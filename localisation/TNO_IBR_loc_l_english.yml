 #Ideas
 Iberian_Economic_Nightmare:0 "Iberian Economic Nightmare"
 Iberian_Economic_Nightmare_desc:0 "Despite being a fairly wealthy nation, Iberia is unable to make use of this economic power, due to its structure making taxation an absolute nightmare. With three jurisdictions constantly fighting each other for funding, and a massive money sink in the form of the Gibraltar Dam and the African colonization projects, the amount of money the government can actually make use of is fairly small. In order to get its economic situation together, the government will have to either force Portugal and Spain to work together to create a functioning Federal tax code, explore alternate routes of funding, or just ignore the problem and hope natural economic growth will compensate for the current shortfall in funding."

 Iberian_Economic_Bubble_2:0 "Iberian Economic Bubble"
Iberian_Economic_Bubble_2_desc:0 "An unprecedented effect of the implementation of the autarkic system is the creation of a massive bubble. Prices for certain goods have inflated severely, and economists are uncertain if this economic bubble will expand further and sustain itself. We must act quickly, for if it were to pop, Iberia will be hit with an economic crisis two times more devastating than its predecessor."

 Iberian_Economic_Miracle:0 "Iberian Economic Miracle" 
 Iberian_Economic_Miracle_desc:0 "For years, the Iberian peninsula has been dealing with an economic crisis that affected its ability to develop and prosper as a nation. Many people laid homeless on the streets while many of the industry held on by bare subsidized threads. However, since the intervention of the Caudillos and the government, who have changed their policy from mere band-aiding to full intervention, alongside advice from several technocratic ministers, the Iberian economy has recovered at a staggering pace. Its GDP has been skyrocketing, alongside the reduction of unemployment numbers to a near minimum.\n\n§GAll in all, life has turned for the better in Iberia.§!"

 Return_to_Autarky:0 "Return to Autarky" 
 Return_to_Autarky_desc:0 "With the economic crisis still raging on, the government has decided to approve of more radical methods to solve it. With "coercion" from the older falangist organizations, policies that relate to the economic system of Autarky have been passed and are planned to be implemented. While the government was informed the measures taken will cause several problems currently, its economic advisors believe that it will be only a matter of time before the Iberian economy will be revitalized. "

 Optimised_Autarky:0 "Optimised Autarky" 
 Optimised_Autarky_desc:0 "With the policies of initial stages of Autarky approved and in operation, the economy has experienced small shifts in its growth. If we want to see the positive effects reveal itself fully, we must keep the momentum and continue to pass more autarkic laws."

 Iberian_Economic_Bubble_1:0 "Iberian Economic Bubble"
 Iberian_Economic_Bubble_1_desc:0 "An unprecedented effect of the implementation of the autarkic system is the creation of a massive bubble. Prices for certain goods have inflated severely, and economists are uncertain if this economic bubble will expand further and sustain itself. We must act quickly, for if it were to pop, Iberia will be hit with an economic crisis two times more devastating than its predecessor."

 Council_Dissolved:0 "Council Dissolved!" 
 Council_Dissolved_desc:0 "By the orders of the influential Caudillos, the Iberian Council is to be dissolved. However, this news comes as a surprise to many, who've seen the council as a way to bridge the gap between the various peoples of Iberia, give equal representation for all parties, and successfully approve or disapprove of laws, all while avoiding the messy legislative and bureaucratic problems of the prior system. Many politicians have voiced their concerns and many are in favor of reestablishing it, but the Caudillos assure that measures are being implemented to smoothly transition. They estimate that in a few week's time, the outrage will have petered out and normality will ensue once more."

 New_Fundamental_Laws:0 "The New Fundamental Laws" 
 New_Fundamental_Laws_desc:0 "With the abolishment of the council, the Caudillos have approved of a new set of Fundamental Laws. These laws will allow the Caudillos to solidify their grasp over the government, and by extension, the entire country. While many are skeptical of this, the Caudillos have once again  guaranteed the people by pledging to quickly bring stability and prosperity back to Iberia.\n\n§ROnce time will tell if they succeed.§!"

 The_Gibraltar_Dam:0 "The Gibraltar Dam"
 The_Gibraltar_Dam_desc:0 "Nearly the hour after the Dam for the 'ambitious' if not completely insane German plan to drain the Mediterranean was finished, the German economy failed. With the Germans leaving the dam as a failed project, the Iberian overseers noted the numerous failings in the walls and locks. Within the next few days the threat to the lives of millions of people on the coasts of the Mediterranean became clear. Now Iberia must pick up the slack where "The Greatest Empire of Europe" has most obviously failed."
 
 IBR_The_Gibraltar_Dam_Abandoned:0 "The Gibraltar Dam - Maintenance Ended"
 IBR_The_Gibraltar_Dam_Abandoned_desc:0 "Due to budgetary limitations, the Iberian Union has officially ceased all operations with the goal of keeping the dam more than essentially stable. The only actions that are to be carried out are low-level maintenance, structural surveys, and essential repairs. Now, with resumption of intensive maintenance operations being impossible due to economic reasons, Iberia can finally rest assured that the budget for fixing the dam will no longer be a constant source of pain for the economy."

 The_Gibraltar_Dam_Completed:0 "The Gibraltar Dam - Completed" 
The_Gibraltar_Dam_Completed_desc:0 "Nearly the hour after the Dam for the 'ambitious' if not completely insane german plan to drain the Mediterranean was finished, the German economy failed. With the Germans leaving the dam as a failed project, the Iberian overseers noted the numerous failings in the walls and Lochs. Within the next few days the threat to the lives of millions of people on the coasts of the Mediterranean became clear. Now Iberia must pick up the slack where "The Greatest Empire of Europe" has most obviously failed."

 Betray_Old_Guard:0 "Betrayal of the Old Guard"
 Betray_Old_Guard_desc:0 "While both Franco and Salazar may seem like a pair of strongmen who steer the nation all by themselves, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Both men lie at the top of an intricate web of alliances, factions, ideologies and interests that decided to elevate them to their current positions. They both previously enjoyed great loyalty from their allies, but the creation of Iberia slowly and steadily ended their universal popularity.\n\nWithout the prospect of a possible restoration, monarchists from both nations promptly abandoned their silent collaboration and many have even left the country. Hardcore nationalists from Spain and Portugal now accuse the Caudillos of treason and rumours abound of coups attempts by hardliner's in the regime that were put down before news of them ever left the offices of the government. Even the Catholic Church and the Armed Forces, the two strongest pillars of the system, have begun quietly complaining. With this situation, the Caudillos now sit almost alone, holding onto anyone that shows the slightest sign of loyalty; but ultimately betrayed by their allies, isolated by their own decisions."

 Disorderly_Federal_Army:0 "Disorderly Federal Army"
 Disorderly_Federal_Army_desc:0 "While both the Spanish Army, Guardia Civil, and Portuguese Army still exist in a limited capacity, the Iberian Army is regarded rightfully as an unholy mess. Clashing doctrines and methods of operation, no standardization, a lack of decisive funding, and very little capacity for the Iberian federal government to actually make a decision absolutely hamstrings the Army. While the Spanish and Portuguese armies, in case of invasion, could be able to put up a decent fight, putting either under federal control is likely to strain the Union to its breaking point."

 Disorderly_Federal_Army_Heydrich:0 "Panicked Army Reforms"
 Disorderly_Federal_Army_Heydrich_desc:0 "While both the Spanish Army, Guardia Civil, and Portuguese Army still exist in a limited capacity, the Iberian Army is regarded rightfully as an unholy mess. Clashing doctrines and methods of operation, no standardization, a lack of decisive funding, and very little capacity for the Iberian federal government to actually make a decision absolutely hamstrings the Army. While the Spanish and Portuguese armies, in case of invasion, could be able to put up a decent fight, putting either under federal control is likely to strain the Union to its breaking point. This situation has been addressed, partially, due to the panic following Heydrich becoming Führer of Germany, but the underlying issues remain."
 
 Separatist_Tensions:0 "Separatist Tensions"
 Separatist_Tensions_desc:0 "Although the harsh measures taken by the Spanish government to crush Basque, Galician, and Catalan nationalism are still in effect, the risk of renewed secession movements still exist. In the event of a crisis befalling the Union, regional separatist tensions could flare up and immediately make the situation much, much worse. Additionally, there is a strong suspicion that many particularly extreme rebel groups are German-funded, opening up a strong risk of them having capabilities that the government does not necessarily know about."

 The_Iberian_Council_1_desc:0 "Founded several years back to assist in governing efforts and help stabilize the shaky situation of Iberia at the time, the Iberian Council has just been given near absolute power over the entire nation.

 Crippled_Sovereignty:0 "Crippled Sovereignty"
 Crippled_Sovereignty_desc:0 "The Union is perfectly equal. In fact, it is mandated to be so. This has caused significant issues in actually achieving anything beyond the bare minimum of keeping civilization running. Any diplomatic action with the Union requires equal Portuguese and Spanish representation, and both countries have equal veto powers. The fact that this enables the Portuguese government to veto road construction in Barcelona was not thought of during the initial meetings..."

 Crippled_Sovereignty_notsomuch:0 "Weakened Sovereignty"
 Crippled_Sovereignty_notsomuch_desc:0 "The Union is an equal project between two nations, and was always mandated to be so. Any diplomatic action within the Union required equal Portuguese and Spanish representation, and both countries had equal veto powers. This had caused major issues in achieving political goals, but recent reforms have alleviated the worst issues of the political system."

 The_Dying_Triumvirate:0 "The Dying Triumvirate"
 The_Dying_Triumvirate_desc:0 "The Iberian Union's anger at the Triumvirate for not doing more to subsidize the maintenance of the Gibraltar Dam has lead to vast tensions between it and other members of the Triumvirate. Additionally, the problem of border clashes with Italy in Algeria has hugely escalated tensions as of late. If a compromise is not found quickly, it is likely that the Triumvirate will fall apart due to Iberian discontent."

 Mediterranean_Tech_Exchange_desc:0 "In order to facilitate faster military development, a technological exchange program has been established. Countries surrounding the Mediterrean sea will be participating, trading equipment such as simple firearms to more advanced mechanized vehicles with one another. With this program, every nation involved can hopefully create new material to equip their armies with."
 
 Dissolving_Iberian_Union:0 "Dissolving Iberia" 
 Dissolving_Iberian_Union_desc:0 "In order to avoid the possibility of a major crisis, the Iberian government has decided that the Iberian nation as many know it will be dissolved permanently. Many have said their grievances and some even protest, but the executive decision has already been approved. That being said, the administration will ensure the dissolution will be seamless and efficient. Once complete, the peninsula shall be divided into two, with Spain on the right, and Portugal on the left.\n\n§WThe Union that held out for two decades is now finally coming to an end.§!"

 Severing_Economic_Ties:0 "Severing Economic Ties" 
 Severing_Economic_Ties_desc:0 "As part of the Iberian dissolution efforts, the economic ties binding Spain and Portugal together will be severed. This is done in order to prevent another economic crisis in the foreseeable future."

 Severing_Military_Ties:0 "Severing Military Ties" 
 Severing_Military_Ties_desc:0 "As part of the Iberian dissolution efforts, the Federal Armed Forces containing both Portguese and Spanish troops will be abolished, and that the old Portuguese and Spanish Armed Forces shall be recreated as fully independent organizations in their respective countries."

 Dissolved_Federal_Government:0 "Dissolved the Federal Government" 
 Dissolved_Federal_Government_desc:0 "The final part of the Iberian dissolution is the abolishment of the federal government itself. The old administration is finally being dissolved, and the many bureaucrats and ministers who've held positions are receiving accommodations to compensate. While the last step has been made, the only thing holding back the official split of Iberia is the lack of recognition of the federal government's closure from both Spain and Portugal."
 
 IBR_State_Exemplary:0 "State Of The Union - Exemplary" 
 IBR_State_Exemplary_desc:0 "The Iberian Union and its people can rejoice, for they are the shining example of national stability in Europe, or perhaps even the whole world. Thanks to the efforts of the government, even the most pessimistic naysayers can agree that the Iberian peninsula stands firmly united.

 IBR_State_Strong:0 "State Of The Union - Extremely Stable" 
 IBR_State_Strong_desc:0 "The Iberian Union remains united and strong in her resolve. The government is well-prepared to handle any threats, be they external or internal. While more work can be done, most generally agree that Iberia is a relatively stable country."

 IBR_State_MedStrong:0 "State Of The Union - Stable" 
 IBR_State_MedStrong_desc:0 "The Iberian Union has seen better days, but the current situation shows signs of normality. The Iberian government maintains the semblance of balance, but many have spoken, saying there is room for improvement."

 IBR_State_Med:0 "State Of The Union - Moderately Stable" 
 IBR_State_Med_desc:0 "The Iberian Union seems to be going along steady... for now. Many have placed concerns that leaving things as is will result in a worsening state, and that the government should increase their efforts to fix it while they still have the chance."

 IBR_State_MedWeak:0 "State Of The Union - Unstable" 
 IBR_State_MedWeak_desc:0 "The Iberian Union is undergoing some internal turmoil. The nation is falling apart at the seams, and many call for immediate action by the government, lest the country suffers more than it is right now." 
 
 IBR_State_Weak:0 "State Of The Union - Critically Unstable" 
 IBR_State_Weak_desc:0 "The Iberian Union heads towards a state of total collapse.

 IBR_returning_campaign:0 ""Return Home" Campaign" 
 IBR_returning_campaign_desc:0 "Many of our fellow Iberian peoples have emigrated abroad to countries that formerly belonged to the association known as the Triumvirate. With the Triumvirate just another page of history, alongside the tense relations we now share with our ex-allies, the government has decided it was their responsibility to guarantee the lives of these foreign citizens.\n\nTo do this, they have initiated a campaign, promising return benefits and compensation, in order to coerce these expats to return to their native homeland.

A tradition of the Iberian administration, this way the government makes sure that the desired effects are seen over the course of the coming year. Usually a rather mundane matter, this year's colonial budget has surprisingly received some criticism, with some within the government arguing that the state should first focus on the troubles faced by Iberians, particularly during this period of Christian celebration between Christmas and Easter. But such critics are a minority within the regime, and this year's colonial budget will go ahead as it always does.\n\nThis year's budget is bigger than usual, with great changes coming to Morocco and the Sub-Saharan colonies and a greater involvement on the development of Algeria by peninsular government."

With its humble beginnings as the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco, which only controlled a sliver of territory in the north and a couple of enclaves in the east, the colony was expanded immensely with the annexation of the French Protectorate at the close of the Second World War. Since then the colony has seen a great number of businesses and settlers flock to it to exploit its riches. As such, we must ensure that Morocco stands strong and keeps creating revenue for the nation."

The convoys and containers that come here just keeps increasing with time and there has already been a number of times where port authorities had to redirect vessels to secondary ports because Ifni was at full capacity.\n\nAs a key element in the Moroccan economy, the government has decided to greatly expand the port to allow more ships in and therefore increase the quantity of trade that flows into the region. The military naval base will also be expanded, although not as much as its civilian partner, for a better defense of the region."

To this day it is the first line of defense against any possible invaders that may strike the colonies first and is also in charge of keeping peace in our territories beyond Gibraltar. As such, it should be well equipped at all times. While it has been lacking in the last few years due to budget mismanagement, the colonial officers will be happy to hear their boys are getting some brand new toys, just as good as those the peninsular troops use."

With the chaos in the French colonies that followed the end of the Second World War, both Italian and Iberian troops rushed in to secure Algeria. Although it was clear that both countries wanted the colony for themselves, the French never officially handed authority over to them, as they believed Algeria was as integral to France as Paris was. However, with the military restrictions imposed on France by the Germans, it was unable to properly claim anything outside of Algiers.\n\nYet despite not allowing the French to defend their colony, the Germans also continued to recognize their claim to it. With France now a loyal German puppet state, neither Rome nor Madrid dared to claim Algeria as theirs. Instead they each began to send settlers into the areas of influences both countries had in the region to begin building a proper claim over the territory.\n\nThe Iberian settlers have been neglected for a long time now due to the government having more important matters to attend to, but with Italy on the move, it is time to properly develop and strengthen our area of control in Algeria."

Most of them travel through the Moroccan portion of the Sahara without much infrastructure or directions and many of them never make it to the end, instead being devoured by the sand and the dunes.\n\nTo counter this a series of roads will be built and signs will be installed to help the settlers find the way to their new homes. The whole operation will be concealed as a simple expansion of the Moroccan road network in the region to not raise French suspicions."

Sadly, these colonies are very undeveloped, with the government's attention focused on possessions closer to home in the deserts of North Africa. However, the latest reports show that Iberia's colonies to the South show quite an economic potential, with the climate in the Guineas perfect for agriculture and the several archipelagos possible sites for trade hubs.\n\nAs such, a considerable amount of money has been reserved for the development of these region with the hopes of them becoming yet another prosperous part of Iberia in the future."

Settlements are scarce, infrastructure is poor and worst of all; bandits are a common occurrence. Natives that didn't accept Iberian rule when the area was pacified in the 50's regularly raid any town or village they find, no matter who inhabits it.\n\nMauritania has valuable minerals underneath it and their extraction would create jobs and wealth for the region, but with the bandits running around, no serious attempt at mining has been tried. If we want to develop the region and obtain its riches, the first step is sending more troops and building more military infrastructure down there to fight those that work against us."

These islands have a very small population and are mostly agrarian, therefore the attention they have received from the central government is almost non-existent. Infrastructure is weak and they depend on the transport convoys that regularly tour them to give them supplies like medicines or machines. These convoys apparently don't visit the islands with enough frequency as there have been several angry letters from the governors there asking for more frequent supply deliveries. To alleviate this, convoy visits will be made twice a month. Not only that, but bigger ports will be built in the islands to better integrate them into the country, with frequent civilian transport ships doing the trip between these archipelagos and the Peninsula."

To further try to convince us to accept, they have pledged to do all the necessary work to clean up the dense jungle there, create the necessary infrastructure to transport the goods and run the plantations; so that the government would only see profit.\n\nWhile it seems this plan is perfect, the people behind it are infamous in the high circles of Iberian society for having frequent contacts with Siegfried Müller, the Reichskommissar of Zentralafrika.

However, just like the rest of the southern part of the empire, the state that Equatorial Guinea is in could be much better.

In the face of German economic collapse, and hence a decline in the Teutons ability to enact Machtpolitik, this call had lost its power and all that remained was unresolved tension between the members of the Triumvirate.\n\nIdeology and imperial ambitions tore at the seams of alliance but it was really the lack of unified purpose that kept Iberia, Turkey and Italy together."

Our fraught recent history has taught us that we simply cannot trust those who claim to have the same interests as us.

Following the unification of the peninsula and the formation of the Triumvirate, a number of Italian military missions were sent to Iberia in order to help in modernising the fledgling Iberian army and organizing better communication channels for future allied operations.\n\nHowever, now that the anti-German alliance has been broken and relations are at a low point there seems to be no more reason to keep the missions in the country. We should move to expel the foreign military personnel lest they begin to parse back sensitive information to the Italian state.

Following the collapse of the alliance many have returned back to their nations of origins as tensions rose. Some, however, have not taken this step, choosing instead to remain on the peninsula. As much as we have appreciated their contributions to our society, we cannot take their presence lightly anymore. There can only be two reasons for their continued living in Iberia: naturalization or spying. Due to it being difficult to distinguish between the reasons on the surface we must put all of these immigrants under watch to test their loyalty. There cannot be any possibility that they can do damage to Iberian state."

Having sensitive data fall into the hands of our new enemies could be just as dangerous now as if the Germans gained access to it.

Now however we stand at odds with our former ally. This has threatened the security of our investments as colonial governors or even the Italian government itself could move to nationalise our precious capital.

In order to protect them from outside influence and internal instability, a number of unified military missions were sent across the empires.\n\nIn these days we can no longer justify the stationing of our troops in Italian and Turkish territory.

We have no information on how the other former alliance members will treat those who in their eyes could be potential spies. Equally terrible would be their use against us whether in economic terms or to spread seditious lies.

Turkey has threatened to use direct military force to seize the lands it claims to be rightfully part of its nation. Italy has vowed to resist the aggressive invaders, invoking comparisons to German diplomatic tact.\n\nOur choice on whether we should get involved has been decided. We need to support the Turkish invasion in order to greatly weaken the Italian empire. This could mean that in the near future we may be able to assert our own claims on disputed land.

Were we to intervene on the Turkish side or to withhold entirely we may be able to benefit off of Italy's weakness to fulfil our own territorial claims. However, with the vitriolic rhetoric and aggression that the Turkish state has shown we cannot with good conscience support them either through benign neglect or intervention. Hence instead we should seek to indirectly support the cause of the Italians who still hold the internationally recognized legitimate mandate over the territory.

Many visits to the continent that we brought great classical civilization to will have to be planned. The Latin American countries of Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and maybe even Cuba hold great potential for this plan.

Despite their membership of the hated Unity Pakt we can play on the cultural and religious ties which Germany in its megalomania and cowardice in the face of Burgundy is quashing.

Romania fared little better. Yet the animosity created by territorial disputes and a bitter rivalry leaves the two nations weak and too divided to stand against possible future German encroachment.

The country has seen tremendous economic growth with the discovery of large oil deposits which have made it a target of many diplomatic missions.

With time the focus of global economic activity has shifted, but this has not reduced the great importance of the trade routes which the Indian subcontinent has perfect access to. It has hence been decided that we should seek to meet representatives from both the National Indian government and the competing Azad Hind.

In this way we will prove the worth of our nation without relying on others, a greater boon to our prestige. "

 IBR_Foreign_Mistrust:0 "Foreign Mistrust"
 IBR_Foreign_Mistrust_desc:0 "It was to be expected. Turkey had only recently consolidated itself into a formal nation-state following opportunistic diplomatic actions, why should they have dropped such a practice so soon? The Italians on the other hand significantly betrayed their German allies twice in a single century. Reckless irredentism and overblown ambition had determined their mode of action in the international sphere for the duration of its rather short history.\n\nWe Iberians, on the other hand, have long traditions of statehood and acceptable diplomatic actions. It was not our fault that the fools abandoned the mutually beneficial anti-German alliance. The lesson learnt, however, was almost equally beneficial. The clarity by which we cannot afford to blindly trust other nations anymore is blinding. Instead we shall pursue a diplomatic policy of healthy skepticism. Foreign influences will have to prove that they are well intentioned."

 IBR_Bare_Minimum_Interaction:0 "Minimum Interaction"
 IBR_Bare_Minimum_Interaction_desc:0 "It is clear that we cannot simply trust foreign actors anymore. In trusting the Italians and Turks we have already compromised a considerable amount of national security in terms of military, intelligence and economic secrets to our new Mediterranean rivals. However, it is equally true that being entirely isolated from the international sphere can have very dire consequences. The need to maintain trade ties and finding new ones is paramount for not damaging our economy. Equally important is the acquisition of intel on international politicking and alliance building. We absolutely cannot find ourselves alone and unprepared if the Germans resurge or other powers decide to intervene in Iberian affairs. The building of some relations to a select number of foreign actors is hence required. We will leave the option to terminate them open, in case anything should happen."

With previous information sharing and combined training exercises now being gone, our intelligence sector is lacking some vital infrastructure and direction to be truly effective. We therefore must push for more allocated funds and a general expansion with more recruits and equipment. In particular we have to ensure that our counterintelligence is functioning as intended in these times of great uncertainty.

 IBR_Trade_Necessity_desc:0 "The downgrading and outright shutting down of many diplomatic ties, in the wake of our understanding that the actors in the foreign sphere simply could not be trusted, has been criticised by some as an act of domestic economic sabotage. The internal markets of Iberia require foreign goods and capital to function normally, so the nation is not dragged down an economic abyss.\n\nThe Caudillos have for this reason decided it would be necessary to carry on trading for vital resources with their most trusted providers. This will be done once they have undergone sufficient scrutiny to ensure that not a single trading contract compromises our national security."

In addition to rallying the population to our side will be able to show off our strength to our neighbours."

Not only has it caused a tough situation in our foreign policy, but it also has given a considerable boost to the various separatist and nationalist movements which continue to plague our great union. We must underline that we are a unified nation of Iberians. No longer are we simply citizens of Portugal or Spain, with separate identities and heritage. A common purpose and a new Iberian identity unify us. It gives us strength. We therefore should not hesitate to further embrace this ideal of unity, especially in these harsh times.

We have endured hardships and pain together, faced off with the existential threat of German dominance and weathered the underhanded conniving of our former sly Triumvirate allies. Standing alone in the Mediterranean should not be seen as a curse but rather as a great opportunity to further forge the history of our nation.

Faith is still proving to be more effective for drawing the population together than any government directive.

Whether it be brutal civil conflict, endless colonial rebellion or adapting to the powerpolitiking of the great powers, the Caudillos have always stood strong in the face of it all. Both men have hence developed a good image in the eyes of the majority of the Iberian people. This image has been used to create an effective cult of personality that critics say mirrors the reprehensible ways in which the Germans idolised their Führer. What that slander does not mention is that Iberia's Caudillos do not have to rely on distorting propaganda, as they have entirely proven their worth as leaders. If we were to expand on the symbolism of the Caudillos and allow it to further seep into popular culture we may be able to better influence our population and promote unity in the face of adversity."

In the same vein as the Germans had laid their eyes on former Portuguese holdings in Mozambique and Angola, we have gained information that our remaining colonies are being targeted. We must not allow them to follow the same fate as the Portuguese holdings did. A plan to fortify various strategically important regions has for this reason been proposed."

Galician terrorists nearly killed our beloved Caudillos, a tragedy that would have surely torn apart the union. This disaster has shocked the Caudillos into action, and made them realise that a more stable, long term system of government must be established.\n\nAs such, an Iberian Council has been devised, serving as a tool to deal with regional conflicts and help the various states reach agreements, instead of getting bogged down in the endless bureaucratic quagmire that was the former system.

It also lists what they are obliged to do, as Iberians. Collectively, these provisions are known as the Rights and Obligations of the Iberian Citizen.\n\nAs any state worth existing must care for its people, we must do the same.

The first level of the pyramid is of basic physical needs, namely food, water, and shelter.\n\nIt is important to keep the people of Iberia happy, for a satisfied worker is a productive worker. If we were to follow this pyramid, then the best way to make our citizens happy is to make sure this basic level is satisfied.

No other program has ever had such a spotless record, full of bureaucrats who seem to truly care for their special blend of paperwork.\n\nEven though it processes everything such a program could desire - healthcare and pensions, among many more - it is flawed. The Seguridad Social program has fallen behind in recent years, due to its relative non-importance towards other factors. Some of the legislation dates back to the 1940's, with only minor corrections performed. We must update it for the 60's, so that it may fit the needs of a modern-day society. "

 IBR_Colonial_Citizenship_Question_desc:0 "While it may seem that Iberian citizenship is a very simple thing, it is not. However, the definition of a citizen is very simple. If a parent is an Iberian citizen, then the child will be an Iberian citizen. The location does not matter, nor the parent - only that one is really a citizen. A new question has come up recently as to a potential addendum to this rule:\n\nNatives from our African holdings do not count as citizens. Therefore, they have limited rights and are not eligible for many privileges that a regular citizen would have. A political movement around this has grown, as a few politicians argue that the natives should be granted citizenship.

While it is difficult to introduce these values at a mass scale, an important step towards such an outcome would be to emphasize them in the constitution.\n\nFirst and foremost, parties with significant disputes should not turn to violence. We must pound this into their heads, at every turn, to prevent another Battle of Barcelona. We need to encourage these groups to work with the state, rather than fight it.

For Iberia's stability, we cannot allow anything of the sort to come to exist. The best way to discourage the idea is to enshrine the opposite in the constitution.\n\nWe must explicitly denounce class struggle for what it is - pointless division and conflict.

Once it had been dispersed properly, we took a survey to gauge public opinion.\n\nWith the results all in, we have mostly gotten exactly what we desired. True, there are no people in the streets screaming our names in almost religious praise, but that is acceptable. The survey shows that the people of Iberia are pleased with our changes.

Who would want a country to run like this?\n\nWe need to give our administration a good, hard, look. We need to cut the slack, fix the problems, and straighten out a deeply crooked government. Right now, it's no wonder there was a Battle of Barcelona! We are lucky, in fact, that something like this had not happened sooner.

It seemed like an oxymoron, a riddle you would use to puzzle someone - how do you have two people with total power, heading the same state? It took much effort, but something was eventually devised.\n\nIt has been a long time since then. The times have changed, and with it the world, and the diarchy will likely need some changes as well. Neither Caudillo would lose their power, that could never happen on their watch, but the system requires at least a cursory review. We must make sure it is up to the times."

 IBR_Justice_Issue:0 "The Judicial Issue"
 IBR_Justice_Issue_desc:0 "If you were to look at the Iberian government, nothing better represents its horrid state than the "system" of courts around the country. The compromises made to form Iberia put the judicial system into the state it is - Portuguese cannot be tried in Spanish courts, and the reverse is true as well. Regional courts can overrule one another, leading to entire cases and trials disrupted because of some petty grievance between judges. Even worse, the federal courts have been rendered toothless, meaning that they cannot stop or even rein in the madness.\n\nWhat kind of system is this? It was created by the Caudillos, sure, but there is no way this is what they intended. Justice and the rule of law are the most important things for a functioning state, and we have neither. The Caudillos must try once more to create a solid judicial court, and this time leave nothing to chance."

 IBR_Regime_Families:0 "The Regime Families"
 IBR_Regime_Families_desc:0 "Even though any perfect government has no factions or cliques, every regular government has plenty. We are definitely no exception. Internal factions have been a constant presence ever since both regimes were established, and they have remained through the founding of the Union. We have deemed the groups the "families" of the state, and there are many - the party itself, the army, church, and so on.\n\nEvery group has their own power and influence, and while they are all ultimately subservient to the Caudillos they can still cause incidents in the government. Even though they are non-official, it would do some good to interfere with them, ever-so-slightly. If we balanced their power, and broke up a few of the less useful cliques, it is a definite possibility that more could be squeezed out of exploiting them."

 IBR_Administration_Pyramid:0 "The Administration Pyramid"
 IBR_Administration_Pyramid_desc:0 "The system of governance devised by the Caudillos is very peculiar. Unique might be a better word. Each province of the country is represented equally, and they are part of two constituent countries - Portugal and Spain. They are both represented equally in the Union itself, which has the final say in many regards.\n\nHowever, there are issues with the system. A lack of adequately clear provisions, as well as some uncertain edge cases, have turned the administrative system into a hydra that is more inclined to smack its heads together; a distinct lack of the harmony required to run a Union like ours. Were we to clearly define what each level can and cannot do in relation to itself and the others, we could have the country run much better."

 IBR_Burocratic_Audit_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is, and always will be, a precarious balancing act. If you have too little, the state will be paralyzed and cease to function. Should you have too much, you will have a bloated monster who is only capable of profiting off its own suffering. Eventually, both will collapse in on themselves. For everyone's sakes, we cannot be either.\n\nWe are, however, the latter. When the Union was first created - the root of all evil, it seems - the compromises made led to what we have now, a bloated monstrosity that chokes the life out of everything it touches. As part of our recent governmental reforms, it would do no harm to give the bureaucracy its long-overdue audit. There are many superfluous parts, certainly, we simply have to find what needs rooted out."

 IBR_Contemporary_State:0 "The Contemporary State"
 IBR_Contemporary_State_desc:0 "Finally, after an eternity of precise revision, the new draft of the governmental side of the constitution is complete. As one compares the new with the old, the differences become much more drastic than they were during the drafting. An old, antiquated system made during a totally different era has been torn down. The amalgamation has been slain. In its place, a true government rises.\n\nThe compromises that created the old state are no longer. We have in essence untied a great knot, reforging the system into one Iberia, rather than two countries prepared to die on one another's arms. The Union shall face the 60's proudly, a modern state."

 IBR_Approved_Exclamation:0 "Approved!"
 IBR_Approved_Exclamation_desc:0 "It is done.\n\nThe government itself has taken to the new constitution with open arms. Even though the brow beating of the Caudillos hasn't hurt, it seems they were just as relieved to have a reformed and functional state as the Caudillos themselves. With their approval, there was only one obstacle towards ratification: the final approval stamp. It wasn't an obstacle, really, since both Franco and Salazar were simply waiting for the opportunity. With everything in order, there is only time between Iberia and its modern future.\n\nThere will never be another Battle of Barcelona, not while the Union stands with her new constitution."

Caring Iberian mothers had to cover their children's eyes when the television showed a Leonardo Vulture pecking the eye of a dead CNT member underneath the marble façade of the Sagrada Família Cathedral, and the footage of a Guardia Civil Colonel executing a handcuffed militiaman became the centerpiece of heated arguments at Sunday family lunches throughout the whole Union. Our citizens are starting to question if the State is really capable of protecting them.\n\nCaudillo Franco has made a reassuring speech explaining that the Barcelona Uprising was a complete failure and the Reds lost both the military and the political battle, but behind closed doors everyone in the regime knows that this Barcelona was only the beginning of the violence.

He will be remembered as a brave man, who staved off the communist threat and who helped guide Iberia down some troubling times. He may never be forgotten.\n\nBut enough with all that, we've got to make sure Salazar's death doesn't cause any undue instability. If his passing means needless hassle for us here in the living, his memory might get slightly sullied.

He appears to truly believe in Iberia and wishes for nothing more than its longevity and success. We will likely know what to expect of him in this respect and may be able to outflank him if need be.

Some in Iberian political society have turned their noses up at the idea, seeing it as stinking of Caetano's alleged reformist mindset, but many more see it as a welcoming take on the role of Caudillo.

Kicking out Salazar's cronies, and the various other stooges and lackeys that made up the crux of the office, and going on a grand tour of Iberia has certainly put Caetano in our good books. The Union looks to be strong, sturdy and stable with Franco and Caetano ruling over the nation as dual Caudillos.

 IBR_containing_protesters_desc:0 "The protestors are soon becoming a menace. They're spiralling out of control and will soon besiege the nation with their violent rhetoric. It's become apparent that containment is the message of the day and this will need to be implemented sharpish or we will face unforeseeable, but likely terrifying, consequences. Something must be done, that we can all agree on. The question though remains, how uncompromising shall our response be?\n\nOne side recommends we take a firm hand but not one that overdoes it. Control will be hopefully established, but our forces will not be allowed to run rampant in order to put down the insurrection by any means. In response, another side recommends going the whole 9 yards with our reaction and let the protestors know we mean business. No chances can be taken with this situation, we cannot afford to look weak in the face of a challenge such as this. Control of the situation must be established as soon as possible by any means before the protests gain enough momentum to become near unstoppable. It's a tough decision, and one that will definitely have consequences not just for Portugal but for all of Iberia."

 IBR_convincing_politicians:0 "Convincing the Politicians"
 IBR_convincing_politicians_desc:0 "If we are to truly grasp the situation and take control of what is occurring over in Portugal, then we will have to deal with the local politicians, and even some of their supporters in national politics, who are currently adding fuel to the growing fire that threatens to swarm us all. They are partly responsible for the current crisis and thus, it is only right for us to hold them accountable. We will need to decide though, just how much we're going to hold them accountable for and how harsh we will be with our justice.\n\nOne option would be to send a message with our righteous justice that these actions will not be tolerated. It will certainly put off any other would be two-bit politician who thinks they can stand up to the Iberian Union's central government. Others though have expressed doubts as to whether this option will not have lasting ramifications that could create a deep-rooted atmosphere of future distrust and bitterness over our handling of these events. Instead, the situation could be resolved with a more forgiving hand in order to settle the situation. It may just calm the situation, but it could also be interpreted as a sign of clear weakness that the fifth column and other opportunists may pounce upon. Whatever decision is made, it will have to be done quickly in order to settle this ever-growing crisis."

We have certainly done our very best to quash this crisis and stop it from escalating out of control. What may be more troubling now though, is what the aftermath of all this shall be. The atmosphere, the very memory of what occurred here may have a lasting legacy we cannot hope to escape from. As people ponder what happened here and what could possibly occur again, it is our job to steer the nation through these tormenting times. If not, we will have to face something even bigger and much worse than the previous incident."

 IBR_the_state_of_the_union_desc:0 "The fall of the Triumvirate has put things into perspective. It may be that this Union, a once necessary act to stop the marching Huns, needs a large-scale reformation to save itself from being thrown into the dustbin of history. We are to call out far and wide, across the nation and across the spectrum to decide what the future will hold for Iberia. Whether we are to increasingly reform ourselves or just keep the status quo remains to be seen. What is needed however, is the discussion to decide how to best proceed and avoid certain doom."

 IBR_call_forth_the_grievances_desc:0 "The call went out far and wide, some didn't even believe it to be genuine at first. And yet it was such. The towering leadership of the Iberian Union has sent out a message across the political spectrum seeking dialogue on how to best address the issues facing the nation. It may be that some of them have something useful to say and can bring something new to the table that will see to our survival rather than our destruction. Others though may be a lost cause, to whom we will pay no real notice to. Whatever our decision may be, we shall hear them out and decide what is best for the future of Iberia."
 
 IBR_the_separatists:0 "The Separatists"
 IBR_the_separatists_desc:0 "The history of Iberia has been a history filled with instances and notions of separatism. Basque, Catalans, Galicians and others have demanded autonomy and nationhood for years and years. These requests were usually stamped out through the tried and tested means of reactionary force but now perhaps is the time to seek dialogue. A lot of blood has been spilt in the name of the separatist question and with questions beginning to arise about the future of Iberia, it may be time to talk to the separatist organizations."
 
 IBR_the_conservatives:0 "The Conservatives"
 IBR_the_conservatives_desc:0 "The old guard from the regimes of Salazar and Franco have quite loudly raised their concerns of the potential democratic turn Iberia may be taking. Falangists, hardline militarists and chief ideologues from the old days are becoming increasingly concerned about Iberia's new direction, seeing it as treacherous and antagonistic to the ideas that they worked so hard to implement. It is time to hear them out in order to avoid a major and dramatic rift in our Union that could have deadly consequences."

 IBR_the_people_desc:0 "A key question has emerged while we have gone on with these reforms. Are we to open this process up to the people? Or are we to carry this endeavor out behind closed doors? Liberal elements have recommended that the debates be broadcast to the public in order to truly open up the process to the masses. The decision to take in public input would be drastic and will no doubt showcase a commitment for democratic reform. On the other hand, do we want the public potentially meddling in matters they know little about? If we are to allow them a voice, we could give them a clear platform to voice their opinions. Or we could just simply pay them lip service then pay no heed to their ideas."

 IBR_the_technocrats_desc:0 "An unusual ally has emerged during our current undertaking of talks and reforms. The Franco appointed technocrats have pointed out their interest in the reformation process and wish to help us through guidance and advice. Certain figures that wish to partake in a larger undertaking of the process are from the Opus Dei, an institution of the Catholic Church with an interest in liberal economics. No doubt old guard adherents of autarky will be suspicious of their involvement in the process. Whether these technocratic individuals can be trusted or not remains to be seen."
 
 IBR_the_military:0 "The Military"
 IBR_the_military_desc:0 "One of the most important aspects of Iberian political society is of course the military. With important connections to the regime via Generalissimo Franco and their direct role in the civil war, the military make up a critical part of the ruling regime. With this in mind, influential members of the military have wished to have a prominent role in the current process. Of course, it is likely that they wish to shape the discourse to make sure the military's power remains absolute yet they also make up an integral part of our movement. Their ambivalence of civilian government is well known but attention must be given to these men. They are very much a powerful force whose needs will need to be placated or there could be untold consequences."

Technocrats, conservatives, separatists, militarists and liberals are all miraculously under one roof. It will doubtlessly be a hard fought endeavor to keep the peace between these opposing sides but the opportunity is here to truly transform Iberia. The result of which could set Iberia on a path of renewal and reward in these dark times. Many are hesitant and many more are extremely nervous at the potential power shifts that these debates may cause. Indeed, no-one truly knows what the ramifications may be of this whole endeavor. However, it is certain that the future of Iberia will be shaped by what occurs in the coming weeks. The consequences of this great debate will be felt for many generations to come. The debate is set to begin and with it, Iberia's political landscape will be decisively decided upon."

Some are clearly here to seek radical change, be it for civil society or the autonomy of certain regions. Others are evidently here though to make sure these seismic shifts do not occur, by any means disposable to them. It should be our duty for this to be a true and fair process so, we are to ensure that these bad faith actors do not stop the will of the Iberian people for reform. Whatever their opinions may be, the long-standing issues that have plagued Iberia politically will hopefully be conclusively settled here. Now, the Congress is to begin. The results of which will decide whether Iberia is to rejuvenate or decay. By our very will, we shall make sure that Iberia is set to rejuvenate with a fair and free Congress."

As a newly and dictatorially empowered man, it is clear that if he was given any sort of leading role in the Congress then he would act in a manner of bad faith and sabotage. We will ensure this does not happen. We made a promise to the Iberian people that change was coming and that's what we shall do. To make sure Caetano doesn't cause trouble he will have to be convinced of the purpose of these undertakings and if need be, be pressured on so that he does not threaten the Congressional process.

They are clearly reactionary to the core and will block any attempts at change. Quite frankly, they are an obvious and large block to any large-scale reformation that would save Iberia from eventual doom. These people are dinosaurs, hangers on from a time that is no longer relevant to the current situation Iberia faces. The worst of whom are the old Spanish Falangists, so resistant to change they'd probably wish for Iberia to burn before it sees any real fair change. It is time to dismiss these people from political life and thus assure the people that a real effort at reforming Iberia is taking place."

Forces of anarchy, wreckers of law and order, are ready to use this Congress to pray on our alleged weakness and pounce upon us. We will not give them the opportunity. They want to make Iberia unrecognizable, a shell of its former self by giving in to the worst elements of our society. The council shall be no more, only we ourselves shall guide Iberia through these testing times. There is no longer a Congress, made up of treacherous separatists and other agents of chaos. In its stead shall be the Iberian Union, indivisible and immortal."

The transition to a fully free and democratic state will be an arduous one but it will be one that we will be prepared for. All the actors involved will work in a position of good faith to truly transform Iberian society into one that is fair and democratic."
 
 IBR_limited_sacrifices:0 "Limited Sacrifices"
 IBR_limited_sacrifices_desc:0 "If Iberia is to be saved, then the transitional process must occur with as limited kickback as possible from certain sections of Iberian political life. Compromises are needed in these testing times and we all can't get what we want. Certain hopes for regional autonomy and full-blown freedom will have to be dashed, at least for now. A splintering now would be costly and something we would likely be unable to come back from. We cannot risk falling apart now at this key stage of the process. To do so would put everything we have worked so hard for in jeopardy. Sacrifices have to be made, for the good of Iberia and its people."

 IBR_the_Council_Unchained_desc:0 "It's time to truly showcase our commitment to the process directed by the Iberian Council, through loosening certain restrictions that were previously put on the Council. They will now have a freer rein to guide the extraordinary transition that is taking place in Iberia. This will also show the faith the Iberian leadership has in the Council and the good work it is doing. A mandate will be established by this decision, one of trust in the transitional process that is taking place. The Council now has our full confidence to do what is needed to achieve this transition."

Amongst the most serious of these antagonists would be the old guard of the military. The head honchos of the Iberian military are likely to put a spanner in the works if we are to go all the way with this process. In order to stop this, we shall shake up the military staff and rotate the generals to sap their power and influence. This should stop the old guard from acting up and allow us to continue with the process without a major hiccup."

We shall speak to them to address and put down any concerns they have about the process and thus help guarantee a much smoother democratic transition."

History may not absolve those who once ruled over Iberia with a firm and authoritative hand but from now on things can change. The age of authoritarianism in Iberia is to come to an end. Rules, laws and accountability will put an end to full blown despotism in our nation. It is no longer acceptable nor wanted to lead with a selfish and cruel heavy hand. Something far more open and democratic will now hopefully take its place."
 
 IBR_a_true_new_state:0 "A True New State"
 IBR_a_true_new_state_desc:0 "Once it seemed like Iberia would be stuck in its own political mess forever. The competing antagonistic power game and bureaucratic inefficiency, all tied together by the tight grasp of authoritarianism, once meant that it seemed Iberia would be sent to the ash heap of history. Remarkably, this seems to be no longer the case. With the thankful success of the democratic process, a new state can now arise out of the old Iberia. A new, democratic Iberia will take its place, saving us from the trials and tribulations of what could have been a failed state. We are now ready to become a truly democratic state, averting what could have been a significant disaster."

 IBR_no_need_for_haste_desc:0 "The one thing we must not do now is panic. To allow for a radical and sudden change at this moment could put the whole of Iberia at risk of destruction, chaos and instability. Who knows what could occur if we were to give a free reign to absolutely everyone all of a sudden? No, the best way through this crisis is a slow and steady pace while we place a watchful eye over the Congress. After all the future of all of Iberia is at stake is it not?"

If the future of Iberia is at risk due to the incompetence or intentions of the Council then it is only just that the Caudillos are able to save Iberia from this scenario. Some may call this authoritarian, that the Caudillos are merely securing their position but what do these detractors know?

Well fear not, for they shall do some "important" work elsewhere from the main currents of the Iberian political scene. Be it at the colonies or some far flung embassy abroad, these nuisances will be thankfully away from the new Iberian government. It will surely be for the better that this occurs and all of Iberia will eventually thank us."
 
 IBR_balance_council:0 "Balance The Council"
 IBR_balance_council_desc:0 "With regards to the Council, to go too far in one direction or the other would put the security of Iberia at risk. Sudden drastic changes could take place without so much as a murmur with little jurisdiction. This would allow the Council to run rife and potentially destabilize an Iberia we have worked so hard for. In order to avoid this likely catastrophic sequence of events, the council shall be equally balanced between those belonging to the reformist and conservative factions. This should stop any surprises arising from the Council."
 
 IBR_swear_loyalty:0 "Swearing Loyalty"
 IBR_swear_loyalty_desc:0 "There will, of course, be disagreements in the Council. To get around any problems arising from this, it is imperative that the Council members are to swear loyalty to the Caudillos. The Caudillos have Iberia's best intentions at heart and this fealty will represent that the Council is of the same mind. Councilmen will not become beacons for their own selfish grandeurs of power. Loyalty to the Caudillos and Iberia comes first, no matter what."
 
 IBR_slow_burn_lib:0 "Slow Burn Liberalization"
 IBR_slow_burn_lib_desc:0 "It's been stated time and time before that to rush into nonstop, full throttle reform would endanger the very concept of Iberia. Were we to implement full scale reform at a breakneck pace, who knows what kind of leap's people would take? Separatism could become rife; communism could return as a political force and God knows what else may occur. To stop any of these Iberian tragedies, liberalization will be put on the back burner. It will occur but only at a rate that guarantees the future stability of Iberia."

 IBR_alter_succession_desc:0 "Iberia does need some future change, that much is certain or what has been the point in our attempts to guarantee Iberia long-lasting existence. In order to avoid a succession crisis that may threaten to tear our country apart, we will have to change the way we get a new Caudillo. Instead of the Caudillos merely hand picking their successor, the Council shall elect a future Caudillo in order to maintain the stability of the country in an act of conciliation and agreement among the councilmen. This shall hopefully mean we can avoid a future disastrous leadership crisis."

Some may cravenly mutter in darkened corners that our reforms were not enough, that they were merely acts of self-preservation, but what do they know?! They can't even begin to comprehend what was at stake here. If this process was not done in this way then murder, war and chaos could have swarmed our blessed Iberia. We have done what we must. We have saved Iberia from itself. In doing so, we have protected the lives of all of Iberia's citizens who couldn't possibly imagine how close they could have been to certain death."

To really get anywhere with them we'll need to really convince them that this is the time where it's different; where it's going to change. In order to do that, we'll need to put a bit more on the line than usual.\n\nThe best way to mislead the councilmen into thinking we're going to do something good for them is in the most part posturing.

It wouldn't do to have someone who didn't have Iberia first, after all.\n\nSimultaneously, the rest will be forced to remain in the chamber for far longer than necessary. It's not out of cruelty, but out of preemptiveness. Most do not take the job seriously, which does not lead to someone who will do a good job.

The new place of the Council seems to have soothed the worry of many, and with the promise of a bit of tolerance, many others have found newfound loyalty to the Union. We have saved Iberia from those that want to tear it apart, and all it took was modifying the role of the Council."

Having seen the work of the Council towards the survival of our Union, I am now confident in the value of reform. The system of government, as it stands, cannot last much longer. Despite how it pains me to say these words, I realized that stepping down is the only way forward. I have too many memories, and too much hope in the people of Iberia to let you down.

It's been years since then, and they still refuse to discuss the Dam with those who actually have to deal with it. In any other position, we would have been playing with fire in any attempts to discuss the future of their abandoned project with them, but as we are now, perhaps the chance of us getting burned at the discussion table will be lower, as our diplomatic relations matter to them to some extent.

However, with our alliance with Italy long gone and our relations with other Mediterranean nations in a precarious position, it may be a good idea to restart our trading with Germany.

Now that democracy has been restored, the old guard are up in arms too, attempting to strangle freedom in its crib and restore the autocracy. At least the other major parties and their supporters have accepted the election results peacefully. Our first priorities must be to deploy the police (in a responsible manner), make clear our aims to the restless working class and make sure that the military doesn't get any funny ideas."

 IBR_the_matter_of_autonomous_communities_desc:0 "The Autonomous Communities - the administrative divisions of Iberia - haven't had anything resembling autonomy since the civil war. Franco and Salazar's obsession with centralisation led to any degree of self-governance they once enjoyed being stripped away in the name of "streamlining" the administration. The result, rather than a more efficient government, was a bloated and overworked bureaucracy that served as a breeding ground for corruption. Reversing the centralisation of our state is not only the right thing to do morally; it is also much more practical and will ease the burden on our administration."

Though they have always possessed a fair degree of plausible deniability, their names and involvement is an open secret these days. Given the current unrest, they clearly remain unconvinced by our campaign promises.

Though we cannot say for certain that there will never be division within Iberia again, we can take steps to soothe wounds both old and new. Not only will the statutes of autonomy be re-established, we will also enshrine them in the constitution. Henceforth, regional autonomy will no longer be a matter up for debate."

The end of autarky has many of them worried about foreign competition, and some peasant communities have already downed tools in protest of our promises to make the agricultural sector more competitive. Unlike our compatriots in the PRD, however, we will be careful not to let the free market get out of hand.

However, they are clearly professionals at heart, and rather less politicised than we initially feared. We think that's the case, anyway - they haven't arrested us for winning the election yet, at any rate.

Many pointed out that regional unrest, most prominently in Catalonia, was a leading cause of the coup that triggered the civil war. We must admit that they were not entirely without fault - the party was, indeed, divided over what fulfilling our promises meant. Now, however, we believe we have found the answer that was demanded: a new vision of autonomy, where the constituent nations of Iberia act as faithful confederates with the assurance that their ancient rights will not be trampled upon by government overreach and paranoia."

Iberia has a long history of political violence. Prior to and during the civil war, leftists, fascists and the military killed one another with impunity, whittling away at the foundations of the Second Republic with every death. Nobody who votes should have to worry about going back to the polls a month later because a bloodthirsty ideologue mowed down their representative in a hail of gunfire. The Caudillos made the houses of government well-suited as fortresses - let's double down, and extend the role of the Guardia Civil to protecting the physical manifestation of government."

 IBR_extend_the_vote:0 "Extend The Vote"
 IBR_extend_the_vote_desc:0 "The surest way of making election fraud more difficult, short of arresting the perpetrators, is to drown out fraudulent votes. The first election had a good turnout, but the franchise was not as broad as it should have been. The voting age of 21 is far too high, and the fact that women had to qualify at all when most other major democracies have had universal suffrage for half a century is absurd. Additionally, there are many citizens convicted of petty offences who have been forbidden to vote for life. With our majority in Congress, drafting and signing into law the legislation required to address these injustices should be no problem at all."

The Iberian people might have chosen poorly, but they knew better - as we believed they did. They made clear that they did not wish for petty division and civil strife, but rather longed for peace and justice. For years, the Caudillos insisted that democracy could not work in Iberia for so long as the threat of radicalism persisted, but the people proved them wrong. The radicalism that was so feared amounted to little more than a few misguided souls screaming into the wind of change. The Iberians were tested, and were not found wanting.

This symbol of Francoist tyranny must be shut down immediately. Every single staff member will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with accordingly should they turn out to have been complicit in any criminal offence themselves, including mistreatment of prisoners. The inmates of the prison will be distributed among several smaller, more modern and humane prisons until reviews of their trials and supposed crimes are completed.

Why are so many of the wealthy bourgeoisie of our nation commissioned officers rather than bankers, businessmen, entrepreneurs and lawyers? Why is the private still paid a pittance while every second lieutenant has a house, a mistress and an Italian sports car?

Businesses, homes and churches alike have become places of hope and happiness. Even the halls of government peal with laughter at times, as a sense of optimism unrivalled in our nation's history sets in. Above all else, there is the sense that no matter what comes, Iberia and its people will find a way to endure. No fascist, terrorist or mad dictator will halt our ascent to heights yet undreamt of! For a free Iberia, and a better tomorrow!"

 IBR_UR_oil_crisis_desc:0 "Mierda! Instability in the Middle East has caused an economic crisis that the papers have already dubbed "The Oil Crisis". Our dependence on Middle Eastern Oil has meant that we have been hit particularly hard by the crisis and our economists are predicting an imminent economic recession. This means that it is up to our government to weather the storm and guide the Iberian ship through this mess."

 IBR_New_Economic_Program:0 "Iberian New Economic Program" 
 IBR_nep_iberia_tt:0 "We will approve a new economic plan to get Iberia out of this crisis"
 IBR_New_Economic_Program_desc:0 "Fernández-Miranda has decided that it is imperative that the government should implement what they dub the "New Economic Program" made especially to deal with the crisis. The reforms within the Program are focused on protecting the wellbeing of the people most heavily affected by the crisis through increased government spending, fairer taxation, and by tackling rising inflation.\n\nIf done right, Fernández-Miranda's "New Economic Program could lead to Iberians being even better off than before. However, free market proponents have established vocal opposition to the program, decrying it as an intrusion on the market's ability to correct itself and as being too expensive."

 IBR_Secure_Minimum_Wage:0 "Secure the Minimum Wage" 
 IBR_secure_minimum_wage_tt:0 "The minimum wage will be secured, to keep a minimum of conditions for the workers"
 IBR_Secure_Minimum_Wage_desc:0 "The first step as part of the New Economic Program, is to establish a minimum wage for all workers. The condition of workers have seen a dramatic fall since the Oil Crisis hit Iberia and after reports of pay cuts after pay cuts, the government has seen it fit to make sure that all working Iberians have the ability to provide not only for themselves, but for their families as well. \n\nBusiness leaders have claimed that it'll make their costs too high to do business but this is a recession and we all have to make sacrifices."

 IBR_Limit_Oil_Consumption:0 "Limit Oil Consumption" 
 IBR_limit_oil_consumption_tt:0 "A propaganda campaign will be released to motivate people to save oil through various means"
 IBR_Limit_Oil_Consumption_desc:0 "With wages secured, it is time to move on to the next stage of the program. A propaganda campaign will be launched to motivate the populace to do what they can in order to bring our consumption down to alleviate the pressures of the sudden loss of oil incurred by The Oil Crisis. By encouraging public transport, carpooling, and burning wood instead of gas, the hope is that these add up to reduce our dependence on oil. \n\nNaturally, the oil companies tell us that this will only worsen the crisis by hurting their bottom lines but it was their incompetence that placed us in this situation in the first place so they will be disregarded."

 IBR_Expand_Healthcare_UR:0 "Expand Healthcare Services" 
 IBR_expanded_healthcare_tt:0 "In this time of crisis, healthcare for our citizens must be secured and expanded"
 IBR_Expand_Healthcare_UR_desc:0 "After the Oil Crisis reverberated into the economy, Iberians all over the nation saw a sudden and dramatic drop in quality of life. Our government cannot stand for that so the next action that needs to be taken is an expansion of our current healthcare facilities. This expansion will cover both the quantity and quality of the current healthcare system and will involve some minor nationalisation and joint public/private construction. Not only will this endear the people to our administration but will also allow people to get healthy quicker and get back to work quicker, therefore speeding up our economic recovery as well as our societal recovery."

 IBR_Subsidies_Special_PS:0 "Special Subsidies for Public Services" 
 IBR_ps_subsidies_tt:0 "Special subsidies will be granted for those public services that employ a certain number of people"
 IBR_Subsidies_Special_PS_desc:0 "Our healthcare scheme has seen popular support from the population which means we can press on with more government intervention confidently. The next step of our New Economic Program is to allocate special subsidies for public services that hire more than (include a random high number) employees.\n\nThese subsidies need to be introduced in order to make sure that our public services do not collapse in on themselves and are forced to lay off too many people. We plan to trial this in the public sector first and if successful, we will eventually roll this out to the private sector as well."

 IBR_Progressive_Tax_System:0 "Progressive Tax System" 
 IBR_progressive_taxes_tt:0 " "Those that earn more should contribute more than those who earn less" "
 IBR_Progressive_Tax_System_desc:0 "While our policies in dealing with the crisis have been popular so far, there seems to be a growing sentiment that we don't have the funds to keep these policies long term. In order to combat this sentiment, we have proposed a overhaul of the tax code, replacing our current flat income tax system with a progressive one where higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate than lower incomes. While this will be popular amongst the lower income and the more left wing in our society, we can expect an uproar amongst the highest income bracket and free market proponents but it's a measure needed to weather the storm."

 IBR_Tame_Inflation:0 "Tame the Inflation" 
 IBR_tame_inflation_tt:0 "We will try and control inflation"
 IBR_Tame_Inflation_desc:0 "Inflation has been spiralling ever since the crisis hit and if we do not do something about it now, the worry is that it will spiral out of control. Luckily, we included policies to control inflation in the N.E.P and there is no better time to introduce them. We will raise interest rates to encourage saving and slow down the immense price rises. Additionally, we will implement temporary wage controls in order to keep both prices and wages down. This will be unpopular with the people who had supported our previous policies but at least it'll calm down the industrialists."

 IBR_New_Energy_Investments:0 "New Energy Investments" 
 IBR_energy_investments_tt:0 "We will invest in new energies to be less dependant on oil"
 IBR_New_Energy_Investments_desc:0 "While we have made some strides in reducing oil consumption, we need to ensure that a crisis like this never happens again and so we must turn to new sources of energy. Our main renewable energy resources that we can utilize are wind and hydropower. As part of our program, we plan to begin construction of a dam on the Tagus River which courses through Spain and Portugal. However, since this will take some time we shall also subsidise the building of wind farms in the north of the peninsula.\n\nThese will be expensive but having control over our own energy will help to ensure that the next time there is a crisis in the Middle East, we're not up the creek without a paddle."

 IBR_Worldwide_Trading:0 "Worldwide Trading"
 IBR_Worldwide_Trading_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis was a global crisis and any economy attached to the global economy has been affected by the problems that were a result of it. However, despite this, we should seek out new trading partners to diversify our trade. Through this, we can make sure that even if one of our trading partners collapses because of future global recessions, we will at least have the others to fall back on.\n\nAdditionally, by having more trading ties with the world, it will speed up our own economic recovery because of the fact that it will give us access to a wider market for our exports and the opportunity for more foreign investment."

 IBR_Pay_Our_Debts:0 "Begin to Pay Our Debts" 
 IBR_pay_our_debts_tt:0 "The government will start to pay its debt to ensure debtor confidence"
 IBR_Pay_Our_Debts_desc:0 "Now that we have implemented a good portion of the New Economic Program, it is time to start paying back the debt that we accrued while funding our economic recovery program. It is imperative that we do this as soon as possible to avoid defaulting on these loans and having our state debtors bail out on us.\n\nAdditionally, by paying them back, it will increase business confidence in us which allow us to pursue further loans in the future should we need to. Confidence in the government's ability to pay back it's loans is paramount to ensuring that our economic recovery can be completed."

 IBR_Another_Economic_Miracle:0 ""Another Miracle Is Coming""
 IBR_Another_Economic_Miracle_desc:0 "Good news has been hard to come by since the start of this crisis however our internal economists have predicted that our recovery should be coming soon. As brilliant as this is, we must not become complacent and we need to make sure that we stick to the emergency measures that we put into place and carry on as we were or else risk slipping back in a recession. The New Economic Program has been mostly implemented and for the time being, sticking to what is currently in place seems to be the shortest road to recovery and our economists agree."

 IBR_End_Crisis_UR:0 "End the Crisis" 
 IBR_end_crisis_tt:0 "The crisis is almost gone, but a lot is yet to be done..."
 IBR_End_Crisis_UR_desc:0 "It has become clear to us that the worst of the recession is now over and we have left the trough and are heading into recovery. This means that we can relax some of the emergency measures that we put in place at the start of the crisis and things in Iberia will start to go back to normal. Our vision of brighter and fairer Iberia will soon come to fruition and the New Economic Program will be expanded and adapted to a non-crisis economy but until then we will make sure that Iberians, no matter their stature in life, have faith in their government to look out for their welfare."

 IBR_marketlib_victory_desc:0 "Tired of the unending inaction on our economic woes under the Caudillos, the people of Iberia have chosen to prioritize its betterment in the first congressional election. Our Partido Renovador Democrático now holds a comfortable majority of seats. At long last, confidence in the peseta has begun to rise, and foreign investors are already knocking at our door in anticipation of what our economic reforms will bring to the nation."

 IBR_embrace_capitalism:0 "Embrace Capitalism"
 IBR_embrace_capitalism_desc:0 "Naturally, the first order of the day is to do away entirely with the Caudillos' notions of autarky and instead embrace whole-heartedly the capitalist free market system that worked so well to enrich the supposedly "decadent" West. The insistence on self-sufficiency proved nothing but disastrous in the long run, and the damage to foreign confidence in our economy was significant. However, there's no cure quite like economic freedom, and it shouldn't take too long to undo the damage the Caudillos inflicted upon us."

 IBR_promote_trade_schools:0 "Promote Trade Schools"
 IBR_promote_trade_schools_desc:0 "With an entire generation having grown up under autarky, there is a distinct lack of economic know-how amongst the newer batches of economists and entrepreneurs churned out by our universities. Further education to remedy this is necessary, so we shall establish dedicated institutions to ensure that nobody taking up a career in economics goes in with only one eye open. To do otherwise would put us at a disastrous disadvantage compared to our economic rivals."

 IBR_less_economic_restrictions:0 "Reduce Economic Restrictions"
 IBR_less_economic_restrictions_desc:0 "The amount of barriers and red tape blocking even the most basic of financial endeavors from proceeding is truly staggering. One almost wonders what the Caudillos were thinking when they drafted the legislation that they put in place to begin with. Assessing each of the relevant policies individually would only waste time and resources better spent introducing our own, more helpful legislation. A slash-and-burn approach is called for. The markets will sort out any resultant fallout in due course."

 IBR_privatise_government_assets:0 "Privatize Government Assets"
 IBR_privatise_government_assets_desc:0 "State ownership stifles innovation and scares off foreign investors. There is absolutely no sense in having so many economic assets under the direct supervision of government bureaucrats without the training to handle them, especially when there is no shortage of skilled and eager businessmen and entrepreneurs chomping at the bit to take the burden upon themselves. Selling off these assets will not only prove our devotion to free market principles, but will also free up bureaucrats for more important tasks and provide a healthy cash injection for future government spending."

 IBR_new_tax_plans:0 "Reform the Tax Code"
 IBR_new_tax_plans_desc:0 "A 70% tax on big business? 50% on small businesses? Absurd! What's the point of such high taxes if there's hardly anyone they'll apply to in the first place? For all his military acumen, Franco was clearly not a man with an education in economics, and Salazar certainly didn't help matters. Still, it's never too late for a few tax cuts and rationalisation of the Tax Code. No amount of red tape will stop the razor's edge of free enterprise!"

 IBR_expand_market_sectors:0 "Expand Underperforming Market Sectors"
 IBR_expand_market_sectors_desc:0 "While the economy in general is in poor shape, there are a number of market sectors in that are in particularly bad condition. Agriculture in particular, despite being a massive section of the economy, remains backwards in methods and means of management. Subsidies for farmers and incentives for investors, along with efforts to finally complete mechanisation, should be just the ticket to compete with the juggernaut of Ukraine. Furthermore, privatisation of our major manufactories will finally allow for a long-overdue modernisation of industrial machinery and techniques."

 IBR_a_nation_of_opportunity:0 "A Nation of Opportunity"
 IBR_a_nation_of_opportunity_desc:0 "The United States has been able to call itself a "land of opportunity" for over two centuries now. Yet, despite our own nations being many centuries older, we have never been able to claim anywhere near their level of progress on the front of freedom and prosperity, even after unification. Only through plunder of the New World did Spain ascend to global dominance in the first place! Neither the autarky of the Caudillos nor the slave economy of Germany have proven viable systems; instead, the liberal nations of the world have clearly won out, demonstrating that hard work, ingenuity and economic spontaneity are the key to the enrichment of Iberia. With enough effort, any Iberian might be the next Ford or Rockefeller!"

The economy is booming, foreign money is pouring into our coffers and the common man is buoyed aloft by a sense of optimism unrivalled since the golden age of Spain and Portugal! The Church, which was originally wary of our "plutocratic intentions" has come around to our way of thinking, and fully supports our efforts to rejuvenate Iberia. The cries of those backwards thinkers stuck in the 19th century grow ever quieter beneath the cheering of the masses at our success, and even men of the old regime offer their thanks and congratulations! While Germany struggles to rise from the muck of slavery and stagnation, we, once the laughing stock of Europe, soar ever higher on the world stage! Viva Iberia!"

 IBR_marklib_responsible_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is no good if nobody understands its functions or purpose. Without proper education on its inner workings, voters may not even know what it is they're voting for! We should fund programs to educate those too young to remember the Second Republic, as well as help older voters catch up on the changes made to our old system. Furthermore, funding should be diverted to both public and private schools to establish constitutional education classes, so that everyone from the wealthiest of the bourgeoisie's offspring to the lowliest peasant's son understands the system and their place within it."

 IBR_freedom_of_speech:0 "Loosen Restrictions on Speech"
 IBR_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "What power is there in language, really? Words are but wind before our present economic realities, and that's what really matters right now. Rolling back restrictions on freedom of speech and the press will be of no consequence, as our policies and the prosperity they bring will speak for themselves - and much more eloquently than any critic. Let the reds and reactionaries shout; the jangle of a full purse will always be louder."

 IBR_more_voting_booths:0 "More Voting Booths"
 IBR_more_voting_booths_desc:0 "Despite the genuine efforts of the electoral commission, the election that established our authority may not have been wholly representative of the entire population. Of course, we hold no blame for this, and enough of the population voted for us that it didn't really matter at the time. Still, there were a number of rural communities and neglected municipalities - particularly in Andalusia, Galicia and Extremadura - that did not receive the same level of attention as the major population centres of the north, east and heartlands. This was an unfortunate occurrence, but one easily remedied with a spot of increased funding for more booths and a boost to the number of election monitors to cover every municipality in the country."

 IBR_regional_elections:0 "Hold Regional Elections"
 IBR_regional_elections_desc:0 "Merely voting for the government at a federal level is not enough - neither to satisfy voters, nor to ensure the smooth cycling out of old and unpopular local governments. Regional elections, for mayors, councils and so on, are just as important for our new liberal democracy as they are for every other democratic success story. It is crucial that the common man sees democracy in effect at every level of government, so that he does not lose faith in our system and turn to violent solutions for his problems once again."

 IBR_Catholic_Guidance:0 "Catholic Guidance"
 IBR_Catholic_Guidance_desc:0 "While our party and the Church have been somewhat at odds in the past, we would have them know that any issues we have with them are purely related to their role in government. When it comes to social issues and morality, we are happy to work hand-in-hand with the clergy and the Vatican. Not only will their backing be useful to shore up conservatives' confidence in our government, but much of the old guard may be swayed by direct Church support for our policies - and we will not pass up the chance to recruit those of them with the sort of talents we are looking for."

We understand his intentions - separatism was certainly a pressing issue at the time - but this is a new era of peace and understanding. Let the Basques and Catalans have their languages and traditions. There is nothing to gain economically from continued suppression, and everything to lose from the return of regional unrest. We certainly don't want to lose our newfound economic clout over such small issues as languages or local festivals!"

 IBR_Some_lines_should_not_be_crossed:0 "...but some lines should not be crossed."
 IBR_Some_lines_should_not_be_crossed_desc:0 "Though we have embraced economic progressivism, social progressivism is another matter entirely. We are, of course, a true Iberian party - and any true Iberian party is a true Catholic party. That said, not all Iberians are as dedicated to Catholic values as we are, and it would not do to simply ignore their complaints or pretend that we do not live in an increasingly globalised society. Divorce is an issue that continues to divide both Iberia and our party, with many considering the traditional family too important to social cohesion for us to dare infringe upon. We must decide whether to allow for a degree of secularism and permit divorce, or continue our unwavering devotion to Catholic principles. Neither option will please everyone."

 IBR_Harmonious_Society:0 "For a Harmonious Society"
 IBR_Harmonious_Society_desc:0 "God, Fatherland and Family are all well and good for the foundation of a society, but you cannot build a house from the foundations alone. The Church may be our bedrock, but it is capitalism, and the freedom to exploit it, that allows for the house to be built. While the Catholic faith ensures that all men are treated as brothers in Christ, economic and personal freedom will ensure that said men are able to make the best possible use of their lives and careers, rather than labouring under the yoke of autarky. The ordinary work of the common man is the foremost path to holiness, and so freeing him to decide for himself is an imperative. A prosperous and holy people will ensure the harmony of Iberian society."

 IBR_tackle_government_incompetence_desc:0 "Iberia's government, much like its predecessors, has a long and shameful reputation of incompetence. The Caudillos did little to remedy this, stacking it with regime loyalists and those considered "politically reliable". This simply will not do.

It's too late for the system, but it isn't too late for them. Rigorous but fair training programs will separate the wheat from the chaff, leaving us with only those truly cut out for government service. While we would like to simply cut out everyone not 100% qualified for their jobs, such an act would only breed hostility and be a waste of potential talent."

 IBR_restructure_federal_agencies:0 "Restructure Federal Agencies"
 IBR_restructure_federal_agencies_desc:0 "Much of the blame for Iberia's woes can be laid squarely at the feet of our bloated, inefficient bureaucracy. There are thousands of superfluous employees and even entire agencies who do barely any work but still manage to sponge up millions of pesetas every year. These will obviously get the chop, but that will leave something of a vacuum in our bureaucracy. To compensate, other agencies will be expanded and the now-vacant roles of the old agencies consolidated, vastly cutting down on the number of employees required and straightening out our labyrinthine bureaucracy."

A despot hires his friend, his friend hires two of his own, and it continues on and on until the entire system is nothing but yes-men. Thankfully, Iberia's government had not yet decayed to such a point when we came to power, and there's still plenty of time to clean up the departments and bureaus that comprise it. Nepotism is the foremost concern, but there also seems to be an awful lot of money missing from some departments..."

 IBR_judicial_reform_70_desc:0 "Nowhere will one find more Francoist old guard than in the legal system. Not even the military comes close to the total grip that the Caudillos enjoyed over our nation's lawyers and judges. Those responsible for miscarriages of justice will be debarred from their profession for life, and brought to trial themselves if necessary. In place of regime loyalists, the legal system will now favor highly educated and qualified individuals. It is critical that the men of the judiciary be of high moral character, and capable of making sound judgements when a mere interpretation can decide the fate of a nation."

 IBR_marlib_final_step_desc:0 "For the first time in centuries, the man on the street can say "Yes, I have a great deal of confidence in our economy and our institutions." For all their political clout, the Caudillos never accomplished that. What we have accomplished is great in its own way; the ordinary worker, regardless of whether he wears a blue or white collar, enjoys more than just a livable wage, and we gave him that without kowtowing to trade unions or reinforcing the failing policies of autarky. For the first time, he can trust that Iberia is in the safe hands of truly competent leaders, who are willing to reform the system into one that works for all. We have yet to see how this progress will continue, but we have faith in God's favor of Iberia."

It is our luck that the loyal institution of Opus Dei has provided a comprehensive plan in order to emerge from these dark times.\n\nThe organization has promised that with certain stimulus arrangements the market would be able to recover and begin resuming a normal trend. In general, however, the emergency program is designed to uphold the market liberal ideology while alleviating the shock of the crisis. After all, the market has always proven itself to be most efficient at designating resources. Opus Dei have promised that opening the possibilities of exploiting new energy sources to investors, and pushing for tax cuts across the board, will bring back the forces of supply in order to meet the outstanding demand.

We cannot have companies going bust and damaging the necessary market forces we need to stave off this crisis.\n\nTo remedy this issue it has been suggested that a new work culture should be introduced, one where we can insure that firms uphold required staff numbers without paying for it with unmet variable costs. Hence, we should ensure that companies know they are supported by the government in firing unnecessary workers as long as they keep those who are truly earning their pay. This should promote productivity in the long run too."

It has been recognized that social security is an important component of modern state organization, but this does not mean that just like with other government branches that it is immune to inefficiency. In line with arguments that have claimed that it only is a bottomless pit that continuously sucks money without giving back to the economy, we have decided it finally is time that we audit the whole operation. There certainly will be parts that are either not an absolute necessity or that are downright mismanaged.

We on the other hand will use no such draconian regulation to harm our economy. The free market has historically proven itself to be the most effective and efficient distributor of resources through the demand and supply paradigm. Hence, we should leave it to these forces to decide what happens with the oil that our nation has access to.

With any lack of energy diversification, a shock could bring great ruin. We must therefore look to other energy sources that can be exploited to ensure that our economy will be on strong foundations even when those around us are suffering.

With great difficulty and after a number of intense debates have they been rebuked. It is clear that they have been seized by an irrational panic! Do they not know that the market is the best and only tool to correct itself? Time and time again when central authority has intervened in order to bring about what it says as good change has it resulted in terrible outcomes. On the other hand, the market has always been able to efficiently correct course and stabilise the forces of demand and supply.

However, with the advent of the oil crisis it has become clear that work needs to be done to expand our market liberal vision into the international sphere. In a similar vein to energy diversification we also must seek to expand our trading networks. Our currently weak links were damaged by the expansive economic damage that weak preparation and an incomplete restructuring of market forces had given us.

Both companies and private individuals have fewer funds than previously and hence are not spending or investing which are the important bloodlines our economy depends on. It is not for the government to sort out issues with how people interact with the market and more importantly how it functions, yet we should certainly facilitate an opportunity for the market to resuscitate itself. In this we have decided upon a general tax cut which will affect all interests in the economy. By individuals and firms having more money again we will hopefully see a return to a new normal."

The crisis has however given us new impetus in our mission to finally achieve total victory over those who stand in the way of liberalising all aspects of the economy. Under the guise of returning financial stability to government expenditure it has been decided to allow private versions of public services to be authorised. With those who can afford private provisions switching we are still providing a safety net to the less advantaged strata of our society.

A number of them have insisted that Iberia pay back its debts with the most utmost urgency, in some cases even with reduced interest rates. It would however currently be detrimental to our recovery were we to pay back all of the amassed debt.

Clearly when relying on technocratic advice it sometimes is difficult to make the public understand our intentions. Necessary sacrifices may be seen as negligence or even worse intentional evil. Like with so many things in history only hindsight will be able to clear the cobwebs from their eyes. In time they will thank us for what we done for them and those who follow. We have chosen the correct and righteous path."

Iberia must choose whether to embrace and effectively work with our reforms or deny their value and fall alongside other nations entirely crippled by the economic crisis. The Union has the potential to become a leading powerhouse in Europe, towering above nations with similar demographics only due to the effective management of market forces. We have done all we can for now, our response was well orchestrated and allowed the passing of necessary legislation in combating the crisis. The foundations for a strong economic upswing hence have been set. It is for Iberians to now lead the Union further into prosperity or reject the gifts we have bestowed upon them."

 IBR_Moral_Nation_desc:0 "Good character, of society, nation and individuals, is crucial for any good Catholic nation like our own. Decades ago, godless revolutionaries sought to tear down every moral boundary and standard in our great nation; the streets of Barcelona were filled with drunkards, hedonists and loose women! Had it not been for the moral guidance of the Caudillos and the Church, they might have spread their vile profligacy throughout the entire peninsula! This was surely the result of the secularisation and "liberation" propagated by the Popular Front and their radical allies. No such depravity shall ever find a foothold again under our watchful eye, and we must educate the nation correctly so as to ensure the same remains true under future generations."

Do these notions not define Spain, most pious of the Catholic nations and oldest of the colonial empires? New, vigorous leadership need not mean a reversal of course, and we know a good thing when we see it! While change may inevitably come with time, Franco's motto shall for now remain our motto, but now for the health and happiness of all Iberia, not just Spain."

 IBR_Freedom_Nation:0 "A Nation of Freedom"
 IBR_Freedom_Nation_desc:0 "Freedom to assemble, to talk, to criticise, to protest... all concessions we can make. Ruling is certainly easier when your critics are silenced (or at least muffled), but we must accept that the resumption of censorship and civic crackdowns on relatively harmless political elements will only damage the peoples' trust in our newly elected government. Democracy might have its fair share of woes, but those who claim it to be the "least worst form of government" are probably worth listening to over the more draconian Francoist old guard."

 IBR_Patriotic_Education_desc:0 "Without question, one of the worst crimes perpetrated by the communists, anarchists and syndicalists during the civil war was their attempt to tear down the very national identity of Spain itself! The Portuguese should be thankful that they were spared this indignity. It is clear that this improper attitude only found a foothold thanks to the vulnerabilities created in the modern mind by the overwhelming nature of modern life and the rapid rise of poorly thought-out education among the masses. Some more liberal-minded types might complain of the stuffiness and rigidity of our new education program, but instilling a strong sense of nationhood in our youth is vital to ensure the continued success of Iberia as a strong-willed and free nation of the world."

We will not go down in history as a pack of book-burning fanatics like the Nazis when we can instead encourage the growth of our public libraries with more funding, literacy programs and grants for new authors. The more... old-fashioned members of our party occasionally express their dismay at the possibility of deviant or - God forbid - Marxist scribblings finding their way into the hands of our youths, but we trust that proper education will have everyone agree to relegate such trash to the dustbin of history."

After all, can a true Iberian man - much less a caballero - find the strength to be a good son, husband and father if he spends his youth with nose buried in the writings of Caesar and Cicero? It may be stimulating for the mind and for his sense of heritage, but the Iberian man is one of action!

It has been this way even before the Iberian Wedding of Ferdinand and Isabella. Perhaps Franco was right to clamp down on the autonomy of the Basques and Catalans at the time of the civil war, but that time has passed. God did not make the Castilians, Leonese or Portuguese to rule alone; He made us as equals. With the political situation no longer necessitating Franco's stern measures, we can instead look to healing the divisions between the majority and minorities in our nation, and guarantee that our national brotherhood will endure any future tribulations."

Of course not! The soul of Iberia is that of ruralism, even if economic realities mean that cities and industry are the way of the future in practical terms. In the rural life, we find reflected a simpler, happier time, when the peasant whiled away the days in his fields under the responsible stewardship of his lord and the local parish.

Initially created for solely pragmatic purposes, it has come to represent something else entirely: a great and diverse people - the IBERIAN people - who, having been divided by tribal boundaries, petty rulers, and mad ideologues for millennia, have finally come together as one family. From the plains of Andalusia to the mountains of Navarra and from the picturesque Lisbon seaside to the humming industrial towns of Catalonia, our strength and brotherhood flourishes like never before. The nations that fathered us will live on, but they are no longer all that we live for. Iberia now, Iberia forever."

Now, they say nothing - if they dare to do so, they are shouted down. Not by us, for we would never deign to engage in political brawling, but by the countless loyal supporters we find amongst the populace. What clearer mandate to govern could we possibly enjoy? Iberia, with the backing of the people and the Catholic Church, has begun its climb to heights unmatched since the days of the Armada and the empires! We have in short order accomplished within a democratic system what the Caudillos could not accomplish in nearly two decades of their joint dictatorship! A new era dawns for all of Iberia: one of peace, prosperity and, above all, stability. There can be no greater gift for our generation to leave the Iberians of the future. God bless Iberia!"

This was especially true of the radical left, which commonly organised itself along the lines of trade unions, workers' militias and village communes. It is only common sense to require any and all political groups to register as a formal political party, so that everyone can keep track of who exactly stands for what these days."

 IBR_Demilitarize_Police:0 "Demilitarize The Police"
 IBR_Demilitarize_Police_desc:0 "During the civil war, the Spanish metropolitan army proved itself either treasonous or comically inept, with only the Army of Africa being reliably capable and loyal fighters. As a consequence, Franco drastically expanded the numbers and roles of the police to maintain order amongst the ruins. Entire squads on patrol with military-grade equipment certainly put the fear of God into any recidivist reds, but they were also expensive and prone to overreacting to perceived threats. With any major unrest and secessionist movements now suppressed, such a bloated force is no longer necessary, and we can be confident that rolling back Franco and Salazar's reforms will not cause any undue problems for us in the long term."

 IBR_Regional_Question_AP_desc:0 "Unfortunately, even after Franco's long-term crackdown, regionalism remains an issue that will undoubtedly rear its ugly head again if not dealt with appropriately and in short order. We are loathe to continue Franco's policies, which actually seem to have encouraged a stiffening of resistance at times, but at the same time we cannot heark back to the Popular Front's policy of increased autonomy, for that would only end in disaster and the dissolution of Iberia. The matter must be put to the Cortes and the cabinet. Perhaps it may even be worth putting out feelers towards regional groups?"

 IBR_Token_Autonomy:0 "Token Autonomy"
 IBR_Token_Autonomy_desc:0 "Naturally, the matter of autonomy has already been decided. There will be no "states within states" in Iberia again. While we understand their desires, regionalists must learn to accept the reality of the Iberian Congress. If total legal equality is good enough for everyone else, it's good enough for them. We shall not budge on this front, though we will of course allow for minor concessions - the right to choose their own public holidays, along with other culture-specific issues, perhaps?"

 IBR_Axencia_Expansion_desc:0 "The establishment of the Axencia was easily the wisest decision made by the Caudillos in regard to our internal security. Operating at a level the police and even the military cannot, the Axencia is both sword and shield of the state - and, by extension, the people of Iberia. Since they have not apparently made any moves against the democratic process, we feel confident in our belief that they serve the state first and foremost, rather than those in power. In light of this and their years of loyal service to Iberia, it is only fitting that the organization be expanded and its funding increased, especially as the role of the police is reduced in our renewed state."

Falangist old guard, fascists and marxists alike can all be relied on to attempt to subvert our democracy whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself. Though we have already taken the initiative and enshrined the secret ballot, we must go further. Election monitors will help prevent electoral fraud, and a new cadre of bureaucrats will ensure the electoral rolls remain clean and well-organised. If the Iberian democracy of the future can thank us for anything, it will be our dedication to the principles of fair and free democracy regardless of how inconvenient it is for our party's interests."

Doubtless, they always had Iberia's best interests at heart, but everyone knows what they say about Hell and good intentions. Indebted though we may be to their vigilance, we must not indulge in any whitewashing of their deeds. Nobody needs to know the gory details, but publicly accepting the realities brought about by the harsh times the Caudillos reigned over is an important first step towards building trust between ourselves and the electorate - not least because there are many former regime staff within our party."

 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code:0 "Rewrite the Penal Code"
 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code_desc:0 "Under the Caudillos, there was an aggressive approach to law enforcement at times. While we recognize the necessity of strong-arm tactics by the Axencia, the court system itself should not have such a reputation for brutality and heavy-handedness amongst the common people. The working class, especially, remains wary of them despite our promises. It would be most prudent to rewrite our nation's penal code and ensure proper judicial oversight, especially given the strong sympathy for the Caudillos amongst judges and prosecutors."

 IBR_Franco_was_Franco_desc:0 "As we have repeatedly told our critics: Yes, we are aware of everything that Franco did before, during and after the civil war. Should we renounce him merely because his actions were often unpalatable to modern sensibilities? No! His gradual easing of harsh laws and the successful return of democracy proves more than anything that he was no fascist demagogue beholden to a Bohemian corporal, but a highly pragmatic man who would go to any lengths for the sake of his beloved nation and its people. He only cracked down on genuine threats to Spanish stability, and in the case of the reds it was certainly well-deserved! Did he accept the aid of Hitler and his motley of gangsters? Yes, but who then could have forseen Germany's total conquest of Europe or the construction of Atlantropa? None should be so hasty as to judge him with the benefit of hindsight. This will be our party line, and there shall be no apologies for it."

 IBR_Renew_Catholicism_desc:0 "Even under the Caudillos, regular church attendance was far below its height in our more prosperous days. The only spike in recent years was when the German civil war erupted and the people suddenly found something rather pressing to pray about. What kind of Catholic party would we be if we failed to take advantage of our newfound legislative power by reminding the people that Iberia is, above all else, a Catholic nation? Nobody is suggesting mandatory church attendance, not only because it goes against our principles but also because it is unlikely to truly motivate the faithful. Instead, we should focus on inviting the church to play a greater role in social, welfare and educational programs. Combined with a healthy dose of funding for new religious construction (especially in the chronically godless region of Catalonia) and some well-deserved tax exemptions, we can restore Catholicism's place of pride as one of the pillars of Iberian culture and society."

That said, they are far more influential in our nation's economy than we would like them to be. We shan't go so far as to criminally probe them - that would be totally unjustified and a waste of resources. However, it would be perfectly reasonable to declare that an audit of their finances and activities is due; a simple bureaucratic review to make sure that everything is in order. While this is obviously just a sensible thing to do from a government standpoint, doing it publicly may also ease the fear common among the fascists and the godless that we are unable to treat Catholic organizations objectively."

Despite the conservative nature of the church in Spain, there is strong support among Catholic women for the earlier iterations of feminism that brought about change in more liberal nations. Our party is split on the issue along reformist and traditionalist lines. One the one hand, the Church's teachings on the structure of the family are clear, and we would not wish to give offense or act in an un-Christian manner. On the other, can we really afford to retain the idea of women acting solely in traditional roles, with a modern industrial economy and a broad sense of internationalism on the rise?"

 IBR_Modern_Christian_Society_desc:0 "Those who say that religion is a relic of the past or the "opiate of the masses" have, we are happy to say, been proven decisively wrong thanks in no small part to our efforts. It was the Christian vote that carried us to our first electoral victory, and it shall be the Christian vote that buoys us in future elections. This is only possible because we alone recognize what other parties do not: that Iberia and its constituent nations are, now and forever, Christian nations, bearing the heritage of nearly two thousand years on their collective shoulders. To abandon our faith as the bedrock of society would be folly; to actively abolish it would be madness."

By chaining our government spending, we will be able to ensure that the crisis doesn't get any worse than it currently is. \n\nWhile this certainly won't endear the population to our government, we can only hope that we will be able to hold our position in power long enough to get through this crisis so that we will be able to lift the measures."

If this trend continues, then our economy will become paralyzed as consumer spending and business investment begins to dry up. This is why it seems necessary to freeze salaries to prevent an unemployment crisis on top of our current economic crisis. \n\nHowever, many of the business leaders we have courted over the election cycle have expressed their discontent at this policy behind closed doors so we will have to placate them at some point."

We are free, free to act on the will of the people, free to stop anyone who doesn't. We are imperial, and we know better than the minorities of the Union, who would destroy themselves for the sake of it. Eventually, they too will be gone, and then we shall be truly one.

They shaped an entire continent for the rest of time. How could this not be a great past? While we unfortunately won't be shaping a continent to our values, people seem to have begun to forget their ancestors.

Forgetfulness is just a part of being human, so what matters is reminding them. Nothing reminds people of their common bonds than a common enemy to fight.

Given the radical nature of their policies twisting them into something despicable will be child's play. This can kill two birds with one stone; we will have something to sic our propagandists on and a scapegoat for the populace.

You are politically accountable for what you do and the legitimacy is still simply not worth heaving to wrangle opposition. We will forever be opposed by Leftists and Bolsheviks because they are capable of manipulating the system to stay in their power. What's worse, the obsession with individual over collective has ruined the moral standards of the Union until nothing will be left but anarchy and degeneracy.\n\nThe decrepit system is incompatible with our radical reforms. Democracy is nothing but a sham used by Leftists to seize power against the will of the people. The system needs to go, for the good of Iberia. Equally so, anyone who objects must be shut down and silenced. It will take a long time to fully dismantle these shams, but it will be time well spent. The only concern is that the people will, brainwashed as they are, reject these reforms out of stubbornness. They will all come around in time."

With the old regime gone, this group have pledged to support our cause of liberty, but they have their reservations. With socialists now allowed to rally and publish their newspaper the conservatives have sent the government their concerns over what they call "barbaric socialists".

It is becoming harder to uproot them amongst a populace that increasingly sympathizes with them, from which they can expect an incrementally larger number of contributions. This must not stand. The only way we can stop this disturbing trend is to give the Axencia the ability to work better with less, and even better with more. Any corrupt officials will be removed from their posts, the rest will be evaluated for their loyalty to ensure they don't have sympathies they shouldn't.

Heat must be conserved for vital purposes, such as cooking food which would otherwise make one ill, and even then sparingly.  If they get cold, they can just huddle together under blankets.

If we allow an oil shortage to disrupt our pride, then we have truly failed as a country.\n\nWhile it is true that there is less oil to go around, with our austerity measures in place we will be able to make sure the military has the fuel it needs to operate - and some in reserve.

They hide within our civilians, both using them as shields and converting them to their cult of treason.\n\nTo stop the cancer from growing, we must win the hearts and minds of Iberians.

By teaching Iberian citizens the virtues of a simple life, we will find it ever-so-easier to bring them around to supporting austerity, and the moral lesson is only an added benefit."

Many would claim that a ready access to large amounts of cooked food is starvation. It is not.\n\nThe truth is, this recent crisis must force Iberians to reconsider their dietary habits.

The masons, a group to be added with the terrorists and the separatists, are to blame for this crisis. We were only hit as hard as we were because of them. They prepared for something like this, and made sure to twist the knife as hard as possible.\n\nThe masons are guilty of treason, nothing less. We need to expunge them from our government, and not stop until the last of their traitorous scum are wiped from the peninsula.

For his faith, he was rewarded with rain, solving his drought and banishing the false prophets. This passage applies to us, too. The false prophets, the terrorists and the separatists, they claim that they can save their people, but they are built on lies and falsehood.

Even the Caudillos would admit that the men who keep Iberia safe and strong would be nothing without the fairer sex to bear their spirits aloft, endure the trials of childbirth and keep their homes from falling into chaos and disrepair.

Luckily for them, we shan't be abandoning them to their own barbaric rule of tribal infighting or whatever they were doing before the Europeans came along. Instead, they will no doubt be overjoyed to hear they will be given some "guided independence" from ourselves and the Italians.\n\nIt would be an act of great tragedy if we were to just leave the natives in their own rotten ways. We will guide them to true civilisation just as we always have and they shall be all the more grateful for it. Those that resist this act of kindness, in their own foolish barbaric notions of "self-determination", shall be met with the right amount of force in this "new" Algeria in the same way as the old one."

We're all too aware of the man's intentions to ravage the region in the search for more oil. We will need to hash out some kind of terms before the ENI decides upon something without our consent.\n\nMattei would be a fool not to strike some kind of deal with ourselves. We all know it is in all of our best interests to share the oil wealth of this very prosperous land. The natives certainly wouldn't know what to do with it. So, it is once more up to the Europeans to sort this out in a civilised way which results in everyone being the winner. There's more than enough oil here for everyone so hopefully this shouldn't be too much hassle."

 IBR_Secret_Meetings_desc:0 "In order to hash out the most intrinsic, important and excruciating details of the plan for the "new" Algeria, a number of secret meetings are occurring between the diplomatic delegations of Iberia and Italy. The very best and most important figures from both sides are set to meet in some extremely tight-knit hush-hush talks. These meetings will likely be the defining point of the negotiation period. It will likely be where it is decided whether this plan can go ahead, or is dead in the water.\n\nThe distrust in the air between the diplomats is palpable. Even after all this time, it is clear the two nations do not trust each other. So much has happened over a short period of time recently. In times as war heavy and as chaotic as these, opportunists arise and this case is no different. Each side may have its deliberate saboteurs who do not wish for the outcome of these meetings to be a pleasant one. God knows what is truly occurring in these meetings, but God help the region if it all turns out for the worst."

The Iberian political elite back home wait with baited breath for the Italians response to the plan we have worked so hard to secure. Thus far, it appears like things are going somewhere and a deal looks just to be in sight. We have had no definite response though, and this is making some of the more worrisome members of Iberian pollical society tear their hair out.\n\nIn the end, it is down to the Italians and all we can do now is wait for their response. We won't have to wait long though, for a decision is sure to come reasonably sharpish. Let us all hope that these talks were not all for nought and that something good can come of this whole endeavor. If not, this has been a spectacular waste of time and quite the missed opportunity."

 IBR_Returning_the_favor_desc:0 "Picking a superpower to work with is perhaps one of the greatest decisions Iberia will ever make. Having an international patron is very important, and their aid will allow us to assert ourselves in ways we never could otherwise. This wasn't a particularly hard choice, either - the Americans are far better than a callous government two continents away or the same bastards that stole everything from the Iberians.\n\nOf course, the only way to show a country you want to make friends is to angle yourself correctly. The best way to get the attention of the United States is to give them some help in very important places. Since they seem to be occupied down in South Africa, perhaps the best chance to help out is wide open. Giving particular support to this plan is Salazar, who has been spearheading the effort to increase Iberia's relevance in Africa."

All we need to do is so much as ask and they will be willing to help, and more often than not have someone able to do what is needed.\n\nIt is said that a good song can lighten even the darkest heart, and there are many dark hearts in wartime. The American soldiers stationed in South Africa would most likely appreciate someone to sing for them, and for a sweet melody to raise their spirits. The Women's Movement has many talented singers in it, and they can be sent to Africa to play for the American troops. The concerts will be funded by us fully, and they are sure to appreciate what we can do for them."

Since American relations seem to be improving, it may be possible that they would be willing to participate in a few mutually beneficial programs. All it will take to bring them around to it will be a small amount of persuasion, and then some competent scheduling.\n\nIt is no secret that the Iberian and American naval fleets have a world of difference between them, with different doctrines, tactics, and officers all creating a vast gap between the two. Opposites attract, and a contrast of naval styles could prove very helpful. To this end, arrangements will be made for a joint naval exercise, which will prove invaluable in providing intelligence to better improve our strategies."

 IBR_Lease_Sao_Tome_desc:0 "São Tomé. One of the only Portuguese colonies to resist German incursion, and a stable and pleasant island. The island is a darling of Portugal, not for its beauty, but for its importance. It was first colonized to serve as a waypoint in the long and treacherous journey to India. Even though it has been centuries since then, and decades since the last time the island was necessary, it is not without use. The island is in a location of immense tactical value, able to serve as a dock for ships and a point through which to filter supplies. It is for these reasons that the Americans want to use it.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill, we can effectively rent out the island to them, and allow them to use it as they please - so long as it is given back to us in fair shape. It so happens, conveniently, that a fair sum of money can be made off the deal."

Worst of all were the retornados, who were forced to flee their homelands to escape the tyranny that would affect them. The heart wrenching stories of those who have truly lost everything have made a very strong case to the government.\n\nTherefore, it is about time they got their revenge. If the Portuguese shall not have it, then the Germans assuredly won't either. Even though they seemingly took everything, there is something very important they failed to take. We still have the map of assets around Angola and it is unlikely that Germany has modified anything. It would be a shame if that map were to be given to the Americans, so that they could disable the infrastructure when they find necessary."

What no-one will tell you is that these environments are less different than one would think, and there is a lot of crossover between them. For example, there are many skills you can learn in one place that you could make use of in another. It is only logical that the Americans would appreciate learning some skills for their time in South Africa.\n\nWe will open up Guinea Bissau to the United States military, and in particular invite their special forces to come train in the area. They could use the practice to fight better in the hostile environments of Africa, where Guinea could prove a valuable introduction to it."

Since the Portugese were chased away by the Nazis, that job was left only half-finished. Yet still, the history of Portugese colonialism in the region is something that can be used to our advantage. One of the first things the settlers did was teach the inhabitants Portuguese, in order to better communicate with the natives. Portugese language is by no means universal, but a significant enough number of Africans in the former colonies know the language to make alternative operations practical.\n\nWe will deploy forces able to use the power of song and voice to strike fear into the Africans fighting under German command, turning their traditions and customs against them. These operations will harm their morale, allowing the Americans a better chance."

Medics are not always on time, nor can they get to some places easily on land. What makes it worse is that they can't always get where they need to be by air, either - as they would have nowhere to land. The Portuguese airborne nurses have been created to solve that problem.\n\nThey will parachute out of helicopters and other aircraft at high altitudes, into hostile conditions, in order to save lives. Through thick and thin, no matter the risk. It is here that the bravest will shine, and those who are in it for a thrill will get exactly what they want. They will be like angels from heaven, come to bring salvation to those in need."

Since they have grown up, lived, and will likely die in the battlegrounds that make up the area near South Africa, they are intimately comfortable with the land. Because of their unique heritage, they are like ghosts. The Africans move from the land, strike, then hide with the native population before the Americans can so much as lift a finger. No longer!\n\nThe time has come to even the advantage. Some retornados were natural outdoorsmen, and have never truly forgotten their old home. For these qualities some have been approached by the CIA, who wish to recruit them for the war effort. If we allow them to, it could nullify the advantage the Africans have."

Clearly the mistake was prioritizing quality over quantity so highly, as we have sent barely anyone. Any advantage is quickly nullified by the total lack of people to capitalize on it. As it were, we will be sacrificing a bit of that fighting quality for numbers.\n\nTo this end we will reform the Viriatos volunteer divisions, originally deployed to Spain to assist Franco, many years ago. Many brave Portuguese men will be able to taste the honor of battle, made all the sweeter by revenge. They will not rest until Angola and Mozambique have been avenged!"

 #EVENTS
 IBR.1.t:0 "The 1962 Infrastructure Program"
 IBR.1.d:0 "With the turn of the year the time is finally rife for us to unveil our new infrastructure expansion plans. The beginning will be marked only by minor improvements to create the foundational framework for larger, more comprehensive plans for our new economic structure in the union. With the highlight of this year's project being the construction of a new semi-major road in outer Madrid, Caudillo Franco has taken a surprising amount of interest in the construction. Reportedly he has been visiting different sites and inspecting work regularly with keen attention.\n\nOptimistic union officials seem to have missed the ensuing grumble that gripped parts of Portuguese society at the news of the plans. Many regions in the country are in dire need of repair so financing roadworks hundreds of miles away seems ineffectual at best and neglectful at worst. However those involved in the project remain fairly confident that it's completion will not have any hindrances due to large security contingents being posted to specifically watch for separatist terrorists. Even more importantly they recognize the potential the start of this project could have for the infrastructure of the whole union."
 IBR.1.a:0 "Let us hope so..."

 IBR.2.t:0 "The Outer Madrid Road Proposal"
 IBR.2.d:0 "Unsurprisingly the new flagship infrastructure plan has hit the same filter of survival that most policy proposals hit once both halves of the ever bickering union has access to information regarding them. Angry invoices and incessant phone calls to the ministry of the interior in Madrid were all of the same nature, a rejection of the plan to start construction on the proposed highway outside of the Spanish capital because of another trivial matter. The matter of the tools being used not being exactly proportional in terms of national origin. This obstacle has the potential to freeze the Iberian domestic arm of the government if not truly addressed so therefore we have two options to consider for going forward."
 IBR.2.a:0 "Use more construction equipment of Portuguese make."
 IBR.2.b:0 "Bribe them with a matching road in Lisbon."

 IBR.3.t:0 "The Asphalt Mixture"
 IBR.3.d:0 "The planning phase for the new infrastructure project has again halted at an early point in the resource stage due to a dispute that begun after a rather sharp Portuguese civil servant noticed diverging Portuguese and Spanish material regulations on asphalt mixtures. There is the possibility that this may ruin the road if further work continues without any intervention. Considering that this will be a coordinated effort between both union members it is important for propaganda reasons that this is done right. Then again it only is a road, the bigger projects are on the horizon afterwards and will be far better at helping to stabilise Iberian unity. How should we proceed on this issue?"
 IBR.3.a:0 "This is Spanish soil, so Spanish laws must be put in place."
 IBR.3.b:0 "Appeal for federal laws on road construction material."
 IBR.3.c:0 "Who needs regulations? Use what we brought along."

 IBR.4.t:0 "The Question of Repairs"
 IBR.4.d:0 "With the asphalt mixture problem resolved and the investigation underway, we have been given the go-ahead to start our project. State sanctioned contractors are beginning to arrive in droves, already making great progress as they begin to tear out defunct infrastructure to implement the new great works. Both foreign and domestic journalists gasp in awe when they get their allotted time to visit the construction sites; a process requiring a great deal of effort and delay on our part as everything has to be prepared accordingly in advance.\n\nOn one such visit everything changed however, time coming to a freezing halt as a blood curdling scream tears down the perfect visage we created.\n\nAn explosion of asphalt ruptures the now trembling earth, exposing cracks within the hardly setting concrete. Swathes of road cratered in after tons of dynamite were preemptively detonated in the foundations of an interchange, reducing days of toil into rubble and ash. Large stockpiles of resources and machinery are lost in the horrific mess. Emergency services were deployed within minutes, tending to wounds and attempting to pull grasping, bloodied hands out of the charred piles of ruin. We have confirmed four deaths and over three hundred workers injured, adding costly medical bills to the already colossal repairs we need to immediately address.\n\nAfter the cry of "Bietan jarrai!" was reported during the chaos, we have strong evidence supporting the notion that Basque separatists belonging to socialist organizations are directly responsible for the attacks, based off reports of similar terrorist activities that have plagued other government sponsored public works. The SECD has begun an investigation to address our suspicions, but in the meantime, we need to figure out how to amend or adjust our budget to deal with this shortfall. How should we recover from this disaster?"
 IBR.4.a:0 "Ask for a grant of Spanish tax money."
 IBR.4.b:0 "Ask for a grant of Iberian tax money."
 IBR.4.c:0 "Cut corners - we can save material here and there."

 IBR.5.t:0 "The Investigation"
 IBR.5.d:0 "After the bureaucratic nightmare that was finding the necessary funds for the desperately-needed repairs, it seems as if we may at last proceed. The many confused workmen were finally allowed back onsite, the immense amount of resources again made available, and the heavy machinery was driven out of storage.\n\nIf only it were so simple.\n\nIn the early hours of the first morning of official repairs, the construction site was suddenly swarmed with mysterious men in dark suits, who quickly cordoned off the area and hustled several of the foremen into black vans before ordering the workers to vacate the site immediately. When the regional governor's office received a phone call from one of the contractors explaining what had happened, he was furious. However, that tone was dampened by the arrival of several SECED agents bringing... less-than-ideal news.\n\nThey had already identified the people responsible for the bombings: a group of radicalized Basque students-turned-separatists with leftist leanings. Their ringleader was one Iñigo Nuñez, cousin of Alfredo Nuñez... one of the foremen for a contractor hired on the project. SECED has reasons to believe that Alfredo may have aided his cousin's terrorist cell in organizing the bombing, and that he was not the only one operating on the inside. They have obtained an official warrant to fully investigate and audit all the contractors we have hired, in order to vet them for any other associates of Alfredo who may share his separatist ideology. In the meantime, all road work must be halted for the duration of the investigation, effective immediately to make sure no further damage can be inflicted on the already controversy stricken project."
 IBR.5.a:0 "Are you really- are you KIDDING ME?!"

 IBR.6.t:0 "Lane Expansion?"
 IBR.6.d:0 "The project should've been simple. It should've just been a two lane road going from point A to point B. Yet sadly nothing can be that simple, these are turbulent times for Iberia, a political union where the building of a road is vastly outdone in effort just by the timescale of getting everything about said road approved with multiple administrations. Every little thing must bear with it fifty clauses and a hundred subsections, as though the mix of the pavement itself could potentially spark an inter-ethnic conflict were it not for corpulent bureaucracy that keeps us moving at a snail's pace.\n\nThe government in Madrid has now become involved in the construction of the road, and with it comes an entirely other magnitude of legislature and administration. The bombing of the road has forced us to create an extra-wide shoulder to be able to actually get equipment around the crater left by said attack. Madrid is now demanding that we turn this shoulder into an entirely new lane. They either have no idea what they're asking for, or, more likely, they don't care.\n\nThis is a case for the federal government. You would have to file a pile's worth of appeal paperwork asking for a permit to actually alter the road we're working on, and then of course there's a lengthy waiting period all just so a committee of pencil pushers and nepotists can take a quick glance at the paperwork and grant or deny your requests on what feels like a whim. Madrid's ignorance of the realities in the ground are mind-numbing. We can't just turn a larger than average shoulder into an entirely new lane! The shoulder would have to be expanded, the budget would have to be reconsidered, and we'd just fall once more into the seemingly endless abyss of bureaucracy we've been dealing with for the past months."
 IBR.6.a:0 "Accept the request, and appeal to the federal government."
 IBR.6.b:0 "Decline the request, to hell with the city government."

 IBR.7.t:0 "Construction Planning Finalized"
 IBR.7.d:0 "After a long period of bureaucratic delays and general pitfalls it seems that the construction of the outer Madrid road is finally proceeding smoothly. Senior contractors and civil servants have created multiple detailed models which all currently project it to all be finished in several months allowing us to finally move onto other, more grand parts of our infrastructure overhaul project."
 IBR.7.a:0 "Let's hope it's really several months."

 IBR.8.t:0 "Portugal Vetoes Construction Regulations"
 IBR.8.d:0 "The small motorcade of Portuguese officials meandering through Madrid's old roads carried with it another message bound to cause disarray. Their national government has very foolishly decided to veto our request to use Spanish law instead of Portuguese laws when determining the acceptable mixture of asphalt for the construction of the outer Madrid road.\n\nTheir decision is supposedly based on technical difficulties with the sand and gravel mixtures but any politically savvy individual could clearly see that it is rather another attempt to defy Iberian centralization with lesser Portuguese characteristics, even on a small matter such as this. They would have us work less efficiently and with a higher cost rather than swallow their pride and admit that other parts of the Union might just have better laws! To remedy the construction deadlock this will create we will have to find a way around this ruling. There is always a loose screw or a bad apple in the bunch, and if we can find them and "convince" them to look the other way, then we will still end up saving a very good amount of time, money, and effort. We will just have to make sure that these less savory actions are not discovered by anyone else."
 IBR.8.a:0 "Do it. Bribe the officials."

 IBR.9.t:0 "Permit Alteration Accepted"
 IBR.9.d:0 "The proposed alteration to our construction permit has been accepted by the federal government, and we are once again cleared to begin work. The new road will now have the desired amount of lanes wanted by the Madrid city administration. "
 IBR.9.a:0 "A miracle!"

 IBR.10.t:0 "Spain Denies Permit"
 IBR.10.d:0 "The Spanish national government has declined our request to alter the construction permit, stating that the city government has no right to make requests that would fundamentally change the new flagship union project. We will not be able to expand the lanes."
 IBR.10.a:0 "At least it saves money."

 IBR.11.t:0 "Portugal Denies Permit"
 IBR.11.d:0 "The Portuguese government has unfortunately decided to deny our request to alter the construction permit to fit more lanes onto the current flagship infrastructure project outside of Madrid. They claim that a municipal government such as ours has neither the ability nor the right to make these kinds of major changes to a project that so clearly falls under federal jurisdiction. This not only means that there will not be any lane expansions but it also sets a decidedly chilly mood for future negotiations on the project.  Despite our proximity to the infrastructure and therefore the heightened fallout whether positive or negative for us, we can now only hope that they will be more reasonable in the future when it comes to the project, as it seems any further involvement on our part is being opposed at high government levels." 
 IBR.11.a:0 "At least it saves money."

 IBR.12.t:0 "Conflict of Interest Investigation"
 IBR.12.d:0 "Another hardship fell onto the contractors and bureaucrats involved with the 1962 infrastructure overhaul plan, which has already been the target of controversy. Senior officials in the domestic office of government, particularly those concerned with optics and propaganda, have begun to take a more intense interest in the proceedings of the road construction. Allegations of misused and downright embezzled funds, overworked laborers and withheld pay are being thundered down on the already shaking shoulders of the hard pressed overseers. The duality of work objectives and optics seems to have come to its natural conclusion, a direct conflict of interests. Whether this scandal will halt the project indefinitely is yet to be revealed by the machinations of the wise Iberian government." 
 IBR.12.a:0 "Since when did Iberia care about corruption?"

 IBR.13.t:0 "Violation of Material Regulations"
 IBR.13.d:0 "A surprise inspection has discovered that we have not been obeying established regulations regarding the asphalt mixture to be used on the road. The Iberian government has fined us for said mistake, stating that only the best and agreed upon quality was allowed to persist in any further construction work. Why government employed workers were being fined by the government for I competency outside their pay grade was still to be found out."
 IBR.13.a:0 "Corruption is to be expected."

 IBR.14.t:0 "Federal Tax Money Proposal"
 IBR.14.d:0 "Our request for more federal tax money to be used for repairing the road has been finally been accepted by officials both in Madrid and Lisbon. Our constructions can now hopefully continue and eventually finish without any further delay." 
 IBR.14.a:0 "Thank goodness."

 IBR.15.t:0 "Spanish Tax Money Proposal"
 IBR.15.d:0 "Our request to the Spanish regional government for tax money to be used for repairing the road has been accepted. This means we are finally free to get back to work and finish this cursed project."
 IBR.15.a:0 "Excellent."

 IBR.16.t:0 "Iberia Denies Funding"
 IBR.16.d:0 "The federal Iberian government has denied more funding to road building, stating that the project has been given more than enough funding to ensure its completion. This comes despite their extensive knowledge of the disastrous bombing attack. We must seek alternate sources of funding."
 IBR.16.a:0 "To be expected."

 IBR.17.t:0 "Spain Denies Funding"
 IBR.17.d:0 "The Spanish regional government has denied us funding, stating that the project is solely in the federal domain and that any move to bring it out of said sphere will result in internal bickering between regional governments. We must seek alternate sources of funding."
 IBR.17.a:0 "Doesn't stop them from meddling."

 IBR.18.t:0 "Road Construction Complete"
 IBR.18.d:0 "Finally, after many incidents and delays, the proposed road in outer Madrid is now usable. This will be the first stepping stone in providing Iberia with a logistical infrastructure system that will bring the half-peninsula the capabilities to flex its eager muscles on the international market. One question remains however... who will open it, and who will it be named after? This may not be an easy issue to solve."
 IBR.18.a:0 "Not this again!"

 IBR.190.t:0 "Portuguese Mechanical Failures"
 IBR.190.d:0 "The less experienced labourers at the road construction site this morning were surprised to see all machines that had used the concrete mixture were in a state beyond repair. The older, arguably more wiser men shook their heads in knowing disbelief. It seems the Portuguese machines that we were mandated to use apparently are incompatible with the required paving mixture, and have suffered numerous mechanical failures. They must be swapped out if we are to finish this project. "
 IBR.190.a:0 "Who even makes those?"

 IBR.19.t:0 "City Government Cuts Off Movement!"
 IBR.19.d:0 "The city government of Madrid, after having their request declined, has denied construction teams a permit to move construction equipment through the city. Thankfully, the federal government is already moving to overturn this, but this still means there will be a significant delay in continuing further construction. "
 IBR.19.a:0 "More delays?"

 IBR.20.t:0 "Government Approves Using Spanish Law"
 IBR.20.d:0 "The Iberian government has approved using the asphalt mixtures and road measurements standardized in Spanish law for the Outer Madrid road."
 IBR.20.a:0 "Surprising, but acceptable."

 IBR.21.t:0 "Investigation Finds Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.21.d:0 "The investigation into the Outer Madrid road project has found several suspicious practices, including fraud, bribery and a neglect of proper vetting procedures for employees. A heavy fine is being drafted for the road-building company to try to minimize mitigating damage to the government. The issue of further dragging the project on is hardly even being considered at this point."
 IBR.21.a:0 "It Could Be Worse."

 IBR.22.t:0 "Investigation Finds Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.22.d:0 "The investigation into the Outer Madrid road project has found many suspicious practices, including bribing officials and a foreman with active ties to Basque separatists. The Guardia Civil have raided the site and arrested the suspect."
 IBR.22.a:0 "Unacceptable Behavior."

 IBR.23.t:0 "Investigation Finds Very Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.23.d:0 "The investigation into the Outer Madrid road project has found many suspicious practices, the most notable of which is finding out that one of the companies involved was a front for a southern Italian-based organized crime family. Considering the initial benign nature of the investigation it is surprising to now see the Iberian government having a minor international incident on their hands."
 IBR.23.a:0 "How did they get away with it?"

 IBR.24.t:0 "Investigation Finds No Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.24.d:0 "Despite the numerous setbacks facing it, the Outer Madrid road project has been deemed a safe and law-abiding enterprise. It is a good example to all of Iberia in how the rest of the planned infrastructure overhauls should be organised."
 IBR.24.a:0 "An Excellent Example."

 IBR.25:0 "The Lisbon Infrastructure Plan"
 IBR.25.t:0 "The Lisbon Infrastructure Plan"
 IBR.25.d:0 "Planned years ago in 1962, the Lisbon Infrastructure Plan has finally been completed. Lisbon now possesses a sister road to the one in Madrid."
 IBR.25.a:0 "Finally."
 
 #Post-malta debates
 
 IBR.27:0 "Trade Debate - Triumvirate Tariffs"
 IBR.27.t:0 "Trade Debate - Triumvirate Tariffs"
 IBR.27.d:0 "With the collapse of the Triumvirate, many of Iberia's former trade partners have suddenly declared themselves hostile to the nation. Today, in their meeting in Galicia, the two Caudillos discussed the possibility of levying tariffs on Italy and Turkey. While they generally agreed that tariffs were a decent idea, the discussion was quickly bogged down by furious argument over exactly what products had the highest priority to levy tariffs on. Spanish and Portuguese institutions both provided conflicting data, much of which was severely out of date. Once the dust settled, no comprehensive agreement had been reached."
 IBR.27.a:0 "Can't they agree on anything?"
 
 IBR.28:0 "Trade Debate - Tariff Sourcing"
 IBR.28.t:0 "Trade Debate - Tariff Sourcing"
 IBR.28.d:0 "With the utter indecision of the previous debate, the Caudillos have moved on to a new topic. Namely, precisely where the money from potential tariffs would go. Again, a consensus was not reached, with precise ratios not being worked out. The issue of the Union government not recieving any sort of reasonable amount of funding appears to be likely to persist indefinitely, as the Caudillos clash over what factors shall determine which administration will collect and distribute tariff money."
 IBR.28.a:0 "We needed that!"
 
 IBR.29:0 "Trade Debate - Port Ownership"
 IBR.29.t:0 "Trade Debate - Port Ownership"
 IBR.29.d:0 "After the disastrous attempt at negotiating tariffs, the Caudillos have taken another topic in to be tormented. The matter of the day is now port ownership, namely the question of which administration owns national ports. While Salazar insists that regional governments should be in control of the ports, Franco argues that all ports should be under the direct control of the Union itself. After nearly three hours of argument, the decision was unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion, and has thus been delayed until the next meeting. Until then, Iberia's ports shall be held in uncertain hands."
 IBR.29.a:0 "At least it wasn't something more important."
 
 IBR.30:0 "Trade Debate - Railway Gauge"
 IBR.30.t:0 "Trade Debate - Railway Gauge"f
 IBR.30.d:0 "The final topic in the Caudillo's hellish trade conference is the matter of railroad gauge. Certain obscure railroads in inner Spain are unable to support railroad cars wide enough to hold standardized shipping containers. Thus, Franco argues, federal funding must be granted to expand the railroad tracks to a regulation length. Salazar, however, does not agree, stating that shipping maritime containers through inland Spain is useless, when containers could simply be unloaded and processed on Portuguese soil. The esoteric argument managed to last longer than any other, and end in bitter indecision."
 IBR.30.a:0 "Was Iberia meant to be this dysfunctional?"
 
 IBR.31:0 "Taxation Debate - Foreign Taxation"
 IBR.31.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Foreign Taxation"
 IBR.31.d:0 "The conference on taxation has begun with the most crucial item on the list, namely, taxing foreign assets. Iberia, due to its weak federal tax code, has a reputation as a tax haven equitable to the worst of the West Indies. In this debate, several schools of thought have clashed, with some arguing to end Iberia's status as a de facto tax haven, while others believe that any taxation at all will lower investments and make the country worse off than it started. In the end, no side prevailed, as Caudillos Franco and Salazar were split on the issue of potential tax discrimination by country of origin."
 IBR.31.a:0 "That was important..."
 
 IBR.32:0 "Taxation Debate - Income Taxation"
 IBR.32.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Income Taxation"
 IBR.32.d:0 "Another dreaded topic of discussion was the potential of a federal income tax. While it has general support amongst the Opus Dei economists recently allowed into the government, the Caudillos are still bitterly split on the issue. Salazar, ever the corporatist, refuses to agree with any sort of concrete estimate on a tax amount or collection mechanism. Thus, once more, an idea sinks into the pits of Iberian government and is forever lost."
 IBR.32.a:0 "An absurd display."
 
 IBR.33:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Distribution"
 IBR.33.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Distribution"
 IBR.33.d:0 "The grand debate on taxation has finally come around to where, precisely, the money from a federal tax would go. There are numerous proposals, such as corporate subsidies, business stimulus, the Gibraltar Dam, and military expansion. However, neither party is willing to give up on their own interests. As the fifth day of debate concludes, the only concession made is a solitary funding break for increasing the budget of the Moroccan police force."
 IBR.33.a:0 "That was a necessary consensus!"
 
 IBR.34:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Collection Authority"
 IBR.34.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Collection Authority"
 IBR.34.d:0 "As with all things in Iberia, the worst has yet to come, for now is the time to debate the federal tax collection authority. For reasons related to regional autonomy, this issue has been heavily debated, and a conclusion was unable to be reached.\n\nA conclusion was still not reached. Equal expansion of Spanish and Portuguese tax collection agencies was shot down by Salazar, as the change would require cross-regional jurisdiction to be given to tax collectors purchasing regionally taxed goods in the other region. A strong federal tax authority was also shot down, as it was determined to not have enough force backing it up in the case of tax evasion. Due to this gridlock, the tiny tax collection agency of Iberia appears that it will stay dysfunctional..."
 IBR.34.a:0 "The absurd becomes the usual."
 
 IBR.35:0 "Military Debate - Military Training Funding"
 IBR.35.t:0 "Military Debate - Military Training Funding"
 IBR.35.d:0 "In general, while our militaries are fairly overfunded, our training sector is extremely weak. Routinely, there is not enough ammunition to properly be used in training camps, and shot-count limitations have to be imposed on trainees. This issue was brought up between the Caudillos, and miraculously passed - almost. An issue with funding for various training camps being biased towards Spanish locations lead to the infamous Portuguese veto being applied, and a furious bout of argument in the chamber. Franco accused Salazar of wanting the Germans to be able to take Iberia easily, and nearly had to be restrained physically."
 IBR.35.a:0 "As if there wasn't enough tension already."
 
 IBR.36:0 "Military Debate - Funding Allocation"
 IBR.36.t:0 "Military Debate - Funding Allocation"
 IBR.36.d:0 "The state of the Iberian Army is objectively awful. That, no party can deny. However, when the time comes to potentially resolve that, the consensus breaks down.\n\nToday, in A Coruña, the negotiations for increased funding to the Iberian Army broke down in spectacular fashion, as bickering military commanders from the Spanish and Portuguese Armies flooded the stage with papers stating that their funding was far more important. As the Caudillos accept these claims, it appears that the Iberian Army shall once more be sidelined."
 IBR.36.a:0 "Hopefully, the Germans won't invade any time soon."
 
 IBR.37:0 "Military Debate - Standard Equipment"
 IBR.37.t:0 "Military Debate - Standard Equipment"
 IBR.37.d:0 "With the state of the Iberian army out of the way, the time has come to review the army equipment. Since the end of the Second World War, Spain's main weapons providers were Germany and Italy, and with the formation of the Iberian Union, it's clear that Spain cannot keep relying on Germany despite the success of the Bär Program of 1943.\n\nHowever, Italy is not in the best position to continue supplying our under-equipped army, and many officers from both armies have stated their opinions on the subject, with two clear major groups coming out on top in the discussions. One of them advocates for the continuation of Italian weapon imports for as long as they can be relied on, and then switching to another major weapons producer if necessary, and another faction advocating for the expansion of the rather small Spanish Arms industry, mainly based around small-time workshops rather than fully blown companies for now. As the Caudillos analyze their options, it is clear that continuing imports it's the simplest and cheapest solution."
 IBR.37.a:0 "Let's hope the Italians still have their guns on the cheap."
 
 IBR.38:0 "Military Debate - Drill Sergeant Language"
 IBR.38.t:0 "Military Debate - Drill Sergeant Language"
 IBR.38.d:0 "With the many attempts of standarizing the army drills, a major issue has been brought up to the Caudillos: The many recruits don't speak the same language as their squadmates from different regions.\n\nThis has sparked a debate on whether or not the soldiers should be split into squads from the same region with separate drill instructors, with the support of Salazar, or trying to maintain and reinforce the current system which tries to force bilingualism through down to a squad level, which is advocated by Franco after his attempts of unifying the culturally diverse Spanish Army during the Spanish Civil War. As neither seems to budge on their position, it seems like the status quo will continue."
 IBR.38.a:0 "Well, at least the drill will be educative for those who only speak one language."
 
 IBR.39:0 "Minorities Debate - Anti-Separatist Agency"
 IBR.39.t:0 "Minorities Debate - Anti-Separatist Agency"
 IBR.39.d:0 "The Iberian Union currently enforces total equality between the two forming states, Spain and Portugal. This however, forgets one of the most basic issues that Spain has to deal with since it's inception, and that's the split between the very different and even opposing cultural groups that form Spain as a country in the first place. Many of those groups, like the Basques or the Galicians saw the Portuguese as a separate entity for centuries, but now that they're all in the same union and the Portuguese are given special treatment while they are still treated as part of the heavily Castillean-dominated Spain where they feel their desires are not represented, rallies and riots against the government have become common throughout the years.\n\nThis is turning more and more into a large issue as many regions have seceded in the past, with an attempt of the Basque and Catalonia to break off in the 30s, and those attempts have both Caudillos worried that further separatism may break the Union apart. With their combined effort, they have devised a new institution for Spain, the 'Axencia Anti-Separatista' which will answer directly to them and will deal mostly with discrediting propaganda and direct supression of separatist movements."
 IBR.39.a:0 "Unbelievable that they agree for once."
 
 IBR.40:0 "Minorities Debate - African Languages"
 IBR.40.t:0 "Minorities Debate - African Languages"
 IBR.40.d:0 "With the growth of our African possessions after the Second World War, we are now faced with the rather difficult challenge of integrating the regions into our mighty country. One of the first and obvious issues we need to solve first in order to correctly integrate it is the status of the African languages in them. Iberia currently owns large regions with Tamazight, Shilha, Rifian and Seghroucheni Berber-Arab sub-languages, which are clearly incompatible with the latinized Spanish and Portuguse languages.\n\nBoth Caudillos argue harshly on this, as both countries have had very different colonial policies in the past in regards to language. Salazar argues that the Union should enforce the language policy of the Portuguese Empire of old, forcing Portuguese through all stages of public life for the colonies, while Franco argues for the old Spanish Colonial approach where natives can keep their languages but can only hold public posts and take part in their local government if they speak Spanish. Both Caudillos are pushing for each's languages and in the end, the discussion turned so rabid that the end result was a simple, but at the same time, underwhelming compromise: Both Portuguese and Spanish will be taught in the region, and the administration will be handled in both languages in order to encourage its use, but it will also try to push for both to be used in the private sphere."
 IBR.40.a:0 "Two administrative languages? Let's hope this doesn't bite us in the long run."
 
 IBR.41:0 "Minorities Debate - Iberian Minority Languages"
 IBR.41.t:0 "Minorities Debate - The Status of Iberian Minority Languages"
 IBR.41.d:0 "The Iberian minority languages are the strange result of artificial kingdoms and caliphates being slowly integrated into Castille and Aragón, causing the Iberian peninsula to be a complete linguistic mess where two provinces can hardly communicate with each other without the help of Castilian Spanish as the lingua franca. However, many people in these regions cannot communicate in Portuguese as well as they can in Castilian Spanish, and it's slowly turning into a huge issue as both Spain and Portugal lean ever closer together.\n\nSalazar has demanded that Franco change the official languages in each region in order to accommodate the new status of Portugal, with Portugese language being enforced in regions such as Catalonia and Galicia just like Castilian Spanish. Franco has disagreed, arguing that such a move would only cause the regionalist movements to spark back to life, each of them trying to claim the same linguistic rights as Portugal.\n\nThe Debate has ultimately ended with a tie, with both agreeing that maybe switching Castillian Spanish for Galician might be a better choice since it's a language that's relatively intelligible for all regions, but that it shall just be used for administrative purposes and the press, while the private spheres of life in the regions shall not be affected."
 IBR.41.a:0 "Let's hope those Galicians don't get cocky just because we chose their language."
 
 IBR.42:0 "Minorities Debate - Status of Rio de Oro"
 IBR.42.t:0 "Minorities Debate - Status of Rio de Oro"
 IBR.42.d:0 "Rio de Oro has been a colony of Spain for quite some time now, and is currently the oldest owned foreign territory of our country. While the creation of the Union has set back the integration of the Rio de Oro into Spain proper, the lack of native opposition and the swift progress of infrastructure works in the region has made Franco confident that it can be easily incorporated into the Union as a proper state.\n\nThis however, did not sit well with Salazar. The area is mostly Spanish speaking, with the introduction of Portuguese being very recent and very limited. Salazar fears that Franco plans to incorporate the colony not to the Union but to Spain proper and force once again Spanish hegemony over the rest of the region. Having all of his integration proposals blocked off by a relentless Salazar, Franco has decided to back off for now from integrating Rio de Oro until the province is able to be integrated under joint administration between Portugal and Spain."

 IBR.43.d:0 "Spain has been left in charge of the Atlantropa project for some time now, and mainting the dam itself as a whole has been severely damaging for our country. This has led to the final decision years ago that the Union would cover for the expenses of vital repairs, but would refuse to pay for normal maintenance, which would run at the hands of the Triumvirate.\n\nAs our policy remains the same, both Franco and Salazar have their concerns with different regions of the dam. The internal workings of its system are starting to rot, and the risk of them collapsing sooner or later seems to be ever growing if our government doesn't pay for its replacement. On the other hand, the conditions of the technicians that work on the dam to keep it working are also severely threatened. While our manpower is plentiful for the dam, our technical experts are hard to come by, and even more those brave enough that wish to work on Atlantropa. After some short discussions and some interjections with some high ranking members of the maintenance crew of the dams, both Caudillos have decided they will increase the spending in the working conditions for the Technical experts in order to provide them with a safer work enviroment, as to not risk running out of manpower in a moment of need."

While the Union has kept the demand covered until now by hiring a lot of state workers, the dangerous working conditions, relatively low pay and even lower prospects of professional growth has forced us to severely rethink the way we handle our workforce on the dam.\n\nWhile Salazar has proposed to continue using cheap workforce, Franco has come up with a better solution: conscripting criminals for them to work on the dam in exchange for their liberation in ten years time. According to Franco, they'd be able to import prisoners other countries want to 'dispose of', and would be able to tackle the expenses of this new penitentiary system by providing for the basic livelihood of said criminals. While Salazar believes this will be detrimental in the long run as it allows dangerous criminals to be absolved from guilt, Franco has reassured him that hardly anyone will be able to survive those ten years of work, and that the expenses of maintance would be cut by 30% in doing so. With both Caudillos agreeing in the end, Franco's proposal will come into effect and the workforce in the dam shall be progressively replaced by criminal conscripts."

With the ever increasing expenditure in its maintenance, the Caudillos have been looking for a way to make the dam profitable for years.\n\nA new proposal has managed to reach the Caudillos recently, consisting of a scheme devised by architect and engineer Pedro Martínez Ayola to reform a series of sectors in the dam to produce hydroelectric power. However, the cost of his project is huge, and just the maintenance of the dam is a risky and slow endeavor. However, both Caudillos have agreed that the expansion will be necessary in the long run, so both are willing to start preparations for those modifications to begin. However, it should be noted that said modifications affect core sections of the dam, and the high risk of reforming these areas may lead to a higher casualty rate than usual in the maintenance crew."

The first meeting consisted of determining how and why the Iberian Council will be created and the Caudillos have already disagreed on some things.\n\nEven though both Caudillos agree that the Council should be small at first and grow with time, the growing speed of the Council is one of the things they disagree with; while Franco thinks the growth should be slow so that the power balance remains steady and doesn't unexpectedly shift hands, Salazar wants the growth to be as quick as possible to try avoiding the bureaucratic pain the slow growth rate would cause. This matter was debated for far longer than expected but the meeting finally ended.\n\nBoth Caudillos left the meeting happy because they agreed on the fact that the Iberian Council was going to be created 'for the benefit of the Iberian people' even though that was not what they called the meeting for and no news of the establishment debate have been revealed."

 IBR.52.d:0 "One of the hottest issues when it comes to the formation of the Iberian Council is who is represented there and how they should be represented and as with most things, Franco and Salazar have different opinions on the matter.\n\nFranco stated that the Council should be based on what he considers are the three natural parts of society: the family, where one is born; the town, where one lives and the syndicate, where one works. Salazar opposed this and instead proposed that the Council should be filled with members chosen with an odd pyramidal system. Franco's difficulty to understand Salazar's unique choosing method together with Salazar's frontal denial of Franco's proposal made sure that the meeting lasted much longer than it was intended to.\n\nAfter much explaining Franco finally understood Salazar's sytem, which he then vetoed before calling of the meeting.

Of course, as with most things, the Caudillos are deeply divided in this matter.\n\nFranco proposed that his own residence, the Royal Palace of El Pardo should be the meeting place but Salazar then proposed his own estate to host the Council. This conversation then transformed into an argument to see whose residence was better before turning into a string of insults to the other's. The matter was finally dropped and the debate moved to the proposals of hosting the Council in either the Palacio de las Cortes or the Sao Bento Palace with each proposal being defended by Franco and Salazar respectively and followed a pattern similar to the private residence proposal, arguing which one is better before deciding to insult the other building.\n\nThe meeting was called off but both Caudillos say they are still analyzing options.

This veto situation was the matter debated today for the formation of the Iberian Council.\n\nFranco proposed that veto powers should be reserved for himself and Salazar, but Salazar unsurprisingly said no to this and proposed that a proposal could only be vetoed if the number of members of the council who decided to veto it was higher than the number of those that didn't want to veto it. Franco then refuted Salazar's argument asking if those members who voted blank would simply be ignored. This spiralled out of control and ended up being a heated philosophical debate of what is a veto and whether a veto could be nullified if it was discovered it was motivated to harm the Iberian people rather than help them.\n\nAt the end nothing was agreed on, so we must expect the veto powers will remain in the hands of the Caudillos, at least for now."

The meeting was headed by Franco and Salazar and the most important subject were debated there.\n\nThe situation in Germany was the first point in the agenda and this led to a very lengthy and heated discussion as many members believe that the German paranoia is baseless since Germany has demonstrated once and again their total lack of planning for the future and that any threats to Iberia are prone to dissapear soon after they begin; but a minority thinks that even if the Germans aren't the best planners they can be quick to make moves and that could harm Iberia.\n\nThe other point to be debated was the way to fix the Iberian economy and if the German debate was heated, this one almost made the room explode. Council members are deeply divided in this issue and they aren't willing to listen to other proposals that aren't their own, so the debate transformed into a full fight between some of the members and the Caudillos had to be escorted out of the room.\n\nEven though this fight wasn't known outside the room, the press has already started writing stories about what could have happened in there and this has both Franco and Salazar enraged, who have decided that there will always be a couple of Guardia Civiles in the room to watch over the members and to avoid future fights, members aren't allowed to go in groups larger than three in the halls of the Palace of Congress."

Everyone knows that the Iberian government is divided into several factions, all bickering for more control and influence, and some of them even willing to go so far as to openly disagree with the Caudillos. To prevent the Council from being drowned by this poisonous factionalism, Salazar had the idea of stuffing the Council with members that blindly supported him and Franco. Surprisingly, Franco agreed to this.\n\nHowever, this plan for disproportionate representation has come at a cost. Many members of government have protested that the Iberian Council isn't fully proportional and that some "sectors'' have more representation than others. Of course, when asked about these "sectors" most of the complainers fall silent, since the factionalism that grips the government is a deeply taboo subject which the Caudillos have tried to keep behind closed doors.\n\nUntil someone is brave enough to speak up, the Caudillos can seat back and relax knowing that the members of the Council support them and their decisions."

Among the many articles it contained, one of its most well known ones stated that both Caudillos, Francisco Franco and Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, held supreme power over the country and that no other institution or person could share this supreme power with them.\n\nWhen the Iberian Council was formed, few paid much attention to whether its establishment was in line with this article or the constitution as a whole. Yet a recent article in the press has shed light on this issue, arguing that the establishment of the Iberian Council constitutes a breach of the Iberian constitution, and suggests that the Caudillos intentionally avoided bringing up a constitutional alteration as it could decrease their own powers.\n\nThe Caudillos have responded by announcing that they would rectify the discrepancy and alter the constitution. A very extravagant public ceremony was organized in Madrid in which Franco and Salazar, both in their best suits, officially changed the constitution and added the Iberian Council to it. This ceremony is already being satirized in the press with Franco and Salazar depicted pouring correction fluid over the article and rewriting it with a ball-point pen. The sketch has already become an enduring image of Iberia's brief constitution crisis."

 IBR.70.d:0 "As Salazar said in his speech when the Council was created, the members of the Council have to perform their duty to their utmost ability... or else.\n\nHowever, due to lackadaisical habits of the Iberian people, this is hardly the case. The Council members are obligated to present themselves at nine o'clock in the morning from Monday to Friday at the Palace of Parliament and work there until five in the afternoon. Yet at least two or three members are always late and present excuses like "The alarm clock didn't go off", "I couldn't find my suitcase", "Excuse me, I am still accustomed to Lisbon time" and other such nonsense. The members are also given the privilege of a one hour lunch break between 14:00 and 15:00. However when it's time to return from lunchtime, several members arrive last. Many of them go to have lunch at home "because nobody cooks like my wife," and use the commute as an excuse for their tardiness. Some have even be discovered having a quick nap in a broom closet during their lunch break, before returning, late of course, to work.\n\nThis situation has the Caudillos furious, as they thought the Council members would throw themselves into the work with vigour, yet have sadly discovered that they possess the same muted work ethic as most Iberians. To put an end to this, the Caudillos have dispatched members of the Guardia Civil to "escort" the members to and from work and keep them in check, but it's just a matter of time before their police escorts are found napping away in a closet or eating at home with one of the members because "his wife really is a great cook".

However, the portraits in this room have appeared painted a couple of times with moustaches on them, which isn't really that funny because Franco already has a moustache. There have also been some anonymous reports of Council members insulting the Caudillos with names like "dwarf" for Franco and "damn Portuguese" for Salazar. This has reached the attention of the Caudillos. Some are trying to defend the Council members by saying that these situations are caused because of the stress they suffer and that they don't really mean it, but the Caudillos won't listen.\n\nTo enforce the respect of every Council member, the Caudillos will do a surprise inspection once every week, and every time an anonymous report is filled about members of the Council insulting one or both Caudillos and no culprit can be found, all the Council will be punished. These measures will make the Council members respect the Caudillos, or at least we must hope so."

One such incident involved a physical confrontation between two Council members after one insulted the mother of the other Councilor.\n\nTo remedy this issue, the Caudillos have decided to allow "elections" for Council members.

He has been heard bragging that all representatives from Portugal are loyal, saying that a good leader would have no trouble with some pesky politicians.\n\nTo this end, Franco has come up with several options. Those representatives found to be especially rebellious would be removed and jailed for treason. This move might cause more problems that it would fix, but Franco will be in absolute control. There is, of course, the softer approach. Franco can decide to simply recall problematic representatives if they sir too much trouble and replace them with ones more loyal to him."

 IBR.405.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 IBR.405.d:0 "The German Reich, once thought to last a thousand years, is in peril. Adolf Hitler's death has lead to various pretenders to the throne, quickly turning Germany into a battleground. Many of our citizens, and indeed most of our government, believes that the best course of action would be not to get involved. After all, Germany eating itself alive gives us the valuable opportunity to focus on our own affairs without worrying about imminent invasion.\n\nThe esteemed Caudillo, however, has other plans.\n\nFrancisco Franco believes we could potentially come out much stronger by involving ourselves in the affairs of the civil war, at least to a certain extent. He has proposed two ways we can do this, the first being sending some aid to Albert Speer's faction, in hopes that we may gain a powerful ally when this is all over. The second option, which Franco seems to personally prefer, is simply to sell guns and supplies to each side, making enough of a profit to fix our economic woes.\n\nIt seems that to maximize efficiency, it would be in our best interests to put our effort into only one option, as we dont have the resources to stretch ourselves between the two. But surely, with the guidance of the Caudillos, our intervention in the German Civil War can only turn out well."
 IBR.405.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"
 
 IBR.406.t:0 "Money Talks!"
 IBR.406.d:0 "For once, the Caudillos have come to an agreement. Speer has a very slim chance of winning, and even if he does through our aid, it's not exactly good praxis to help out the nation responsible for ruining up our economy in the first place. If we're going to get involved, we should at least get something out of it.\n\nWhile they debated who to sell equipment to, Salazar came up with a brilliant idea: just sell as much as we can to as many sides are as willing to buy. By simple math, this would quadruple our potential profits and provide us with enough currency to get our economy back into shape, which will hopefully solve other issues down the line.\n\nSome in the government, as per usual, worry that this whole act of "playing all sides against" each other is morally dubious. Moreover, they worry that if one faction finds out, it is quite possible we will face not only diplomatic condemnation but also sanctions, something Iberia can ill afford. Fortunately, our Caudillos are brilliant leaders, and surely they have an excellent plan in mind."

 IBR.408.t:0 "Our Path To Profit"
 IBR.408.d:0 "The idea of playing all sides while staying hidden has ultimately proven appealing to most within our government. In part due to anti-German sentiment, and definitely not because they were pressured into agreeing with the Caudillos out of fear of their own safety. A plan of attack has been drawn up, strategizing what items to sell, and where to sell them.\n\nObviously, Goering is going to be our biggest buyer, so he will be prioritized, and likely the source of the plurality of our profits. Not only does he control a lot of territory, which comes with a lot of troops, but as a diehard militarist he's bound to be grabbing guns even when he doesn't need them. Bormann is second priority, as he controls a lot of territory himself but is a little more reserved. Many feel safe in discounting Speer, but his army is rather sparse, so profit could be made there too. Hell, even Heydrich might be willing to buy some of our stuff, though admittedly he's lowest on the priority list.\n\nNow, with the plans set out, only one issue remains. The fact of the matter is that we cant sell our weapons to all sides, at least not directly. We're going to need to find a middleman. But who among the nations of the world is willing to dive this deep into the black market?"
 IBR.408.a:0 "We'll make them an offer they can't refuse."
 
 IBR.409.t:0 "Sending The Goods To Brittany"
 IBR.409.d:0 "As it turns out, we only really have one option when it comes to black market deals of this magnitude: Brittany. Sticking out of both France and the Greater German Reich like a sore thumb in more ways than one, this little nation has gathered quite a reputation in its ability to smuggle all sorts of forbidden things into Germany and its territories. And as luck would have it, Breton agents within our country have heard of our predicament, and are willing to help us out.\n\nNow, granted, this comes with its share of risks. In addition to Brittany being home to some very unsavory figures, pirates, rogues, and the like, using them as a middleman means we need to add another layer of secrecy. Surely, if other countries, or even if our own citizens, get wind of us consorting with black market dealers, they would think less of us. But as long as everybody stays quiet, we should have no problems making a profit."
 IBR.409.a:0 "Dangerous games..."
 
 IBR.410.t:0 "A Leak?"
 IBR.410.d:0 "Ever vigilant, it is the accountant who first catches an air of trouble. Looking through the various papers where transactions are recorded, he realizes something is quite wrong, the numbers don't make sense. Not what's going out, mind you, but what's coming in, there's far far too little considering what we've been sending out.\n\nAn investigation by other accountants confirms this, and the matter is brought up to the Caudillos themselves. Franco and Salazar comb through the findings themselves, and are absolutely aghast to discover that so little money has come back to us. They soon realize that there's only one explanation: our middleman dealers in Brittany are smuggling off both goods and profits, leaving only a trickle to come back to us.\n\n"You utter baffoon!" cries Salazar, "When you told me we were going to sell to all sides, you assured me you had found reputable markets to push our goods through!"\n\nThe Castillien dictator stammers, a mix of anger and confusion in his voice. "I can assure you, I...WE thought we ha-"\n\n"Brittany is literally the OPPOSITE of reputable!" his counterpart interrupts. "This level of blithering idiocy from your administration is exa-"\n\n"Now wait just a minute! Who are you calling-"\n\nThus, as per usual, the joint dictators began yet another argument, spewing insults and threats at each other late into the night for all to hear. And though they eventually gave up yelling at each other in order to sleep, the problems still remain. Our black market dealers have double crossed us, and we have wasted valuable time and assets attempting to reach Germany through them."
 IBR.410.a:0 "Damned Pirates!"
 
 IBR.411.t:0 "Marking Up Prices"
 IBR.411.d:0 "Obviously, we only have a limited number of goods to sell around, and thus simple math tells us that there's a limited profit to be gained at the moment. We COULD actually put in some effort for once, and ramp up our equipment production so that we can turn in a profit, but Francisco Franco has a far better idea.\n\nRather than producing four times the goods, we'll get the same amount of money with a quarter of the effort if we just quadruple the prices. They get their guns, Iberia gets a profit, everybody wins. Mostly us, anyways. Of course, some in the government, Salazar included, believe that if we jack up the prices too much nobody will buy from us, but they have forgotten to factor in how desperate each of the German factions are for more equipment. Surley, they will be willing to shill out some extra cash in this hour of need."
 IBR.411.a:0 "How could we fail?"
 
 IBR.412.t:0 "Offering Military Grade Weapons"
 IBR.412.d:0 "Even by raising the prices to ridiculous amounts, we still don't have enough equipment to turn a meaningful profit. Sure, we could actually make enough arms and supplies to earn a meaningful amount of money in the process, but that would take actual hard work. However, once again there seems to be an easier way around this.\n\nAs it turns out, we still have plenty of Triumvirate equipment that we... borrowed from Italy. Since it's very doubtful that they're going to try and take it back, why not make some use of it by selling it to the Germans? With all this stuff sitting in reserve, we're likely to make nearly double what was projected.\n\nOf course, once again the worrywarts in government are raising concerns. Salazar in particular thinks that this is a bad idea as "we don't actually have that much Triumvirate reserves" and "we have no idea if it even works properly or not". Even if it's not in the best condition, it's not like the buyers are going to know about it until they've already paid for it."
 IBR.412.a:0 "The Italians won't miss them."
 
 IBR.413.t:0 "Fading Profits?"
 IBR.413.d:0 "In theory, our two-pronged approach of raising prices while digging for extra guns would have increased profits immensely. It was clever, ingenious even. But unfortunately, this being Iberia, nothing ever goes according to plan.\n\nThe Caudillos got a rather rude awakening around noon today when the most recent profit reports came back...and were almost entirely unchanged from the last one. In fact, a quick look back at previous reports shows that our antics haven't made a lick of difference. These results, to say the least, have baffled both our ministers and Franco, who were positive that quadrupling prices would mean quadruple profit, and not result in crashing demand.\n\nFurious by the incompetence from his Spanish counterpart, a meeting between the Caudillos today resulted in Salazar quickly losing all patience. "You simple-minded idiot!" he screams, ripping up some important documents out of sheer anger, "What foul witchery drove you to such ludicrously poor judgement?"\n\n"In my defense," stammers Franco, "it seemed like a good idea at the ti-"\n\n"Oh, so it SEEMED like a good idea, very nice! Sure, you acted without any oversight from the Portuguese government and made errors that are leaving our economists alternating between shaking their heads and laughing uncontrollably, but I guess since it SEEMED good everything's peachy, huh!?"\n\n"That's entirely unfair! At least I'm actually coming up with ideas! I didn't see you brainstorming any way to profit off the civil war! Sure, some poor decisions were made, but at least I acted!"\n\n"If the choice is between inaction and acting like an imbecile, I choose the former!"\n\nAs with many others, this argument between the Caudillos carried on for several hours, ending with nothing accomplished but a lot of hot air being blown around. Regardless, it seems that Iberia's schemes have failed to pay off, in both senses of the word, and may have made our economy even worse for wear."

 #Heydrich's Tree
 IBR.76.t:0 "Heydrich Wins The German Civil War!"
 IBR.76.d:0 "Terrible news has reached the Iberian peninsula, the German Civil War was finally over, its last contender standing was Reinhard Heydrich, a secretive, ideologically driven monster of a man. The initial jubilant reaction to the more immediate threat of a rampaging Goering having been defeated has been replaced by a thoughtful, uneasy silence in our nation. Now there was only a dark stain in the center of Europe, ready to swallow its poor, weary citizens and drag them into the abyss just like it did with the other, at least human, Führer contenders. Heydrich, the blonde beast, the hangman, now sat in a ruined Germania, his plans unknown, just like his equally elusive counterpart in Burgundy. Panic has stricken certain parts of our nation, the German refugees who had escaped the horrors of the Civil War and the SS being especially distraught by the news. The church also seemingly was recoiling in horror at the news. Attendance for mass in the immediate days after Heydrich's victory proclamation rose dramatically, yet no real answers could be given to the terror stricken people. Frantic public officials and other authority figures tried to give calming reassurances to the population stratas that were terrified at the development in Germany using propaganda and speeches, yet their own unease and lack of knowledge on the handling of this crisis hindered their use ultimately. A few dissenting clergymen advocated that these were the end days, God's last test for humanity before he would come to lead us into salvation, but these doomsayers were quickly taken away from any official positions when the reports of their wrongdoings reached the police, most not to be heard of again and certainly not the last of the desperate who would befall to this fate. In these dark times, the only certainty, in relation to the future of Europe and therefore Iberia, was uncertainty. "
 IBR.76.a:0 "Merciful God, forgive us for our sins..."

 IBR.77.t:0 "The Panicked Commanders"
 IBR.77.d:0 "The news of Heydrich's victory evidently did not just worry those who understood the darkness of the beasts ideology; military commanders and officers in all of the Iberian armed forces were exceedingly panicking about the battle hardened and extremely disciplined SS becoming Germany's primary armed forces, no longer restricted by the Wehrmacht and the NSDAP leadership. Our enlightened, civilian leadership however seems far less on edge, their expert political analysts having predicted that Germany would spend a vast amount of time, impossible to judge at this moment, recovering from the Civil War, and be far less powerful due to the collapse of their sphere at the end of it. Any plans the reticent hangman of Prague might have would be limited to the admittedly poor German populace that had to suffer his rule. However not all in government seemed to share this view, some took the worries of the military quite seriously indeed, even when they recognized the factual evidence of the political situation in the center of Europe. Chief amongst these was Caudillo Salazar, who had always despised the Nazis as being paganistic barbarians. For him, Heydrich and his twisted ideology represented a darker if not as obvious threat as Goering did. Which faction was to be proven correct in their estimation of Germany's threat to Iberia would only be determined by time, yet it did not harm for the military to be prepared for any unexpected circumstances. "
 IBR.77.a:0 "Calm down and make a plan!"

 IBR.80.t:0 "Guarding The Dam"
 IBR.80.d:0 "Yesterday, during one of the short, regular meetings with senior military and naval personnel that Caudillo Salazar had requested since Heydrich's seizure of ultimate power in Germany, following his victory over the other Führer candidates in a civil war that had drained the once proud German nation, both of the Caudillos were informed of the necessity to reinforce military presence at the Gibraltar dam. One of the navy commanders spoke gravely about the woeful shortcomings of the defence around the dam, how simple it would be scuttle the current naval installations and ships stationed near Gibraltar for a military power such as Germany. A military commander interjected with corroborating evidence that it was unlikely that if the Germans were to assault Iberia that they would cross the mountainous Pyrenees, and would more likely commence a major naval invasion of one of the weaker port regions of the peninsula or strike right at the dam, which for then was a symbol of lost prestige. Caudillo Salazar was listening intently, noting down all the information that the advisors were giving him while Franco sat back looking dazed and bored. For him there was no chance the weakened Germans would ever be capable again to pose a serious threat to the empire he and Salazar had built, yet as a military man himself he could hardly argue against the necessity of careful advanced planning, so for once when Salazar proposed to deepen defence around the dam he did not oppose his Portuguese counterpart. 
 IBR.80.a:0 "Let's hope it's enough."

 IBR.81.t:0 "Pumping Up The Military"
 IBR.81.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar's deepening paranoia since Heydrich's victory was not going unnoticed to Franco. The Portuguese statesman was beginning to speak the language of the dictator of Spain, who in a not so distant life had been a brilliant general. Salazar was proposing spending more of the yearly budget on defence, building up the Iberian forces to a standard that they could be considered a deadly force to be reckoned with, not just target practice for the disciplined, dangerous SS. Franco allowed a brief smile during their meeting, something he could rarely afford with his constant squabbling with his fellow Caudillo, as he lightly slapped Salazar's back in a friendly fashion. He assured the Portuguese that if he desired to expand the land and naval forces of the union he would not oppose him during the council, rather he would enthusiastically encourage the idea, giving a speech to accompany the proposal. The relief that began to spread across Salazar's face disconcerted Franco slightly, he did not understand why the fiercely intelligent Caudillo would be so worried about a destroyed nation, however he did not question it as they then returned to normal disagreement on the next matter of state."
 IBR.81.a:0 "Who cares if it's sustainable?"

 IBR.82.t:0 "Unity Against The External Threat"
 IBR.82.d:0 "In an unprecedented move of unity both Caudillos announced during a recent council meeting that in the face of the immense external danger an SS run Germany could pose to Iberias unity and quite frankly survival, that both wanted to depend the solidarity that the Iberian peoples felt towards one another. Therefore propaganda tools during the upcoming weeks should be focusing on painting a beautiful picture of a splendid union of equals, united in diversity against the uniform collectivism the Nazis would impose on a conquered Iberia. The surprised council members left the conference room in a dreamlike state, both terrified of the nature of the message that been imparted on them but also the unprecedented cooperation between both Caudillos. Little did they know that Salazar had to compromise with his Spanish counterpart in a fashion that rather went against his personal principles but had to be done to deal with the threat he knew would come in time, if not in his lifetime then in the next. He agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Francos suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity. Anything was better than falling to  the darkness bumbling and fermenting in Europe's dark heart, anything, even if it meant agreeing with his gruff fellow Caudillo."

We must renew the old Pyrenees Line immediately. In order to do so, we will initiate several inspections along the line, replace built-in artillery, and ensure that the logistical problems involved with running heavy artillery and armor in the mountains are maximized for a potential threat, yet minimized for our purposes.\n\nIf the Germans come, we will be ready for them."

One of the most notable of these was their aerial bombing operations, which legendarily crippled the industrial capacity of any nation that drew their ire. The fearful capabilities of the Luftwaffe can be seen in the desolation of western Africa following the Second World War, and the bombing operations that turned Russia from a respectable power into an anarchic wasteland. Thus, in order to avoid meeting this fate ourselves, a means of protecting our civilians is necessary.\n\nThis means shall come in the form of the humble air raid siren. While not capable of directly protecting our industry, they would give ample time to our citizens to get to shelters, and for various cities' garrisons to get anti-aircraft systems online. Until we can revolutionize our air force and meet the modern standards demanded by our potential opponents, this stopgap measure will have to do."

While Müller is slightly more reasonable than the Reichskommissars that seized the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa, he still presents the same mortal threat that any agent of the Reich does, simply by existing on our borders.\n\nAdditionally, with the formation of the Afrika Schild and the South African War, it is extremely evident that the Reichskommissars will not hestitate to expand wantonly into any territory that takes their fancy. Therefore, our at-risk colony must be fortified as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. While its risky position and the appalling state of our economy will present challenges in this sector, there's nothing that a few honeyed words, promises of freedom, and 'volunteer' labor cannot solve, when it comes to the field of construction. Hopefully, when the endeavor is over, the Reichskommissars will choose a different target, and kindly leave us alone."
 IBR.88.a:0 "Our time has come."
 
 IBR.89.t:0 "Silence the Saber"
 IBR.89.d:0 "Now that our more urgent preparations are complete, it is time to finally put an end to Bormann's sabre-rattling... by rattling our own sabre back! We shall hold an enormous military exercise in the far western Pyrenees, simulating a potential German invason from the French border. While the plans for this exercise existed before, it has been heavily altered to reflect the loss of the Triumvirate as dependable allies in wartime. Still, even without Italian naval support, armored divisions, and supplemental airpower, the display is sure to be enough to make Bormann turn his head towards a weaker neighbor.\n\nThe festivities shall occur over a week-long period, and be attended personally by both Caudillos. Elements from every wing of the Iberian armed forces shall be present, from the federal army, to the Portuguese Army, to the Spanish Army, to Guardia Civil units being used as reserves. Two full tank divisions, the majority of Iberia's armor corps, shall be deployed in advanced maneuvers in the foothills of the Pyrenees, while split elements of the Spanish and Portuguese armies shall serve as the federal army's opposing force in the mountains themselves. To prevent foreign interference, a massive deployment of military policemen and elements of the AAS shall stand in support.\n\nAs a bonus, since the exercise is occuring within the Basque-populated region of Iberia, it could serve to shock the problematic ETA into lying low for a while..."

 IBR.90.d:0 "The whole political world of Iberia was in chaotic uproar, entire ministries in utter pandemonium, with civil servants rushing from meeting to meeting, each more depressing than the last in its tone and content.\n\nThe disastrous news that had reached them this morning from Germany had awakened an ice cold terror in many a strong man. Göring, the proud, fat oaf, who had had the immense backing of most Wehrmacht personnel, was now the new Führer of the destroyed Reich, now but an army with a half functioning state. He had vanquished his opponents in hellfire, carving a deep scar into Germany, one that was unlikely to heal soon if ever. The unwavering militarist was likely already crafting extensive plans for foreign policy escapades with his hawkish advisors, while all around him ordinary people were suffering abject poverty and devastation.\n\nAn emergency council meeting had been called when the official declaration of victory had come from Germania, both Caudillos fearful of the danger that may soon face Europe and Iberia. Salazar seemingly had first been surprisingly joyous that it was not Heydrich who had climbed the iron throne of the Reich, but he also shared his Spanish counterparts apprehension of what an openly militaristic Germany could symbolise for their future. Their only hope was that the Reich still needed time to repair and prepare its offensive forces. If we act quickly we might be able to hold off the Germanic horde when it comes."
 IBR.90.a:0 "We must prepare, fast!"
 
 IBR.91.t:0 "The Pyrenees Line"
 IBR.91.d:0 "The emergency council meeting concluded with a series of intense measures that were to be undertaken with immediate effect, one of these was the reactivation and expansion of the Pyrenees defensive line. The mobile Germans had proven themselves expert in defeating, or rather avoiding, strong defensive positions in their last European conquest to encircle troop contingents and rush strategic targets.\n\nHowever, times have radically changed. More effective and efficient defensive installations have been invented to compliment that are able to compliment the natural fortification that the Pyrenees Mountains gives our great Peninsula. Even more importantly military analysts have also concluded that the German hordes had enjoyed a great deal of luck in the conquests of France and the lowlands, something we will not allow them to have if they dare knock on our doors. However, some of our high command, especially those who advocate for increased special force use, have warned of naval invasions to try to take key strategic ports or possibly even the vulnerable Gibraltar dam itself. Although not an impossibility we still have deemed the Germans under Göring will prioritize a direct approach."

 IBR.93.t:0 "Fortify Equatorial Africa"
 IBR.93.d:0 "Just a decade ago, the fat Reichsmarschall had had the brilliant idea of seizing the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa, a bold move to consolidate German control in the region during the formation of the vast African Reichskommissariats. One that fit in well with Hitler's intense megalomania. It was what had driven the pragmatically opposed Caudillos in each other's arms in the first place, the starting shot of Iberian unification which Salazar had initially opposed based on sovereignty issues. With the loss of his treasured African colonies however, he had no other choice but to accept Franco's proposals for a united front against the reviled Germans.\n\nNow, the German Civil War was over, and the hated Göring stood victorious over his defeated foes. The expansionist, the military man. In time he would certainly bring the African Reichskommissars back under his jackboot and look to Equatorial Africa as another target. It was a simple assumption to make; therefore one Göring was likely to take into consideration.\n\nDespite the region originally having been a Spanish colony, Salazar was ecstatically pursuing plans to fortify the last Iberian stronghold below the Sahara. For once, for the usually collected Caudillo, this had become a matter of pride and prestige; Franco also not eager to lose what formally was just his colony, did not sit idly by either. Extensive plans for strong fortification lines and subsequent guerilla warfare, once the lines would be breached, were drafted, military high command eager to follow the lead of their Caudillos as they saw the strong strategic use of drawing away more German forces from the European theater. The Nazis would have to fight hard and suffer bitterly for our land in the sun."

Therefore propaganda tools during the upcoming weeks should be focusing on painting a beautiful picture of a splendid union of equals, united in diversity against the painful conflict and conquest that Göring would bring upon Iberia, reminiscent of the horror of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe terrified council members left the conference room in a dreamlike state, both eager to impart the Caudillos message into public policy but also happily shocked by the unprecedented cooperation between both Caudillos. On this matter the two old men had finally come to full agreement, both were too fearful of the danger that was strengthening just beyond the horizon, a bond reforged that first had been set in place by the same man they now again may have to confront. Salazar even agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Franco's s suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity.

 IBR.97.d:0 "An official news broadcast from a ruined but now hopeful Germania was picked up on waiting Iberian airwaves today, both Caudillo Salazar and Franco waiting together for the past few hours for the statement from the Reichstag to finally be pronounced. Speer, the liberal and idol of Germany's youth, has won the German Civil War, a huge sigh of relief could almost be heard coming from all freedom loving peoples of this wretched earth. The Nazi reformer now becoming Führer was seen as a much appreciated shift away from the current dark paradigm that Europe has had to suffer for the last 20 years, conquest and economic ruin being its defining hallmarks. In Iberia this view was shared by the vast majority of the populace, even both Caudillos could for once agree that this was the best possible outcome of that terrible conflict, an outcome with a future that may not have to involve further war and death. The possibility of regained prosperity from trade, bettering of diplomatic relations, finally the chance for Europe to come closer together. After brief celebrations and a short meeting with other senior government officials, the two Caudillos parted ways for now, Salazar leaving with a secretive, yet buoyant grin. If everything went accordingly now and Speer kept to his reformist promises, the Iberian Union may become defunct as a necessary measure of unity against an external threat. Portugal could become independent again, sovereign again, reigned just by the pragmatist, regaining its lost glory. His daydream was almost too perfect, to be free of Franco and his split, mismanaged country. Whether Speer would be able to actually change Europe's oppressive, dark dynamic was yet to be seen, but for once Salazar could finally entertain the idea of hope."

The new Führer was still a national socialist, formerly a devoted, close acolyte of Hitler, one that may talk sense but still a by blood a barbaric German. The idea that Iberia could now relax, possibly even devolve as Salazar hoped for an idealistic future, was not one rooted in the still grotesque reality they had to endure. After initial jubilance even the Portuguese Caudillo became rooted again, adopting his usual composure in the next council meeting. Invited military and economic analysts began to give estimates, derived from close analysis of Germany's material reality and Speers proposed policies, of how long it would take Germany to rebuild and what sort of military capabilities the Iberians would need to prepare for in a worst case scenario. Caudillo Franco, unusually for the aging fighter, was very invested in this meeting, interrupting regularly to ask specific questions on military matters. Salazar, spotting Franco taking charge of the situation in a way he did not appreciate in the slightest began to make equally valid statements on the political and diplomatic motivations Speer may follow, trying to reduce the push for further Iberian military expansion as he viewed this as being an unjustified, aggressive move, one that may produce negative reaction. Underneath his open reasoning, he also was motivated to try to reduce the further integration of the two nations this would create. Surprisingly, the council took Franco's side in this matter, the final decision of the council being to prepare for a worst case possibility, to better be safe than sorry. Salazar retched internally once he left the meeting."

Instead it was greeted with the unusual sight of a rather large contingent of the Iberian navy, both Portuguese and Spanish ships conducting a large scale exercise, a show of strength personally overseen by Caudillo Franco from the shore. The brutish Spaniard had secured this personal vanity project out of his Portuguese counterpart in the recent debate over the Iberian response towards the victory of the liberal reformer Speer in the German Civil War. Salazar, quite fond of the his navy himself, had quickly recognized that the Germans would take little notice of this waste of precious fuel, their attention mainly focused inwards at this moment, any of their little foreign policy decision being in regards to their subjects around the world, and therefore granted his fellow Caudillo's request without much opposition. He needed Franco grateful and ready to compromise with him on more important issues regarding the new diplomatic scene of Europe, but the training also showed him the Portuguese naval capacity, which he also inspected closely from his comfortable viewing platform standing next to Franco. It after all was vital to rebuild the empire he had lost to the marauding Teutons, who it seems now might be finally tamed from their destructive nature."

Or so it would seem for anyone watching the sunburnt manual labourers and military men toiling away endlessly, using man's great ingenuity to further expand the large fortifications that lined the beautiful mountain range on the Southern French border. Again the Iberian council had voted for Franco's gruffly made proposal that had led to the constructions, to the deep and bitter chagrin of Salazar who was getting more impatient with Franco's defensive demands each new meeting. The Spaniard did not seem to run out of ideas. So far the intelligence services had reported nothing that could suggest Speer had untoward desires when it came to Iberia and its peoples. Whether that would change with each new military venture that Franco departed on was yet to be seen. In all honesty, Salazar was not entirely against the fortress installations being built, yet for different reasons to the Spanish Caudillo. He saw a great threat emitting from the former German puppet of Burgundy, the secretive SS state. Any kind of defense against this ominous threat was a welcome one indeed. He therefore has not vetoed this idea either."

 IBR.108.d:0 "In the ever worsening personal conflict between the two contrasting Caudillos over the official Iberian government policy towards the new Reich, the traditional statesman and politician Salazar had finally been able to wrangle a significant concession out of the aging former general. Drawing upon all the previous plans and projects from the Spanish Caudillo that he had not vetoed for the sake of an opportunity like this, the old Portuguese convinced the Spaniard that even if the government's policy will follow one of caution toward the wobbling European hegemon, we should not allow the Germans to see any aggression in our handling of state affairs. Following another debate, this time more of a monologue as Franco had lost interest, it was decided that diplomacy would be initiated with the new regime in Germania, diplomacy on mutual necessity. In other words trade and commerce. It would allow a channel of communication in the possibility of crisis. Through this change in policy it might also be possible to expand the intelligence network we are still building in the ruined country, to ascertain the direction and working of the German government, but for Salazar more importantly it could allow a thawing of previously frozen relations between the two European nations. Like usual, Franco had not been able to object to the ascetic statesman when he had begun his rant. He saw no real danger in pursuing what Salazar proposed but deemed it not useful enough for Iberia, the nation needed a threatening external force to unite against. Looks like he might have to create a new enemy."

Fundamental changes that are likely to cause a maelstrom of death, sucking in unfortunate and guilty souls alike. With the unexpected student coup against Speer, the great reformer figurehead having lost his place in the hearts and minds of the intensely radical members in his faction after allowing his territory to fall into a state of anarchy, the Iberian government prepared for a worse civil war outcome than hoped at the initial outbreak. These almost fantastical turn of events however are far worse than expected. We have no idea what is going to happen now, no idea who the merciless, revenge seeking killers are going to target next once they have finished in Germany, after all they thrive on terror and hatred enacted on anything that represents the current establishment. Europe, in its current state a visual representation of the dark fantasies the Nazis had imagined, was therefore not safe. For the lack of knowledge about the DSR motives, we do know is that the storm clouds on the horizon have now become considerably darker and more destructive. It's likely only a matter of time before they expand outwards of the ruins of the Reich. "

It therefore came as no surprise that both the Caudillos were not this morning reading both the official newspapers and government briefings before their planned meeting, but rather focusing their attention on the hastily drafted notes that the security branch had supplied their aides with the night before. Salazar was the first to look up, with his wisened, squinting eyes, from the typed out pages, as his previous knowledge already covered most of the information provided here again, Franco needed a while longer, his brow furrowed in a crease of utter concentration. After a gruff cough the Spaniard began to make his observations on what he had read. It seems the previously installed moles in both the German state apparatus and societal institutions had mostly survived, only few had not been able to report back at the designated time, their status currently still pending. This would be a great opportunity to understand the intentions of the new German regime, but even more importantly their capabilities and limits. Using the information from the moles the Iberian peninsula could stand a chance in preparing itself for any foreign excursions the DSR was planning to make."

Since these are crumbling or forcibly being reorganised, and hence no matter whether they will provide useful information back to us, we still have to prepare for a worst case scenario. Part of this scenario would have German planes fly over our skies again, just like in Guernica 30 years prior, this time however capable of imposing far worse damage on the fractured union of Iberia. It has therefore been agreed that we will have to expand our current anti-air defences, first this will mean building up more ground infrastructure such as both immobile and mobile defence stations and RADAR, but it should also later include a further increase in the Iberian air force size and interception capabilities therefore. In times such as these we could never be too careful, having those demons in the sky, raining hellfire down upon us may entirely demoralise the whole union into submission."

He briefly noted down some of what he considered to be the key snippets of information being discussed, grinning at his discovery, and when he felt the conversation had run its course continued down the long and dark corridor to a winding flight of stairs. Once outside the impressive, yet severely damaged building he jogged without any rush to a secluded phone box in a side street. As he punched in a certain list of numbers he looked around at the filth that was mounting in the alleyway, things would not be in a great state for a while here, maybe never. A chirpy voice picked up the phone, informing the man that a Mr Canaris was currently not around and whether a message should be left.

In response to the unfolding crisis it was decided in an emergency Caudillo meeting that the refugees should be settled in our lands were we to be seen in a good light on the international stage. Of course they also felt sympathy for the terrorised mass of people, however both Caudillos would not be in their position had they not been practical people.

A long speech was given by the Canadian PM once Franco was settled in at Parliament Hill, giving praise to the Caudillo for taking the time to meet with Canada on a personal basis.\n\nDespite the warm greetings and generally friendly attitude, there was something that had been plaguing the trip to Canada since the Caudillo's arrival. One of the major concerns for maintaining a friendship with the Canadians was the ongoing struggle between the Quebecois independence movement and the Canadian government.

Furthermore, the internal conflict is amplified to the global stage by the support given to the Boers by the Reichsprotektorates to their north, setting South Africa to be a potential stage for a proxy war between the Reich and the USA.

If we are to recognize the government, it could grant us further ties with the OFN and help us position ourselves with them in this cold war.

While the influencer often holds more power, the influenced can play around this to their benefit and to the detriment of their neighbors. This behavior is best observed in the Balkans, where countries have feuded with one another for centuries. Some are better at the game than others, and have their independence to show for it. Caudillo Salazar believes is time for Iberia to participate in the game.\n\nThere are a few countries not yet dominated by the two powers who contest in the region, Germany and Italy, and creating ties with these independent countries will be important towards the new foreign policy."

 IBR.277.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar found himself in Budapest, meeting with a modest but dedicated group who had arrived to receive him. The ambassador and his entourage were friendly enough, and offered a tour of the Hungarian capital. To be polite, Salazar gladly accepted. The historical sights were impressive, and it was clear the Hungarians leaned on their legacy for its sightseeing value. After a long while, the tour was concluded. It had taken far longer than anticipated, and only a limited amount of time remained before the state visit was over.\n\nIt was planned that there would be both discussions about commercial and trade affairs, as well as a more publicized meeting between leadership, to be leveraged for public relations. While the opening for a true meeting is past, there is still time to discuss business. If trade deals are not particularly enthusing, then it would still be possible to praise the Hungarian government, in order to thaw the ice for later relations."

Press releases, miscellaneous meetings, and more occupy the Caudillo's day. The most important of these lighter actions was the arranging a higher-up meeting, on short notice, in order to strengthen diplomatic ties. It was only a matter of killing time until then.\n\nOnce the time comes, there will be no time to delay. There needs to be a concise, pre-prepared plan of discussion. Two proposals have taken the spotlight. The meeting could either be about business and trade, establishing further economic ties, or the meeting could be with the king himself. While not as economically profitable, the more personal touch of talking with the king could serve to break the ice, creating the groundwork for further relations."

What Caudillo Franco learned was that, much like Iberia itself, midday was hot, seemingly hostile to life. It was no place fit for staying outside in, for sure, as he took some time off for a siesta. Inside, in the formal environment, the people were as warm as the environment outside. Various affairs, as tedious as they were numerous, filled the day's schedule too far for Franco to properly enjoy the day.\n\nAs the day drags on, there is still time to prepare the greatest meeting of the evening. Saudi oil would undoubtedly be a worthwhile trade, and discussing business in-depth could help in securing an advantageous deal. However, relations could be improved by the classic tactic - flattery. By praising their monarchy, things could warm up between the leadership of both the Saudis and Iberia."

There are opportunities abound in the sub-continent and to have an ally who has access to the natural resources and manpower of India would greatly strengthen Iberia's diplomatic and economic position. We will have to make the decision whether to recognize India or the puppet state Azad Hind as the rightful inheritor of the title of India. India is the stronger of the two but Azad Hind has the might of the Co-prosperity Sphere behind it and a support for their government could lead to further diplomatic opportunities with Japan. Of course, at the same time, we could choose to not recognize either and carry on our policy of neutrality."

Before Franco lies two options: we could definitively say that Iberia will recognize the great Indian republic or we can nod along to what they say and make some vague promises before we make a bee line to Calcutta. A visit to Calcutta would mean throwing away any chance of getting the Indians on side, but Franco has been meaning to try a real Calcuttan biryani..."

We have disregarded the Indians so now it is time for Franco to decide whether we will support the Azad Hind government as the true successor to the mantle of India or whether we will leave India to Indians and back neither government. Naturally, this would mean less opportunities to flex our diplomatic muscle on the global arena but it would mean less chance of potentially getting dragged into a future conflict on the sub-continent."

Since the loss of the Portugese colonies all those years ago, Iberian presence in the far east has been limited however, given the emerging markets that reside within, it is imperative that we return. There is much work to be done and so little time to do it but Franco can and will maintain and forge our diplomatic and economic ties in the pacific. Our mutual hatred of Germany means that fostering relations with the GEACP is top priority. While there may be some animosity towards the Japanese in their occupation of our former colonies and massacres of Iberian citizens in the Philippines, this is a new Iberia and we intend to show it!

Franco saw what Japanese occupation had done to the sullen local populace whose faces bore no discernable emotion. Unfortunately, this journey was not for humanitarian efforts but for business and so business is all that shall be discussed. \n\nTalking business with the Chinese could yield many results, as the economic potential for such a large country in terms of population and natural resources could allow Iberian firms to hold onto the coattails of China's imminent meteoric rise. On the other hand, we could meet with the Chinese president [CHI.GetLeader], and further establish diplomatic ties with a country that could become a powerful actor on the world stage, should the Chinese successfully throw off the chains of Japanese domination."

Alternatively, we can meet with the president of Australia, [AST.GetLeader], and establish a clear diplomatic policy with the country. Both have their advantages: furthering economic ties would mean that our investment, both to and from our countries, would be more diversified, shielding us from a potential crash should any other country we've talked fall into economic crisis; whereas further diplomatic ties could be our gateway to the OFN.

Every man among the crowd eager to weigh in upon the complex economic discussions anticipated for this assembly of the Iberian Council. Political blocs from across the Union, both great and small, have ensured that their representation within the assembly will be at an absolute maximum. It is time for this landmark assembly of the Iberian Council to commence.\n\nThe assembly opens with the usual legislative formalities, and a quorum is called without a hitch. Shortly thereafter, the Caudillos make their appearance in an awkward tandem as they address the council. The two leaders engage the council with tall talk of economic prosperity and national greatness. The general reception of their speeches, however, garners little more than a subdued applause.\n\nFollowing several ungainly speeches, shared nearly equally between Franco and Salazar, the two leaders jointly call the deliberations of the council to an open."

The discussions persist with no true progress to display. Bureaucrats continue to take the floor of the assembly, putting forth nothing but safe and unremarkable economic proposals. As the hours progress, the once lively atmosphere of the assembly hall becomes dull and subdued.\n\nThe deadlock is finally broken as a senior member of the technocratic wing speaks. "Gentlemen!" he bellows. "Our union is strained and our economy lies in a disgraceful disarray. Our chosen partners of trade have all but forsaken us, and our abhorrent protectionism impedes any recovery in trade. We dare to attempt to solve our economic concerns alone, but we are failing! Gentlemen, the way forward is clear; we alone cannot solve the economic question. We must implement policies of liberalization!"\n\nAs the man sits, members with ties to the Opus Dei and technocratic blocs rise to their feet and issue an organized and thunderous applause, with many of the more liberal elements of the assembly pitching in. Other elements of the council, however, remain less than enthused. Loud jeers erupt from opposing wings, and many members shout obscenities towards the opposing side. The commotion finally dies down following several calls to order, and the proceedings resume. The Opus Dei continues to put forward detailed plans of economic liberalization, free trade, and a market economy. They argue that despite the loss of state control over economic affairs, the increasingly open Iberian economy would be attractive to investors both internal and external. Furthermore, they go to great lengths to outline the benefits of a renewed Iberian presence in international trade. After lengthy discussion, the Opus Dei conclude their proposals."

It would certainly seem so! Or have they simply forgotten what happened to Iberia when it dared to rely on foreign powers? The lone source for our current disaster is the Iberian reliance upon foreigners to protect our nation and to protect our economy. This must end! This can end! Iberia's path to greatness lies inward! We alone shall be the masters of our economic destiny, not the profiteering foreign fat cats!"\n\nThe assembly hall erupts into a tumultuous roar as nationalist and right wing elements applaud the counter to the liberal ideas. As the excited commotion dies down, the Falangists begin to lay out their plan. With a radical emphasis upon autarky and nationalization, the Falangist proposal outlines an Iberia that relies upon itself and itself only. A nation that possesses near unlimited economic control.

Tensions run high, and any argument put forth by either side is swiftly met with jeers and counter arguments. The assembly has stagnated.\n\nThe Caudillos grow tired of the endless squabbles, and jointly agree that a decision must now be made. The assembly is swiftly called to intermission, and the politicians retreat to their blocs to revise their plans of action.

These efforts, however, leave Franco utterly unconvinced. He had chosen his stance long ago.\n\nThe Caudillos exit the secluded room from which they deliberated and take to the floor of the assembly. Approaching the podium, many notice that Franco, in an unusual breach of convention, walks several paces ahead of Salazar in his approach to the podium. With Salazar standing aside, Franco mounts the podium, and the assembly hall falls silent. "It has been decided, after careful consideration, that the way forward to ensure Iberian prosperity is to pursue a path of self-reliance. We will be the masters of our own economic destiny!"

Despite the council being merely advisory, Franco finds that it would be within his best political interest to seriously consider both camps of the debate. The Caudillos debate the options for hours, as the politicians of the assembly grow tired. Despite hours of internal debate, no decision is made.

Franco and Salazar recognize that neither man among them carries the political weight behind them to enforce their standpoint upon the other.\n\nThrough the deadlock of lengthy debate emerges a compromise. It is decided that, as the two men are unlikely to come to a decision through personal deliberations, the council shall hold a vote to decide upon the topic. Despite the original intent being for the Iberian Council to remain advisory only, giving it the power to vote upon the economic reform remains the only method of decision the Caudillos have left, save for complete capitulation to the other man. Furthermore, both Franco and Salazar recognize this final opportunity to garner support for their cause, before a final vote is cast.\n\nThe Caudillos exit the secluded room and take to the floor of the assembly. In their approach to the podium, the two men walk shoulder to shoulder, maintaining a nearly visible effort to remain level with one another. Salazar and Franco jointly mount the podium, and together they inform to the assembly of their decision. At a soon to come date, they announce, the Iberian Council will convene to vote upon two options for the economic future of Iberia: the approach of liberalization, or the maintenance of the status quo. Immediately, the Falangists audibly express their immense disapproval over their lack of representation in the final vote, and many members of that bloc immediately stand and storm out of the council chambers.

From the conservatives to the reformists, lines are beginning to be drawn on the questions that we will have to answer in the coming months. A liberal democracy? An authoritarian democracy?

While this would help legitimise whatever party wins and by extension our political system, there are worries amongst many of the more nationalist leaning people that this would infringe on the sovereignty of the nation and potentially give the countries we grant observer status a chance to influence the election. \n\nThat being said, the hard-line reformists demand that we allow total transparency in this upcoming election as the peninsula hasn't seen a free election since the days of the Second Spanish Republic back in 1936, and they fear that authoritarianism could return without these international checks and balances.

Representatives from rural areas have asked for disproportionately more ballot boxes than in urban areas because of their worry that there won't be enough to make sure that the people in these small communities can reach them on election day. \n\nHowever, representatives from the urban areas claim that this is unfair; that the current plans for distribution should suffice and that rural representatives are trying to have their areas overrepresented.

This has come under heavy fire from the hard-line reformists and would surely outrage the people disenfranchised by it, however the conservatives argue that allowing these people to vote would only lead to instability in our newly christened democracy. \n\nThe radical reformists have declared that suffrage should be expanded to everyone over 18. While they only hold a minority in the council, they seem to have popular support throughout the country, judging by rallies which have been held, visited by tens of thousands, in order to pressure the government to open up the franchise. \n\nThe final proposal, seen as the compromise option between the conservatives and the hard-line reformists, details universal suffrage with an ID registration system. This system would potentially dissuade some of the elements the conservatives want to ban while fulfilling the populace's desire for universal suffrage."

Using the police would be able to break up any conflicts that could occur, and even act as a deterrent to dissuade troublemakers from showing up. Furthermore, it would be a signal to our citizens that we are truly committed to democracy and encourage them to participate where they otherwise wouldn't have. \n\nIn spite of this, the general consensus among the officials we have put in charge of organising the election is that the fears of voter intimidation are exaggerated, and that the deployment of the Guardia Civil would be a waste of police time and resources which could otherwise be spent elsewhere."

Those sympathetic to the rule of Franco and Caetano wish to actively fund Unión Nacional, through proxies and Swiss bank accounts, to ensure that no other party can match their level of funding. Others have considered using suppression to ensure that no liberal parties can become elected or even become part of a coalition. For these moderates, so long as some kind of conservative party wins, Iberia will be safe and the reforms will be limited. \n\nNaturally, the reformist ideologues have expressed disgust at the thought of illegal funding or suppression of parties and reject the notion that only Unión Nacional can guide this country sufficiently, declaring that only free and fair elections can allow the people of Iberia to choose the direction of their nation democratically."

All of these groups have seen a resurgence since the rallies began, and every day their support grows wider and wider. Many in the council have expressed disgust at the prospect of a liberal or even a socialist government and have considered a media blackout to halt this momentum and prevent what they see as a red tide poised to sweep the nation. Rural representatives have also expressed support at this measure, wishing to keep leftists and cosmopolitan urbanites as far away from their communities as possible.\n\nThe more optimistic within the council have stated their opposition to the blackout, believing that they can beat back their political enemies on the merits of their arguments rather than resorting to dirty tricks and backdoor politics."

With enough propaganda in the right places, we could turn the farmer and villager voting blocs away from Alianza Popular and towards the Unión Nacional and potentially secure victory in the election. \n\nThat being said, many of the moderates in the council have stated their position that an Alianza Popular victory in the election would be satisfactory as we share many of their values. The more liberal minded in the council have proclaimed that there should be no meddling in these areas, and to allow the people of Iberia to choose the government that they wish.

 IBR.450.d:0 "The church bell rang six times. On any other day, there would be a few people meandering around, on their commute to work, but this was not any other day. The announcement of Iberia's first free elections had been made. The jubilation tingled in the air, leaving its mark on anyone who ventured out that day. All the excitement and anticipation that had been built up to the announcement had burst out into a celebration larger than any other in Iberian history. For one day, all peoples in the nation felt united and all differences had been ascended. The old wept at seeing how far the nation had come from the days where collapse felt inevitable. The young finally had the chance to be represented and to choose a government they weren't born into. As the day marched on, the crowds only got bigger, the cheers only got louder, and the spirit of democracy only grew stronger. \n\nFor Franco, this was just another day. He didn't get up early nor did he eat breakfast with any haste. However, as the aging Caudillo left his residence for some air, he saw the crowds. Crowds he had not seen the like of since the victory 31 years ago. He had only reluctantly given additional powers to the council, and throughout this process had gone back and forth on whether it had been a good idea, but seeing the people of his nation cry out with such elation caused a single tear to drop from behind his glasses. Iberia had been saved."

The talk of organizing the election is over and now the practicalities of running an election have begun to take place. \n\nNow that the decisions made by the council in preparing for the elections have begun to take shape, there has been criticism from all sides regarding the handling of the logistical side of things. Some believe that the numbers of police deployed is too much, while some say too it has been too little. Some have stated that not enough ballot boxes were sent to rural areas, while others too many were sent. The old adage, "you can't please everyone" applied to politics seems to be closer to "you can't please anyone".

Currently, minor parties have begun to emerge everywhere as anticipated, but through mergers and arrangements minor parties are taking shape into a few major parties representing the ideological makeup of modern Iberia. At the moment, the parties that seem to be gaining traction are: the socially liberal Unión Republicana, the conservative Alianza Popular, and the economically liberal Partido Renovador Democrático. \n\nThe newfound diversity in the republic has shocked the old guard who believed that many of the views now being openly advocated in the streets had died out under the Caudillos' watch, but to their dismay both the red banner and the flag of the second republic is being paraded around with seemingly no consequences. With the decline of the Unión Nacional, reactionary elements within the party have been provoked to believe that a stronger hand will be needed to guide the UN to victory in the election."

This made the Unión Republicana's decision to outline their plans for minority representation in the city a clear sign of their commitment to the cause of peaceful devolution. The rally itself was rather short, but the speech was almost drowned out by the cheers. Once the rally was over, brawls sporadically broke out across the city between Galician nationalists and unionists. City officials denounced the UR speakers for "incitement of violence" and "disturbing the peace". Torcuato Fernández-Miranda has refused to acknowledge the denouncement, staying committed to the slogan of "Freedom and Autonomy for all of Iberia's children!" \n\nThese words would have gotten any man imprisoned mere months ago, but has now become the rallying cry for the up and coming Unión Republicana; a party dedicated to reducing inequality, empowering Iberia's minorities, and seeing that the process of democratisation is brought to its natural conclusion. The party has seen widespread support in urban centres, from moderate minority nationalist movements, and from the most hard-line reformists in the council.

We, as the Alianza Popular, vow to not only halt this menace, but reverse the degradation and make Iberians proud of their nation once more." \n\n– Manuel Fraga Iribarne, Leader of Alianza Popular. \n\nFollowing the Unión Republicana rally in Galicia, Fraga has released a scathing article in the conservative ABC newspaper targeting Fernández-Miranda and his party. Criticising their "inflammatory anti-Iberian language" and "highly idealistic and unrealistic policies", the article has inflamed public opinion with its use of divisive language. To accompany the article, Fraga has released their manifesto in which the policy positions of Alianza Popular were showcased. As expected, it calls for aggressively combatting terrorism, maintaining a unitary style of government, and strengthening of the bond between the church and the state. Naturally, this has come under heavy fire from the liberals who claim that Alianza Popular wish to maintain the status quo at a time when reform is needed, with conservatives arguing they only wish to preserve what makes Iberia great."

Whether this call will fall on deaf ears remains to be seen but the publicity around the stunt has given the PRD a boost in the polls and has propelled them to the lead for the title of the main center party with their emphasis on the civility needed in politics. \n\nPromising a focus on economic liberalization along with vague promises on social reform, the Partido Renovador Democrático has managed to gain the support from the urban business leaders and the money that comes along with them. Given the stagnation that occurred under the Caudillos' rule, their message of adopting a laissez faire approach has resonated with many of the people most affected by the pitfalls of the old economic system, and the more measured tone on social issues could mean that the PRD stands to poach voters off both Alianza Popular and Unión Republicana.

The growth of the liberals in the Partido Renovador Democrático and Unión Republicana have pushed the two parties together in an alliance in hopes that by working as one, they can avoid splitting the vote and secure victory in the election.

Privately, Valcárcel has been seen wandering the party's headquarters and any attempt to communicate with him only results in a volley of curses and seething anger."

The UN had seemed like the obvious choice if any extrajudicial funding would be needed, but some in the government feel like they have fallen too far to be saved, even with covert support. Instead, there has been a proposal to fund the Alianza Popular as they have been seen as having a strong chance in winning the election. Although there are some differences in policies between the two, Alianza Popular is still a conservative party opposed to the liberals, and therefore broadly agree with the vision of the Unión Nacional. They could for this reason be the key to preventing liberal influence from disturbing the status quo. \n\nThat being said, some have stated their opposition to any election tampering and wish to ensure that the people of Iberia get to choose their own government, whether that be a liberal or conservative one."

However, it would be costly to be able to print enough ballots in time for the election as printing houses would have to be subsidized to work overtime. \n\nThat being said, it is not immediately certain that the amount by which we would be able to print will fall short of the demand. Should there only be a few thousand people who do not have a ballot, there is a chance that the press wouldn't pick it up and we could avoid the cost.

A feeling of unspoken trepidation. Questions that plagued the mind of the average Iberian. What if it all went wrong? What if all of this was for nothing and the old regime remains, rebranded for a new decade? There were celebrations from dusk till dawn but that anxiety hung over like a stalactite ready to fall at any moment, ready to spear their newfound liberty. \n\nAntonio, Isabella, Leo, and Gabriella could not have less in common. What common ground does a bureaucrat, a student, a banker, and a nun share? Usually very little, but today they all felt that feeling in their stomach. As they gripped their secret ballot, they were united in the foreboding apprehension about their country's future. No words were exchanged but they all shared in the comfort of each other's worried glances. If the future were to be bleak they wouldn't face it alone, but together. \n\nWhile in power, it'd be easy to say that Franco could never really connect with his people and understand their plight but even he could feel the uneasiness in the air. The people wanted reform, that he had been sure of but if they didn't get it, what would they do? Who would face the wrath of the disillusioned masses? Franco was many things but clueless was not one of them and he realized how his position, however ceremonial it may be, could be the target of populist outrage. After coming to this conclusion, he had decided to visit the Cathedral of his hometown of Ferrol for the remainder of the day to pray for everything to work out as intended."

While there had been recent reports that city officials were riling up their constituents to vote, the measures taken by the government were thought to be enough to keep them at bay. \n\nThis was wrong and these same measures were actually used to propagandize against the government which has severely limited the ability of Unión Nacional and Alianza Popular to secure the election. Reports are flooding in, showing that the average urban turnout is well above the average turnout in the rural areas. Not only will this damage the reputation of the Unión Nacional for this election, but has the ability to be used as a bludgeon against them for the elections yet to come.

Some journalists have suggested that the wording of the speech suggests that he intends to resign once this objective is done but there has been no official statement on the matter. \n\nAfter Fernández-Miranda was done, Sá Carneiro took the stage and took a more policy based approach in his speech, calling for three "E's" to be implemented "Establecer, expandir e eliminar": the "establishment of a provincial autonomy system"; "expanding civil rights''; and "eliminating the ghost of the Caudillos that haunt Iberia's political system".

Due to the fact that these arms were earmarked for the Federal Army, which is rather shoddily equipped in this sector, getting to the bottom of this supply leak is of utmost importance.\n\nSeveral leads have been noticed, and can be pursued, including access records to the secure area of the warehouses, the guard shifts, and, if worst comes to worst, some worrying accounts of separatist activity in the area. As this is Catalonia, it's very possible that nearly any force could be involved.\n\nAdditionally, due to the lack of damage on the buildings or storage areas, it is very possible that the force causing the arms disappearances has one or more men on the inside.

Whatever is going on here is clearly either a legal matter for the local police, or a simple bureaucratic error.\n\nThus, it is best to either kick the issue down to the locals or drop it, and instead focus on preventing anomalous situations like this from happening again, be it through greater security or bureaucratic reform."

Gravely, he held up photographs of bombed churches, dead priests, and desecrated saintly relics.\n\n'Whatever it takes', he says, 'to rid this city of the murderous anarchist scum, is justified in our quest to make Iberia safe and free from this degenerate behavior.'\n\nThe officer wishes his men good hunting, and orders them to apprehend or eliminate any potential threat they run across.

With several officers wounded and one dead, the Guardia Civil cease this operation, and instead regroup in numerous precinct houses scattered throughout downtown Barcelona. Instead of a decisive purge, they will need to go door-to-door and quickly smash any signs of revolt.\n\nCalling in some heavy support from the Spanish Army, the paramilitary forces begin sweeping the city for possible CNT arms caches or meeting places."

As nighttime rains wash the blood and broken glass into the city's gutters, the police continue their raids.\n\nDespite resistance, it seems that they are closing in on the source of the city's woes, and many law-abiding citizens hope that they will be done with their duty by the end of the week."

Taken by surprise, the surviving soldiers only managed to put up a small resistance against the CNT-FAI rebels, and were soon after squashed. Of all of the 140 men in the convoy, none have turned up alive.\n\nDue to this attack, the reinforcements outside of the city have been called in, however, more and more army units are coming into contact with the well armed and prepared rebels.

It was all they could do at this point short of raiding every single building in the city. However, after launching a few more of these raids, it was obvious that they were just falling back into their prior pattern. The breaking point of this operation was a large scale showdown between the Guardia and CNT rebels, resulting in the Guardia having to retreat yet again, with 7 officers injured and 2 dead.

Some were not as lucky, with many citizens acting in open revolt, attacking the officers, injuring 5 and killing 1. As the night continued, the exact amount of civilian casualties has not been accounted for yet.\n\nFew officers successfully arrived at the warehouse at their predetermined time, and upon arriving, they immediately realized what had happened.

This has, of course, made many people upset, and is only raising tensions even higher.\n\nThe police almost had a lead today, but due to some unforeseen circumstances, with multiple police officers disappearing after following false trails.

Several detonations were visible as the Guardia Civil closed into the location, of which were enough to nearly total several buildings. Given the status of the survivors of the attack, the investigation would have to proceed without their testimony, as they were still recovering from their injuries. It was later found that the power of explosion required to damage the structure of the buildings in the complex was far higher than the ordinance produced - suggesting that another, stronger explosive was used in order to damage the facility. Furthermore, very little of the finished product remained, destroyed or otherwise, leading one to conclude that it was taken en masse.\n\nThe political effect of this destruction was disastrous. With new ammunition and supplies at least one terrorist group has been freshly equipped, and they most likely have shared it with fellow separatists. What's worse is the perception of the government.

Reports indicated that the group had access to weapons considered 'far above their status', almost considered military-grade. In order to finally beat back the CNT forces the army had to be called in to restore order to part of the city. Even though their presence has been beaten back, some hold-outs still remain to be flushed out.\n\nAs was simply part of the fighting protocol, beating back the separatists took a large amount of time and was very costly in collateral damage. No favors have been earned with the population of the city, who resent the naturally unpleasant counter-terrorist tactics.

Cordoba wasn't a separatist zone, nor was it a hotbed of extremist activity, that is unless they've seriously been overlooking the city's affairs, which was unlikely.\n\nIt was not until a transmission came through on state tv that the anti-separatist division would figure out who was responsible. At 3:15, a regular state news broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a new signal, showcasing the blurry image of a man sitting in a basement, his face concealed by a ski mask. Claiming that these attacks were carried out on the behalf of the BTA, the mysterious man suddenly began shouting angrily, launching into what can only be described as a lunatic tirade against "the ruling class" and "forces of reaction", coupled with some very violent and explicit threats against the government.\n\nTransmission was cut off after less than five minutes, but the entire nation is stunned. The simple fact that a separatist group was able to launch a coordinated attack, let alone one of this magnitude, outside of their home region is proof that they are far more widespread than previously thought.

 IBR.576.d:0 "Confusion and panic are ubiquitous in the city of Lisbon today, in the aftermath of yet another terrorist attack by the FSLP.\n\nIn a rather unprecedented move, the wee hours of the morning were heralded by multiple high intensity explosions, most of which appear to have been targeted at industrial centers. A few bombs, however, were set inside an apartment complex, leveling it almost entirely and killing over one hundred people. The damage to the factories, meanwhile, is considerable, and any production in Lisbon has been effectively neutered as a result of the attacks.\n\nThe FSLP wasted no time in proclaiming responsibility for the attack, claiming that the civilian deaths were "a necessary motivator to the general public to support our cause". It seems that they regard even their fellow Portuguese citizens as poorly as they do the "Iberian occupiers", if they remain indifferent to their radical cause. Unconfirmed reports have it that membership is increasing simply due to fear of being targeted next, and with ordinary civilians in their numbers they will be increasingly capable of sabotage and terrorism."

 IBR.577.d:0 "Lisbon, in addition to being the capital city of Portugal, is also the location of the main broadcasting center for the Portuguese language version of state controlled news. Unlike the headquarters in Madrid, where the news was broadcast in Castilian Spanish and the newsrooms filled with shouting and commotion, the Lisbon headquarters tended to be on the calmer side.\n\nAt least, until today...\n\nNobody is quite sure how they managed to pull it off. Some claim that they were undercover agents working for the state news for months waiting for the right time, others claim that they were recent converts to the cause, while the official Madrid line is that the terrorists impersonated low level janitors and secretaries to infiltrate the building. Whatever the case, the building was overwhelmed with the sounds of gunfire and terrified shrieks around 8 am, punctuated by the occasional splat and sickening thud.\n\nIberia, and indeed soon the world, would become very much aware as the FSLP terrorists who had taken control of the building used their position to broadcast live on state television, for millions to see. There, in a room littered with corpses and the miserable hunched over forms of terrified employees, a masked spokesperson for the terrorists delivered what was in effect their manifesto. There were no bombastic nationalistic proclamations, nor was there any harshness to his tone; the masked man delivered their grievances to a live audience with a surprising lack of emotion, even as the demands turned into direct threats on innocent lives. At some point about fifteen minutes in, the masked man and his cohorts decided that they had said all that they needed to, and in one last show of brutality executed all remaining employees on camera with a bullet to the head.\n\nBy the time anti-separatist forces arrived the terrorists had managed to make a clean getaway, leaving behind a newsroom in disarray and piles upon piles of corpses. If their manifesto is any indication, the FSLP does not plan on slowing up on these heinous acts until their demands for a free Portugal are fully met."

At an initial examination, there was no correlation between the victims other than being in public and not secure. However, a later look into the case revealed that the victims all shared two common factors - they were in the Iberian administration, and they were all Spanish. As this follows the modus operandi of a Portuguese separatist group, it is safe to assume they were the party at fault.\n\nEven though the culprits are narrowed down and justice is inevitable, the damage they dealt is unavoidable. Many Spanish officials are afraid that they'll be next, and between fearing for their lives and doing their jobs little is being done. The blow to the governmental efficiency is severe, and has greatly diminished productivity."

 IBR.593.d:0 "There has been a regional blackout in the services of the Axencia in northern Portugal. Taking the men entirely by surprise, a terrorist group struck directly at the regional headquarters, using firearms far more powerful than intelligence had suggested. Not only did they have such high-grade weaponry, but they were capable of hiding their firepower from the watching eye of the Axencia, too. Understandably, the agents present were not prepared for a separatist group to strike the anti-separatist forces at their own base of operations. The complex was designed around such an eventuality, and with these pre-built fortifications the separatist defeat was inevitable. They didn't let this stop them, though - the fight they put up was reportedly fierce, with only two or three terrorists not fighting to the death.\n\nIt would be fine if this didn't turn out to be a diversion. An unknown agent allowed a group of separatists access to the facilities, and they made off with records, weaponry, and intelligence. As undercover agents are smothered out and depots raided with the newfound data on them, the Axencia has been busy finding their leaking part. The upper half of Portugal will remain vulnerable until an audit is completed, the loose thread is cut, and new connections are established."

 IBR.594.t:0 "Administration records stolen or destroyed!"
 IBR.594.d:0 "An administrative building, containing many important records and no smaller amount of paperwork, was very nearly wiped clean by a terrorist attack. According to the reports of security guards on-scene, a disturbance was responded to, which turned out to be little more than a large distraction. A struggle had begun in the building they were guarding, which had been infiltrated while a diversion was occurring. Their arrival was too late, as the insurgents had defeated the guards and shockingly massacred the staff. When they were intercepted they were in the process of starting a fire on a pile of documents. Even though the terrorists were defeated once their presence had been identified, the guards lacked the means to put out the fire they had started. When it was put out it had burnt through much of the present paperwork.\n\nThe damage goes without saying. Even though much of the lost documentation can be restored in time, it is time exactly that cannot be spared. Since it was a large amount, it will take a large sum of time to replace it all. The time spent replacing papers is time that cannot be spent fighting off terrorists, and they have taken gleeful notice of the fact."

Our ceaseless raids, arrests and other policing actions have proven too much for the treacherous reds, and what few terrorists remain have scattered to the winds.\n\n This has been our hardest-won victory by far; support for the anarcho-syndicalist movement has never died in Catalonia, giving the traitors no shortage of refuge and material support. The workers of Barcelona were a particularly difficult obstacle to surmount in our pursuit of the CNT, but no task is beyond the capabilities of the AAS.\n\nPerhaps with their armed wing broken, the Catalan anarchists will see the futility of their cause and abandon it for good.

The ETA have been far and away the most effective terrorist group active in Iberia, killing hundreds in bombings and armed attacks over the course of their campaign. However, we can now rest easy, as the AAS has finally secured the last of their mountain bases in the Basque Country.\n\nMonths have passed since we began to push back the ETA in earnest. Their martial capabilities almost matched those of the AAS, and it was only with military assistance that the terrorists were defeated in open battle. But for all their ferocity, they lacked the manpower and popular organic support to withstand our relentless assaults.\n\nThough our victory is cause for celebration, there are many questions that remain unanswered; primarily, the question of their material support. The ETA never enjoyed widespread support among the population of their homeland, and the amount of hardware at their disposal was suspiciously high for a terrorist organization. For now, though, perhaps we should be content to sit on our laurels and enjoy peace in the Basque Country."

Bitter old miners and workers were no match for our brave AAS agents. After months upon months of sweeping the land, we can safely say that the BTA is no longer a substantial threat. Sympathizer and isolated cells may remain, but this should be the end of them as a cohesive and effective organization.\n\nNow that they are free from both communist propaganda and the threat of violence, perhaps the mines and factories of the north can return to their usual level of productivity.

After being driven from their urban hideouts, the FSLP fled into the countryside, taking up refuge in the wild places of the land they sought to 'liberate'. The Portuguese branch of the AAS, however, had studied all their moves and learned their devious tricks. Come the final assault, there was nothing the reds could do to escape justice.\n\nAt long last, the green and red of the Portuguese flag can fly happily alongside that of Iberia. No longer do patriotic workers of the west need to fear being targeted as 'class traitors' and 'collaborators'. With this blow, Portugal is at last free from fear and class conflict."

That was no surprise, of course- they had a majority, enough so that the programs failing would be more of a surprise than their success. Of course, those who were against the new - or perhaps the renewed old - autonomy were a talkative lot. The Francoists had a talent for never shutting up, especially when their military buddies were in earshot. They were definitely in earshot this time, as Adolfo Suarez was forced to discover when he was strongarmed into meeting a representative officer.\n\n"What the hell were you thinking!?" The sergeant screamed at him, with a fury Suarez had never seen before. "Even- Without even what I was sent here for, I want to know what the fuck you were thinking!? Do you want to kill this fucking country?"\n\nAdolfo, despite how hard he tried to keep a respectable face, was this close to wavering under the pressure placed on him. "We are the ones killing the country? Trying to keep a hold of the entire thing like all it takes is a paperclip?

I can't blame you, but I would like you to understand that your support is very important to getting the support we need. So, the reason you're here is that I would like you to talk to me. Tell me everything you want done, all of your demands, and which are the most important."\n\nThe regionalist was incredulous. "You'll comply with a list of demands if I vouch for you?"\n\n"Why else are we here? Our transcriber will note down everything you say, then we'll go over it."\n\nEach local leader was a few days after the other. Francisco was handling it himself, and he knew what to do - he would let one sing the praises of the government, pass some legislation, and then face a more trusting leader.

That was good, since getting someone else to do it would come off poorly.\n\nThe Basque spoke of things that were popular, Carneiro knew, because he had written the speech for just this occasion. He watched the Basque speak of freedom, of liberty, of the right to exist as Basque, not Spanish. Carneiro inhaled on the dramatic pause, held his breath, then exhaled as it moved on to the freedom of language.\n\nWhen the crowd cheered after the fact, he took heart that maybe, just maybe, the whole diarchy could be a bad chapter of history.\n\n"I can tell you caused this!" screamed a military official, who had coincidentally been present for the speech. He went to speak more, but Carneiro quickly stepped into his car.\n\n"Sorry! I'd love to chat but I need to attend to further business!" The politician drove off with a final comment."

 IBR.610.d:0 "The farmers who populate much of the rural areas of Iberia may be, in some regards, blessed. Regarded as the ideal lifestyle by the Francoists, the farmers of the country were often pandered to. Even during autarky, the effects of which were lessened by their self-sufficient nature, the farmers were pampered and had little reason to support other groups - this continues to today, where they are a secure opposition voting bloc.\n\nThe farmers do not support us, and perhaps this is not entirely unwarranted. We are perceived as an elitist group, the dreadful sort which exclusively supports urban areas (as opposed to the dreadful sort that pandered to rurals before us), and as painful as it is to admit, we are in many ways overly favoring our voting bloc, the urban areas. Even though the way to fix this is fairly obvious, the party is split between three opposing factions on this matter, each supporting a different resolution.\n\nThe first and second groups both wish to effectively buy over the farmers using benefits dedicated to them, though they diverge in what benefits specifically to give. The first wishes to use farming equipment, increasing the effectiveness of the farmers and intending to use that favor to acquire supporters. The second wishes to use less direct means, using subsidies to show that we have not forgotten them. The third, and final, faction does not want to do anything. They argue the farmers are a lost cause, and attempts to buy them would be pointless waste.\n\nWhich idea will the leadership favor?"

Created with an overwhelming sense of authoritarianism, the Axencia has been used not only to stop separatism but effectively act as a paramilitary in some cases - creating some of the worst incidents to come to Iberia.\n\nThis is no reason to create an enemy out of them. As horrible as working with them is, it is a necessary evil until the time comes where they may be defanged.\n\nFrancisco Balsemao will be sent to meet with the higher echelons of the Axencia. His diplomatic skill, hopefully, will prove a valuable asset in the coming meetings.

Do you have a lighter?" He was handed a lighter, and a cigarette, and took a few moments to cherish a puff. Then he began to speak again. "Now, let us begin our meeting. I am sure you can understand me through a smoke..."\n\nThe man proved to be an eloquent speaker, and the dance of words between two men who made the act an art was a sight to behold. The men spoke for around an hour, around which the meeting concluded and both went their separate ways.\n\nHe was sold. Pleased with our moderation, the official was more than willing to put in a good word in the Axencia, for they greatly appreciated our commitment to ensuring the state evolved at a controlled pace. This is a great surprise - they surely know our end goal with them - but it isn't a matter to complain about."

"I'll pass. Smoking in the conference room is poor manners."\n\n"As you say," Francisco responded. "Let's get started with the meeting, if you are ready...?"\n\nThe man was very blunt. He spoke honestly, but he spared nothing for politeness. It was almost respectable, his commitment to curt conversation. He informed Balsemao, in no uncertain terms, that the Axencia was concerned. They were concerned with the progression of the state.\n\n"It would grow out of control, and swallow the country in bureaucracy and waste," the man argued. Even more so, they were scared for their own future. "Is it unreasonable to want to protect your livelihood?" Yet.. this meeting was a promising sign. That the government would meet in good faith was very valuable to the man meeting, and he would push the others to give the Unión Republicana a chance, if nothing else."

Because of all of it, several undoubtedly involved individuals have made very persuasive arguments to stop the investigation.\n\nGiving up will without a doubt stop our efforts here. What's shocking is that this may not even be the worst possible occurrence. We could always just continue on with the investigation, trying even harder to reach the evidence that is surely just out of our grasp, but this would make us dangerous enemies.

We are at our status quo, with one important change.\n\nThe investigation has infuriated the military.

It will no doubt be a great blow to their legacy when we release the proof of their deeds to the public.\n\nEven better than that, the intuition shown in the investigation has cowed the military.

If we have any say on the matter - which we do - that will end today.\n\nAs is the case with every political matter in this country, there is a wealth of options before us on how to handle the municipalities.

One of our promises was to unban these leftist groups, securing their support in creating a new Iberia. Now that we are in power, they expect us to make good on our promises and unban them.\n\nIt would be very easy - just a few strokes of a pen - to do so, but the political ramifications would be severe.

We would not only be promise-breakers, but seen as spineless as well. We could not entirely unban them safely. There could be a compromise, however. If we were to unban the less-revolutionary groups. We could keep the military's displeasure at a minimum, and repair some of the bridges we just burned."

 #Audit The Prisons
 IBR.619.t:0 "Investigating Political Imprisonments"
 IBR.619.d:0 "Franco gave his loyal supporters a lot of leeway. It so happens, to everyone's misfortune, prisons were some of Franco's most loyal bastions. It's hard to tell if the previous regime even tried to monitor what happened in those prisons, as abuses and violations of rights were so common that it created a reputation for brutality. Franco would simply throw a dissident into the prison and let them die - which was far from an impossible occurrence. We cannot let people be incarcerated in such conditions anymore.\n\nThe best way to lessen the issue immediately is to remove the people committing these atrocities. There are many problematic guards, used to not facing consequences for their actions, as well as those who are so adept at torture that they are better called torturers. If we arrested them all, then we could stop many abuses that could happen. However, we may upset the military by being indiscriminate, which could be dangerous. To that end, we could easily justify only arresting the most heinous offenders."

 #Close Down Tarrafal
 IBR.620.t:0 "The Matter of Tarrafal"
 IBR.620.d:0 "Tarrafal. A prison designed to hold the most troublesome of dissidents. A prison designed to break their spirits by any means necessary, a grinder of souls. It was made to be inescapable, situated on the island of Cape Verde, far away from the Iberian mainland. In an ideal world, we could just tear the prison down and put up a monument to the people it has killed. Since it is far from an ideal world, some tact will be required.\n\nThe commander of the prison was largely left to his own devices by Franco, and attempting to chafe on that autonomy may anger him. Since he is in a fortified location, out at sea, with plenty of provisions, his anger would be an incredible blow to an already unpopular decision - for Franco made sure to intertwine his brutality with Iberian pride. With the right pressure, the commander could be pushed to ending the worst of his excesses, which would still be a victory, if admittedly a minor one."

 IBR.806.t:0 "Tarrafal Camp Commandant Refuses To Stand Down!"
 IBR.806.d:0 "The worst has come to pass! The camp commander, angered by our decision, has refused our directives! He has stated that he will "not allow the end of justice in Iberia", and opted to instead make his stand by beginning to hole up within Tarrafal. Negotiations are pointless, as he has mentioned that he will not negotiate, only allowing access to the prison again if he totally achieves his way.\n\nA siege on Tarrafal, of all places, would be political suicide. There must not be a siege, so there are only two options to end this charade: A surgical strike, and the unthinkable. A squad of soldiers may be able to apprehend the commander before he can fortify, sending the pyramid tumbling down. However, if they fail, then the consequences will be truly severe. Otherwise, we would need to concede to the man. It would be a horrible loss of face, but better than what a failure would do."

Stating that he recognized the changes in policy and wished to adapt to them, he resigned from the position and granted us full access to Tarrafal. Most guards complied as well. Tarrafal is being wiped away currently, and its prisoners have been released or transferred accordingly. With the monster itself gone, all that remains is the man behind the slaughter.\n\nThe warden was the man responsible for the state of Tarrafal, creating the system which allowed it to grow as it did. In spite of his evils, there are some in the government who wish for him to be granted a pardon for his deeds - as if running a death camp was a deed. If we kept him free, it would please them... but is this really a man to keep free?"

It should be obvious that the military still holds significant power, and attracting their ire could spell the end of far more than just our party. This being said, we could go a long way towards defanging the military if we provide a little extra evidence of corruption into the investigation's results, though this will go poorly if there isn't plenty already. If we intentionally probe lightly with the investigation, it could open up negotiations and help ease relations - provided they trust us still.\n\nWe must be decisive, remain committed to our choice, and remember that we will not get a second chance at this.

We do not make deals with someone inclined to break it for petty gains. Your-" he spat the word with a remarkable venom, "party seems more inclined to make gains, not cooperate, so cooperation is not going to happen.

We wish to take this chance to arrange a relationship that benefits both groups."\n\nThe officer stared at him, with a look slightly more attentive than before. "Of course. Do you have a list, or should we take it from the top?"\n\nHaving brought in a receptive bunch, Balsemao was pleased to learn that the military, too, was relieved by the prospect of talking things over. With a more functional relationship prepared, it seemed like the country would be just a little bit less hostile."

 #Find Who We Can Trust
 IBR.622.t:0 "Securing Political Connections"
 IBR.622.d:0 "A country like Iberia is hardly the place for a liberal-oriented party. Having been under the tight leash of a regime - two, arguably - which sought to eliminate all political opposition, nearly every echelon of society is staffed with despots, lackeys, and yes men seeking to maintain their power no matter what. For a party like ours, who wishes to move beyond this dark era, these men are often dangerous and unwavering enemies. To throw away help in a situation like this is to prepare our noose.\n\nOur help is, to put it diplomatically, whoever we can find. There are still many moderates in Iberian politicians. Whether they are veterans who have cooled over the years or young dissidents, it does not matter. If we can secure these connections, then defeating the Francoists will be much simpler."
 IBR.622.a:0 "Then get to it!"
 
 IBR.5854.t:0 "Tension Looms"
 IBR.5854.d:0 "To assume that a moderate would be inclined to support us is a mistake. Those under the term are remarkably variable, but most importantly the veterans - those with influence - are rather conservative. Even though they want to move on from Franco, they wish to do so in a less radical way than ours. We have learned from insider information that many of these veterans are skeptical of our policies, opposing its implementation for one reason or another.\n\nAre they still worth trying to court? If we were to make concessions, there are fair odds they would go along with the show of cooperation. This asks another question, though: How much is their support worth?

 IBR.5855.d:0 "While none could deny that we certainly tried to court much of the old guard, many would agree we went a step beyond that. To a level that was downright pandering, we made one concession after another in attempting to gain the trust of those who were, in hindsight, manipulating us. The charade probably would have continued indefinitely until someone decided enough was enough. All these dealings were leaked to the media.\n\nSwooping in like birds of prey, the media outlets exposed our dealings to the rest of the country, and more importantly towards those we tried to reach. We are like a joke to them now - who would work with a party when there was only one spine between them? So thoroughly compromising our values for the sake of support seems to have also alienated some among our own, too."

 IBR.5856.d:0 "Given just the right amount of political handiwork, our deeds have finally been noticed. The moderate veterans, the best-aged segment of Franco's regime, have seen us as a worthy cause. With due note to their collective opportunism - if we were not elected they would not give us the time of day - it was very easy to create an effective and comprehensive political alliance. It is certainly a great step up for our power, but should we really show it?\n\nWe could announce our new alliance publicly, as a way of showing the military that we are not to be trifled with. It could cow them, but it might also do just the opposite if it is handled poorly.

Instead of silencing the military, the speech seems to have made them more talkative! They speak of intervention, concern, and of "proclaiming our dishonest motives"...

 IBR.815.d:0 "Two military men, clad in the most inconspicuous clothing they could find, walked along the street. They had been separated from the rest, and only assumed the worst. They had shaved beards, grown out hair, whatever they needed to do. If they wanted to get out of the country, they would need to look as far away from their old selves as possible.\n\n"This wasn't supposed to happen," lamented one.\n\n"Shut up, they might hear your bitching from Madrid." responded the other. "Whatever. If we can make it onto a flight, we can disappear in the States."\n\nOn the way to the airport, they beheld military. Not their military.\n\n"Play it cool," said the second officer, "they have no reason to suspect us."\n\nOn their way to the airport, they found that they were suspected. What was supposed to be a cursory inspection turned into far more, and by the end of the proceedings one was unconscious and the other was in handcuffs. They were identified, placed into custody, and sent off to Madrid."

 IBR.816.t:0 "Renegade Officers Flee The Country"
 IBR.816.d:0 "Two officers beheld an airport - their ticket out. The only issue was, it was guarded by soldiers. The front only had two soldiers watching the door, so their best way through would be getting through them, however possible, and getting on a plane.\n\n"What if they recognize us?" asked the first officer.\n\n"You worry too much! There's not a rat's chance in hell they know us. Don't you see yourself?" The second officer replied, gesturing to the thoroughly modified appearances they had taken as disguises. "Stay calm, and all they'll see are civvies."\n\nThey were immediately suspected. One of the guards present appeared to see through the disguises immediately. He shot them a quick salute, then waved them through.\n\n"All I see here is a patriotic Iberian citizen." said the guard, his voice low but quick. "Isn't that right, Hernandez?" The second guard, Hernandez, nodded in agreement. "You two have a safe flight, alright?""

 IBR.817.t:0 "The Officers' Trial"
 IBR.817.d:0 "The officers have been captured. They are currently incarcerated, and in a short period of time they will go to trial for treason against Iberia. Given the current state of Madrid, it is what legal professionals would call an open-and-shut case. It will likely be a short trial, for they have no hope of opposing the evidence against them. The only uncertain part is how they will be sentenced.\n\nThrough political maneuvering, we have great influence in the punishment the officer cabal will receive. Normally, an act of this magnitude would be punished with death. However, if we wanted to use this opportunity to reconcile with the remaining military elements, then "just" a life sentence will serve to show that we can still forgive."

In the middle of the parade was the former government, broken men still in their suits, displayed as if they were wild animals in a zoo.\n\nThe old government was led through the city, in full display of the crowds gathered upon the sidewalks of the streets, to the former House of Deputies. There, under the gaze of the Francoist flag, many of the politicians were lined up, including Fernández-Miranda, Balsemao, Suarez - who had to be tied down from how hard he kicked and fought - and Carneiro.\n\n"You are lucky not to be crucified!" screamed the officer in front.\n\n"Ready!"\n\n"Aim!"\n\nWith only one more word, the dream of a democratic Iberia died."

 IBR.819.d:0 "We have triumphed! The officers have been thoroughly defeated. Their soldiers lie dead or defeated, having suffered so greatly for so little that those who remain are unwilling to continue. With their surrender, the military officers at the head of the coup have lost any momentum they once had. Their credibility has evaporated, and they will not be able to muster anything like this again.\n\nThere is still the status of the traitors to consider. They did not surrender with the rest of their troops, and still desire to return to menace us. We must deal with them, as only their capture can totally put this treason to rest. Because their capture is so critical, Fernández-Miranda himself will preside over the investigation."
 IBR.819.a:0 "We enter our final stretch."
 
 IBR.820.t:0 "Counter-Coup In Western Iberia!"
 IBR.820.d:0 "Somehow, the situation has gotten even worse! The traitors, dissatisfied with their progress, have abandoned most of the fighting in Madrid. While their locations were unknown - as the battle was still raging when they fled - their true intent was revealed not long after.\n\nThey have issued a pronunciamento against the government, calling upon the larger military to aid them in toppling our government. Unfortunately, our military being what it is, most of them have deserted us to join the fascists. It is a fact of human history that some things never change, and it looks like the old Spanish habits will die hard. A civil war is upon us, and to save not just Spain but all of Iberia we must not repeat the mistakes of our grandfathers decades ago."

 IBR.5400.t:0 "The Beginning of Rationing"
 IBR.5400.d:0 "It has become obvious to the government, given the oil crisis afflicting the nation, that it is imperative that an oil rationing system needs to be put in place following our inability to import enough oil for the excessive demand. While there have been prominent voices within the opposition detailing their problems with an oil rationing system and how it might affect the ability of firms to manufacture goods that require oil, the government intends to press on, in order to make sure everyone has at least some oil and oil based products for their day to day lives. \n\nWhat the government has not decided on, is how strict this rationing should be. The first proposal has been a very harsh rationing system to thoroughly ensure that the country does not run out what little oil it has left in its reserves. However, some members of the cabinet have stated their hesitation with the measure warning that it is too strict and could cause the government's approval to tank considering the central oil has in both people's daily lives and the economy as a whole."

 IBR.5401.t:0 "The Question of Interest Rates"
 IBR.5401.d:0 "While the New Economic Program is centered around the need to address the working people of this nation, some measures will be needed to address the inflation that occurs when utilizing stimulus spending to offset this economic crisis. It is for this reason, that the government has seen fit to raise interest rates in order to curtail consumer and business spending. While this will impede the economy's ability to grow, the threat of rising inflation and even potentially hyperinflation means that it is something that has to be endured if the government's plan to weather the storm is to succeed. \n\nIn spite of this, our in-house economists are divided on how much to raise interest rates with the two main camps based around raising the rates from 6% to either 9% or 15%. The proponents of the former increase state that raising them too high will paralyze the country's economy and make spending so unlikely that the economy will continue to plummet whereas the proponents of the latter claim that 9% wouldn't impede spending enough to cause inflation to decrease claiming that the average Iberian would soon their currency become useless. Both arguments could lead the country down a road of economic ruin and by extension, an unmitigated defeat in the next election so we have to pray to both God and Keynes that the right decision is made here."

 IBR.5402.t:0 "Paying Back What is Owed"
 IBR.5402.d:0 "With our economy beginning to get back on track, it's time to address the growing issue of how the government intends to pay back the debt from both the previous administration and from what has been accrued in lifting the country out of the economic crisis. The question of debt repayment begins with who we intend to pay back, as there is substantial debt from both domestic and international lenders who both want their money plus interest back as soon as possible. \n\nOne thing that cannot be ignored is that the government must pay back the debt from the domestic lenders due to the fact that ignoring them would be political suicide and would weaken the government's credibility with small and large businesses operating in Iberia. However, whether the government can afford to pay back the foreign debt still remains up in the air, as the means by which we could afford to pay them back would certainly require a further tax hike which would be immensely unpopular and further inhibit our economic growth. That being said, a refusal to pay these international lenders back would result in eroded confidence from foreign firms and an even bigger bill when we are in a situation to pay them back due to the interest that will have accrued."
 IBR.5402.a:0 "Reach out to the world"

 IBR.5403.d:0 ""Through our New Economic Program, we have managed to weather the storm and, if our projections are correct, are soon heading into the recovery stage so long as we maintain the course. Luckily, the average Iberian has managed to stay afloat during these turbulent times through our use of stimulus spending and welfare programs. It is important that we remember that we cannot leave this recession unless all peoples of Iberia have been raised up and no longer go hungry, no longer be forced to live paycheck to paycheck, no longer be punished for the mistakes the top 1% make." \n\nWhile the members of the "top 1%" didn't seem to like Fernández-Miranda's TV speech, the "average Iberian" seemed to love it and the Unión Republicana has seen a steady increase in the polls as a result of it. The mixture of presenting hope for the future with populist messaging about the rich has really struck a chord with the working class and rallies in the urban areas since the speech have seen a dramatic increase in turnout. The response from these people have made it clear, they are behind Fernández-Miranda and Unión Republicana, all the way."

 IBR.623.d:0 "Iberians, Franco has died tonight. This exceptional man who before God and History, has took upon himself the responsibility of the hardest and most selfless service to Iberia, following throughout his whole life, day by day, hour by hour his transcendental mission. I know my voice will arrive in your residence being constantly interrupted by my tears and constant sobbing; it is natural to feel this way the tremendous pain his absence brings to us. It is a moment of extreme sadness, but we must not become hopeless, it is true that Franco, our Caudillo for so many years, is not among us but he left us his work, his example and the fulfillment of an historic duty. I was witness of his last day of work, when Death had already taken her toll at his heart and I can guarantee you that this were his last message to the people he loved so much:\n\nNow that the time is near for me to stand in judgment before God Almighty, I ask that He look kindly upon me since I have striven to live and to die as a good Catholic. It has always been my desire to be a faithful son of the church, I ask forgiveness from all, as I give my most heartfelt forgiveness to those who declared themselves my enemies. I believe and hope that had no enemies other than those who were enemies of Iberia-Iberia, which I will love until the last moment and which I promised to serve until my dying breath, which is near. Do not forget that the enemies of Iberia and of Christian civilization are watching, and you should also be watchful and should lay aside all personal gain in favor of the goals and interests of our homeland and of the Iberian people. Continue striving to obtain social justice and education for all Iberians and make use of the rich multiplicity of its regions as a fountain of strength for a continued united Iberia. I would like in these, my last moments, to join the names of God and Iberia, and for us all to embrace one another and to shout for the last time on the threshold of my death - Arriba Ibéria!"

 #National Union Events  
 IBR.633.t:0 "Channeling Minority Nationalism"
 IBR.633.d:0 "The minorities of Iberia are the nastiest of them all. With frightening dedication, the secessionists are the greatest threat the Union could ever face. At their worst they are able to create 'red zones', isolated pockets of extreme activity. While these red zones are essentially massive targets that are stomped out just as quickly as they appear, it serves as a great example of how unpleasant they can be. For the sake of stability these occurrences need to be reduced or even stopped.\n\nInitially, the plan was just to simply channel it towards foreigners. There was an issue with this, though, and it was that we didn't have any plan beyond 'point them at the outsiders'. So we put our best minds at the Axencia to it, and after laboring day and night they presented a more in-depth plan. All that remains is to put the plan into effect, and watch them flock to our banner."
 IBR.633.a:0 "What are we waiting for?"

 IBR.634.t:0 "Continuing The Integration"
 IBR.634.d:0 "We must integrate the minorities into Spanish society. It is the only way, or else we will be prey to eternal terrorism and destabilization from the more radical elements of their people. Minority cultures must die. The first step is to eliminate their language. Only Castilian will be taught in schools, and local media will never use local languages. Like Franco's policies, total immersion in the language coupled with allowing no further instruction of minority language will kill it off until everyone speaks Castilian or Portuguese. After that comes the second phase, where the differences between Castilian and the minority cultures will be slowly eroded until they are the same. Then, no matter what they say they are, they will be Spanish. There's an issue and it's obvious: this will cause a lot of anger. The policies aren't negotiable so it's necessary to find another way to quell most of the unrest.\n\nAnd a contingency plan is exactly what's planned. Should the minorities get too uppity then we'll arrange a meeting with several leaders of their community, and offer them some apparent 'guaranteed rights and privileges' in exchange for them publicly denouncing any separatist forces. What we'll fail to mention is that there is a loophole or an override for all of these, rendering them moot. By then, it'll be too late to object to them."
 IBR.634.a:0 "Who do you think will go first, the Galician or the Catalonian?"
 
 IBR.635.t:0 "Redefining Separatist Activities"
 IBR.635.d:0 "Too many terrorists slip 'under the radar' just because their crimes aren't legally considered crimes. It is on us to change that. Even there, though, there is still an issue. There's little consensus on just how wide the window of separatism truly is. The dispute got so bad that eventually De Valcàrcel had to step in and set the policy based on his own views on the matter. Coincidentally, his opinions happened to be the harshest of them all.\n\nUnder the new legal definition, separatism extends far beyond simple terrorism. Now, anyone found to be so much as sympathizing with separatists can be charged with the same crimes as the terrorists themselves! That is to say nothing of what now legally constitutes separatism. All that needs to be done is send the new laws to the Axencia Anti-Separatista and direct them to arrest those who had slipped through the cracks previously."
 IBR.635.a:0 "Make sure they have plenty of handcuffs too."

 IBR.636.t:0 "Making Use Of The Cults Of Personality"
 IBR.636.d:0 "The Caudillos were very careful to cultivate a strongly positive public image. In every minute they were revealing themselves to the people they put on an aura of authority and morality - it really looked like they were entirely ready for both their job and working with each other. The idea of two benevolent guardians was able to tame many into obedience, and not having to take action against as many people only served to reinforce the image of kindness, which in turn led to more obedience, and so on. Over time this image has fallen to the wayside because nobody was willing to use it. It's time that we place it back into Iberian society, as it should be.\n\nTo the populace we will portray ourselves as the successors to the Caudillos. We will claim the legacy of the benevolent protectors, and extract what loyalty we can out of that. After all, we are the new Caudillos, following in the steps of the previous ones; and if you followed the old ones why wouldn't you follow us too?"
 IBR.636.a:0 "We only want what's best for them."

 IBR.637.t:0 "The Principles Of Christian Civilization"
 IBR.637.d:0 "Later today we will begin publication of "The Principles Of Christian Civilization", a thesis declaring Iberia to be a society of moral Christians. The thesis will be particularly targeted at the clergy, who will be able to get the ideas out to more people better than we could. Within the thesis we will begin by elaborating on the definition of 'Western Civilization', and how it is founded on Christian values. Through this we can explain how Iberia, a western civilization, is also founded on these Christian values. From here we shall proclaim that the Union will fall into barbarity and chaos without these values. It will be elaborated on what they are: charity, chastity, and obedience for your highers. The three pillars, the fundamentals of any good moral society. It will be a call to all who read it to maintain and spread these values everywhere they go, and to become the paragons of Christianity by following them."
 IBR.637.a:0 "A little bit of religion never hurt anybody."

 IBR.638.t:0 "The Old Propaganda Tactics"
 IBR.638.d:0 "Back in the days of the Caudillos, they used total immersion in propaganda to more effectively persuade people. If there was no other view, then the only perspective would eventually beat you down into accepting it. There was only one issue to this, and it was that it took a very fine level to achieve the desired results. Too much, and you risked apathy. Too little, and you could let some unapproved material slip through the cracks. But not to worry, as the people who worked this before are still around now. Even better, most of them have come to work for us. All we need to do is let the experts run free, and before we know it we'll have the people twisted around our fingers. After all, if anyone can replicate the success of the past, it would have to be the people who enabled it. They will be provided all they need, and a bit more, to make sure any dissidents are relegated to the fringe."
 IBR.638.a:0 "Whatever it takes, so long as it gets results."

 IBR.639.t:0 "Instigating National Fervor"
 IBR.639.d:0 "Propaganda is only one thing, and if it's all you use you'll never get anywhere in your doings. For maximum efficiency there needs to be a drop of truth, or even better a gallon of hatred. In order to really coax an Iberian identity it is necessary that one of the two are utilized. In this case, it would be better to pour on the hate. Then, it can be capitalized on. Find a scapegoat, give them plenty of blame, or make someone look scary, then talk about how you need the military to keep things in order. Emphasize the armed forces, ensure people know how necessary they are. Regardless, with the emphasis on things you can blame, you can more effectively rally people around opposing said thing.\n\nIt is still trivial to assign some incident from a foreign power as an act of malice. Then, once it is established there is a threat, the nation can be whipped up into a frenzy. By using some limited hyperbole to get the desired effect, hate can be channeled away from the state. Because all of their discontent is aimed at someone else they will be far more willing to listen to their betters. While it is unsavory these tactics are necessary to make sure people properly respect authority. The success of this program is already a given, so everything that needs to be done is to set it into motion."
 IBR.639.a:0 "Someone else is the issue, not us."

 IBR.640.t:0 "Striking Against Leftist Influence"
 IBR.640.d:0 "Socialism has been an eternal cancer ever since the day its vile ideas were conceived. They are a dangerous set of principles that fill people with naive beliefs of what is simply impossible in practice. Even worse, they allow for fools and despots to navigate their power, enslaving everyone who dared help them. For their sake, we must stop this ideology where we can. From here on out, all hives of this dangerous thought will be rooted out and removed from Iberia. More importantly, we will be able to rally the populace in opposition to leftism.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the destruction of socialism in Iberia is that it is one of the few things the upper echelons of the party are in total consensus on. They all want it gone, entirely, as soon as possible. The entirety of the Unión Nacional was united in one goal:"
 IBR.640.a:0 "Iberia must never be red, ever."

 IBR.641.t:0 "Investigating The Left Opposition"
 IBR.641.d:0 "Once the discussion turned from the question of elimination socialism to where to start, any semblance of party unity disintegrated. Thankfully this time the situation resolved itself quickly enough to ensure de Valcárcel did not intervene. The first most important step to removing leftism is to destroy their influence in politics. But how? They clearly must be arrested for their harmful beliefs, but there is no valid cause that they may be arrested for. At least, that we know of. That we might not know about some of their doings - of which could be grounds for arrest - was enough to pique the attention of several party members. The next move was already a certainty. The opposition would be investigated, their socialist and separatist ties revealed, and their members arrested. While the circumstances to enable such a move are contrived and tenuous at best, they are necessary to keep Iberia safe. "
 IBR.641.a:0 "The ends justify the means."
 
 IBR.642.t:0 "The Organic State"
 IBR.642.d:0 "Anyone with a brain knows that more things than humans are living beings. For example, the country itself is a living being too. Much like an organism, the state is comprised of many lesser parts who, all together, create something far greater than each other separate. Nowhere is this more true than Iberia, where several regions come together to form a greater whole. Much like an organism, however, there cannot be room for deviation. All parts must perform their dedicated function, and allowing anything to stray from their role will hamper the function of the whole. This school of thought is one that needs to be applied to all levels of government, and until it is accepted by the people it must be hammered into their heads that they ought to hush up about their grievances, and allow the dedicated leadership organ to do their job, just as they ought to do theirs."
 IBR.642.a:0 "No one can stand if their arm is fighting their leg."
 
 IBR.643.t:0 "Enforcing Catholic Social Doctrine"
 IBR.643.d:0 "A truly moral society is one based on her religion. In order to have a strong union we must lean on our traditions, and the faith is the strongest of all traditions. Therefore, Catholicism should be raised up, and injected into Iberian society. Thankfully there is a pre-established doctrine for placing religion as a main pillar of daily life. The value of the common good above all else is paramount. If one focuses on the individual, then they will neglect the whole to the detriment of the common good.\n\nOf course we lack the support to properly put this into effect. In order to move things along we will need to rely on support outside of our party. Due to their ideological proximity we will discuss the matter with some of the more malleable members of the Alianza Popular. In order to secure the success of the Catholic social doctrine the party must be convinced. Without their support, it will not be possible to achieve our goals."
 IBR.643.a:0 "So you'd best be persuasive."
 
 IBR.644.t:0 "Discussing Corporatist Economics"
 IBR.644.d:0 "No-one could ever deny that morality and piety are critical to the national health of Iberia. However, simply posing these as the end-all be-all of the nation's well being could not be farther from the truth. Any state is tied to their economy, and the prosperity of one spurs the prosperity of the other.\n\nAt least, that is how it should be. Unfortunately, 'should' is frequently replaced with something else. A privatized economy is a good example of something that is anything other than 'should'. Iberia has the right to her own destiny and self-determination. With the corporations of foreign people in charge of her economy, the Union lacks that self-determination, since it cannot exercise sovereignty over every bit they ought to. Therefore, a new system needs to be put in place. Every segment of the economy will be placed under the control of a corporate block, who will then operate it for the common good.\n\nThis matter is undoubtedly unpopular, despite its benefit. Without the support of the Alianza Popular, the corporatist system has no chance of success. Therefore discussions will be held in order to convince the other party that this system will be something worth supporting. Their success is critical."
 IBR.644.a:0 "I'm getting really tired of having to ask others to get anything done."
 
 IBR.645.t:0 "The New History Curriculum"
 IBR.645.d:0 "Iberian history isn't correctly written. Between outright Socialist lies and slightly less harmful half-truths it is easier to say what isn't false. Since our power is secure it is our solemn duty to change that.\n\nThe people of Iberia are held back by the deceptions and so they must be changed. The first truth is that the Caudillos weren't the best for either Spain or Portugal. Everyone knows that, but it is more nuanced than that. Like it or not they were stabilizing figures, and this fact needs to be represented in history. Equally so is the depiction of the empires that preceded Iberia. They aren't given a fair chance, and their qualities - such as their abilities to civilize and bring holiness to savages - are sorely missed.\n\nWhile only a sample of the sweeping reforms that are necessary to properly show the Union's history, it needs to be mentioned how monumental this project is. Once the new curriculum is fully written, it will be printed into new textbooks, and sent off to every school free of charge. After that it is only a matter of time."
 IBR.645.a:0 "There is something truly beautiful in seeing the world for how it really is."
 
 IBR.646.t:0 "Targeting The Fundamental Laws"  
 IBR.646.d:0 "De Valcàrcel sat secluded in his study. The sun had long since set and the night had gone on so long that it was closer to sunrise than sunset. It was at this late hour that the party leader contemplated. Sleep had nearly consumed him, but he would not let it until he knew what he was going to do.\n\nLate at night was hardly an apt time to consider matters of state, but there was simply no time to do it elsewhere. There was one thing on the man's mind: their political career. No matter what they did, where they did, it was always blocked by the opposition! Even when they weren't doing it the Alianza Popular made sure to stick their noses in too. Nothing got done, and nothing could be done! A rage was boiling up from the party leader's depths, but he bit it down.\n\nPiecing together a solution only took a few minutes. If the opposition always got in the way... then they'd need to be shoved out of the way, or better yet ran over. As a draft was drawn up and plans were born, Valcàrcel's expression went from anger, to smugness, to excitement.\n\nThe scribble of pencil continued all through the night. When the Francoist finally woke up again he found a - barely legible - set of documents and a burned out lamp bulb."
 IBR.646.a:0 "Acceptable. At least now we have the means to make sure we're properly heard."

Iberia was the least of all evils, it argued, because unlike everyone else it didn't wish to kill you for existing. Anything that dissented with this opinion was swiftly silenced, in order to make sure the narrative was kept vigorous and consistent.\n\nClearly, it didn't work. Whether by leaked documents, a breach in the net, or just from plain disbelief, the idea that the Union was the least of all evils just didn't stick with the population. If anything, they seem to be even angrier. The intent was to decrease terrorist support among minorities, but the opposite has occurred. From the perspective of the average citizen, supporting a separatist, despite the risks, has become far more palatable. After all, they'd not be victim to Iberia anymore."

While quite a few didn't fall for the ruse, they found it way harder to enlist the aid of their countrymen, who increasingly saw their methods as futile, dangerous, and self-destructive."

 IBR.650.d:0 "Unfortunate news! We had plotted for the Axencia to be more effective, but the new versions of separatism have only reduced their effectiveness. Rather than simply doing their job a sizeable number of agents have opted to disobey or even sabotage operations. Those that haven't have nearly unanimously put in a formal complaint: our new definitions are horrid, and the Axencia cannot operate using them. The arguments from this have varied from their draconic nature to the inability to feasibly execute them. What they have not seemed to consider is that, by the new laws, this is also separatism. The response is obvious. All protestors of the new programs will be arrested and replaced with people more dedicated to their jobs. Sadly, this will render the Axencia nearly inactive until it is properly reorganized. "
 IBR.650.a:0 "It's better than what we have now...?"

 IBR.651.t:0 "Separatist Arrests Cause Legal Chaos!"
 IBR.651.d:0 "We have gone overboard with the crackdown. Our agents displayed an unusual zealotry in enforcing the new anti-separatist regulations, and have arrested an obscene number of suspects from all around the peninsula. By itself this is no negative - it is a strong positive, as these are people who can no longer threaten Iberia - but there is more to complicate the situation. So many people have been arrested in such a short amount of time that we cannot keep up with it. There is an overwhelming number of prisoners to process, trials to be held, and legal challenges to bat down. All these issues will be sorted, and the initial wave of arrests will eventually die down, but it will take time. Valuable time in which the Axencia will effectively be at a standstill until the holding facilities have enough space to house arrests again."
 IBR.651.a:0 "Just keep going. We can keep this up; they can't."

 IBR.652.t:0 "Protests Against Anti-Separatist Arrests!"
 IBR.652.d:0 "For a while, the new separatist definitions worked. Our men were dedicated, and the prisoner flow was not so much as to overwhelm our processes. As time went on, it appeared as if it had gone as expected. Sadly, it didn't. Once more suspects were arrested we moved higher up, going from random people to more important figures who now lacked a support base to back them. The convicted separatists were able to cause quite a stir among the public, who now organize campaigns of disobedience against us in retaliation. While only a matter of time until the incidents fade from the public eye and these protests become bad memories, until they are forgotten the Axencia will be operating on a handicap. It is far harder to find separatists among a populace who wishes to spite the authorities. "

 IBR.653.d:0 "One moment, the man was delivering a speech to the assembled crowd of citizens from Bilbao. The next, he was dead on the ground, with a hole through his chest. A gunshot was audible, but the shooter was nowhere to be seen. Even though the former bodyguards of the deputy and later the Guardia Civil began a sweep for the killer, he could not be found.\n\nEven though it has only been an exceptionally rare occurrence, the recent murder of a deputy of the Unión Nacional has sparked a new wave of fear in the party. Many members are afraid that they would be next in a chain of assassinations, and the attitude has had a negative impact on productivity. Instead of doing their job, some members are more concerned with obsessively securing themselves in the event of an attempted killing. The fear will eventually dissipate into nothing, given time and assuming no other murders take place. It has already done its damage, and the shortfall of work done has temporarily paralyzed Iberia, as the time wasted was needed to make sure the absence of several deputies would not be a negative effect."

After the last object falls into the greedy embrace of the fire the bunch stop a moment more to admire their handywork, then flee off into the darkness of the country.\n\nIncidents of this sort - symbolic destruction of anything in Spanish - have grown more popular since the continuation of the integration efforts. Given recent circumstances, they seem certain to only get more commonplace. Leaders of minority communities have all squarely refused to negotiate, taking stances that vary from neutrality to outright support of what they consider 'just' resistance against Iberia. Given the substantial influence these figures hold within their communities, combined with the integration policies, supporting separatists is far easier to swallow for most. Even worse, more have taken on the mantle of freedom fighter in an attempt to "liberate" their people."

Coaxing them into a negotiation to bring it all to an end was a simple matter. The verbal back-and-forth, plotted out by the National Union, ended with the intended response: the participating minority leaders condemned the actions of their separatists, and in return rights and privileges were guaranteed by the government. By the time they had realized these wouldn't mean anything, the damage had been done. The calls for compliance echoed louder than the cries of betrayal, and so many who would have before resisted instead found it easier to cooperate."

Though not universally followed by priests, many were willing to oblige the Principles. Their intended message was simple and because of that it was simple to work it into something else.\n\nEven through all of this the Principles simply weren't enough. They simply lacked the longevity to stick with those receptive to the idea, a group outnumbered by the group that wasn't. A lasting impression only developed among only a small few. A religious incentive to not rock the boat was simply not going to be, and forcing the issue would only make things worse. So, the Principles passed on as a barely-remembered memory."

In a public statement a clique of key Alianza Popular figures condemned the ideas contained within the Principles, decrying them as a 'lamentable perversion of religion' and even outright calling it 'francoist in nature'. While this proclamation had little effect on those already not in favor of the mandate, to those who thought something of it this was a very effective turnoff. At the urging of the Alianza Popular the more religiously minded of Iberia found themselves a bit less trusting of their ruling government, as a state that was so willing to pervert the meaning of the faith was not their state at all."

 IBR.659.d:0 "It is a chilly morning in Lisbon. But the inclement weather didn't seem to stop a crowd from turning up. Gathered in front of a government building, a cluster of individuals especially stood blocking the way into the building. When an official or a clerk tried to make their way inside someone moved over to stop them. This continued for what felt like an eternity as morning turned to day and only got warmer. Finally, the police arrived. Though some appeared sluggish and reluctant the law enforcement agents did their duty and dispersed the crowds. While functions were able to continue on after that, the damage had been done. Half the day had been wasted by protestors, and function was crippled for a substantial time after.\n\nThis was not the only city this occurred in. Every major city (and some minor too) in the Union had a similar rally, as protestors blocked off government functions as best they could for as long as they could. The emphasis on military and it's necessity caused a large amount of discontent, and so the average citizen was just a little bit less trusting of their government."

 IBR.660.d:0 "Over the course of our crusade to root out bolshevism, dissent has spread to every area of government. Everywhere that we do not directly control has been victim to some sort of agitation or discontent from more foolish souls. Falling under the socialist falsehood that the investigation is not in their best interests multiple figures in the Congress have spoken out against it, declaring it 'unjustified'. This sentiment has gradually diffused into the general populace, sparking dissent and outrage everywhere it goes. Sadly it appears an uproar has already been whipped up and so citizens have began a series of rallies and protests against the investigation into the political left-wing.\n\nThe mass of objectors have one demand: the immediate cessation of the investigation. As there are a large amount of people who have made their opposition vocal folding to their demands is an entirely possible option. Of course, it is also possible to simply send in the Guardia Civil to force them to disperse. The action will not be popular but against law enforcement agents they will be forced to comply."

Crackdowns and forced dispersals have only made the affair less popular with the population. Even worse, it has given a more convincing excuse to call the investigation off. The argument espoused by leftist mouthpieces is that, since it causes enough to force a police presence, it clearly isn't that democratic. The crowd who wishes to oppose us no matter what we do has latched on to this and parroted it to no end.\n\nSince any protest against the action is shut down by the Guardia Civil not long after it begins, we can simply keep on as planned. Public outrage is nothing new, and it will subside with time. Alternatively it would be simple to just call the investigation off. A move like that could save face among elements of the public and would in effect be cutting our losses."

Not even the tiniest violation - they had run an exemplary campaign.\n\nIt wouldn't do. The public reaction - all that for nothing - would be horrible. In these moments of unfiltered desperation, a plan was concocted; if there was nothing to be found, then something would need to be 'found'. This idea was very popular among the party, but simply calling it a day never fell out of favor.

Expecting a group that would leave once asked a bit firmer than nicely, the Guardia Civil were caught entirely by surprise when the people started responding with violence. As time went on a questionable response caused things to only get worse. The Barcelona Incident, as it was later called, was really set in motion by a perfectly positioned car bomb. When the situation escalated the Guardia Civil were caught even more by surprise and were nearly entirely forced out of Barcelona by rioting citizens. What was most devastating about the whole affair, however, was that the law enforcement was humiliated. Unable to entirely contain the situation in a timely manner, they instead were forced to cordon the affected areas off and choke off the riot.\n\nIt appears this wave of unrest stemmed from the accusations levied towards the more left-wing politicians, which were flawed and easily debunked. The idea of evidence being faked in such a fashion seemed only to enrage the population, laying the groundwork for today's tragedy. "

Worse, it was considered by most to be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nOutside of the frontlines, incidents had occurred that could almost be considered optimal. The Axencia discovered a group of Catalonian terrorists planning to incite violence by detonating a bomb during the rally in Barcelona. Thanks to some 'convenient' and legitimate appearing documents, the attempting bombing was able to be tied to the more leftist areas of Iberian politics.

Another small segment of the populace took active hostility against the doctrine. Seeing a 'malicious pattern' in what it attempted to convey led to them opposing it everywhere they found it. To both extremes it was a matter of harsh contention, but the majority didn't think anything of it either way.

Unfortunately, without their full support the doctrine is dead. Even though it would likely be possible to compromise on a neutered version of the proposal doing so would render it pointless. Though it is true that there are some, namely the loyalists, would vote in favor of the measure anyway, they are insignificant.

The prevailing concern among the AP was the 'Francoist' nature of the proposal, but this seemed to not play large enough of a part to significantly influence the outcome.\n\nThe importance of this support cannot be understated. This initial support sets the foundation for a trend that can be capitalized upon later on. Additionally, this means that we are able to move through, unrestricted, with the Catholic social doctrine. Nothing will be left out, and everything will be just as hoped. More advantageous than even the trend of support set by this move is the influence it grants us within the Alianza Popular.

Once the far-reaching nature of our policies became obvious, the tone of negotiations changed drastically. From one of those present, 'the whole place dropped a few degrees. Nearly anyone who got what we meant gave us some kind of look.'\n\nWithout these discussions any chances of securing Alianza Popular support for the policy are gone.

If we do not, then the deal is off.\n\nThe prospect of planning an entire system in the space of twenty-four hours proved too much for our economists. Their relief was palpable when it was revealed that much of it was already planned. The ideals were there, and only the minutiae between them needed to be plotted out.

Rapidly rallying their supporters in Madrid, the opposition have used their useful idiots for two purposes. Firstly, they have harassed Unión Nacional members. Even worse is their second use, in which they have been used as leverage to reverse the measures before they go into full swing.\n\nFrom their advantageous position the protestors are capable of placing an immense pressure on the government, which could easily be assuaged by calling the policies off. The side effect of this would be that this would embolden the opposition, which could threaten to deadlock the already fragile system.

We have fallen under attack from short-sighted figures from every end of the political spectrum, and the whole affair has been very unpleasant.\n\nEverything we could do to save our situation was to rapidly roll back the corporatist system. This has not saved much, but it left a salvageable sum we would lack from doubling down. It has inspired a wave of militants and reprobates to begin vocal opposition to our party.

Despite the Alianza Popular's willingness to go along or at least compromise on most matters, they no longer wish to associate themselves with us on economic matters. It will not be an issue in the short term, but once the economy requires further calibration we will find ourselves in unfortunate circumstances.\n\nEven though the Alianza Popular's disappointment was wounding, worst of all was the rifts created within the Unión Nacional.

In their place were a number of 'decoy' documents, which only held up to a quick glance's inspection.\n\nA scandal this size has never been seen before, and getting away from it before consequences come crashing down is probably impossible. Attempts to deflect or divert the public anger have failed. Rather than be mad at the criminals who leaked it, they have instead opted to be angry at the people being leaked.

In these reached people it found more supporters, and so on. The whole thing had nearly irreversibly spiraled out of control by the time it made its way to Valcàrcel's attention.

Francoism was a mistake, and they deceived the Alianza Popular into supporting it. Because of this, the two parties would never associate again. Instead of just staying alone, they would instead work with a separate organization to bring the Unión Nacional their day of reckoning.\n\nWhile most of this was to be expected given the circumstances, the final statement worried Valcàrcel.

First things first.\n\nThe man looked around, until he found what he wanted to see: an entrance, left unattended. The door stood wide open. All it would take is the attention to be focused somewhere else. So de Valcàrcel tapped the shoulder of another party member - a dedicated, trustworthy hardliner - and gave him some simple instructions. Cause a fuss, make a scene, just draw all the attention to you.\n\nAs the man made a fool of himself to a watching audience, de Valcàrcel crept out of the room and through the hallways. Keeping hidden as to make sure nobody saw him sneaking around, he looked through room and room, searching for a very particular object. He would call the Guardia Civil, and have them arrest the opposition! The only issue was to find a phone that also wasn't monitored. Finally, as he found himself near an office room, he saw exactly what he was looking for."

 IBR.681.t:0 "Unión Nacional Stands Down"
 IBR.681.d:0 "As de Valcàrcel looked around, he contemplated the futility of his situation. There was no way he could slip out of the Chamber. There was no way anyone else could, either. Even then, he spent a few awkward minutes trying to puzzle his way out of the room. Once he was fully confident he couldn't - a process of elimination that was increasingly painful the longer it went on - he simply couldn't find it in him to keep going. His gaze locked to the floor, shoulders slumped, he walked forward and grabbed a resignation form, and sloppily signed his signature.\n\nWith his position forfeit and his presence no longer justified, de Valcàrcel shuffled his way out of the Chamber. The guards stepped aside to let him through. After the departure of their leader, the Unión Nacional's members slowly filtered out too, and after a while the party was no more."

 IBR.682.t:0 "Democratic Salvation Coalition Takes Control"
 IBR.682.d:0 "Now that the Unión Nacional has been decapitated, we find ourselves dominant in the Congress. Without their leadership they are relegated to that of a writhing snake, waiting for someone to put them out of their misery. That someone needs to be us. However, a large number of obstacles remain in our way to save the Union.\n\nTheir first failsafe is in the bureaucracy. The Unión Nacional has sunk their talons deep, and a large amount of administrators still have loyalty - or sympathies - for the Francoists. These unknown loyalties could prove detrimental, and if they aren't eliminated it could stop any meaningful reform.\n\nIt is undeniable that the UN managed to take a near-frightening grasp on the population, especially in the conservative sectors. This same grip allowed them to do a large amount of damage to Iberian society, with harmful religious propaganda, inflamed minority tensions, and nearly assert their control for a "New State".\n\nEven though their influence and reach were nearly all-encompassing, their more authoritarian policies provide a good framework to tear down the last resurgence of Franco's loyalists. Regardless of even that they still have many loyalists and sympathizers in the lower levels of the Union, and the minority groups are still enraged. All of these challenges together seem insurmountable, which begs the question:"
 IBR.682.a:0 "Could democracy be saved?"
 
 IBR.683.t:0 "Contacting The Guardia Civil"
 IBR.683.d:0 "When de Valcàrcel made a run for the nearest office, he knew his largest threat would be some Coalition goon wrestling him out and away from the phone. Once he was in the room, he pulled a chair to the door and blocked it. Then, he put another chair with it too. As the door was now adequately blocked for his standards, he tread over to the telephone, placing in the three numbers for emergency services. A one... another one... and a two.\n\n"How can we help?"\n\n"This is de Valcàrcel, they've taken the whole house hostage!" He glances outside - nobody has come yet. Then he glances back to the receiver. The voice on the other side was taking too long to answer. Could something be wr-\n\n"Don't worry, señor Valcàrcel. We're sending people right now. Can you wait for a few minutes?""
 IBR.683.a:0 ""Why yes, yes, I think I can.""
 
 IBR.684.t:0 "Guardia Civil Enter The House Of Deputies" 
 IBR.684.d:0 "As it turns out, the Guardia Civil only needed four minutes. Because the office de Valcàrcel had hid in was near an entrance, he didn't have to wait much longer than four minutes for his salvation. Creating a commotion as he threw his makeshift barricade to the ground and rushed through the door to the authorities. He proclaimed to them to follow him, as he would personally oversee the arrests of the traitors. The walk was short, and any Coalition member he came across moved out of the way of his army, though they weren't being arrested - likely being left for later.\n\nTriumphantly, he marched into the Chamber of Deputies with his entourage close behind him. After allowing his party a moment or two of jeering, he began to speak to the opposition. There would be no resignation, only arrests. All traitors to Iberia and the Union will be arrested, and then the country would finally be free. "
 IBR.684.a:0 "Check."
 
 IBR.685.t:0 "Guardia Civil Expels National Union, Arrests Leaders"
 IBR.685.d:0 "On and on continued de Valcàrcel, ranting and raving about anything that crossed his mind, made him mad, and could vaguely be tied to the Alianza Popular. He was fully engrossed in his speech. As such, he failed to notice the Guardia Civil moving near the Unión Nacional members, slowly surrounding them. It was only when a party leader pushed back against an officer and was wrestled to the floor. The noise of the fight was enough to knock de Valcàrcel out of his trance, and as he turned to look he was handcuffed.\n\nMeagre protest was all the man could raise, and the knowledge that everything he did was going to be undone collapsed on him. Most didn't see much, but a younger man saw the leader of the Unión Nacional in tears as he walked by - a sight more pitiful than anything. The rest of the Unión Nacional was escorted out shortly behind him. Awkwardly shuffling towards the near exit, most left with either silence or quiet muttering."

 IBR.5412.d:0 "Unfortunately, we can't rule alone. If we could, the country would be back under a rightful eye and a strong director. Our coalition partner, the Alianza Popular, is still an independent party, and so we need to keep them happy, for the most part. Usually, the most it takes is a concession on some policy or another. With the recent crisis unfolding, we can compromise on plenty of things to get them to keep their heads down.\n\nThe recent drop in oil has made it necessary for non-essential workers to stay home, for conservation. They simply burn too much oil in transit, as well as with running the actual places of work. We can't stop many private workers, but several state professions have been called to stay home to preserve fuel. The Alianza, ever the fiscal hawks, have lobbied for the salaries of these public workers to be frozen, or reduced in proportion to the hours they currently work. We have to do something at the minimum, but if we go as far as the Alianza Popular desires then we may lose support from the people whose salaries have suddenly disappeared. Of course, this may give us a perfect opportunity to extend our influence over them..."

 IBR.5413.t:0 "Collecting Additional Revenue"
 IBR.5413.d:0 "Oil use needs to be curbed. It has to be curbed, in fact, if Iberia wants to keep functioning. We need to make sure our use of the black gold is less than the scant amounts we can acquire, until the shortage is concluded.\n\nThe current proposal is a raised consumption tax, effectively discouraging oil use by taxing people extra for using it. This plan has attracted remarkable support, both from our coalition and from the other parties. Using this once-in-a-lifetime bipartisan support, the law itself is a certainty. The only question is how to best apply the tax.\n\nBack when Franco was in charge, the government didn't need to concern itself with popular support. They simply did what was best, without boiling it down to sate the masses. Franco is no longer here, and his government gone, and to ever bring it back we will need the support of the people. The law would undoubtedly work better if we applied it universally, but if we were to spare the common worker from it, then we would definitely gain their support. Either will work, it is just a question of which is best."

They thought themselves very clever, with their extortion and their ability to hide horrible deals just under the surface. The creditors have greatly reduced their demands after we threatened to destroy them with full force. It isn't a bad thing by any means, but there is the possibility of gaining more.\n\nThe government is definitely not the only group these bastards have scammed, and if we do nothing we will be far from the last. We could definitely make use of these services more than once - though what would bring us there is unknowable - if we kept them going. If we were to try them for their usury and make a great show of it, then it would undoubtedly be a great victory in the eyes of the common man."

Of course, they were not watching him yet- he still had some brief time before he was live. He was worried, for a moment, but the politician crushed his doubt like a separatist. He was Franco's successor, damnit, and he would need to speak like it too. Allowing doubt to fester would be a betrayal of Iberia.\n\nOnce he was live, he began to speak. Emphasizing with grand, sweeping movements of his hands, Valcarcel spoke of the need for unity, above all else.\n\nOr at least, he would have if he had not knocked down his water bottle. He had totally stopped, staring at the water bottle- for far too long - before picking it up in spite of the puddle it had made, and then recomposed himself.\n\n"This must not destroy our Union, Iberians! We are one country, united by our common heritage, and we must act like it! This is your struggle, and it is the struggle of the National Union, and it is the struggle of Iberia! We..." He trailed off, having forgotten the rest of his sentence. "...We will struggle together! Iberia will be united in prosperity, but first it must struggle united through hardship!"\n\nOnce all was said and done, Valcarcel found that it could have gone far worse. His voice cracked, but at least it was only once."

His Eminency spoke about the importance of faith and union in these troubled times, as the Caudillos are getting older and the power in the Union is being transferred from their hands into the Council's, the Archbishop has made use of a metaphor comparing the essence of the Nation with the development of life. At his start the child as well as the Nation must be brought up with a strong hand so he learns obedience and doesn't deviate from the right path, as the child matures the father should start to be more lenient with his offspring and allow him to relish his independence and find his place in the world, if these steps are followed thoroughly the child will make her father proud even after his death.

 IBR.750.d:0 "The flash of a dozen camera's went off as Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete emerged into the conference room and took the podium. If the newly appointed head of the Guardia Civil was nervous, few could tell. Back straight, his face a visage of determined calm, he was a military man through and through. All knew his record: A former Falangist and veteran of the notorious Division Azul which fought for Nazi Germany, he had now chosen to side with Iberian democracy and the Democratic Salvation Coalition.\n\n"Good morning," he began, greeting the assembled journalists. "I am here today in my capacity as Director General of the Guardia Civil to announce that by direction from the Minister of the Interior, the Guardia Civil, alongside the National Police Corps, the Municipal Police, and other regional law enforcement agencies, have begun a nation-wide inter-agency investigation into the involvement of federal agencies, government organizations, and state officials in the election of the Unión Nacional. It is the belief of the Guardia Civil, and the newly convened Democratic Salvation Coalition, that forces within the Iberian state manipulated the election result, ensuring a win for Unión Nacional in full knowledge of their plans to subvert the constitution."\n\nBefore he could even finish two dozen hands shot up while the room exploded into a cacophony of questions. Topete simply held his hand up, calling for silence.\n\n"Now, before I answer any questions, I wish to address those who may be listening who assisted in this plot. I say to you: Turn yourselves in. The Unión Nacional has been defeated. There is no further cause for undermining the Iberian constitution with the aim of restoring the Unión Nacional to its position of power.

 IBR.751.d:0 "Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete looked over the list one last time. There were many names he knew here, men who he had fought with during the civil war, even some he had fought alongside in Russia with the Division Azul. Such men would surely call him a turncoat, a traitor to the Falange, Caudillo Franco, and the Iberian nation. Aramburu didn't much care what they thought anymore. In his many years in the military he had always made choices based on what he felt was most in line with law, order, and security. During his youth that had meant siding with Franco against the terroristic insanity of communism. Now it meant siding with Iberian democracy against his former comrades and their fanatical authoritarianism. \n\nThe list was long, some 300 pages, containing the names of thousands of government employees, army officers, civil bureaucrats, and electoral officials, all party to the conspiracy to rig the elections in favor of the Unión Nacional. Hundreds of confessions had been correlated and compiled, leading to an ever growing number of exposed traitors. Most if not all would be charged with serious crimes, but that would have to wait. Now it was time to purge them all from their positions, and ensure they couldn't do any more damage.\n\nPlacing the list in his briefcase and getting up to head to the Ministry of the Interior, where he would present the Guardia Civil's findings to the new government, Aramburu could not shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The list was larger than even he had expected, and if the Unión Nacional had this much support inside the state, there was no telling how much they still had outside of it."

But now all we can guarantee is that the names that were listed will soon be serving prison terms for violating our new electoral system.\n\nIt is a shame that it has come to this, but we can at least show to the world that we will take our new democracy seriously."

But when the Guardia Civil went to seize the Unión Nacional records, all they were confronted with was many empty filing cabinets and piles of ashes in the party headquarters. All of the party's records from the last election have simply gone up in smoke.\n\nClearly, this was to hide their illegal activities of voter fraud, and to prevent the police and government from taking legal action. They have managed to hide their network of agents and saboteurs seeking to destroy our nascent democracy through fire and smoke. While we don't have any hard evidence, an officer of the Guardia Civil, speaking anonymously to the press, revealed our discovery. This has led to denunciations in the newspapers, and in turn the anger of the Iberian people. The UN is scrambling to respond to this incriminating act."

Teams have been working around the clock to sort through the files and determine if something, anything illegal or incriminating has been discovered. So far, the answer is... very little. Maybe some of the entries in ledgers could be seen as possible evidence of voter fraud, but there is nothing solid or definite, and no 'smoking gun' that can unravel the whole mystery. What we have will help us, but it's not enough.\n\nThis is disconcerting, to say the least. Either the UN has managed to keep a massive voter fraud scheme virtually under wraps, or, much more concerning to our government, the UN has much more support than we realize.

Sitting in a bulletproof car across from the building, he radioed the order to begin the operation.\n\nThe building was stormed quickly, with no casualties. It seems that any of the Falangists who remained had chosen to surrender rather than make a last stand. Hearing that the coast was clear, Aramburu exited the vehicle, and headed through the front doors to the building. Entering the lobby, he found his men detaining several Falangists in military uniform, on their knees with their hands cuffed behind their backs.\n\n"Aramburu, you traitor," one of them spat, looking up at him. The Director General did not recognize him. Perhaps one of his former subordinates in the Civil Guard. "What is the meaning of this? This is private property. You have no right to be here."\n\n"I am here on orders of the Minister of the Interior and the Court of Auditors," he replied, ignoring the disdain of the prisoners. "You are to hand over all documents pertaining to the last election so that they may be submitted as part of the government's review of the election results. Where do you keep your files?"\n\n"Burn in hell," the Falangist scoffed, a look of disgust across his face. "You will get nothing out of us."\n\nAramburu sighed. He had hoped to avoid such unpleasantness.\n\n"Take them away," he said, turning to his men. "And scour the building. Their files should be here somewhere.""

We are certain that the UN has committed voter fraud and conspiracy against the state.\n\nThe trial will last many days, perhaps weeks, as prosecutors present their evidence, the defense tries to handwave it away or call out flaws in their opponents arguments. It will be prime television to a populace divided, with Nationalists believing that we are simply punishing the UN for having the audacity to contest elections, or that of the supporters of the Democratic Salvation Council are infuriated that their votes may have been stolen from them, and many, many more wait to make their final judgement.\n\nBut many already realize that old habits die hard, and the efforts by the Nationalists to rig the elections to turn out in their favor must be punished to the full extent of the law if democracy in Iberia is to mean anything."

But even more supporters of other parties are on the streets as well, believing that the elected government is on the verge of being overthrown in a coup, leading to clashes between the two groups on side streets throughout Madrid. Guardia Civil and police are doing their best to maintain control, but some looting, arson, violence, beatings and arrests are occurring as well.\n\nTo make matters worse for our government, Caudillos Franco and Caetano have sent a joint letter to the Democratic Salvation Council that we should resign our positions immediately, and to turn power over to "the rightfully elected government of the Iberian Union," meaning of course, the Unión Nacional.\n\nBut we know full well that the UN has committed voter fraud.

As more and more evidence is brought to light in the trial of the complex vote rigging scheme that the UN undertook, the masses are coming around to our side, and acknowledging that, well, maybe the UN did something wrong. Even the Caudillos have gone silent, perhaps realizing that they were backing the wrong horse. Or, more likely, that it would look really bad for them to stand in the way of democracy and the law.\n\nSome diehard supporters of the UN maintain a lonely vigil outside the courthouse, but they are outnumbered by the police and counter-protestors that support our effort to maintain the rule of law. At the start of every morning, the number of UN protesters continues to shrink from the previous night's numbers, showing that even they must realize that they are on the losing end against democracy and freedom."

 IBR.761.t:0 "Breaking The Corporatist Policies" 
 IBR.761.d:0 "The Democratic Salvation Council has proclaimed a series of decrees to end the Corporatist domination of the economy of the past, and to bring Iberia closer in line with other democratic nations of the world. First and foremost, the big monopolies that had been set up will be disbanded, to establish competition in the economy, which will drive down prices and increase wages. The restrictions and bans on labor movements have been lifted, which will give the workers a say in how they are to be treated by their employers. We will also institute a minimum wage pegged to the yearly inflation rate, so that all workers have a chance to make a living.\n\nIt will take more laws and many more years of work to fully decorporatize the Iberian economy, but this is a first step."

 IBR.762.d:0 "The government has just passed a new education law which will provide a sweeping overhaul of the curriculum by sweeping away the dictatorship's propagandized elements of the system. First and foremost, the "national spirit formation" and "housework" subjects that many a young Iberian had grown to loathe over time will be ended entirely. In line with that, the portraits of the Caudillos will no longer be placed in every classroom, schools can now no longer raise the national flag at the beginning of the week and take it down at the end, college students are no longer required to sign an oath of allegiance to the state, the daily prayer and allegiance to the state have been removed.\n\nBut the biggest concern will be that of the subjects that are taught. While mathematics and science will be less affected, there are some that will need to be overhauled: for example, we will encourage more diversity in the reading materials in both Spanish and Protugese classes. History, however, is the biggest issue. The new law sets up a non-partisan board of historians and academics to rewrite the history textbooks, to provide a more equal and balanced subject for our students to learn at all levels of education. While we can still take pride in Iberia through the study of history, we must also recognize that we had done bad or terrible things in our past, and must acknowledge them."

 IBR.763.d:0 "The new election laws have been passed and signed into law! Many new safeguards and mechanics have been put in place to ensure that our elections will be free, fair, and no longer tainted by authoritarians.\n\nThe new election law will make it very difficult to corrupt the vote, but also place enormous penalties on those that attempt to do so. While most of the law deals with the minor details to ensure that elections are fair, some of the most important aspects of the law is simple to understand: an impartial, non-partisan group will be in charge to provide the ballots, the ballot boxes, and set up polling places, as well as educating the public in how the elections work. The parties themselves will be banned from the polling places: no party posters, campaigners or materials will be allowed within 50 meters of any polling station. Guardia Civil officers will be present to oversee the voting at all times, to ensure that the ballot boxes are not tampered with, and at the end of the voting, three Guardia Civil Officers, chosen from outside the district that they are stationed in for this day, will take the ballot boxes to a secure location to be counted and verified.\n\nNow that a strong and enforceable election law is in place, the Democratic National Salvation Council has announced that they are resigning, dissolving the Iberian Council, and new elections will be held."
 IBR.763.a:0 "And this time, there will be no funny business!"
 
 IBR.764.t:0 "Guardia Civil Dispatched To Guard Polls" 
 IBR.764.d:0 "With the election taking place in a few days, the caretaker government has ordered the Guardia Civil to take up their stations at the thousands of polling places set up across Iberia, from the little towns of the Basque country, to the sprawling centers of Madrid and Lisbon. But unlike under the dictatorship, where the steely faced policemen were there to intimidate the voters to make the right choice, now they are there to scare away those that would try to tamper with the election, and to ensure that the voting is free and fair.\n\nMany other Guardia Civil officers are stationed across the Union to keep an eye on the rallies and parades, to ensure that no violence comes to pass. The head of the Guardia Civil gave explicit orders: no violence of any kind, by any party or group, is to be tolerated. If an agitator is trying to rile up the crowd, they are to be arrested. If a mob starts to form, they are to be broken up. If anyone tries to hamper anyone from voting, they will be charged with voter fraud and taken into custody. There will be no repeat of the last election.\n\nFor soon, millions will go to the polls, and will freely and fairly, choose the next leader of the Iberian Union."

 IBR.706.t:0 "Iberia Wants Observer Status" 
 IBR.706.d:0 "A great deal of hope was placed in the countless documents enclosed in the numerous, Italian leather briefcases of the Iberian delegation flying into DC on a miserable, stormy morning. When the heavy doors of the private jet opened the small group of seasoned diplomats was clearly surprised to find a rather large welcome had been arranged for their arrival. A military band was in the process of playing the Iberian national anthem, followed by the US one despite the torrential downpour, and a small guard of honor lined the walkway to the black, bullet proof cars. Later that day it became apparent why the Iberians had been so surprised upon their arrival. The delegation was not in the United States to broker an official alliance and join the OFN but rather had come to strengthen diplomatic relations and request observer status.\n\nYet, the implications of which were clear and provided hope for the near future but a certain level of disappointment was still felt on Capitol Hill and in the White House. The diplomats were still able to enjoy a short, celebratory stay in the capital of the free world while shady, backroom discussions were undertaken to determine the outcome of what news the Iberians could return home with. All members of the OFN delegation realized the strategic importance of Iberia in this ongoing cold war with a dark European super state and therefore seemed willing to humor the baby steps the Iberians were taking in their direction. For them it was another step on the long path to create a stable, free world."
 IBR.706.a:0 "Very Well" 

 IBR.707.t:0 "The US Grants Us Observer Status in the OFN"
 IBR.707.d:0 "On the agreed final day of the diplomatic mission that the Iberian delegation had been sent to the United States, delegates from the different OFN nations and the hopeful European diplomats gathered at the Intercontinental hotel in DC, their luxurious limousines arriving in much the same torrential rain that had greeted the Iberians a few days earlier. The atmosphere upon entering the conference room was rather jovial, the room littered with small groups of dignitaries hunched in different corners in deep conversation, raucous laughter reaching even outside making the regular guests chuckle. Upon the last official entering and the stewards closing the door, the mood became more professional, the Americans quickly making the official OFN stance regarding the Iberians' request. An audible sigh of relief was heard from the Europeans as the discussion then shifted onto the regulations and limits of the Iberians involvement in OFN observation. The US agreement has led to the possibility of a significant turning point in history as Iberia draws closer to the alliance of free nations and further from fascist Europe."
 IBR.707.a:0 "Fantastic" 

 IBR.708.t:0 "Iberia Asks What to do With La Canadiense" 
 IBR.708.d:0 "The Iberian union has in recent times gotten closer to the OFN, trying to build strong diplomatic ties across the vast Atlantic, which our strategists have lauded as a vital step towards our final victory in the cold War against the withering fortress Europe. In the most recent summit hosted in Iberia itself, more specifically the region of Cataluña, a fascinating subject was raised that our delegation had not considered before the meeting, as we had expected just discussions on military and diplomatic matters.\n\nLa Canadiense, one of our state run electricity providers that came into our hands during the great European economic slump of the 50s when Belgian and Canadian private investors panickingly sold their stocks and assets to us seemed to be considerable interest to the Iberians. Seemingly the Iberians planned to surprise us with their proposals to buy the assets, based in the region we were currently in, right at the end of rigorous discussions on other more pressing diplomatic matters as to take advantage of our desires to leave the sweltering conference room quickly. A decision has to be made now, with our good diplomatic ties we can trust the Iberians to make good use of the company's assets and could mean even closer relations, however we could also try to capitalize on the old assets and make more profit for our government."
 IBR.708.a:0 "Reactivate the company"

 IBR.709.t:0 "Canada Sold Us La Canadiense's Assets" 
 IBR.709.d:0 "Our ingenious tactic of pushing the La Canadiense acquisition proposal onto the overworked Canadian delegation at the end of long discussions, especially considered the summit was held in Cataluña seems to have wholly worked out in our favor. Another piece of foreign owned capital in our nation is back in our capable hands, ready to be used for the good of the Iberian people, not the profit of the already rich Canadian government. We now have the means to further invest in the area and expand existing structures and machinery to make best use of the opportunity of harvesting more energy for our bustling and electricity hungry population. Using the company's existing knowledge in the field it could also help us to better understand hydroelectric power generation to better innovate in this field, which in turn may be useful for applying better use to the disastrous Gibraltar dam. This is a leap in the right direction, a leap of progress."

 IBR.710.d:0 "At around 10am an interesting, but very welcome short memorandum reached the desk of the commander in chief of the American armed forces, immediately drawing his attention away from all the other hefty documents piled high on his desk. It was the notification that another Iberian delegation had arrived and been welcomed to do diplomacy with their eager US and OFN counterparts, however this time around they had brought very different instructions from Madrid and Lisbon, that caused a rather large stir in the conference. The piece of paper more importantly however stated in simple terms that the Iberians were ready to begin negotiations on officially entering the OFN as a key strategic ally in Europe. The decision that now has to be made, and it wasn't just his to make but other OFN members would follow suit, could be described as a key turning point in history. Is it a good idea to let the admittedly friendly Iberians into the pact or would it be a better idea to initially hold back and only offer them observer status to gauge their intentions?"

 IBR.711.d:0 "The expected OFN mission to Iberia which was going to submit the much anticipated answer for the Iberians request to join the alliance of free nations was canceled today, two days before it was going to arrive in an eager Madrid. Disappointed civil servants were in the process of abandoning and burning all the plans that had been made well in advance for the diplomats arrival, when an important notice was passed onto all ministries within the Iberian government structure. The Americans had sent an official letter, cordial in tone, declaring that due to vital strategic considerations when analyzing the European situation, Iberia was currently not able to be accepted in the OFN, a blow that struck hard considering the steadily improving relations between the European nation and the enlightened democracies. A little caveat was included in the letter however, a small compensation for the quite frankly dangerous effort the Iberians took to hopefully change the political problems of Europe in the long run. However, the president viewed the offer that the letter he held in his hand contained with more gratitude than many of his pessimistic ministers. The option to become an observer nation to the alliance can potentially deepen ties across the Atlantic over time and lead to another chance for the Iberians. For now however the president could just sigh deeply and rip apart the speech he was going to hold for the honored guests that would never arrive at a specially organized banquet that would never occur."
 IBR.711.a:0 "I guess that will work" 

 IBR.712.t:0 "Iberian Delegation Visits Washington" 
 IBR.712.d:0 "Another friendly Iberian delegation has arrived in busy Washington as per schedule, it's diplomatic mission the same as always, to improve relations and therefore ties between the now democratic Iberia and the OFN. The currently still hidden motive these visits and the increase of cordial correspondence between the former despotic but German opposed federal union and us was clearly visible; the two combined peoples were likely wanting to draw closer to our alliance itself and from there join it as an equal member. A possibly very lucrative enterprise considering the strength of a Europe still shrouded in darkness and a protective far East. It however would not come without danger as the Germans have proven themselves in recent decades to not be very sensible folk, especially when reacting to foreign made stimuli. Our decision therefore is how to continue dealing with the Iberians, should we draw nearer quicker or only better relations slowly, betting on the Iberians not abandoning their current foreign policy towards us. Currently this decision is represented by how the president will respond to the delegation, will he send a letter thanking the Iberians for their effort or will he send an OFN delegation to Madrid and Lisbon to deepen ties?"

Their arrival should be marked as a historical event. He had been unsure whether the Americans and their allies would pursue the great risk directly associated with visiting Iberia after he had sent a successful diplomatic mission recently to Washington. The positive news had opened entirely new pathways for his two peoples to find their position on the world stage amongst the competing world powers, finally there might be the option of directly being involved in the future of a ravaged Europe and the struggling globe in general. Not just being eternal watchers or low level influencers as a secondary power in a doomed anti-German alliance. Hope was the primary emotion of many Spanish and Portuguese as the impressive American plane landed in Madrid, and this was reflected for the duration of their stay and during the lengthy discussions held at Madrid Palace Hotel in our bustling capital."

Our gradual alignment with the OFN, having seen us sending special envoys to the US capital to foster cordial relations, with the possibility of closer diplomatic cooperation, seemingly has hit a minor wall in its path of progress. Instead of sending a diplomatic delegation of their own to visit our splendid homeland and continuing to foster better relations, the Americans have merely sent us a letter of appreciation. It contains a "warm" thanks for our efforts, but seems to contain little else for our analysts to go on. Seemingly the OFN still views having closer relations with our nation as a security hazard considering our close proximity to the slowly strengthening Fortress Europe. This was indeed factored into our predictions but still comes as an unwelcome turn of events. We however will not change our course of action, but instead tweak it to suit the careful Americans."

 IBR.715.t:0 "Iberia Wants Assistance With The Dam" 
 IBR.715.d:0 "During the euphoric German mania that seeped postwar Europe, one of the most damaging projects the National Socialists undertook was the building of the Gibraltar dam, a project doomed to fail with the foundations of the German economy being built on forgotten lies and empty promises. The consequences have been disastrous for the Mediterranean, the Union of Iberia included. It's economic growth and capacity shrunken by the failed construction project. With Iberia's democratization and diplomatic thawing, we have seen the former pseudo-fascistic bastardized nation align itself closer to our strengthening alliance of free nations. In one of the more recent diplomatic summits which included representatives from the European state, the issue of the dam and its incomplete nature were raised and discussed at great length. Considering our current foreign policy that favors closer ties to Iberia a considerable investment into the completion of construction could mean long term returns for us but also more importantly a more economically powerful dependent ally in a region of great strategic importance. However, there is always opportunity cost. The money could be used well in our own national economy and vocal, influential nationalists might consider the move unfounded and unnecessary causing political instability."

 IBR.716.d:0 "Our quite reasonable suggestion at a recent diplomatic summit in America with OFN members on needing investment for the incomplete Gibraltar dam has been rejected outright. The economic possibilities that this project could have had for our nation are very considerable, the thorn stuck in our side could finally have been removed to unlock previously unimaginable possibilities for trade and electricity production. Therefore this is an extremely disappointing development considering our huge efforts to get closer to America and its allies despite the fearsome dangers it could bring for us from other European states less inclined towards the capitalist bloc. This betrayal will not be quickly forgotten both by our government and the Iberian people, who have found out via an unfortunate media leak. Since we cannot really retreat from our current foreign policy direction this has just reduced several key strides made so far. Hopefully our relations can improve relatively quickly so we can get back on track for solving other issues with the OFN."

They will fit in any role we place them in, but there is still uncertainty to the degree they will be integrated with the military. We could place them in the general staff, which given their loyalty to us could be helpful, as well as the larger benefit they could provide to our military. If we were to keep them as separate advisors, it would be less controversial.\n\nThe population of Iberia is rather divided on this move, so we will need to make a decision with the opinions of the public in mind."

By embedding the Americans in the military, we have secured several pairs of eyes and ears within the general staff.

As it so happens, most of the people in the country are conservative minded. They are hardly xenophobic, but by-and-large are wary of outside influences, which they see as subversive.\n\nBy keeping the advisors on the sidelines and truly only advising, as we have, we have reached a situation that only benefits us. More reformist minds are pleased by our efforts to court the Americans, while those wary of outsiders are happy that we have kept them to the sidelines, where a would-be subversive cannot do as much."

 IBR.1001.d:0 "Long-built tensions in the Middle East have finally erupted, culminating in several emergent rebel groups and former colonies fighting either amongst each other or against their former overlord. With this wide-scale conflict however, comes a cost. The Middle East contains a vital resource hidden underneath its desert sands, oil. With access to this valuable material cut off, its general pricing has fluctuated significantly, causing widespread economic downturn among many countries in the process. \n\nUnfortunately, the [Root.GetName] was not spared from this, as a majority of its oil was imported from abroad. At the same time, as the situation escalates, nations with large stockpiles either refuse to sell any of their precious petroleum, or spike its price to extremely high values. Another disadvantage brought about by this oil shortage is the departure of several foreign businesses operating in Iberia alongside the mass frenzy of investors, panicking and selling their stocks before it's too late. This has led the [Root.GetName] to experience nationwide cycles of worker lay-offs, mass unemployment, and incurment of large amounts of debt. The government has announced plans to devote its remaining resources intensely in order to quickly solve the immediate problems, but the entire situation still remains uncertain."

Even on such short notice, crowds numbering in the hundreds attended to watch the ceremony, with many television stations recording the event as well. While there were relatively few people present at the ceremony in person, just about all of Iberia was watching along.\n\nThe opening ceremony began at noon, in front of the building which administered the dam. The door was blocked by a sliver of red-colored tape, and next to it stood Franco, holding a pair of hedge shears. [ROOT.GetIBR_Portuguese_Caudillo] delivered a short speech about how Iberia had done what seemed impossible, and beat Germany by finishing their own construction. Then, the tape was cut. With the door open, the two Caudillos moved towards a covered object, the tarp pulled off as they arrived.\n\nThere were many figures on the statue, their many stomps coming together to one larger, stomping on a smaller man with a swastika across his chest. It was not particularly large, and was somewhat off to the side. It was only really visible if one looked for it, or was being shown it.\n\nSomeone out of view, after a signal from Franco, seemed to activate the statue - and it turns out that it was a fountain. Water gently leaked from the pommel of the statue, as well as out of the eyes of the swastika-clad man. A band began to triumphantly play a series of songs.

#Extraordinary Council Meeting Events

 IBR.4006.t:0 "Up With the Times" 
 IBR.4006.d:0 ""You've called me for a meeting, at this ungodly hour?" Salazar asked over the phone. It only took a glimpse out the window to tell the time, as the only thing illuminating the dark skies of either city were the street lights of Madrid and Lisbon. "What is so urgent to you that it cannot wait another... 10 or so hours?"\n\n"The scuffle at Barcelona has me worried." Franco sighed, wiping his forehead with a hand. "This is going to happen again. I know these rat bastard separatists better than you, and I know them well enough to tell you this won't be the end of it. Do you think we can survive another Barcelona? I don't, Antonio. We need to update the constitution, offer the people something that will calm things down for a while."\n\nFranco just kept speaking, only stopping to catch a breath. "But Antonio, we need to be a united front on this. We can't show disunity on this question."\n\n"Francisco, what are you on about?" Salazar asked. "Wasn't it enough that we created the Iberian Council? Now you want to give them more concessions?"\n\n"Tell me," Franco responded, his tone growing agitated. "Would you rather this Union fall apart? Do you want the consequences, if this peninsula melts around us? You know what would happen. We have to do something before it's too late. Help me out here, if only for your own sake.""
 IBR.4006.a:0 ""Damn you, Franco, I just want to go to sleep.""

 IBR.4007.t:0 "What Matters To the People" 
 IBR.4007.d:0 "Finally, the government was ready to discuss. It was not the entire government, of course - it was the Council, representatives from several government agencies, and the Caudillos themselves. Remarkably, the entire Council was present - which was the first issue the convention met. There were not enough seats for everyone. The convention solved its first issue in approximately three minutes with a couple of folding chairs.\n\nThe first real problem of the convention was where to start. They had a whole constitution to revise, after all, and even though they would reach all of it, they would not get it all done at once. Of course, this is where bickering ensued.\n\nFollowing an eternity of arguments over petty and ultimately meaningless issues, Salazar put his foot down and ordered them to start from the top: Basic needs."
 IBR.4007.a:0 "Let's get on with it."

 IBR.4008.t:0 "Maslow's Theories: Food" 
 IBR.4008.d:0 "A politician taps a finger on his notes, eventually settling and running his finger along the paper as he reads it aloud. "According to the psychologist Maslow, the, uh, his pyramid of needs posits a hierarchy of needs. Following its logic, the only way to get a happy, productive citizen is to make sure these needs are fulfilled." His voice is loud, but monotone. He clearly wants people to hear, though he doesn't seem very enthused himself. "As I'm sure you all know, everybody needs to eat. Hunger goes on, even when you can't stop it. I do not know anyone who cannot provide for themselves, but I am certain they exist. So, my partner would like to present..." He looks expectedly towards another politician, who starts speaking on cue.\n\n"I would like to propose something to help people get the food they need, so that they aren't left in the dust. A specially dedicated currency, to be given out to anyone in the country that needs it. They can spend this on whatever food they'd like- provided it is food and not luxury."\n\nThe hall lit up with speech, though eventually the Axencia representative spoke loud enough to be heard by all.\n\n"Why would we need this? You know about the Auxilio Social, right? It already does that duty for us! What's the point of bloating the state for a function we don't even need?"\n\nEventually, the Caudillos came to be the final word on the matter: Would there be a new food program, or not?"

"As important as the water, is the cleanliness of that water. Drinking filth will do nothing but make you sick, at best. Without access to water, more than they strictly need, and clean, you cannot expect to have happy, productive citizens." The man clears his throat. "We need to make sure the water is clean. Some areas of Iberia have been left behind. They do not have clean water. I have some water regulations, here, and if we assert them then clean water will not be an issue."\n\nAnother councilman objected, his voice high but steady. "That seems very nice, but it's not necessary. Have you seen the news? We haven't had any cases of water poisoning, or of cholera, or of any other ailment that stems from bad water. We don't need to waste all our budget on measuring a pipe down to the first three drops through it. It'll be fine as it is."\n\nThe debate continued on, for much longer than the ones before it.

I have nothing to say about this, so I'll let a colleague take their position..." The man goes silent, as another speaks in a move that was painfully obviously coordinated.\n\n"It is critical that we make sure all Iberians have housing. Not everyone has a house, and some lack the means to gain one. Even worse, some do - but they live in squalor and filth. It is true that we provide housing already, but our programs are not sufficient. I would propose intervention into the housing market, with the specifics to be worked out later. It is our duty to make sure the people of Iberia do not want when we could provide."\n\n"But we can't provide, can we?" responded another councilman. "For all the comprehensive programs you and your bunch keep proposing, you never seem to stop and consider the budget. Well, we're going to consider the budget! The army needs funding, or we'll dissolve from separatism. The dam needs funding, or we'll dissolve from the second greatest flood to scourge the Earth. All of these minor issues will need funding, or we'll dissolve because all you can think about is how to spend every penny we don't have!"\n\nWith a sigh, Franco called both off.

 IBR.4012.t:0 "The Question of Colonial Citizenship" 
 IBR.4012.d:0 "A growing movement in the congress has finally found itself sufficient support to debate colonial citizenship.\n\nIberian citizenship is granted automatically to anyone who has a parent with Iberian citizenship - at face value, it is a simple policy. However, it becomes significantly more complicated once one factors in other processes, such as colonial residence. The natives are considered non-Iberian, and denied citizenship. Effectively, they are denied any of the benefits one would gain from citizenship.\n\nA clique in the congress has argued againt this policy, for several reasons. Some find it unjust to deny the natives citizenship, since they lived on the land before our settlers, and others oppose it for more practical reasons. They desire to create a "collaborator" group within the native populations with which to sabotage the others, or simply to ease administrative strain. The end result is the same: to give all African natives Iberian citizenship.\n\nTo say this arguement experienced significant pushback is an understatement. Opposition has been fierce, with a great many wishing to maintain the status quo. The settler groups wish to keep the situation as it is, as the current laws work very favorably for the Iberian settlers. Ultimately, it is still the call of the Caudillos."

 IBR.4013.t:0 "Settler Associations Protest" 
 IBR.4013.d:0 "As predicted, the settlers took native citizenship very poorly. The groups, usually organized by colonial domain - such as Guinea, Morocco, and so on - have announced a joint proclamation, with a near-unanimous decision to publicly protest the federal government's decision.\n\nThey have declared our decision "unfair to the natural citizens of Iberia", with an emphasis on justice. Despite their claims otherwise, it is glaringly obvious that they are upset by the fact that natives will no longer be treated as second-class citizens, and the new legal parity has upset those who took their supremacy for granted. The word of the Caudillos is still supreme, and it seems about time that they be reminded of the finality of the government's decisions."
 IBR.4013.a:0 "You and them are equal."

 IBR.4014.t:0 "Natives Support the Government" 
 IBR.4014.d:0 "After the joint declaration, some settlers even took to protest in Casablanca, venting their anger against the government. It seemed as if the move would be a political expense and nothing more. To everyone's surprise, a group of natives showed up, counter protesting for the government. While the assembly did not come to blows, it came very close as law enforcement dispersed the protest.\n\nEven though this was a spontaneous action, it is representative of sentiments within native populations. We have been formally thanked by several native organizations - through the same channels as the settlers, in what seems to have been spite - for our decisions to extend citizenship."
 IBR.4014.a:0 "Thank you!"

 IBR.4015.t:0 "Native-Settlers Clashes Cause Deaths" 
 IBR.4015.d:0 "Tensions have reached an all-time high as Iberian mainlanders, furious with their lack of legal primacy, have resorted to less-than-legal methods of intimidating nearby colonials. Bands of retornados, armed with makeshift weapons, have started to hunt down and beat colonials they find vulnerable. This escalated when the natives started to fight back, creating what were quickly nicknamed "brigas repentinas", for their spontaneous and violent nature. As all incidents do, these fights began to escalate from two or three to as many as ten to fifteen on each side.\n\nIt has escalated again. After the murder of a retornado by a colonial native, riots have broken out in several major cities around the colonies.between both. The Guardia Civil is on standby, and the death toll is poised to only increase unless the riots are put down immediately."
 IBR.4015.a:0 "Intervene and disperse."
 
 IBR.4016.t:0 "Settlers Stand Down" 
 IBR.4016.d:0 "A crowd of men sit within a holding cell, in some distant prison they know nothing of. They get along quickly - they seem to have been soulmates, in a way. Their conversation eventually leads them to the great question: what were they in for? All present had the same reason, the "disruption of common decency", but they all knew they were in for protesting the new citizenship laws. They were eventually split up, incarcerated for their deeds.\n\nSights like this had become very common, at least for a small while. As the Guardia Civil intervened, they arrested a large number of rioting settlers. Following the show of force, most of those remaining surrendered. It seems like they won't be complaining about citizenship again."
 IBR.4016.a:0 "You better."

 IBR.4017.t:0 "The First African DNI" 
 IBR.4017.d:0 "King Hassan sat at his desk, looking over what seemed to be an endless number of documents. He signed his name on one, the black ink from his favorite pen shining brightly on the paper. Then, he looked to the next in the stack, another which seemed to be just a signature on the bottom. Regardless, it never paid to be unaware. He read the paper itself, expressing yet more legal provisions and regulations that, ultimately, just added up to common sense and basic decency. His silent musing was interrupted by the clicking of cameras, the flashes providing a harsh incentive to keep looking down. He supposed that nobody would be unsure of how the paperwork worked.\n\nThey found him again as he took the picture for his ID card, forcing him to keep the artificially widened smile on for even longer than he ever wanted. Better that than to frown for the cameras, he supposed.\n\nThe day came when the ID was ready to be received. Swamped by the press for what was undoubtedly an important day, he did his best pretend-to-want-to-be-here smile and held it up for everyone to see.\n\nSomeone asked him, "How does it feel to be the first native to get citizenship?".

One word from any of the native leaders, and countless numbers would become insurgents and separatists, a wave harsh enough to batter down any of our previous attempts at colonial stability.\n\nSurprisingly, there was no such thing. At first there was nothing, but then one-by-one many of the leaders urged their followers to stand down. They wanted the bloodshed no more than us, it seems, and they have all agreed that citizenship is not worth the conflict. Our position is secure."

 IBR.4021.d:0 "Of course, nobody wanted to start an argument over the Diarchy - not in front of the Caudillos - but objective ground was necessary for a discussion. To this end, they were provided a summary of the legal powers of the Diarchy, the rulings and documents from where these powers came from, and were charged with figuring out the byzantine web of the bureaucracy. The men present, for the most part, agreed that the best way would be to assemble a list of pros and cons - the institution would stay for sure, but figuring out where it succeeded and failed would be critical."

 IBR.4022.d:0 ""One of the largest benefits of the Diarchy is the increased cooperation between leaders, creating an apparatus where two people may respond decisively to issues, rather than one. Yes?" The clerk looked at the Caudillos.\n\n"Actually," Salazar said, "The political apparatus does not encourage decisive interaction. Mark that off. In fact, I'd even say it goes so far as to hinder decisive action, with even the tiniest thing to protect a country-"\n\n"Enough, you petty bastard!" Franco snapped. "It's enough that you groan and grumble over every little measure that doesn't coddle you like a damn child! I try to get one good thing done and all you can think about is taking jabs at me!"\n\nThe two continued to bicker, at this point blind to the world beyond what they could use to argue with the other. The council became one of the first external groups to see, in all its glory, the way in which the Caudillos cooperated. Everyone - except the two dictators - sat in silence, unable to muster the will to move or even stop watching the argument.\n\nThe clerk himself shrank back, unwilling to be near the source of the yelling. At that moment, a thought came into his head: shouldn't he try to, well, do something about this?"

It was enough to silence the Portuguese dictator, who sat shocked. After a few seconds, he lunged for Franco with a yell. The two had started to come to blows, wrestling with one another. A few slaps, a couple of punches, but the two were held back by their advanced age.\n\nYet again, the council was in stunned silence. The army representative suddenly stood up, almost dragging the Axencia agent out of his seat.\n\n"We need to stop them before they hurt themselves!" The officer turned the agent to the door. "Find a phone, call the Guardia Civil."\n\nAs the Axencia representative ran off, the military man turned to the rest of the council. He needed to lead them, too, it seemed. Should he get some people to help him break up the Caudillos, or have a few explain to the Guardia?"

 IBR.4024.d:0 "As the army officer moved to intercept the councilman, he was barreled out of the way by a second councilman, who was far more set on stopping his colleague than the officer. The two began fighting one another, presumably to figure out who would help their preferred Caudillo. It seems the spirit of pugilism was contagious, since most of the other council members had gotten into miniature brawls of their own.\n\nKnowing there was nothing he could do, the officer sighed and walked to the door. He figured that he could watch for the Guard and also keep an eye on the Caudillos. He hardly had to wait for the Guard, as several officers walked in a few moments after me made it near the door.\n\nThe situation was easily explained with a sweep of the hand - a good most of the council was fighting itself, and a handful were trying to pull people off of one another. It only took one person to stop the Caudillos from fighting, simply pushing the two old men apart, and the rest of the council took several minutes to stop. Most had the sense to stop once they saw the Guard arrive, however.\n\nThe Guardia Civil dispersed the meeting, and sent everyone away with mostly bruises and scrapes. If there was to be more discussion, it would be once the tensions had died down."

 IBR.4025.d:0 "The officer went to stop the council man, only to be interrupted by an airborne suitcase. The object whacked the councilman in the head with a resounding thump. He didn't seem to be dead on closer inspection, merely unconscious, but those few moments allowed all hell to break loose.\n\nThe soldier beheld the true nature of the discussion, as the entire council dissolved into anarchy. Man fought man, and although nobody seemed to be using weapons, they sure did zealously swing their fists. Nothing he could do about any of them, his mind quickly thought, so he did the one thing he could.\n\nIt was very easy to break up the Caudillos, simply a matter of prying apart two old men. Then, he kept the two away from each other until the Guardia Civil arrived - a tense few minutes. The Guard did much more to break up the meeting than he could, seemingly absorbing the hostility of the rumble and using it against the council men.\n\nAfter an eternity of fighting, the final damages were tallied. A large number of members had been arrested for their brawling, and the Caudillos were sent to their homes to stew for a while, until the event was behind them. It was quite an unfortunate event, but perhaps it was better to have it settled now, rather than in an even more important event."

Well, technically, it had been handed to him by Franco, but for all intents and purposes it was his.\n\n"It is a terrible issue with the modern Iberia that, for all its posturing as a unified country, it does not have a unified judiciary. The system is decentralized, and the regional courts can run around as if they are independent!" He quietly hoped that didn't seem too monotone. "Iberia can only fulfil its promise of unity when all elements of the country are united as if they were never separate. Our courts are no different. Are there any questions?"\n\nSomeone, to his dread, had a question. "How would we best integrate these courts? Centralization should only be attempted if we can ensure it does not go poorly. Therefore, I want to hear your ideas on the matter."\n\nOh no.\n\nIn an act of divine providence, someone was able to interject and answer the question, moving the pressure away from him. The debate was similar in nature, but the final consensus was that ultimately..."
 IBR.4026.a:0 "Decentralized justice is fine."
 IBR.4026.b:0 "We must centralize the justice apparatus."

 IBR.4027.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Caudillos" 
 IBR.4027.d:0 "The first, and most powerful, clique in Iberia was the leaders. The Caudillos guide the state, cooperating even when all pragmatic logic begs for backstabbing and treachery. They are capable, even as they age, and their guiding hands have saved the entire peninsula from collapsing into bloody anarchy.\n\nWhat in the world is there to fault them for?"
 IBR.4027.a:0 "Yes, everything is good."

 IBR.4028.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Military" 
 IBR.4028.d:0 "At the right hand of the Caudillos is their enforcement arm, the military. Franco and the military have had a very productive relationship dating back decades, and although Salazar is not as familiar to the soldiers and general, he has the sense to usually defer to Franco on such matters.\n\nThe military is very influential, and at no point allows the Caudillos to forget that they can remove them from power. To this end, no action against them is necessary. It would only create a conflict that the military has every chance of winning."
 IBR.4028.a:0 "They can make themselves irreplaceable, but not much else."

 IBR.4029.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Church" 
 IBR.4029.d:0 "Favoring the cross over the sword, similarly acquainted with the Caudillos is the Catholic Church. It is an incredibly influential institution, holding total dominance over Iberian religion. It permeates all facets of life in some way, the centerpiece of a stage carefully constructed to accommodate it by many rulers of Spain and Portugal. Because of its position, it is coincidentally a very important institution to keep loyal. The faith of many leads them to believe the Church, and if the Church is friendly to us, then so will the congregations follow. Some would argue that this is not a good thing.\n\nThere has been an argument that the influence of the Church - its monopolistic control over education, religion, and in many ways the thoughts of the faithful - is too great. The same groups arguing this propose that the Church's influence be checked, so that Iberia is not dependent on its loyalty. Of course, if they are not checked, then there is no reason to fret over their loyalty..."

 IBR.4030.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Party" 
 IBR.4030.d:0 "A state, unfortunately, cannot be run by only two people. They must delegate, and give up shreds of their power to lesser men so that the matter of government is not totally overwhelming. This is the plight of the Caudillos - in their age they have had to find other men to run matters that they can no longer perform. This is the foundation of the Unión Nacional, the party which runs what the Caudillos cannot.\n\nDespite formally being one group, anyone with any knowledge of it knows that there is far more than one group within the party. Reformists, technocrats, and hardliners are just a few of the groups who are perpetually struggling with one another for the favor of the Caudillos. This factionalism is agitating, as it hurts unity and harms Iberia as a whole through constant scheming. However, it also stops any of the groups from growing dominant and imposing their views on the state. Is the status quo preferable?"
 IBR.4030.a:0 "Impose the Caudillos will."

 IBR.4031.t:0 "Families of the Regime: Those That Remain" 
 IBR.4031.d:0 "It would be false to claim that Iberia has been politically stagnant throughout the years. The greatest example is perhaps the creation of the Union itself, although there are many finer details that are overlooked. A few of these details are some of the smaller, less relevant families. The old falangists, the carlists, and the monarchists are only a few of the groups that have slowly withered away to naught.\n\nIberia killed them. They are irrelevant, minor, and it seems that they are going to disappear in a few years. In fact, the only reason they still exist is because they haven't realized they no longer exist. Without our intervention, the end of these groups is certain as other, equally disunited, groups take their place. However, if we so desired, we could perform euthanasia on the dying familes as to make their deaths quick. What will it be?"
 IBR.4031.a:0 "End their suffering."

 IBR.4032.t:0 "The Corrected Constitution" 
 IBR.4032.d:0 "The new constitution - or at least, a draft of it - has been published. Copies have been printed in every newspaper possible, and nearly everyone in Iberia will have seen it by now. It certainly seems that way, based on the stir we've created in the government and without. There has been dissent within the government, although it is at a level minimal enough to be curbed.\n\nIt is said that a good compromise leaves nobody happy. According to our political factions, the constitution was a good compromise. Some argue it went too far, and others not far enough, and there is enough of both sides to ensure that there will be an argument over it for a long time to come\n\nSurely, this is what it will take? The Union will now last forevermore, right?"
 IBR.4032.a:0 "Right."

 IBR.4101.d:0 "Events on the European continent have taken quite the turn with the latest news. We have been given some solid reports the Burgundian tanks have rolled into France in what is sure to be a one sided and very short war. With France being further castrated by their Nazi overlords, all claims of French legitimacy to the land of Algeria have disappeared overnight. We all know they have bigger issues at hand at the moment, than to defend from our advances.\n\nWe have been handed a golden opportunity here. This opportunity does not come around very often and we would be foolhardy to pass up such an endeavor. Moves will have to be made, and made fast before anyone else wizens up to what's going on here. Plans and meetings will need to be sorted quickly so we can jump on this before any other opportunist. One thing is certain though for the moment. That all right now is for the taking and there are no limits as to what we could do down in Algeria."

 IBR.4102.t:0 "A Letter to Jardim" #from debrief jardim
 IBR.4102.d:0 "Opportunity rarely has the courtesy to knock at an opportune time. For Jorge Jardim, opportunity interrupted a perfectly good breakfast. Were he a sensible man, he wouldn't have abandoned his poached egg and toasted bread for the letter apparently rushed to him from Madrid, but unfortunately for him he was a politician and such sense was not allowed in this profession.\n\nBright eyes quickly scanned the letter, absorbing both the written word and the unwritten intent behind them all at once. He stood from the table as he reached the end, his mind already turning over the newfound information. According to the letter, the Shadow State was storming into the French rump state and to no one's surprise, the French were receiving the worst of the fighting. The French had been more or less a non-factor for over a decade, unable to maintain control of much of the country outside of Algiers itself. That's why they were here in Oran after all, and the Italians on the other side of the garrison.\n\nBut the letter was much more vague with its actual orders, a necessary tactic to maintain plausible deniability should it somehow fall outside of Iberian hands and cause a scandal. That didn't matter though, they wouldn't have sent him this letter without knowing what he'd do once he got to reading it, and already, he was deep in thought.\n\nA spin, Iberia needed a spin to justify the acquisition of Algeria. While, yes, militarily occupied by both themselves and Italians, it was still legally French, and they weren't in a position to simply take the rest of the country by storm. After all, if they did that, they'd be fighting Italians, not the scarecrow army of the French State. So what excuse could they conjure up that would prevent the Italians from intervening?\n\nHe sat there deep in thought for some time, running through the scenarios in his head. It was clear that whatever scheme was cooked up, they'd have to work with the Italians directly to achieve it. So be it they would play this one by ear.\n\nHe took a bite of his eggs, grimacing as he chewed. Opportunity had made his eggs go cold..."
 IBR.4102.a:0 "The plotting has only begun."
 
 IBR.4103.t:0 "Plans for Algeria"
 IBR.4103.d:0 "In the modern age, military glory was becoming increasingly rare and difficult to come by, even as militaries all around the world continued to ceaselessly grow. The advent of the nuclear bomb and the resulting global stalemate seemed to all but halt the ambitions of those who would mark their place in history through conquest.\n\nAnd likewise, when force of arms failed, great men of silver tongues and wily diplomacy would often step up to the plate. But in these modern times, it seems like every rock, every blade of grass and every grain of sand is owned by somebody, somewhere, and no one was interested in selling. The world was as small as it was ever going to be, and no one saw value in losing their corner of it.\n\nThat's why when the Caudillos called the greatest military and diplomatic minds of Iberia together to discuss plans for the French Colony of Algeria, they came not with vague ideas and concepts, but with papers, with maps, with briefcases and books worth of schemes. This was an opportunity that they all knew they'd never again see in their lifetimes, a chance to be known as the conqueror- through guns or through words- of Algeria.\n\nGenerals came with grand campaigns and elaborate war plans, some even going as far as to invade Tunis and Libya should the Italians stand in their way. Diplomats cracked open briefcases to reveal grand schemes and plans to buy or swindle the Italian half of Algeria out from beneath their feet. When the Caudillos made the call for all spheres of Iberia to form a plan together, they instead got a rapid- and long- succession of political sales pitches."
 IBR.4103.a:0 "This is going to take a while..."
 
 IBR.4104.t:0 "Two Plans Remain"
 IBR.4104.d:0 "The moon was gazing down upon the military headquarters in Madrid when the Caudillos finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. After discarding the obvious losers, and then the less obvious losers, the Caudillos were left with two plans to decide between.\n\nAmong the generals, Kaúlza de Arriaga's scheme had the most support. A limited war, but with the added benefit of looking towards the white French colonials in Algeria for support, and the creation of a cooperative government with them in the process. The Kaúlza Plan, as it has been called since he first presented it to the Caudillos, calls for open warfare in Algeria to simultaneously drive out the Italians and pacify the natives all in one fell swoop. The generals have rallied behind the Kaúlza Plan, and already believe that Salazar will support them.\n\nMeanwhile, among the Diplomats, Adriano Moreira's plan had proven to be the most attractive. Rather than approaching the Italian government directly- which would require a great deal of expense to acquire the Italian half of the region- he proposes that Iberia should instead approach the Italian Oil Giant, ENI. If they can convince ENI to support the Iberian claim to Algeria in exchange for a generous deal on oil development in the region, ENI could in turn put much more intense pressure on Italy to accept the Iberian claim. The other diplomats and politicians have abandoned their own rejected plans to support the Moreira Plan, and hope that Franco will support them in turn."

 IBR.4105.t:0 "Caudillos in Disagreement"
 IBR.4105.d:0 "It was mid-day when Salazar entered the meeting room. Normally they wouldn't time a meeting so oddly, but Franco had requested he enter once he had fully collected his thoughts on the Algerian issue, and not one moment earlier or later. Sadly, what this meant was that Franco had to dedicate nearly the entire day to waiting, for whenever his counterpart finally got around to attending. He was thankful, then, that they showed up shortly after lunch.\n\nAs expected, Salazar got to talking as soon as he closed the door behind him.\n\n"I had to see everything, but I've made up my mind- Algeria needs to be secured. At any cost, it doesn't matter, we need to guarantee the retornados a home." Franco began to open his mouth to respond, but Salazar snapped at him first. "Don't start about pragmatism to me, not about this. Those retornados were exiled from their home once already, I would rather die than let them be kicked out again, and so soon after the first time! Arriaga's plan will guarantee them their home, and he'll make sure those Italian bastards recognize it!"\n\nFranco half-sighed, half-grunted in annoyance. "I can't fault you for being passionate about your people, but you are refusing to see the larger picture. We need peace in Algeria. A war will win them the land, maybe, but then where will you be, when they all die fighting for it? What good would it do, Salazar?" Salazar started a response, getting out perhaps half a word before Franco interrupted him. "Whatever we settle on, just remember. It needs to be unanimous...""

He spared a glance to his colleague - who was more focused on the plans before them - before returning his gaze to Kazula and Moreira, who seemed more concerned with shuffling through their things. Eventually, they both prepared to present, but Kazula was mandated to go first.\n\nHe spoke loud, with a boisterous tone that showed his total confidence in his plans. He didn't have any formal charts or flashy models, but simply passed out two pieces of paper and laid a map out on the conference table, a map of Algeria. He detailed the situation (as he saw it), then carefully explained how they could swipe the rest of the country from the Italians. To this end, he also explained the contents of the documents he passed out - they were manifests, of the equipment they'd require, optimistically, to get the job done.\n\nOnce Kazula finished, it was time for Moreira to present his plan for Algeria. During the war plan briefing, the politician had taken the time to properly set up a presentation, though his delivery left some to be desired. He explained his plan, how working with ENI could win Algeria, and of how to make deals situated to look desirable to them.  He pointed out the resources required, and how to best use them. With a style of utilizing as little words as possible, his side of the meeting concluded remarkably quickly.\n\nAs both sides had finished their presentation, the Caudillos spoke their verdict. While they both made designs to sell their plans, what the two didn't know was that the Caudillos had both already decided. They told the two, in their back-and-forth speech style, that..."

Today, Jardim had the wisdom to simply set it aside, finishing his breakfast before breaking into the plots and schemes. What were they going to do, shoot him for a few minutes delay? The clinking of silverware was music to his ears, just as the sensation of warm food was music to his mouth.\n\nOnce he finally had the hands to open a letter, Jardim plucked the envelope open with a fingernail and then scanned the page. Attentive anticipation turned to curiosity, and from there to excitement all in the space of a paragraph, as Jardim found himself unable to suppress a laugh. A brand new job, specially for him, as soon as he was finished with his tenure in Algeria. Even better, they were going to pay him for work he wasn't yet doing! Today was going to be a good day, he was already sure.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Iberia proper, there was no laughing, for the "top brass" Jardim was going to join found the entire affair much less amusing. Perhaps it was jealousy, or maybe resentment, or even contempt - but it did not matter where it was coming from, for the end result was the same. Quite a few were unhappy with the new promotion, not least because he wasn't even out of Africa yet."

As far as anyone knew, he was maintaining professional posture. What the bodyguard knew, and was a little ashamed of, was that he bided his time by listening.\n\nFor the most sensitive matters, he couldn't do such a thing - he was never where he could hear anything. Today, the man was nearly sure that this meeting was one of those affairs. With another guard, he was to watch the door and make sure nobody else entered. If there was a scuffle, he would stop it. Nothing of the sort happened.\n\nEventually the door opened, with businessmen and diplomats filing out. The guard watched them silently, before he was given his next order:"

Every now and then, he took a few sips of coffee, speeding up as time wore on to beat his cooling drink. His cup was already empty when he heard the door click open, and he had just enough time to set it down before beholding the face of an advisor. In that advisor's hands, a map.\n\nThe map, when unrolled, revealed itself to be a map of Oran, just as Jardim had requested. Not just any map, however. This was a survey map of the oil deposits around the city of Oran. Scribbled over top of it were several pockets of red pencil, with many of the deposits covered by red,\n\n"These are the deposits. " The aide taps a finger on one of the red-covered deposits. "These, are deposits in use. For every one colored in, the fine folks back at ENI have signed on a contract.

So many had been marked over, in fact, that Jardim could count them on one hand, plus one that was half-colored.\n\n"I suspect you're aware of what kind of map this is.

The recent deals with the Italian-owned oil company has created those potential gains - if we were to come into conflict, then the lucrative deals for the black gold would be gone. By planting the seed of profit, we have shown the Italians that our objectives are friendship and cooperation.\n\nTo cement this, diplomats have been sent into a meeting with Italian officials. With the influence of a company who wants to preserve profits, and our show of friendliness, a peaceful solution is in sight. Of course this will not be an immediate affair, and the objective of our diplomats for the first few meetings will be to build trust. "

 IBR.5000.d:0 ""I come before you today with a message containing a stark warning, it is your choice, Iberia's choice, whether to heed this warning or to succumb to the detrimental consequences otherwise. We have emerged victorious out of a dark age, some may call it our golden age, but they are either selfishly devious of nature or misinformed. This dark age gave forth the idea that a centralised self sufficient economy was needed to maximise output. Now two important things are to be noted here ladies and gentlemen. The time that this idea emerged under and the results wanted, both inextricably linked, are a product of that dark age. Can anyone here explain to me the need in this atomic age of requiring a war economy geared towards output instead of growth and the welfare of citizens?"\n\n"I come before you today, professing the warning that this era of mindless economic policy has to stop before we fall behind the rest of the world and are eternally forgotten as a union of two of the world's most decadent empires.

 IBR.5001.d:0 "Not shortly after Ullastres gave his well received speech the market-centred new state apparatus kicked into gear, its mission to slowly dismantle itself for the good of the country and less obviously itself. Many of the state run industries which had been under the jurisdiction of multiple government ministries, like the defense or interior, were beginning to be packaged and repurposed to be sold to Iberian private investors who had slightly different goals than their state counterparts. As conservative and falangist protests are springing up around the nation, none large enough to be of immediate concern, the market was beginning its impersonal processes, valuing the prices for the various new products that had just been added to the selection of supply. How this reform will play out only time and the 'invisible hand' can tell."

The privatization effort of multiple state industries, which had been running in the red or generally been a pain for the state, produced unwelcome circumstances in the new more market-oriented economy. At first it seemed as if the state would be running a loss selling capital at a price below the rate expected. This did not bother us, as the main goal was to stimulate the economy and not exploit these sales. Yet as time went by, it seems that private investors were not quite as accustomed to the new Iberian economy as Ullatres had hoped. It was not long before many were asking for subsidies to provide lucrative contracts to the state instead of working on the market. Even worse, it seems that others read some loopholes in the sale agreements and were selling them to foreign investors. It may be necessary for the state to intervene to correct certain market failures..."

With a decent stream of revenue from leases and direct sales public spending can even be revamped, if only slightly.

With the privatization of state firms from multiple struggling ministries at the behest of the government, a strong spike in economic activity has occurred, mostly obviously in the private sector. The investors have not let the old capital go to waste in the slightest and are letting mismanaged assets finally come to fruition, being exploited to their full worth for profit and dividends.

Yet we have to be careful, this cannot be thrust onto our people without consideration of the lack of liberty in Iberian culture. How can such a powerful tool be given to a citizenry who still in parts respects the empty promises of demagogues whether on the right or left? This has to be a slow process, one guided by our party as we have Iberia's future at the core of our mission, not personal advantage. This is our mission from God, to infuse the culture with individualism and its accompanying responsibility. Allow people to fend for themselves and see that their voice has impact and therefore consequence. Until then we must reign like the backroom despots of the past."

 IBR.5006.d:0 "All around the nation in the various localities the PRD spin doctors and campaign strategists were beginning their arduous task of reinforcing the central administration's line of planning for the upcoming regional elections. This was an important event as it could mean a further consolidation of power for the government, enabling them to push through reforms at a quicker rate while guaranteeing their effectiveness on the ground. Hence it was extremely important for the party that this event would go in their favor. Some critics have stated that the government is putting too much attention towards these elections and pivoting away from other pressing issues of state however official statements have repudiated this harshly, labelling some of the hit pieces against them as disinformation."

 IBR.5007.t:0 "Choosing a Posture on Social Issues"
 IBR.5007.d:0 "Since these upcoming regional elections are vital in securing a strong base in local areas for the party and to ease in reforms it is necessary to develop a coherent, popular posture on dealing with social issues. The most important of these being the political status of women and minorities due to the stability issue of the union which greatly affected the concept of the Iberian identity. We can however not just limit ourselves in the social sphere to this as our nation is not just plagued by a hovering identity crisis. Once the range of issues and their importance have been made clear, we next need to actually choose our stances. Should we appeal more to the Conservative portions of the country, who naturally hold great sway in elections from the despotist era, or should we rather target the liberal elements who mostly congregate in the urban areas."

 IBR.5008.t:0 "Clarifying our Economic Stance"
 IBR.5008.d:0 "The direction of both the local economies and the broader national economy is of great interest to the party, hence with the upcoming elections we have the opportunity to reaffirm what most already know about our free market stance, or to slightly tone down the rhetoric in favor of a more compromised solution. Weighing up the positives and negatives of the two options makes one realize the precarious situation Iberia truly is in; were we to go with the more market oriented approach we may risk conservative elements of the populace and business world at the very least acting non compliant while not pursuing the free market approach may leave our economy lagging behind ultimately in the global market."

 IBR.5009.t:0 "PRD Makes Moderate Gains in Conservative Regions"
 IBR.5009.d:0 "Our election strategy has seen mild success as we were able to infiltrate Conservative strongholds and gain enough seats to threaten their complete dominance. This ultimately will give us enough political capital to begin to try to push through reforms on a local level, but we will still incur heavy costs and have to compromise. These are a necessary part of the ebb the flow of promises that we have to make the electorate.\n\nThe experience still has taught us something though as we now know more about what will appeal to this strata of the populace for future elections. Our name has also gotten out there and any publicity is better than none at all. "
 IBR.5009.a:0 "A work in progress. "
 
 IBR.5010.t:0 "PRD Makes Large Gains in Conservative Regions"
 IBR.5010.d:0 "A great shock, both for the party itself and many establishment figures, hit Madrid today as results from the recent election started to filter in. The PRD has made significant gains in Conservative areas of the nation, something that despite the large amount of propaganda dedicated to the campaign had seemed impossible. It was initially planned and predicted that a small entry point could be made, from which the party could begin to expand their influence. This may now not even be necessary anymore, as with these results future policy changes will be far easier to implement and likely will not receive any sort of major protests. Consolidation will have to be carried out with due diligence, as now losing what had been gained would be a great smear on the party, even on the national level."
 IBR.5010.a:0 "This is our chance. "
 
 IBR.5011.t:0 "PRD Makes Moderate Gains in Liberal Regions"
 IBR.5011.d:0 "The numbers were beginning to come in: almost every working party official browsing line by line with increased dread. Yet despite wishful thinking nothing changed between numerous inspections of the election results. The party had been unable to make major gains in liberal areas, something which had seemed to be a guarantee considering their normal platform. Had there been too many policy concessions to appease conservatives? Had local dignitaries been unaware of the actual electoral mood? All questions that would need to be answered if the party can continue to try to govern and bring Iberia forward into the brighter future they have envisioned. Despite this roadblock likely taking some time to get over some officials cite the gains as an achievement nonetheless and something to be built on. This may be true but did nothing to raise sullied moods."

 IBR.5012.d:0 "Unsurprising to most it became clear even in the early hours after the last ballots had been cast that the PRD had made considerable gains in the liberal areas of the nation. These were very important to the party, despite their almost ensured support, as future policy would be built upon their backing and any sort of electoral challenge could now be squashed with their votes. However as most dignitaries celebrated, some of the higher level party members were already in deep conversation on the topic of liberal expectation and conservative moderation. Policy changes would certainly come across differently in the two opposing camps. Finding a balance between the two as not to antagonise either to any greater extent was vital both for the stability of the party and the nation."

 IBR.5014.d:0 "A Liberal thorn, or perhaps further left, was wedged into the soft flesh of party complacency. Because of course the Iberian people are a Catholic one but, under foreign influence and internal oppression, views on certain social issues have radically altered.\n\nIt should have been a peaceful, normal working day with hurried economic activity in the second largest city of the Union. Instead many major roads in Barcelona are blocked by throngs of people protesting for something they have no right to, divorce for any reason. This cannot stand; sedition like this spreading among the populace would shift Iberian politics out of control. Hence the protest must be countered in such a way that is discredited, not merely broken up. The message must be killed, not its messengers. Perhaps some counter protests may do the trick, organized by our friends in the Opus Dei to show the true will of the Iberian people against these hooligans."
 IBR.5014.a:0 "Attempt to set up counter protests"
 
 IBR.5015.t:0 "Counter Protests Succeed" 
 IBR.5015.d:0 "The numerous men of cloth and their countless supporters have succeeded in their mission to drive out heretical thought from the still impressionable minds of the Iberian people.\n\nOpus Dei's large rally in Barcelona ran into the initial divorce protestors on their second day, and was easily able to drown out any influence that could have been enacted on the people's psyche. Their success has allowed the administration some much needed breathing room. The insistence to win hearts and minds instead of using brute force to quash the social revolt has been a clever move to save face with the more left-leaning elements in the country and in the PRD support base. "
 IBR.5015.a:0 "Our friends in the Opus Dei prove useful once again."
 
 IBR.5016.t:0 "Counter Protests Prove to be Ineffective" 
 IBR.5016.d:0 "The effort to create an effective counter protest by the government has been foiled. Not only was the intended outcome of reducing the credibility of the original divorce protest not achieved, but many liberals have also taken issue with government policy considering promises made in local elections. Finding the link between the counter protest organised by the religious followers and the current administration had not been a hard job as speculation regarding the connection between the two groups had been running rampant since the initial swearing in of the party.\n\nA multitude of marches and other forms of protest have begun to erupt around the nation, mostly confined to the larger cities, that condemn the administration of forgoing their promises to maintain strong relations with Catholics and conservatives alike, playing the game of politics instead of staying true to their word. Crackdowns are already occurring, luckily with minimal violence, but the whole affair has left a stain the government may not ever be truly able to clean."

 IBR.5017.d:0 "At precisely 6pm on the state run cable TV networks the broadcast was interrupted by a speech from the president of Iberia. It was unannounced, causing worry from those who believed it to be an emergency address. Luckily this was not the case; rather the president had taken it that this would be a good time to reiterate the importance of Catholic Church in the lives of every Iberian. Using a politicians tongue and expert hyperbole he went on to make his statement for around twenty minutes, delving into history and its lessons for modern society, drawing parallels between godlessness and chaos. Finishing not too soon he also mentioned Opus Dei in positive terms, giving those he presided over the advice to seek out their support in case of emotional distress or a lack of faith. And with that the normal broadcast resumed."

Iberia has become a beacon of freedom on the European continent, a bright light in the dark swathes of authoritarianism. All that had to be done was to create more economic freedoms for the people, to allow choice where previously had been mandate. After all how could it all be managed from the top down? The party was not God and neither was this his kingdom.\n\nClearly not everyone was as eager to accept this new opportunity for the union, some had to have their faith reinstilled, often just by positive social reinforcement. On other occasions the vigilant Opus Dei organization was always ready to help. However they have seen the light now, the way forwards into the harmonious society that will be representative of God's will on earth."

 IBR.5020.t:0 "Formulating a Strategy on Government Reform"
 IBR.5020.d:0 "Ullastres stepped forward to the podium, waiting patiently for the gathered ministers and journalists to quieten down before speaking. "The state of the various governmental branches and institutions that were inherited from the dark era of the Caudillos is in dire need of serious reform. There will be no capability to transform the nation into a union of equals that can enjoy political stability and better living standards for its many citizens without, and excuse the metaphor here," he winked almost cheekily while a few laughs were heard in the auditorium, "a great flood to uproot the former constitutional mess of the botched unification."\n\n"The autarchical nature of old economic and even political policy represents an almost intolerant hermit nation in dealing with the problems that the world presented to us. We were not listening, we were drawing back into ourselves. Well ladies and gentlemen, I say no more!" He stood back for a moment, again waiting for the applause to subside. "Clearly we will require great expertise for such a herculean task, yet I am confident our new government is up to the task. We are also very fortunate to have amassed a significant amount of contacts to experts in various fields of the private sector who recognize that it's in their interests to support the recovery. Thereof do not fret children of this great country, the nation of Iberia will stand strong and proud, a rock of liberty in a torrent of tyranny! There shall be no harkening back to a great era once lost, we will forge our own, right now, that those who will come after us will imitate for eternity to come."
 IBR.5020.a:0 "A strong signal for a bright future."
 
 IBR.5021.t:0 "Advice From a Trusted Friend"
 IBR.5021.d:0 "Following what has already been established as a keynote speech in Iberian political history the new president of the Iberia, head of the reformist market liberals, has seemingly been hard at work establishing the groundwork for the grandiose promises he had made. His staffers have rarely seen Ullastres leave his office with only few people coming to visit, one of these however being the founder of the religious organization Opus Dei, Josemaría Escrivá. \n\nThe man of God has been rather frequent in his visits, often carrying large briefcases overflowing with charts and other assorted papers. Clearly Ullastres had made good on his previous statement about consulting private sector experts to help in forming government policies that will move towards greater economic liberalisation of the nation. Relying on the Catholic likely proves the president's will still play to the traditional base despite his widespread reform plans."

A government probe has discovered that local institutions around the nation were infested with crooked civil servants who were funded by businesses and private interest groups from the previous era. Their goals were still unclear but their treachery was obvious. Only by chance and skill of the investigators had this scandal been uncovered as judges and other lawmen had covered for the traitors. Even more menacingly it seems that this corruption and nepotism was not just restricted to the various regions of the peninsula but rather had even made its way up to the national level.\n\nNationwide people began to match on the streets protesting against this outrage, calling for the government to intervene.

The choice to be made is not a simple one with both sides bringing hefty negatives that will weigh heavily on the shoulders of the administration. This should not be a surprise however as no disaster of this scale is likely to reap many positives. Not even when the old seats can be filled with those loyal to the new Iberia. The more benevolent option is to continue monitoring the traitors and try to reform them, only seeking to eliminate those beyond saving and who have done the most damage. The effectiveness of this is unclear sadly, hence may harm long term goals of the government. Mass arrests on the other hand will make sure that the system can be rebuilt, fashioned into a more effective state devoid of the taint of the of the past. Yet this will not go without consequences when caving to the public. A hard choice will need to be made. "

Even small conservative rural towns were not spared of this treatment either, rather they seemed to garner the most state attention.\n\nShortly after noon it became clear why, in many of the locations that were covered large mobs began to assemble, waving placards and posters decrying the government crackdown on conservative and falangists, painting them to be one of political sabotage. Having had time to set up and gain advantageous positions the police was able to control the protests and keep most of the planned marches peaceful.

The gears were already beginning to turn even before the staffer could finish, Ullastres considered the possible assassin list and motives, considered reprimands, considered consequences.

 IBR.5404.t:0 "Slashing Fuel Subsidies"
 IBR.5404.d:0 "The previous provision of fuel subsidies to certain sectors of the economy had been justified upon the grounds that it was a necessary component for industry to grow and hence should be provided to an extent by the government to help Spain compete abroad. Even prior to the crisis this policy had been deeply criticised by members of our government who argued that all it was doing was wasting precious resources which would have been allocated more efficiently by the market. The crisis has given these arguments further impetus, throwing even previous defenders behind the idea that reform was needed. In order to adjust to the crisis, we hence need to ensure that the little oil we can salvage for the economy is allocated to the sectors of the economy that need it. Hence only those that can pay full price and highly demand it should be able to claim it."

Structural issues concerning the labour market and environmental regulation could create long lasting unintended negative consequences. Others have reacted to the claims with harsh venom. The extreme free marketers continue to hold by the mantra that the only good market regulation is no market regulation.

They now demand that interest payments on government debt have to be moved forwards in order to safeguard their other investments. Our state should only be a simple night watchman, providing law and order to ensure uncompromised movement of market forces. For us to accumulate debts is a sin and represents failure. We likely should hence pay them back now.\n\nYet we are completely in our right to withhold on these payments. The previous payments have all gone according to procedure and we are on target to effectively deal with our debt in the near future. The demands to pay back now seem almost preposterous. To deal with both the crisis and these payments could result in terrible economic consequences. A decision has to be made."

Conceding that certain actions, no matter whether their intention was aimed towards the greater good, negatively had impacted some parts of the population. Directly addressing those who were currently employed he promised that with the eventual upcoming upswing in the economy there surely will be a place for them to return to. He however did not apologise. Staying resolute he argued that the policies of the government had been a necessary countermeasure to prevent the crisis from deepening further and critically affecting the economy. With the reforms the newly restructured economy, which now would be able to gain even more from free market efficiency, would emerge from the crisis stronger and more durable to future shocks. When the good times come with this development so too would the benefits trickle down to the public. Finishing with a sheepish smile he added that in time the populace will thank the PRD for what they have done to save the Iberian economy."

 IBR.624.t:0 "The Matter Of Special Regions"
 IBR.624.d:0 "Regionalism was the scourge of Iberia. It had been that way all the way back to the Reconquista, when the peninsula had been divided amongst half a dozen warring kings. For centuries regionalism was allowed to fester until it became a sagging boil that exploded into two devastating civil wars. Now, with democracy restored and the sensible administrators of the Alianza Popular in power, Iberia had a once in a millenia opportunity to put aside regionalism once and for all. Jorge Verstrynge knew this. His enemies in Congress did not. \n\nFor almost an hour now they had been causing a scene, the parliamentarians of the Unión Republicana and the Partido Renovador Democratico, berating the government in the strongest possible terms over its opposition to the autonomy of the regions. Verstrynge had listened to their outbursts quietly, allowing others from his party to respond to their cajoling, but he was growing tired of the antics. Taking the next opportunity to speak, he rose to the podium.\n\n"Fellow Deputies, I have listened intently to the intervention of those opposite. And I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed. It is as if those opposite have forgotten all the events of the past 40 years. How separatism fueled the divisions of Spain and tore it apart in civil war. How Iberia mere years ago was plunged into the fires of seperatist insanity, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. Well, we here in the government have not forgotten the dead! We have not forgotten the debt of blood that Iberia owes to the martyrs who died for its liberty and unity against separatists and extremists alike! No, we will not allow you to once again fan the flames of separatism that have torn this nation apart. We in the government will chart a new course, one towards a strong, united Iberia!"\n\nThe opposition howled in indignation at Verstrynge's fiery retort, and the debate raged on and on."

 IBR.625.t:0 "The "Rights and Duties of Special Regions" Law"
 IBR.625.d:0 "Iberia was, and always would be, a unitary country, ruled from the center. The victory of the Alianza Popular had made sure of that, and President Manuel Fraga Iribarne wanted to make sure everyone else remembered it. Regionalist hysteria and terroristic separatism would not be tolerated in the new, democratic Iberia. He knew that the sooner that everyone, including the troublesome separatists themselves, understood and accepted this, the better off everyone would be.\n\nThe new law just passed by Congress made that very very clear. Defining the rights and duties of Iberia's regions, the legislation practically ended all pretense of political autonomy, leaving them more as symbolic institutions than actual levers of government. A large portion of people would undoubtedly be very angry. The opposition were practically livid. They would all get over it eventually.\n\nYet there was little point rubbing salt in an open wound. The separatists would be offered a few small symbolic concessions, things that might be of some importance to them, but of little real significance to the unity and security of Iberia. What did he care if the Catalans and Basque wanted to speak their own languages in private? Or perform their own little national dances? Such things harmed no-one.\n\nHe would of course anger the hardliners in his party and those further to the right, but that was inevitable when charting a course away from the ruinous, divisive politics of the past regime. Franga knew that he was in a unique position to finally solve the issue of the regions once and for all, and forge a democratic and truly united Iberia. This had to be done, despite all the detractors on the left and the right. Whatever the cost."

 IBR.626.t:0 "The First Rural Roots Festival" 
 IBR.626.d:0 "The sun beats down on a clear, beautiful day. The blue sky stretches overhead unto the horizon, and beneath its azure canopy a man in ragged, old-fashioned peasant's clothing heaves and grunts at the back end of an old iron plow, muttering curses at the stubborn ox hitched to the front. "Move, you old bastard!" bellows the peasant, swinging a leather whip at the beast's hindquarters. A nobleman on horseback, dressed in rural finery, chuckles and canters forth, giving the ox a whack with his riding crop and finally setting the mound of muscle in motion. The ox gives a guttural bray, lifting its head from grazing and continuing on its arduous journey across the field. The peasant smiles and raises a fist in triumph, drawing cheers from the large crowd of onlookers seated nearby. A camera clicks, capturing a memory of the past come back to life.\n\nOf course, this is no 16th-century farm, but the first annual 'Rural Roots Festival', designed to honour Iberia's rural past. Held on a warm day near Madrid, the festival has drawn tens of thousands so far with many more expected to arrive from as far afield as Catalonia and Portugal. The peasant and nobleman are just two of many historical re-enactors who have been tirelessly entertaining and educating the crowds. Beside the entrance to the main performance field stretch triple rows of stalls, numbering in the hundreds; many a well-off farmer has travelled up from Andalusia and Extremadura to hawk prime produce, jam, wine and honey. The citizens of Madrid, so used to the greys and browns of urban life, are spoiled for choice and clearly dazzled by the charm and diversity of the countryside's gifts.\n\nAs the day draws to a close and the sun dips towards the horizon, sleepy children are herded home, many tightly clutching toys and curios hard-won in traditional games. More than one farmer, who mere years ago was struggling to make ends meet, fires up his truck and sets off for home with a load of empty crates and a bulging wallet. As earnings and attendance figures roll in, a local council member smiles - this year's budget will be nicely padded for once."

 IBR.628.t:0 "The New National Curriculum" 
 IBR.628.d:0 "Schooling in Iberia has for decades been a stuffy, rigid business. Daily lessons in Latin, prayer at least once a day, and corporal punishment of children, all supervised by the Catholic Church. President Fraga was of the opinion that it was time for a change, if only to bring the country back into the 20th century. Whoever was given the job of spearheading the modernization effort would have to weather the storm of criticism from both the hardliners and the opposition liberals. Fraga would have to find a man of intellect and grit equaling the task. \n\nHe found such a man in Jose Luis Villar Palasi. Previously a minister in the old regime but now a supporter of Iberian democracy, Palasi was a soft, gentle man, unassuming and bespectacled. But underneath that veneer hid a towering intellect. Palasi was a polymath, speaking over 15 languages, and was known for his love of philosophy, economics, and law. And most important of all, he was a modernizing conservative, determined to bring the Spanish education system up to date with the latest trends and practices while maintaining its religious and civic character.\n\nPalasi's General Education Law passed easily through the Council, supported even by members of the opposition Unión Republicana. Its effects were sweeping and immediate. Archaic schooling practices such as Latin lessons were done away with and replaced with useful activities such as sports. Classes in religion would continue on and the Catholic nature of Iberian education would be maintained, but the influence of the priests and nuns would be curtailed in favor of educated professional teachers. Social science, philosophy, economics, and politics would be taught for the first time, and a unified system of standardized testing would ensure every student had a chance of going to university.\n\nAlready immensely popular, the reform has even won over some of the government's detractors, and made Palasi a household name."
 IBR.628.a:0 "God bless Palasi!"

 IBR.629.t:0 "Opus Dei Faces Audit"
 IBR.629.d:0 "Formally, the Opus Dei is an upstanding Catholic institution. They are dedicated to the faith, and appear to work tirelessly to ensure their devotion. However, there is a possibility that not everything is as it appears on the surface. A commonly held opinion within the party is that this upstanding moral character is too clean - and someone who strives so hard to appear honest is certainly hiding something. The train of thought that the Opus Dei is a fraud was something that was prevalent in far more places than ever expected, from a primary concern to a shred tucked in the back of their mind.\n\nIt wasn't hard to reach a consensus that something ought to be done, and so an audit on the Opus Dei was arranged. There was an issue, however. Because of their nature an investigation won't be able to hit everything in a reasonable time, and so to have even a chance of something substantial the investigation must be carefully directed. Suspicions are raised the most in two locations: their finances, and their political connections. Examining their financial connections is risky, as their threat is something any savvy politician knows, but if something is turned up then it could be decisive in discrediting the Opus Dei. Looking into their political connections could expose any ties with political parties that may be present, but if they have taken sufficient precautions then it's likely that nothing could be found regardless. Therefore, in order to maximize the odds of finding something suspicious, the investigators decided to"

 IBR.630.t:0 "The New Iberian Woman" 
 IBR.630.d:0 "President Fraga was not having a good day. For hours the Alianza Popular party room had been engaging in one of the most fractious debates of its short history, split down the middle on its approach to the government's policy concerning women's rights. Before now Franga and his cabinet had seen fit to avoid the question entirely, seeing it as a divisive distraction from the government's current legislative program.\n\nYet a small faction on the left of his party, led by popular journalist and writer María Victoria Fernández-España, had now raised the issue in the party room. Representing the small number of female Alianza Popular deputies, they were loudly calling for the government to encourage women to enter the workforce and break down traditionalist gender roles passed down from the old Iberian regime. Usually, Fraga would have been able to safely ignore them, but much to his annoyance, his secondhand man Jorge Verstrynge had already waded into the debate, backing the women. He would have to deal with Verstrynge's insubordination later, when this mess was over.\n\nThe hardliners were responding as they always did, suggesting that if the government conceded to the feminists they would soon be demanding abortion rights, the right to divorce, and the legalization of adultery, all fundamental challenges to the status of Iberia as a Catholic country. Their rhetoric had now begun to take on hyperbolic proportions, arguing that any movement of women into the workforce would undermine the Iberian family unit, the fundamental building block of Iberian society, thus resulting in social degradation and ultimately collapse.\n\nThe President had stayed out of it until now, hoping that the discussion would cool and they could move on to more pressing matters, but there seemed no end in sight. He would have to take the podium and intervene in the debate, lest the party tear itself apart. His word would ultimately settle things, with the center following his lead. As Fraga took the stage before his party, he set upon a course of action."

 IBR.631.t:0 "The New Penal Code"
 IBR.631.d:0 "Much had changed in Iberia since the days of the Caudillos. Democracy had been restored across the peninsula, new modernizing reforms were being passed almost every month, and the whole country was imbued with a renewed sense of optimism and hope for the future. Yet in the dark and musty courtrooms of Iberia, one felt transported back to ages past. Strict, archaic statutes, some dating back as far as 1944, continued to land a great many innocent Iberians in jail, while the courts were packed with apparatchiks of the old Falangist order.\n\nThe government's New Penal Code put an end to all of that. Hundreds of judges and other court officials associated with abuses under the Caudillos have been sacked, replaced with a new generation of young lawyers. A series of vital democratic reforms have been implemented, ensuring the accused the right to free legal representation and appeal, while also stripping the military of the right to try its members in secret military courts. Freedom of assembly and press are enshrined in law for the first time in decades. Jose Luis Villar Palasi, a legal thinker as well as an education reformer, has earned himself and the government much praise for his role in devising the new system.\n\nYet not everything has changed. Adultery, abortion, and divorce remain illegal, along with a whole series of other statues regulating sexual and social freedom. The death penalty will continue to be enforced for heinous crimes. The right for workers to associate in a union remains nebulous at best, and the police have as much power as they ever did.\n\nPresident Fraga and his party tow a fine line. Iberia must be free and democratic, its courts a beacon of fairness and equanimity on a continent gripped by extremist insanity. Yet it must also remain strong and just, ensuring the social and institutional fabric of the country, already so fragile in the aftermath of the Iberian War, remains intact."

 IBR.632.t:0 "Fraga Speaks"
 IBR.632.d:0 "Few Iberians knew President Manuel Fraga. A great number of them had voted for him, mostly because they believed he and the Alianza Popular represented a cautious, conservative choice for Iberia, a sort of halfway house between the old dictatorial regime and the new fledgling democracy. Many knew he had served briefly in the old regime as Minister for Information and Tourism, yet few Iberians recognized his face in the newspapers, and even less knew what his voice sounded like. \n\nFraga wanted to change that. If he was to be the man who led Iberia into its future as a modern democratic nation, he had to be a constant source of inspiration and comfort. Yet so many simply saw him as just another collaborator. Speaking directly to Iberians in their homes via the radio, he could give them his side of the story.\n\n"Fellow Iberians," he said, beginning his address to the nation. "I am speaking to you today to address my role in the old regime. I say to you today, as I have always said and always will say, that I am for a free, united, and democratic Iberia. Yet I believe we must remember the chaos which engulfed our homeland in these past decades. The regimes of Salazar and Franco arose in situations of anarchy across the peninsula, when the forces of extremism threatened to bring civilization toppling down. They united to form Iberia when under attack by those same forces of tyranny. Without these harsh measures, Iberia would not exist, and I would not be here talking to you today. Despite this, the violence and brutality of the old regime was unconscionable, and many mistakes were made. Some will ask why I do not feel guilt for my involvement in the regime of Salazar and Franco. As any who was there at the time can testify, I advocated long and hard within the ranks of the regime for democratic reforms, at risk to my own career and self. If the end result is Iberia, secure and free as it stands today, then I say I would gladly do it all over again.""

 #A Catholic Nation
 IBR.5050.t:0 "A Catholic Nation"
 IBR.5050.d:0 "The Catholic Church has always had deep roots in Iberia, dating back all the way to the Reconquista. As a consequence the nations of the peninsula have historically been unparalleled champions of the Catholic faith, and Catholic orders of all stripes have played an important role in governance and politics. Democratic Iberia is no different, and a number of Catholic organizations play an important role in Iberian politics.\n\nOne such organization is the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei, made up almost entirely of laymen and secular priests not tied to any monastic orders. Though deeply religiously conservative and supportive of Church doctrine, they were ostracised by many Falangists in the old regime who believed that Opus Dei was a covert front for freemasonry. Since the fall of the old regime they have become increasingly popular for their role in various charity efforts and sponsorship of universities.\n\nYet recently they have developed some very controversial ideas. While they recognize that Iberia is and must remain a Catholic state, they have shocked many right-wing Catholics across the country, and their liberal-minded Jesuit rivals, by supporting efforts to expand the freedoms of religious minorities in Iberia. Their leader and founder, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás has argued in his most recent book that "pluralism is not to be feared but loved as a legitimate consequence of personal freedom," concluding with the slogan: "Long live students of all religions and all ideologies."\n\nThis turn has caused serious tensions within the government. With the question of religious freedoms being talked about openly on the streets, pressure is being put on President Fraga to take a side. Either risk losing the support of Catholic hardliners within his own party, or risk alienating a sizable portion of Iberian Catholics. A decision will have to be made, one way or the other."

 IBR.5054.t:0 "Opus Dei Audit Finds Nothing of Note"
 IBR.5054.d:0 "When the investigation began it wasn't sure what the Alianza Popular wanted to find. Perhaps it was some incriminating documents, or some other scandalous piece of evidence. Their conditions were strict - not many people approved of an investigation into an institution of the Catholic Church, and so it took a lot of compromising to even get an approval into order.\n\nFaced with only a small amount of time, hostile oversight, and overly stringent standards the investigation team was left with the shaft. Even if they didn't, it's hard to tell if it would make a difference. The Opus Dei were to set an example in everything they did, and the audit finds that they did just that. Patrolling their records sent one the impression of a freshly-sponged room, so clean it reflected back at you.\n\nIf anything, the most notable thing to be found in the results is this cleanliness itself - no other organization carries themselves in such a wonderful manner.

 IBR.5055.t:0 "A Connection Between PRD and Opus Dei?"
 IBR.5055.d:0 "Working against time and excessively restrictive regulations, our investigators have prevailed. The reception to the idea of investigating a Catholic institution was received poorly, no matter the contents of their doings. As such, the only way even so much as a cursory glance could be approved was to compromise heavily, leading to a shackled audit. Therefore it was necessary to focus on one certain aspect in order to have any chance at a real breakthrough.\n\nTo our delight, pooling the resources into the investigation of the political ties of the Opus Dei has revealed a possible connection. It is a thread, weak and barely present, but nonetheless tangible. One of the main opposition parties, the PRD led by Alberto Ullastres, may possibly have a connection with the Opus Dei. Some even suspect they are nothing but their puppets! With this lead secured, what remained was to validate it by a rigorous investigation.\n\nThere are multiple ways an investigation into this possible political tie can be conducted. The easiest method would be to just conduct an expansion of the previous investigation, with formal support and a shield in the event of unexpected circumstances. However, this may not be enough. Attempting to go through legal channels, while sound, could allow for the Opus Dei to cover up any evidence they might have waiting to be used against them. To counter this a more illegal solution could be utilized, breaking into their headquarters and finding their documents before they could be hidden. It would be disastrous if word of this would get out, but the possible reward is far greater. How will we investigate this possible connection?"

It wasn't strictly legal, but you had to get your hands dirty to clean filth, right? There was a simple plan: a double agent would be recruited somewhere from the shadowy organization, find some documents, and report back with them. The kind of documents needed were very specific in nature - it had to be a collection important enough to be indisputable, while still proving a dedicated tie between Opus Dei and the PRD. Finding someone of absolute loyalty to the coin, however, was harder said than done. Once found, this double agent would use the plans as a checklist of sorts for the discovery of the necessary documents.\n\nNo questions were asked, and no answers were given. Payment was rendered for a service well performed. After this, the Alianza Popular's leadership was left with their prize. The evidence contained within was damning. The Opus Dei and the PRD were very closely linked. Their connection was, for the sake of legitimacy, kept carefully covered up. Especially surprising was the plans to cover up this connection, which were as extensive as they were detailed.

The populations of these areas are all in uproar following our recent legislation. According to various sources, they do not feel that we represent a party of Iberians, but of a party of Spanish. Since they did not vote for a Spanish party, we have effectively lost the minority vote.\n\nOur recent steps to grant token autonomy to minority regions is the source of this damage. As opposed to just being grateful, they have instead been outraged that we did not give them more. Because of our unwillingness to grant them the mile, they have taken the stance that we do not represent them. The resulting protests, most likely egged on by separatists, have crippled any productivity the minority areas could muster.

Nevertheless, despite the grumbles the police had been on a fair track to being separate from the armed forces.\n\nMaking the case for this has become significantly harder as of late. As law enforcement has been transferred to civilian oversight, the police forces have gone rampant. Reports of brutality have risen significantly, and professionalism and morale have taken a nose-dive. With such happenings it is far more difficult to make the case that the military should not enforce the law, since they seemed to have kept a tighter grasp on the police.

This legacy of bloodshed has continued on to Iberia, and we have been shackled to it as well. Even though Iberia is a free republic now, many of these terrorists simply haven't gotten the point. In nearly every minority region separatism has taken a major hit, but still holds a monumental popularity among some segments of the people.\n\nMost of these people will never take any action to further the cause they support, but there are those who will go so far as to sacrifice their lives for a misguided campaign. Usually they're just arrested. This action, while effective, is not entirely sustainable. These terrorists will just remain in prison, until they are broken out by their cohorts and returned back to causing chaos on the streets. Only one thing can definitively rule out this possibility, and it is their death; but killing the terrorists brings on a whole new debate.\n\nHow shall the Axencia eliminate these people? The most practical option would be to just kill off anyone suspected of being a separatist. This could prove very messy, and is highly risky. However, it would eliminate all of them far faster. Alternatively, we could send in hitmen to eliminate them quietly. This has far smaller odds of causing a stir - after all, it's only a couple of criminals - but would take far longer to properly be rid of them all. Finally, we could back away from this plan and leave them be. Nothing wagered, and nothing lost. But nothing will be gained either."

With their assistance, they were able to massacre almost every guard and nearly managed to broadcast their accusations over the radio network. Thankfully they were cut off before such a thing could happen, and the public is none the wiser of the events that triggered their assault. There is no doubt of the disaster letting a bunch of criminals and murderers back out into society, as this group undoubtedly wishes to, which leaves only one option on the table."

They would eliminate the separatist agitators at the head of the riot, followed by the special forces working in tandem with Madrid police and Guardia Civil to contain the would-be prison break and arrest the rioters. While not a first option, lethal force was to be used on anyone who overly resisted. Bringing in new guards would be an issue, but the local law enforcement and Guardia Civil could serve in their stead for the interim. In theory, the inmates would be pacified and back in their cells with minimal casualties, and in no longer than a couple of hours.\n\nIn this particular instance, theory was far detached from reality. By some unknown factor - though insider assistance is most likely - the ringleaders of the riot were not dispatched, and the special forces were pitted against a crowd of angry inmates hungry for their freedom. The prisoners were no match, and were eventually pacified. This took many more hours than originally estimated, and the bodycount was easily more than triple the original estimate. As these kinds of incidents always do, this was of course leaked to the press.

Faced with only a fraction of their initial opponents, the riot was quickly brought to a close.

The police frequently identified subjects, typically accurately, but could not act without any evidence. Because of this, the contract killers continued unmolested by law enforcement.\n\nUnfortunately, no system lasts forever. Typically the longer lasting a scandal the larger impact it makes, but this was a relatively recent altercation which caused a disproportionate stir. One of the hitmen has been arrested, using evidence we were not able to remove from the occasion. Currently incarcerated, something needs to be done before he exposes the entire system. There are two probable options. He can be eliminated in prison, silencing him before he even speaks, or some more money can be used to ensure he doesn't speak.

To this extent, they were merciless. Under the harsh light of interrogation this resolve of silence eroded away. The hitman eventually buckled under the pressures of rigorous investigation and confessed to it all.

He broke, and confessed everything he knew to them. Thankfully there wasn't much to know - two men gave him an impressive amount of contraband in exchange for killing someone.

The camera lingered on him for some time before panning back out the rest of the rally, several thousand strong.\n\n"Can you believe this shit Jorge?" President Manuel Fraga said, growing exasperated as he stared intently at the screen. "I deliver them democracy and they call me a fascist. The youth are so ungrateful."\n\nJorge Verstrynge, Fraga's second hand man and political proteje, fidgeted nervously in his seat as the two men sat before the television screen. What he would say next would certainly anger his boss, but it had to be said.\n\n"Respectfully Manuel, it's not just the youth. The cuts have turned a great number of people against us. Pensioners, the sick, those with disabilities, the unemployed. Austerity was certainly necessary to stop an economic crash created by the oil crisis, but we have to recognize how unpopular the cuts are."\n\n"They are only temporary," Fraga scoffed. "And what can we do? It's not like we could give in to their demands and reverse the cuts. To do so would be to bow to the will of the mob. No, the streets belong to the state, not the people. The streets belong to me! I would be better off sending in the police to clear them all out."\n\nVerstrynge was disturbed by such talk, but did not let it show. There might come a day where Fraga overstepped, and action would have to be taken, but for now he would have to try to sway him to a reasonable course.\n\n"Look, nobody is saying we give them everything they want. But maybe restoring funding to a few of the programs, partially reversing a few of the cuts. That would defuse the protests and still ensure we avoid financial ruin."\n\nFraga's eyes broke away from the television screen and turned to Verstrynge. He was clearly surprised by the proposal.\n\n"All I ask is that you consider it Manuel," Verstrynge said, trying to ward off an argument before it began. "We all want what is best for Iberia.""

I guess he had every right to be, with many of his cherished social security programs, implemented by his ministry since the establishment of democracy, being dismantled in recent weeks. Yet still, Fraga had not expected this much opposition, let alone at a cabinet meeting.\n\n"We have no choice," Jorge Verstrynge responded, taking point and showing Fraga why he kept him around as his second-hand-man. He really was quite invaluable in a debate. "The oil crisis has seriously depleted our treasury. If we don't raise taxes we will not be able to pay our debts. We are facing a sovereign default."\n\n"To hell with that," de la Fuente retorted, now turning and pleading directly to the President. "If we need more money, we have to find it elsewhere. It is hard-working middle class people of Iberia who support our government. Raising their taxes will be a stab in the back. I guarantee you, Mr. President, that if we do this our own supporters will throw us out at the next election."\n\nFraga knew there was some truth to what de la Fuente was saying. The traditional middle class base of the Alianza Popular wanted to see less taxes, not more, and support for the government would atrophy as a result. But the economists had been quite clear to him in his briefings on the economic state of the country: Either raise taxes, or face oblivion.

And though he had been a Falangist in his youth, experience had now taught him that a softer hand was necessary in such situations. Driving the unions underground during the old regime of the Caudillos had only made matters worse, inflaming radicalism and posing the interests of the state against those of the working man. That is why he had been pushing for labour reform in the Alianza Popular government, trying to convince President Manuel Fraga to support his changes. So far he had experienced some success. The unions were no longer underground, and he could negotiate openly with their leaders, yet just enough of the restrictions from the old days remained that the state usually had the upper hand. Just how he liked it.\n\nBut the Oil Crisis and now the Public Sector Strike had ruined his plans. Forced to implement sweeping privatization programs in health, education, and even welfare and pensions to raise emergency revenue and cut down on bloated public spending, the government had now triggered one of the largest public sector strikes in Iberian history with tens of thousands of public sector workers demanding a reversal of the privatization scheme and the restoration of government funding.\n\nAs he sat in his office preparing to meet with the union leadership, de la Fuente tossed up his options. He could tell the unions they would not be getting a deal, and push ahead with his orders to enforce the privatization. He would almost certainly have to deploy the Civil Guard to crush the strike.\n\nOr, he could get on the phone right now and call the President. Up until now Fraga had respected his remit on labour issues. More importantly, Franga himself, while deeply worried about the economic crisis, seemed more concerned with avoiding further rifts within the government. De la Fuente knew that if he asked Fraga to moderate the privatization scheme, he might just acquiesce, if only to avoid a split. Whatever de la Fuente's choice, he would have to act soon."

Meanwhile the economy was in freefall, unemployment was at an all-time high, and the state was facing financial ruin. If things did not improve, and soon, Manuel Fraga knew that he and his government would be facing catastrophe. Yet in the meantime, support had to be shored up. Speaking directly to the people, as he had done many times before, was his best and last chance.\n\n"Fellow Iberians," he began, addressing his countrymen in his customary manner. "As you are all aware, the country finds itself in the midst of a deep economic crisis the likes of which it has never faced. We in the government are well aware of the suffering this has generated amongst broad layers of the Iberian people. \n\nIt is for this reason that the government has pursued a policy of austerity, to make sure that the state, which protects and provides for all Iberians, continues to be able to function. These measures are temporary, and were employed with the greatest possible reluctance on the behalf of myself and the government. In this time of difficulty and struggle, we must all band together as Iberians, tighten our belts, and make sacrifices for the greater good of the country. \n\n"Many think that the threats to the security and peace of Iberia have disappeared in this time of economic crisis. They have not. Marxian extremism, totalitarian threats from abroad, and seperatist terrorism may yet return to Iberian shores in this period if Iberians do not remain vigilant and united. In the years of democracy we have built a new, modern Iberia. Now I am asking all Iberians to help defend her, to put the needs of the country and community first.

In the same league is of liberalism. The adherents are misinformed, brainwashed into something evil by anarchists. Regardless, the how and the why hardly matter, beyond a reason to oppose their cruelty. It has to be handled with great care, in order to ensure the campaign isn't sabotaged. Every good crusade has a specialization, and there are two specializations that are practical for antiliberal use.\n\nThe most obvious path is to eliminate the corruptors at their core, and destroy the spread of influence by removing the people who spread it. This will have to be handled quietly, as any major disappearances could cause a major catastrophe if exposed. Alternatively, the influences could be quelled by a propaganda campaign. If we choose to use propaganda, there is no guarantee that the influence will be effectively countered. However, there would not be as much of a backlash from the campaign.\n\nResources are limited, so there is only the time and budget to do one of the two. The choice needs to be careful.

Only one last hitch remained before finalization: how would this all be directed?\n\nThere is no denying that separatists can draw from areas outside of the regions they claim to represent - more than once has a non-minority been arrested for working with terrorist groups. Are they more of a threat than the minority forces of these groups? The resources behind the propaganda program are limited, and we cannot hit everywhere at once. We can target the individual minority regions, and cut off the main source of the terrorist manpower. If we so wish, the program could be put across Iberia as a whole.

For anything to get done, attention needs to be honed in on one specific spot.\n\nOf the myriad of facets, there is one in particular that gains the attention of criminals: universities.The impressionable, young minds are perfect for propaganda. If we were to plant agents in undercover areas then we could catch separatists red-handed. A riskier solution is to attempt to break into the terrorist groups themselves, sabotaging them from inside.

They do not worry, because they do not believe retribution will not be applied to them.\n\nThe change in perception can be reversed by vigorous application of propaganda and other methods of spreading information.

On average, they go through more equipment and more men than they have ever before.

The most pressing motivation to stop this is how it makes the government appear. When an over-use of force isn't reined in, it makes for a very bad look. It makes the administration of the Caudillos seem brutal, cruel, when in reality it is nothing of the sort.\n\nThis sort of happening is nothing new, but what is new about it is the frequency of its happening.

The intellectuals are very entrenched, so removing them is certain to cause an uproar. An operation with less risk is to target the downright treasonous elements of the government. These politicians are attempting to bring the Union down from inside its own administration. Removing them will fix any degenerate shifts the government might undertake. As well, they are not as popular as their intellectual cousins. It is also possible to target the terrorists further, who are in cahoots to help push the propaganda onto good citizens.

The first plan was to use stealth in order to get things done. Accidents, assassinations, and all sorts would be used to eliminate without causing an uproar. While suspicious, it could be effective. Alternatively, others have advocated the use of a velvet glove - force is not strictly necessary, and the targets will realize that. Working with them while also making sure they know of the violence that could be leveled at them could be very effective, making collaborators out of rivals.

 IBR.5090.d:0 "It came to be that there was a dreadful rhythm to a terrorist raid. Always, some official in some office hundreds of miles away from the scene would sign a piece of paper, sending many to certain death or something of the sort as easily as if they were eating lunch. To these bureaucrats, it was little more than numbers on a report.\n\nTo the agents on the field, it was still little more than the rhythm of death. The view on the ground was a bit messier, but even against all the mess it was still the same underneath, but with a few extra steps. Get briefed, go to the location, take down the door, always the door, then drag a fellow or a few more out kicking and screaming. It certainly wasn't lucky when they went down with guns blazing and tears of desperation in their eyes, but it was nearly welcomed. After all, familiarity breeds contempt, and there is no better familiarity than a job. Anything to break up the monotony was appreciated, no matter how violent.\n\nAll of it was to a good end, the stability of Iberia. Like a box carried by ants, it was much more firmly planted on the ground once the insects were properly squashed. Even better, more ants who would think themselves special for coming up with some idea or another will have a worse time getting off the ground, as now they cannot act off the backs of others."

 IBR.5091.d:0 "The man wrote one last sentence, examining his finished work. It was an entire manifesto, roughly, of just how he felt on the government and why he felt that way. As he peered into the darkness of the nighttime countryside, he felt a happiness so great that he was sure he could never be happy again. Tomorrow, he would share it all with his cohorts at the nearby university, and above all else he was excited for it. He switched his desk lamp off, and moved to prepare for bed.\n\nJust one last thing, to close his manifesto cover! He shuffled through his home to his study, and started to get worried when he could not find his writing. Surely it was on the desk, the author had left it just there.. He switched his lamp on, and looked around. It wasn't on the table, and he found it scattered on the floor. As he bent down to pick it up, he felt the arms of Axencia agents force him to the ground.\n\nThis was not the only major author removed from the public eye, and combined the group has taken a major hit to numbers. Above all, they are afraid. The intellectuals will not speak out against the government for sure, or else they would end up another example. Already, the liberal surge has begun to dissipate, slightly."

 IBR.5092.t:0 "The Iberian Government Appears Weak"
 IBR.5092.d:0 "When in the business of bribes, one has to be careful. If you do not provide a threat, then the motivator loses its purpose. It is an easy pitfall, and one the Iberian government has fallen into hook, line, and sinker. For not being too firm, they have been punished with little to no change from their circumstances, and nothing but a spent pocketbook to show for it.\n\nMany of the officials in question took the bribes, with many promises of efficiency and work ethic in exchange for the unexpected bonus. Most of the many required some more, and some more, and some more... nothing was done, ultimately, and with an affinity for gaining last chances it was unlikely that anything would be done.\n\nEven worse, the recent failure to act harshly enough against the enemies of Iberia has turned the people against their once trusted government. Any complacency cannot be tolerated when the Union is faced with overwhelming forces ready to bring it down; this mistake cannot be repeated. With no changes in the system, it seems that the government has become a laughing stock, a country of all bark and no bite."

 IBR.5093.d:0 "No plan is ever simple, preparing for variable after variable. Fortunately the execution is much simpler than the planning, as every hitch is only a redundancy, designed to make sure that any unseen surprises do not upset the operation. Rarely used, the Axencia has grown complacent. Where there were once sophisticated plots to foil some terrorist safehouse, there is now little detail of use for the agents on the field. Where twisting, almost all-conceiving nets of circumstances and possibilities warned the operatives of anything that may befall them, one can only find a plan that is effectively a straight line in and out.\n\nThe agents on the field themselves have gone from shining examples to uninterested clerks with guns. Where creativity and quick-thinking once resided, now lies stubbornness and complacency. They are incapable of operating as well as they could, and many are in it to get paid and leave as opposed to keeping the Union together.\n\nIt's not like enemies of the state of all colors haven't noticed this as well. Agents have been foiled at every turn. Even worse, arrests have dwindled to dangerously low levels. The Axencia is becoming unable its main job in defeating terrorism, but also in assisting with other critical covert operations. It will take a long time before discipline is whipped back into them, and until that time comes Iberia will be in a dangerous position."

Astoundingly, this march is in sympathy with the targets of the most recent crackdowns, all of whom were verifiably enemies of the state, and had grown very violent. Just as water cannons were being considered, some wise soul decided it apt to fire upon the crowd. This sparked a riot so violent it took two days to force down.\n\nThis riot was only a symptom of the problem: unrest against the force applied by Iberian agents in order to rid the nation of those who would rather see Iberia burn. The only way to force the discontent back down is to step away from unrestricted brutality, and take a lighter approach. Damage has still been done to the stability of Iberia, and separatists will surely appreciate this weak spot."

There is a small limp in his step, but it is drowned out by the plethora of guards sprinkled liberally across the stage. He finds his voice with a simple clear of the throat, booming out a tone few elders would have in depth and confidence.\n\n"I have... have brought myself here to you all today because I wish to address the Iberian Council." The effort strains him, but he finds himself using his arms, gesturing wildly as he had years ago.\n"Their dedication is truly commendable. Their help is one that has proven invaluable. Iberians!" He snaps, a crescendo of volume piercing through his earlier speech, just as quickly gone.\n"Do not ever forget the qualities of these patriots! The merits of the council are those that you must aspire to! Loyalty, commitment, morality... always, always keep these in your hearts."\n\nAs the Caudillo moves off stage, his voice fatigued from a long and formidable speech, he is given a farewell of applause.

 IBR.719.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, many members of the Council found themselves with a particular letter in their mailboxes, printed yellow and red and green and many more colors, but those three in particular. This meant only one thing: someone wanted their attention, and that letter contained the reason why.\n\nAs it turned out, there was a very important reason. The Caudillos had a meeting prepared, one to address a particular issue which had come up suddenly. It wasn't a scheduled meeting, because the problem was so sudden that it had to be addressed immediately. The time and date were included, and with it the bait was set. Anyone who wasn't already notified was to be notified by their peers, if at all possible. At the most dire, this situation may even require some more power for the Council to help solve it.\n\nThe chamber of deputies was particularly renovated, with a new coat of paint and new furnishings too. Well guarded, it looked to be a comfortable, easy meeting."
 IBR.719.a:0 "Welcome All!"

 IBR.720.t:0 "A Very Long Meeting"
 IBR.720.d:0 "Things looked to drag on for ages. A Caudillo would present an issue, discuss it with his cohort, then pose it to the council. Like a crank, each part of the council moved an issue back and forth, back and forth, in a seemingly endless motion. In an endless cycle of bickering, arguing, and all-but-brawls, a united consensus would come of something. It was muddled, indecisive, and frequently did not entirely address what they were set out to be. Not to say that everyone participated in such a scheme, but those seemed to frequently lose the tug-of-war with those in it for the money and those who took an unusual happiness in throwing a wrench into the process. They were so engrossed in their debates, in fact, that nobody seemed to notice the guards locking the doors.\n\nSomeone turned to leave, enraged by some comment angled in his direction. He tried the doors, and attempted to open them even harder when they did not open. The council member was prepared to argue with a guard nearby attempting to shoo him back to his seat. Seemingly out of patience, the guard simply knocked the man to the floor with  a blow from the stock of his rifle. The thud caught the attention of many, slowly suffocating the noise in the room.\n\nCaetano chuckled, age never dulling the feeling of a good scheme. Franco spoke to those assembled, his voice booming through the room.\n"It was so helpful of you all to attend! We are going to fix the problems in Iberia, and you are going to help us. We are going to stay here until then. So...""

 IBR.721.d:0 "With the doors locked, armed guards watching every entrance, and the groaning pile of a man dragged back to slump in his seat, the Council found themselves the hostages of men so old they belonged better in a museum. Franco continued speaking.\n\n"There will be no food, no water, and even if it means the deaths of you all, there will be a working plan before we leave this room. So! I would advise you all to stop cowering, and start brainstorming."\n\nSuffice to say, they were much more talkative after the Caudillo's advisory. An issue was presented, discussed, and questioned. It was like a tug-of-war, but now both sides were tugging. The Caudillos would present a problem, the Council would suggest solutions, and attempt to hold them up under scrutiny. The Council would present a problem, and the Caudillos would present solutions. It was rigorous and exhausting, but everyone seemed willing to step up and brave it.\n\nIt was the next day before the Caudillos seemed satisfied, with a prepared document so thick that it seemed a paperweight, and so heavy that an aide had to carry it. The finishing signatures were met with claps of delight by Franco, as Caetano stepped up to say a few words."

 ###Congress Tree Events (Fate of the Council)###
 
 IBR.5100.t:0 "Conservatives Raise Concerns"
 IBR.5100.d:0 "Those whom are defined as Conservatives in our political establishment have rather loudly raised their concerns towards the speed of the reforms that have grasped Iberian political society. Writing to the Caudillos personally, head honchos from the old guard stated clearly and concisely their anxieties toward what is currently taking place in the nation.\n\nBelieving that the "breakneck reformation will allow for the scourge of liberalism and even worse communism to once again flow in Iberia", the old guard Conservatives have written a rather impassioned plea that also states that "the change that is occurring on all fronts threatens not only the political existence of our regime but also the very future of Iberia. We write as a collective to give you our genuine advice that this process may very well destroy everything we have worked so hard to build. This process could lead to a catastrophic turn of events that would tear Iberia apart from the inside. Please do not let his happen."\n\nA stirring letter it may have been, but we still hold the real power in Iberia and we can choose to dismiss the concerns of these vestiges if need be. Or we could also pay heed to their opinions and give them a promise to listen further to their advice."
 IBR.5100.a:0 "We share their concerns"
 IBR.5100.b:0 "These ideas are unfounded"
 
 IBR.5101.t:0 "A Letter of Approval"
 IBR.5101.d:0 "The figures that make up the old guards have seemingly rejoiced at our response that we will listen closely to their concerns and will take them on board. Once again writing to ourselves they have wrote up a pleasant and congratulatory letter that praises our decision.\n\nIn a jubilant letter, co-signed by the major old guard figures, the conservatives have stated\n"To our humble Caudillos, we give our most grateful thanks that you have decided to pay attention to your oldest and most thankful supporters. It is extremely pleasing to hear that you take our concerns about the future of Iberia seriously and will see to it that the fifth column and the agents of chaos won't bring ruin to the nation through this process. You can count on us to help in any way we can to see to it that a great calamity does not occur. We shall gratefully give you our support and you can rest easy that no further complaints will arise should the current situation be kept."\n\nEvidently it seems that conservative support of the government has increased. We may need to count on these men should trouble arise further down the line."
 IBR.5101.a:0 "We have listened to our oldest and wisest supporters, if anyone knows best its them"
 
 IBR.5102.t:0 "The Mutterings of Disapproval"
 IBR.5102.d:0 "With our blatant disregard of the conservatives quite frankly in our eyes unfounded notions, we have received no further written letters begging for us to listen to the old guard. Nor have we also been sent a letter decrying that we have "betrayed the very ideals that Iberia and its governance was built on" or any other such rubbish. These men know better than to further directly challenge our authority, it was ourselves after all who stopped the renegade Falange some time ago, but that doesn't mean they will not scheme against us. These dinosaurs of yesteryear may not look like much but they are heavily experienced in the political game. Some noise is likely to be created amongst the most zealous and hard-line in the faction but the rest will likely bide their time, waiting for an opportunity to trample on the process.\n\nIt is quite likely that we will not be able to rely heavily upon the conservatives as their support for the process dips with their lack of faith in us. Whether this vitriol will remain the tantrums of old men or morph into something far more seditious and dangerous remains to be seen. What is known however, is that the old guard is not happy and likely won't take this decision lying down."

 IBR.5103.t:0 "The Regional Debate"
 IBR.5103.d:0 "Perhaps the most contentious issue in the process is the issue of separatism. Basque, Galicians, Catalans etc. all have made the claims for nationhood and have sometimes used violence as a means to achieve their goals. The history of this issue is seemingly everlasting, it has become ingrained beneath the very skin of Iberia. Many have died fighting for and against the ideals of the separatists but a radical option of paying heed to the separatists is now available. So too, is the option to shut them out once again.\n\nOn the one hand, listening to the separatists and giving them a real Special Regions programme would perhaps allow for the future of Iberia to remain stable and whole in the end. Terrorism would hopefully eventually cease and the needs of these people will be placated within a deal we could hopefully reach with them. On the other hand, giving any sort of leniency to their demands may set the dominoes off and foresee to the balkanisation of Iberia. Whatever decision we make we are bound to upset someone. But we must do whatever's best for the future of Iberia so disaster does not strike in these world changing times."

 IBR.5104.t:0 "The Placating of the Separatist"
 IBR.5104.d:0 "It once seemed like a pipe dream that the Caudillos would even consider notions of regionalism in the nation of Iberia or even in the previous nations of Spain and Portugal. Time and time again the despots, the monarchs and the governors of Iberia's past had ruthlessly crushed separatist dreams. In response the separatists turned to politics by way of the gun and a seemingly everlasting cycle of violence began to grip Iberia. Now, however, the cycle may just be starting to crumble.\n\nWith a promise of listening to the regionalists and considering their demands for a real Special Regions programme, the separatist movements have now been forced to take the process seriously. A real breakthrough may arise from this, it has been enough to make any hard-line separatist zealot think twice about any would-be terrorist attack. While the issue is certainly not been put to bed, a clear expression of confidence in the process has been given by the regionalists. By proxy, this means some confidence has also been given to this governance.\n\nHowever, this decision may come at cost. There are many in Iberia who would rather die than see the nation break up into pieces. Indeed, some may believe that this olive branch to separatism will hasten this. Of course, this is nothing but the delusions of staunch paranoia but we must be weary. Not only of the separatists but of those within our own governance as well."

 IBR.5105.t:0 "The Fire and Fury of the Separatist Menace"
 IBR.5105.d:0 "Iberia is one indivisible and eternal nation. There will be no entertaining of separatist notions that would lead to certain doom. This goes double for the treacherous separatists in Spain who once worked as a heathenish Bolshevik fifth column. We have not forgotten their treachery and to placate them now would let them simply bite the hand that feeds. Its simple, you give these deserters an inch and they'll take a mile. We completely and utterly reject their demands that would have seen Iberia crumple into a failed state.\n\nThis has of course not gone down too well with the separatists who were sticking their neck out talking to the government in the first place. Now it seems we're back to the usual cycle of terror. The more militant and radical elements of the various separatist movements have apparently been "proven right" by our response and more attacks are likely to follow. Let them come we say, for we have faced them down once before and will do so again. The separatist may cry and stomp their feet but they will not tear apart this great nation. We, with all our might, shall see to it."

 IBR.5106.t:0 "Technocrats Appeal to the Congress"
 IBR.5106.d:0 "With the process chugging along, the technocrats aligned with the Opus Dei organization have sent out a plea wishing for the furthering of their involvement in the process. Believing that the process apparently needs a "qualified voice" to speak up on certain matters, they have sent in a number of proposals that they seek to bring to the table. One such proposal they are particularly pushing is the improvement of civil liberties for Iberians.\n\nOn the outset, these proposals seem all well and good but God knows what these people are truly after. One thing this process cannot allow for is the fifth column to arise once again. It occurred once before and it took the strength of an entire nation and a sea of blood to stop the fifth column antagonist. That being said, it could be worth placating these people if we are to embark on real reform in Iberia. These technocrats could certainly prove to be a key part of the process if we are to take them, and their proposals, on board."
 IBR.5106.a:0 "This process needs their input"
 IBR.5106.b:0 "The Opus Dei should not be involved"
 
 IBR.5107.t:0 "A Technocrats Triumph"
 IBR.5107.d:0 "With Opus Dei's involvement in the process, the dynamics of Iberian political society have clearly changed. Socio-economic liberalism has seemingly been given the all clear, now the floodgates are open for the rest of Opus Dei's proposals. The decision to take in Opus Dei and their opinions has caused no shortage of hoo-ha amongst the more conservative sections of Iberian political society. This matters little though, for the process requires the means of all qualified voices in Iberia. The Opus Dei are to be welcomed on board and bring a hopefully healthy element to the Congress.\n\nThe Opus Dei have of course been nothing but grateful of the opportunity provided to them by the Iberian government. This gratefulness has been showcased by their entrenchment of support for not only the process but also the government as well. The technocrats will certainly have to prove their usefulness as the Congress will soon evolve into its most crucial stages. In any case it is hoped that the technocratic expressors will bring something new and fresh to the table."

 IBR.5108.t:0 "Liberalism Combatted"
 IBR.5108.d:0 "The rejection of Opus Dei and their proposals has not gone unnoticed. Both conservatives and reformers have seen our decision as indicative of our intentions for the Congress but in reality, it was something more than that. For it was obvious to everyone what the Opus Dei's proposals of so called "civil liberties" and their hoity-toity pretensions of qualifications actually meant. This technocracy is simply the scourge of uncontrolled liberalism disguised and thus, the Opus Dei have been put in their place once more.\n\nThis calculated decision has not gone without its consequences though. Any hopes the Opus Dei had in the government and the process has been slashed considerably. Any support we could count on from the technocrats has near evaporated but, we have done what we must to keep Iberia safe and secure from the ills of liberalism once again. We make no apologies and Opus Dei should now hopefully know better than to get considerably involved in matters that in actuality know little about."

 IBR.5109.t:0 "The Armed Forces Role"
 IBR.5109.d:0 "The situation in Iberia today is far removed from the past and these testing times have clearly influenced Iberian political society. For example, it has become a common belief within certain sections of the Iberian government that the nation is under an existential threat from the forces of terrorism. It has been alleged that Bolsheviks and separatists have ran rampant in the recent past, beseeching our great nation with the horrors of urban warfare. There has thus been a clear worry that the current process will not only not stop the terrorist threat, but also increase it as instability grows in the nation. It is through this worry that the military and its most staunch supports have stepped into the limelight.\n\nThe military very clearly want to have a voice in the current ongoing debates. They, of course, claim they only wish to do so in order to stave off the threats of instability and terrorism. The more cynical amongst us however, deem that they only wish to do so in order to keep hold of their power and stop any sort of reform to the armed forces. Their intentions certainly seem to be wholly political rather than mere love for the nation, Iberia of course having a clear history of military involvement in political affairs. This occasion seems no different but we could put a stop to their meddling in an obvious showcase of our commitment to reform. That being said, capitulation to the armed forces may be necessary in order to stop any separatist threat or leftist plot."

 IBR.5110.t:0 "A Very Liberal Indignation"
 IBR.5110.d:0 "Our agreement with the armed forces has clearly rattled some feathers in the Iberian Congress. The more liberal elements amongst us have kicked up an almighty storm in the debates that such an apparently "craven" deal could be struck with the alleged "authoritarian despots whom have next to no regard for democracy". Resignations and walkouts soon followed after the tantrums which all had one clear message. A glaring lack of faith in this government to deliver any "meaningful" democratic reforms.\n\nBut why should we pay heed to these flabby and naive liberals. It would seem from this kicking and screaming that the liberals would rather our nation succumb to socialism, separatism and subjugation than to give the armed forces a deserved role. These men are amongst the most principle among us. They bravely did what was necessary once before to send to Bolshevik menace packing and put separatist notions back in their desired place. So sure, the liberals may be unhappy with our decision but the nation will be thankful for our decision to bring the heroic military fully on board."
 IBR.5110.a:0 "Our brave boys come before any limp liberal"
 
 IBR.5111.t:0 "An Antagonistic Army"
 IBR.5111.d:0 "The decision to so blatantly tell the army and its political backers that they are not needed nor wanted in the political process has went about as well as could be expected with the military and its supporters. Incensed that such a snub could occur, the army has "expressed its deep disappointment that such a decision was taken" but so far that has been all they have done. They have been clearly stopped where they thought they could succeed; the yes men of previous administrations have evidently made them arrogant towards us. Now that they have been told no, like an opulent child they cry out against the rational choice. They will now need to reconfigure but this gives us more than enough time to figure out how to truly sap their power if need be through this process.\n\nHowever, this decision has also irked the military's conservative backers who have likewise expressed a definite voice of a lack of confidence in ourselves and the process. It's plain to see they don't have what it takes to stop Iberia from falling in on itself, so latched onto a past that no longer exists, but it matters little. The process shall go on with no insidious meddling from the armed forces."
 IBR.5111.a:0 "The army shall know its place in this new Iberia"
 
 IBR.5112.t:0 "Broadcasting the Debates?"
 IBR.5112.d:0 "A question has remained ever present throughout this whole process, it teeters on every meeting and talk that has so far been held. Precisely what is democracy and what should it entail? Well certain liberal adherents believe it entails one key feature. The people and their input. In order to envision a truly democratic reformation process, it has been recommended that the final debates should be broadcast to the whole public to show transparency and a genuine commitment to democracy. All in Iberia, be they rich or poor, Spanish or Portuguese, conservative or liberal will be able to watch the most important debates and no doubt voice their opinion towards the results.\n\nThis huge spectacle could have drastic ramifications. While it may show the government has faith in its people and shows an attempt at making a connection with them, it could also cost us dearly. Should the debates go smoothly we have little to worry about, but if they end in disaster then God knows what the consequences will be from the public. Instability is already too high and this just might push Iberia over the edge. We could keep the debates behind closed doors as a precaution but this may also give off signs to our true feelings towards this process."

 IBR.5113.d:0 "For the first time it what seemed like centuries, posters and leaflets were seen throughout Iberia that was not just Falangist propaganda or pro-regime material. It was a callout, a mass marketing campaign unlike anything seen in Iberia before. Walls, lampposts and shops all had them on display. It was a message to the whole of Iberia that perhaps the most important event in its history was about to take place. People first whispered about it, somewhat in disbelief, and then they began to shout about it. For the Iberian Congress was about to broadcast its final debates to the entire nation for all of the public to see.\n\nTo those born in the Caudillos Iberia, the proposal seemed foreign and alien yet exciting. A new development that would give a leashed public a legal voice in the proceedings of the nation. To those much older who had seen a society much different from that of Iberia today, there was cynicism but some couldn't help but be optimistic. Maybe, just maybe this could be the real deal. The outcome could be a hopeful one, one that helps stop Iberia's decimation. After all, it appears to be partly in the hands of the people now does it not?"

 IBR.5115.t:0 "Civil Liberty Reforms Pushed"
 IBR.5115.d:0 "As the representatives of the Iberian council toil away at the reformation progress, one proposal has surprisingly enough been pushed with some success. Led, directed and whipped into action by the technocratic faction of the Council, a proposal for the strengthening of civil liberties has found its way at the forefront of debate proceedings. Opus Dei's liberal allies have helped along with this process which could change the very nature of the future Iberian regime. For decades the nation has been ruled by strongmen and their hegemonic grasp on civil society. Now, that power could be broken as the right of the individual look to be ratified under these reforms.\n\nThe reforms are no doubt drastic, a total overhaul of the former principles of Iberian civil society. The reforms are sure to find their antagonists in the army and the conservatives but for now the reforms seem to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. If the current proceedings occur without and hiccups, then the technocrats and their allies will have accomplished a remarkable victory with this legislation."

 IBR.5116.t:0 "Drafting of Minor Reforms"
 IBR.5116.d:0 "As with nearly every important thing in life, necessity is key. And my fellow Iberians, is it really necessary to embark on such a wide ranging and tiresome debacle on civil liberty reform? Would it not be so, that this complete uprooting and overhaul of Iberian civil society would leave us weak to the scourges of separatism and the fifth column threat? The Council it seems is certainly of this same opinion, with an agreement recently being reached concluding that there is no need to quickly make any sweeping changes in regard to civil liberties. The antagonism of the conservatives and the army would no doubt have reached dangerous heights if the Council as to embark on such an all-encompassing reform. Drastic measures are to be left aside as compromise, it is hoped, will be the theme of the debates.\n\nOf course, certain liberals and Opus Dei sympathizers do not quite see the drafting of these scaled back reforms the same way as the majority of the Council. There are cries of a deliberate shut down at an attempt of real reform and the scuttling of a chance for Iberia to become a new society. This view though is as utopian as it is naïve, these liberals are far too narrow sighted to see the larger threat any drastic reform could deliver to Iberia's doorstep. We shall let them stew but we know we have done right."

 IBR.5117.d:0 "The ideas and solutions proposed by the technocratic elements of the Council have been met with disdain and dismissiveness from the militarist faction in the Council. The militarists have made their contempt known, citing that the proposals from Opus Dei and their allies will make Iberia unsafe. Clearly wishing to play on the threats from Bolshevism and separatism, the army have stated that they would be unable to fight off the dangers to Iberian society. It soon became clear as the heat rose in the Council that with every utterance the militarists made against the proposal, the less chance any sort of compromise could be reached.\n\nThe technocrats fought back against the accusations, defending their proposals and stating that the militarists "only sought to keep a stranglehold on their despotic power of Iberia". With the debate raging on, it soon became clear to all those who saw that the Council was marred by factionalism. If these men could not come together for Iberia now, some thought, then what could ever possibly unite them?"

 IBR.5118.d:0 "The attempted push for civil liberty reforms, pursued by the technocratic councilmen, has been met with an immediate negative reaction from the more conservative inclined members of the Council. The conservatives have been brutal in their condemnation of the reforms, stating in heated hustings that the proposals "go against everything Iberia stands for" and "is the sort of treacherous liberalism that would tear this nation apart and subdue it under an unpatriotic ideology". The liberals have held their ground in the proceedings though, coming straight back at the conservatives and condemning them as "tired-out tyrants only looking to keep the Iberian people down and themselves afloat". At one point the debate looked so viscous, it was a surprise chairs were not thrown between the two competing sides.\n\nIn the end, there appears to be a considerable amount of pushback from sections of the Iberian pollical class against these reforms. While the reforms are apparently intended to simply improve the lives of the everyday Iberian, their perception as the work of fifth column liberalism by opposing factions has created a clear schism on the Council."

 IBR.5119.d:0 "A couple of years ago, it would have been unthinkable for what is currently occurring in the Council to actually transpire. For decades, the people of Iberia and their political representatives have scapegoated separatism to an nth degree. They have long called out against the fifth column element of sinful separatism, naming it as one of the biggest dangers to the nation. This paranoia has previously led to the lack of any self-determination or minority representation in the Iberian sate. This though, could be about to change.\n\nWith the usage of their cunning political skills and dextrous tactics, the regionalist faction in the Council have managed to gain sizeable momentum behind their attempts to pursue a Special Regions programme. The programme would result in a real and new change for the Iberian political system, with far greater autonomy being granted to Iberia's minority regions. The success of the regionalists can surely be attributed to their strong connection to the dreams of autonomy. While some still say they pursue a hidden agenda of fully-fledged separatism and the disintegration of Iberia; this has not been shown in the Council as the Special Regions programme looks set to be passed."

 IBR.5120.d:0 "As the Council sat down to discuss the days proceedings, the spectre of separatism came up once again and once more Iberia's most powerful shot down any hopes for any drastic change. The reasoning was the same as it had been the last hundred times. The capitulation to any form of regionalist demands would put the future of the Iberia at risk. It would be a surrender to the terrorist pest, it would see the emboldening of political violence and it would be the end of a project we worked so hard to build and make a reality.\n\nIt soon became all too clear to the majority of the Council that the regionalists had a hidden agenda of unabridged separatism and their proposals of a so called "Special Regions" programme needed to be shot down with haste. However, the regionalists and their wishes could not be just disregarded at will. This is a new Iberia after all. So, it was the Council's preference that token autonomy would be the solution to the minority question. This was of course a rather vague and unenthusiastic proposal that may well be seen through but it was decided that this was far superior to giving in to the regionalists and their alleged fifth column thought."

 IBR.5121.d:0 "Many had feared what would happen to the debates once the question of regionalism was brought up. Many in the Iberian political system have long held staunch opinions about the nature of minority representation and what the placating of such demands could mean for the future of the nation. Any previously comradely discussion in the debates would be eviscerated and forgotten about if clashes arose over allegations of separatism and tyranny. This, it appeared, was precisely what happened when the militarists gave their response to the regionalists proposals.\n\nThe militarist reply was lengthy, brutal and uncompromising. Militarist, after militarist, arose to shout down the regionalists calling them "terrorist sympathizers" and "the hideous face of separatist treachery, hidden behind a suit and tie". Man, after man, gave speeches that stated that "Iberia would never give in to terrorism" that "the nation would remain strong in the face of separatist terror" and "would smash down the terrorist instead of succumbing to it".\n\nThe regionalists were, of course, appalled by these allegations and threatened a walk out due to the tirades of the militarist faction. It seemed as though we were an inch away from the dismantling of the Council and it was only when tempers calmed that a split was avoided. Clearly it seems the Council has some work to do to make sure the question can be answered without resulting in some irreversible political damage."

Among the groups it has most raised the ire of is, unsurprisingly, the conservatives. With the discussion of the apparent regionalist proposal of a "Special Regions" programme coming to an end, the conservatives would have one last say before the end of the proceedings. These final states would, as it turns out, scupper any remaining hopes of a functional debate over the regionalist question.\n\nThe conservatives clambered up to speak their minds with little care for what the regionalists thought. In a brazen statement to the rest of the Council, the conservative faction voiced that the proposed reforms are completely unacceptable because Iberia is only the union of two countries and there cannot be any real special status for other "groups". With complete disregard for the demands of the regionalists, the conservatives stated that "Iberia is indivisible and immortal and will not play into the hands of little pests with grandeurs of nationhood."\n\nAs was expected, the statement received an immediate kickback from the regionalists who called the conservatives out over there "blatantly offensive and callous remarks". With this event, any notions about a helpful and healthy debate over regionalism can be disregarded. For it has been shown for all to see that the debate has showcased a problematic dynamic in the Council that, if not put to bed soon, could end in imminent failure."

Instead what transpired was the making of a solid reformist consensus that looks to usher in an era of newfound optimism in Iberia.\n\nThe streets, for the first time in what seemed like an entire generation, were packed out with hearty celebration of freedom and hope. The young and old had come out together, raising the flag of the Iberian Union with renewed pride. The more conservative inclined Iberians conceded a defeat here but not in a way that sort to sow division in Iberia. There was to be, for now at least, no dramatic kneejerk and instead it looked as though there had been consent given to the results of the debates.\n\nA real, great and hopefully everlasting accomplishment had transpired here.

Some incremental change has occurred, needed to save our nation for belligerence, but we have needed to be slow and steady in our reformation. One day, perhaps Iberia could go through some kind of seismic sudden change, but the time is not right. The nation must hold together as the world around us plunges into confusion and the process we have set ourselves on shall take as long as it need be. For now, we hold the line and this is precisely what the public shall know from these debates.\n\nThe achieved consensus that was broadcasted to the nation was met with a general amount of content. Sure, some naïve dreamers may have been disappointed by the results but the majority were just happy to see Iberia set on course to survive. The nation would endure, at no risk of instability causing unadulterated destruction. With the reaching of a consensus, it looks as though now the stability of our nation can be further secured and the public now have faith in us to accomplish this.

It is unfortunate that the chance for change or consensus was not truly grasped here but we must plod on, for it is the future of our nation at stake here.\n\nWe may not of got our desired outcome from the debates but Iberia and its government will need to endure.

In fact, quite the opposite has befallen upon Iberia. We have been made to look like coños in front of all our people. The constant bickering, the blatantly unhealthy clashes and the lack of anything even resembling a consensus has stifled any hopes that this process first brought about. A clear lack of any sort of resolution has been emphasised by critics of the talks, along with the constant fighting that accompanied the debate proceedings. Now, the message being passed around the public is one of failure and disdain. It seems the incompetence displayed here has made the public even question our legitimacy not only to pass change, but to even keep Iberia stable.\n\nThe lack of any clear vision for Iberia's future is deeply concerning yet we must find a way to press on.

 ##Honor The Family
 IBR.689.t:0 "The Madrid Families Festival"
 IBR.689.d:0 "An unfortunate fact of the modern world is that many, even within Iberia, have forgotten the importance of a morally righteous family. To help remedy this issue, a great festival was organized in Madrid, celebrating the Iberian family. It seems to have worked, too - crowds of thousands attended, from Madrid and areas across the country. The festival began in the early morning, with all present taking part in a great mass dedicated to the concept of the family, and of its virtues. The schedule was designed to resemble the cycle of life, and to that end the first third of the event - from morning to noon - was dedicated to the children of Iberia.\n\nChildren played games and activities designed for their amusement, all while being lectured on their importance to the country. The parents were not left out, and were able to pass the time by taking advice on the best kinds of "family equipment" to raise children with.\n\nThe midday was directed to the parents, with several hours of speeches about the importance of their role in the family. There weren't enough guest speakers to cover the entire time, so most had to draw their speeches out as long as possible.\n\nFinally, the ceremony came to an end with a celebration of the elders. After stressing the importance of respect for one's elders, the most important elders of all - the Caudillos - personally performed the closing ceremony."
 IBR.689.a:0 "It is remarkable, how such a small bond can cause such great things."
  
 ##Glorify Womens' Roles 
 IBR.691.t:0 "Iberian Woman Appreciation Day"
 IBR.691.d:0 "A woman must fulfill her roles in society, for a society to function. They were noble jobs, and to help emphasize their importance and nobility, it was decided that an entire day be dedicated to the appreciation of a woman's importance to society.\n\nThe main bulk of the event was organized through the efforts of the Sección Femenina, with Pilar Primo de Rivera leading the event in Spain and Cecilia Supico Pinto representing it in Portugal. The event was celebrated by recollection, contemplation, and faith. Speeches were delivered by the government representatives in each city in the Union, planned to give two final ones in Madrid and Lisbon respectively. Special masses were held in cities across Iberia, where the priests were able to explain the importance of the women's role in bearing and rearing children, securing the next generation of citizens.\n\nThe festivities were cut short when several self-proclaimed 'feminist organizations' started marches in cities across the union, ruining the celebrations through disruption. Even though most protests were successfully halted by police actions, the protests in Madrid and Lisbon proved volatile enough to necessitate evacuating both representatives."

 IBR.5130.d:0 "Society requires a hierarchy. Human nature dictates that there must be a pyramid at the center of every state - at the top the leaders, and below them the decreasing rank and increasing size of the lower classes. This is how any good state functions, and Iberia is no exception. In order to show our appreciation for these natural laws, we must incorporate them into many of our daily actions. The only question is how.\n\nThe degree to which we recognize the fundamental laws of hierarchy will make a great difference. If we desire to have more heavy-handed dealings, we may enforce this idea formally. If not, then we may simply encourage the populace to follow it while doing so ourselves."

Should we listen to them? They have drafted a plan to make a gradual change to their preferred economic model, but for all their posturing we still don't have to oblige them."

The minority regions of Iberia face problems and unjustified oppression, rooting from issues designed to suppress them as a people. These systems will need to go.\n\nIn order to make sure the minorities do not get preferential treatment, we will need to determine the extent to which these systems need to be revised.

The way the Caudillos speak in public appearances, the way the state press prints reports, above all else it is inflammatory. This tone inspires unrest, as it creates the perception that we are wholly uncaring of their presence.\n\nIf we were to drop this language, then governing the country will likely become easier. We will find many more agents and supporters where we would have once alienated them. Would it be better to drop this language entirely? It would be more work for a benefit that would be around the same as just cutting some of it, which would force less change onto the status quo."

We took careful polls and encouraged that opinions be submitted, and carefully compiled them into various categories of complaints or opinions. Once we had filtered out the low-quality or obviously terrorist poll responses, the results were, to put it lightly, less-than-ideal.\n\nWith their wants and desires firmly on record, we can start to take actions to resolve them. However, the question still stands about how much we should hold ourselves to these resolutions. If we are totally set on fixing the issues, publishing the findings publicly would serve as a motivator, as they would expect us to fix them all.

We have been named the presidents of the Iberian Council, a position which we additionally will hold until further notice."\n\nThe Presidents spoke some more, sometimes swapping the speaking position, of topics that were far less related.

 IBR.5136.d:0 "At the time, it seemed like centralizing the bureaucracy in the two capitals of Iberia - Madrid and Lisbon - was an excellent idea. There was a Union to be kept together, after all, so why wouldn't the heads need to know what the arms were doing? As it turns out, trying to figure out what all the arms were doing, our many flailing arms, has caused Iberia no small amount of grief. The bureaucracy is frequently swamped, and trying to keep up with the many requests piled on it has caused it to fail to actually accomplish anything in a reasonable time.\n\nBecause of this, decentralization is our best option. If we were to hand more powers to the provinces, they could handle their day-to-day affairs on their own, as well as easing the present social tensions. While they will not be federalized - we are not liberals, after all - giving them a bit extra power will ease the central administration's workload. How much would be best to give them?"

If we were to give them the option, then, they would nearly certainly split away from our state. Are we really sure people like this should have more power? The threats to our national security could be intense.\n\nOf course, if we give them some limited power, then the minorities could be sated a small amount. Giving them too much would kill the Union, but a token level of power would serve to stop any complaints that we are oppressive. Still, there is always the option to disregard what they think..."

Through well intentioned but misplaced policies, decisions made more to sate egos than to help the country, and corruption so thorough it would make president Nixon blush, a country has built its foundations on sand. Some of the decisions the Caudillos made, though sensible at the time, are better off reversed. It seems like the only way to save the Union, is to open up some more politically.\n\nWe need to do something politically. We have our best chance at saving the country by increasing its representation and making those present eager to participate. There are a number of tabled reforms we could pass, though thoroughly overhauling the system could work even better for our ends."

This is the nature of the Union - it is never perfect at first, but can improve to be near it given the right attention. Some do not get this, and these people, often minorities, will agitate for our destruction. We need them to be silent.\n\nThe best way to silence these pests is not the stick, but rather the carrot. By passing some limited political reforms, we could go a long way to bringing dissent down to acceptable levels. How much would be best? We could work through a backlog of tabled reforms, or simply target the most critical policies."

 IBR.5140.d:0 "Democracy is all well and good as a system, but sometimes it can produce unfavorable results. Above anything else, an election's primary purpose is to legitimize the regime in the eyes of the people, and if we allow ourselves to be voted out then it fails to accomplish that. We need to ensure that the people - or enough of them - vote for the right choice.\n\nWe will be deploying agents to most major polling stations, and there they will establish themselves and keep a very close eye on the voters. In addition, wire-tapping of election workers is to be conducted with state of the art technology purchased from the United States. Our electoral plans depend on enough information being revealed through constant surveillance. Hopefully, the systems already in place will not obstruct us."

 IBR.5141.d:0 "Of course, what we wanted done to polling stations was not necessarily legal. If we were to blatantly compromise a perceived anonymity, and even more through breaching legal protocols and precedents, it would create an impressive stir among the public. The matter required sensitive handling, and no small amount of work from our bureaucrats to ensure that our aims were implemented correctly and the laws budged to make them legally bulletproof.\n\nWe should have never even thought of doubting our bureaucratic strength.

This hierarchy is known by all from the lowliest janitor to the Presidents themselves, and the average people accept the guidance of their betters. It is not only accepted, but even desired that the state provide a basic framework for people to do their civic duty within.\n\nThrough this unspoken consent to provide direct help, many facets of the polling stations - including the voting itself - are under our influence. We have the ability to control the ballots themselves, and by combining this assistance with our previous surveillance, very little will happen during an election that we do not know about. The public supports this move, and thanks to that it will be able to last for a long time to come."

 IBR.5143.d:0 "It would be a bad idea to simply declare our elections monitored. By taking such a decisive course of action, and in the process break many established norms, we would set ourselves up to alienate many who would otherwise support us. Setting up surveillance on most polling stations around the country would be a delicate affair, leaning mostly on the competence of our bureaucratic services to ensure that things are as they should be. If they are not swayed, then we cannot do anything.\n\nGiven the current results, the bureaucrats do not act with Iberia in mind. Unable to actually deny our requests, we have fallen victim to the timeless political maneuver that is not actually doing what we desire. They claim that they cannot make progress in surveillance due to complications in protocol and paperwork - conveniently leaving out how they are responsible for most of it - and even create more when they can excuse it. Political surveillance, it seems, is further from our reach than anticipated."

This can be very good for us - the majority wants us, after all - but that same system is a double edged sword. If we were to be voted out, unlikely as it is, then we would be in the uncomfortable position where giving up power would be expected. It would be a nightmare, so we will need to make sure the sleep is sound.\n\nMost of the troublesome parts of democracy can be avoided if we place the people in an advisory role, allowing their decisions to guide us but not order us. Then, we can claim all the benefits of public support and none of the drawbacks of losing it. If we are confident in our support, then we could just allow elections to proceed unimpeded."

The reformism has brought an entirely new dimension to the business of policy, as anyone with a lick of political sense can see that the environment is definitely changing. One of the new issues buzzing around is that of political parties.\n\nDo we really want more political parties? Iberia has been run by a single party - the National Union - ever since its inception. The argument has been made that allowing the creation of new political parties may be just what the country needs, as their limited dissidence will do wonders towards discharging much pent-up tension.

The Caudillos, of all people, supporting a multi-party system? It was ridiculous. As it later happened, this event proved the fertilizer for the Iberian political scene to blossom, as the endorsement from the very Caudillos themselves led many to flock to political parties.

The subject of democracy did not come up just once, but several times - and frequently in the same fashion. One would bring it up, and then another would deride the very concept. It would be quite damning, were it not a private meeting.\n\nLike all things best kept private, it didn't stay that way. Our bureaucrats, whether by incompetence or malice, have managed to have our internal transcripts leaked to the public.

In smaller numbers, these same protestors also march through the countryside - presumably to join their urban brethren. It is everything the Guardia Civil can do just to keep these protests from exploding into riots.\n\nThese protests are in response to our recent meetings, nicknamed the "autocracy admissions" by the media. They are protesting for legally binding elections. We cannot disperse crowds of this magnitude, there are simply too many to try it without starting a true revolution; our only hope to keep the status quo is to ignore these protests for long enough that they fizzle out.

So when the Presidents decided that Iberia needed a multi-party system - a real one, not a sham democracy with a controlled opposition - then it was decided then and there that Iberia would have itself a democracy. No matter the surprise, or the confusion, orders were orders.\n\nDrastic reforms are being written up, and are only a rubber stamp away from approval. The old laws, limiting Iberia to only one effective political party, will be repealed as soon as possible. With the new political diversity, Iberia is well on its way to becoming a democracy.

With the new reforms, other parties are finally beginning to form, diversifying our political scene. They are young, embryonic, and inexperienced. This could be an opportunity like little else.\n\nAgainst our apparatus, which is finely tempered by the rigors of political life, these new parties would have little resistance. If we were to actively campaign about them, then we could keep them weak and marginalized. However, we would be seen as more legitimate if we allow them to grow and become relevant entities."

The only question was where - would they be irrelevant, would they be present, or would their combined strength be enough to challenge, or even topple, the regime? Few could provide a definitive date, though it seems like they won't need to.\n\nThe new political parties have started to grow at a slower pace, and with the rate steadily declining they are set to likely plateau in a short period of time.

This blind, heedless political opportunism will prove to be their downfall.\n\nThis time, there is no openness and tolerance. In our most genius move yet, the new openness is a trick. We will use it to lure the vultures out, promising a wonderful political carcass, and now that they have taken the bait, sweeping in for their opportunity, we will destroy them.

This is not due to any particular resilience on their part - they were still taken by total surprise - but due to our own poor planning. Due to several regulations, technicalities, and plain legal obstruction, we could not entirely remove the opposition's political influence.\n\nIn any case, it is certainly not a defeat for us.

The military officers followed suit.

 IBR.5416.d:0 "Caudillo of Iberia, President of the Government, Champion of the Last Crusade and Hispanic Heritage. Francisco Franco had many titles, styles, and accolades. "Lord of Meirás'' was the least well known of these, and for good reason. Franco liked to keep his summer manor in Galicia out of the way, far from the prying eyes and endless churning politics of El Pardo, the Madrid palace where he usually held court. Here he could rest, and conduct his business in peace.\n\nThat is why when reaching out to Opus Dei, he invited them to Meirás, where the hardliners in the Falange could not be a nuisance. The regime and Opus Dei had a complicated relationship. They were loyal Catholics, but their internal secrecy had always spurned on claims from the more inquisitorial members of the Falange that they were a front for Freemasonry. In a country where membership to the Freemasons was illegal, the mere suspicion was reason enough to keep Opus Dei at an arm's length.\n\nBut times were changing. The Oil Crisis had sent the Iberian economy into a deep recession, with nobody in the government quite knowing what to do about it. Franco was in need of new blood, advisors up to date with the latest economic theories. Opus Dei had amongst its membership many fine economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. Technocrats, disinterested in the petty politics of El Prado who could deliver results and reform the economy on a new, sound basis.\n\nWorking with Opus Dei and its members would have its consequences. The Caudillo knew he would have to put his foot down, stamping out complaints and protestations from Falange ideologues before they could even be voiced. Either that, or the three economists would have to carry out their work in secret, presenting their plans to him at his frequent visits to Meirás. Either way, he was a Caudillo of Iberia, and where he chose to go, Opus Dei, and the Falange, would follow."

 IBR.5417.d:0 "Caudillo Franscisco Franco watched as his bodyguard reached into his holster, drew his pistol, and fired a single shot into the head of the horse. The beast fell to the ground unceremoniously and died. Out on his customary morning carriage trip around the grounds of the Pazo de Meirás, his summer palace, one of the carriage horses had slipped and broken its leg. Pitying its pained cries, the Caudillo had ordered it shot. When he was younger he had rode about the grounds himself on the very same horse, yet even that small pleasure had been stolen from him by age.\n\nDuring the carriage ride back to the Pazo de Meirás, the Caudillo once again thought over the National Economic Stabilization Plan presented to him by his new team of economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. The technocrats' plan was ambitious, proposing a fixed exchange rate, raised interest rates, increased foreign investment, significant cuts to public expenditure, and privatization of key industries. It was exactly the kind of new, pioneering reform that Franco believed the struggling Spanish economy desperately needed.\n\nYet it would also be controversial. The plan went back on decades of economic orthodoxy, doing away with the official policy of National-Syndicalism under which Iberia was neither capitalist or communist, with class struggle abolished and the worker and the capitalist both serving the interests of the Iberian nation. State ownership of industry, national economic independence, protection of the worker: the policies of National-Syndicalism were one of the great legacies of the War of Liberation against the communists, or so said the ideologues of the Falange. To give it up would be to relinquish the power of the state over economic policy and invite pernicious foreign influence into Iberia.\n\nFranco himself was loath to undermine it, at least publicly. Perhaps some compromise would have to be found, in which the National Stabilization Plan was only partly implemented, leaving National-Syndicalism largely intact. But perhaps, like a horse with a broken leg, it simply had to be put down."

He already knew that it would tell him the same thing that their reports had been telling him for weeks: Extend the timelines.\n\nWhen the oil crisis had begun and the government implemented its new economic policy, many promises had been made. Promises that the austerity would only be temporary. Promises that ordinary Iberians would not bear the brunt of the cost for the crisis. Promises that the Caudillo and the Iberian state was there to take care of them. Promises that they seemed more and more unable to keep as the days went by.\n\nThe whole program had been framed in a series of timelines, with several major austerity measures to be lifted when the allotted time was reached. Yet after months and months, the Iberian economy had only marginally improved, with Unemployment was still high and investor confidence stagnant. And all the while, the deadline for the end of the austerity measures was approaching.\n\nThe technocrats had been telling the Caudillo for some time now that their liberalization program needed more time for its effects to be felt, for the economy to start turning around. They had begged for the timelines to be extended, but up till now Franco had refused them. How would he look if he went back on his sacred word to the Iberian people. But now things were coming to a head. He would have to make a choice: betray his word, or risk economic catastrophe."

 IBR.5180.t:0 "A Worthy Successor"
 IBR.5180.d:0 "To be torn on such a decision would have suited the aging Spanish Caudillo perfectly before his rival for Iberian dominance had died. Now, standing uncertainly alone atop a house of crumbling cards, he wished the former technocrat was beside him. He had always had a clever comment ready for a situation like this. Franco could almost hear the faint whisper of his voice.\n\nYet he was alone, sitting in a large conference room surrounded by empty faced bureaucrats and lackeys who he could not rely on for critique or sound advice. What did they know of the severe strain put upon the union by this precarious situation? What did they know of the Portuguese people's mournful cries and the significance these held for the future of this nation? It was on him to now hold Iberia together in the face of an ugly and unrelenting world. Hopefully alongside him someone to bring the joys and rigor of ruling back to the old man's heart.\n\n"Brief me again on the two candidates." The almost hushed murmur made many, even those sat close to the usually imposing military man, lean in to listen intently. A short pause followed, as the room was unsure of who should speak first. Seeing the dejection and quiet withdrawal of the man at the head of the table the discussion was promptly started nonetheless."

 IBR.5181.d:0 "A quiet day marked a welcome change to the feverish events that had plagued the last few days since Salazar's death. Sat alone in his spacious office Caudillo Franco silently contemplated his choice for the successor to Salazar. It had not been easy, the pragmatic Portuguese had always been a hushed voice of reason that he could rely on even if he despised it. He would miss it. His senior staff had been excited at the opportunity to now further centralize the regime, ensuring maximum control of a population he might need ready for war. Or worse.\n\nYet Franco knew he needed more than a figurehead to keep Portugal loyal within the union. His final choice had been the scholarly Marcelo Caetano, a protegee of Salazar who had already lived a long life inside the world of politics. His moderate reformer stance may be an issue that could offset the stability brought from securing Portugal, as hardliners may see him as a step too far in the wrong direction. It would be a difficult matter even for his eventual successor to contend with. He sighed. This was not a world that readily embraced the language of hope anymore."

His senior staff had been excited at the opportunity to now further centralize the regime, ensuring maximum control of a population he might need ready for war. Or worse.\n\nHe had considered the possibility of becoming the lone Caudillo of a Union badly in need of a more martial spirit. Yet with his age he may soon follow his former political rival into the grave. To leave the task of maintaining a stable Iberia, following Spanish centralization, to someone not of his own caliber was dangerous. Hence someone of similar leaning was needed, someone who would be easier to work with and who could be trusted with upholding Portugal's half of the union once he himself would be dead. By suggestion of his advisors António da Mota Veiga had been chosen for this role. A capable and ruthless politician who had enough experience in Portuguese politics to be an essential asset. The concerns of his possible ambitions were sidelined. Stability was now needed and hard choices will have to be made to ensure it. For this there could be no better man."

His senior staff had been excited at the opportunity to now further centralize the regime, ensuring maximum control of a population he might need ready for war. Or worse.\n\nWith age his swagger had begun to leave him, but not his bite. Sunken, aging eyes glared intently around the room of gathered senior officials. The silence ate deeply into the confidence of all those who faced the Caudillo. Then he spoke, outlining a plan both rational and extremely dangerous. He would assume sole leadership of Iberia and prepare in grooming a successor who would lead a unified state against the dark forces on their doorstep. None of the bureaucrats could see the slight nervous twitch in the left hand of the Spanish dictator, and even if they had done it likely would have only been pushed onto his age."

 IBR.5184.d:0 "An event so momentous and grandiose it can only be compared to the pompous crowning of past absolute autocrats. Yet this was not some medieval ceremony of authority but a modern legitimation of a regime so wet behind the ears it has not even raised a single generation successfully. Noone knew the importance of the appearance of longevity and peace as much as the Spanish Caudillo, who had taken the surprising liberty of inspecting the construction in Lisbon himself.\n\nHe counted the diverse forms symbolism he had ordered to be quietly included on the various stages and locations where the rule of the regime he had helped build could finally be stabilized. Pillars of society like the church could not be forgotten in a historic event such as this. Observing the hurried tussle of the many workers conscripted from all over the union he allowed himself a small smile of relief. Soon would be the end of his road, he now just wished that his rival could have stood beside him in this glorious moment."

 IBR.5185.t:0 "The Chosen Successor"
 IBR.5185.d:0 "The reformer approached the lavish podium flanked by a seething mass of cheers and jubilation. His eyes however remained steady and pointed forwards, examining the deceptive serenity on the face of the man he would soon run a union of nations with. Hands reached out to grasp hold of him as others were swatted away by the countless security personnel which guarded the extended walkway. Admiring the effort of the Spanish Caudillo in quickly preparing such sumptuous courtiership of the Portuguese capital, he climbed the hastily erected marble stairs to stand beside the aging former general. Not exchanging a single word with Caetano, Franco stepped forward to the microphone.\n\nHis speech, a strange mix of honorable remembrance for Salazar and a desperate call for unity managed to arouse some excitement amongst the masses of Lisbon's gathered. Caetano noted the slightest hint of a satisfied smile on the old man's face upon his retreat to the back of the stage. Now it was his own turn to step forward. He braced physically against the intense din as he quickly shuffled the notes for his speech. Words of reform, moderation and an ease of tensions on the half peninsula were almost lost in the raucous applause that followed. Did he detect a hint of jealousy in Franco's eyes when they left the stage together? No matter, he had done his part and he had done it well."
 IBR.5185.a:0 "Forwards, into a new era for Iberia!"
 
 IBR.5186.t:0 "Disturbing Allegations Arise"
 IBR.5186.d:0 "Franco violently threw the crumpled newspaper on the floor with disgust. He surprised his personal aide when he jumped out of his seat with an energy powered solely by fury. 'Is this true,' he bellowed at the nervous man who had stepped back in fear of being in the way of the Spanish Caudillo's ravings and flying spittle. Hesitantly pointing at the briefing he had just brought prior to Franco's explosion the aide excused himself and quietly left the room.\n\nWith both his hands holding his head steady, Franco began to quickly read the report that the National Institute of Statistics was about to publish publicly. His choice as successor to the role of Portuguese Caudillo, da Mota Veiga, was being accused of possibly being involved in a corruption scandal. Further details could not be given yet as the investigation was just about to get under way. The accusation however stood there on the paper, bold and strong. The aging Caudillo groaned; it was not as if Iberia had not been facing enough problems as it is. Now what had been considered as the safe choice for the replacement of Salazar was in the process of letting him down more than his old rival ever had."
 IBR.5186.a:0 "Get to the bottom of this, quickly!"

 IBR.5187.t:0 "Evidence Surfaces"
 IBR.5187.d:0 "Despite Franco's quick handling of the press it seems the corruption crisis surrounding his choice for the position of Portuguese Caudillo has its own ways of expanding in magnitude. A regional paper from the north of Portugal has published a document from the National Institute of Statistics detailing how da Mota Veiga had seemingly purposefully adjusted some numbers to increase the level of funding received from the central government for a town he had property in. Despite the newspaper's relatively neutral coverage the significance was still damning.\n\nReports of da Mota Veiga arriving at Franco's residence following the publication's release were circulated in national papers. The reasons were however censored well this time, with reporters praising the level of cooperation and unity between the new leaders of the Union. With the issues facing effective censorship in Iberia it is not known how aware the public is of the still unfolding scandal. One thing is for certain, the new administration has a long road ahead before it can begin to govern successfully."
 IBR.5187.a:0 "Not good, but not terrible either..."

 IBR.5188.t:0 "Portuguese Statistics Completely Fabricated"
 IBR.5188.d:0 "Da Mota Veiga has been returning daily to Franco's residence. The Iberian national papers are still toeing the line, proclaiming that a great deal of work to resolve issues that the Union was facing were being done in these private meetings. The reality was looking starkly different.\n\nDocuments had been flooding, not just from the Institute investigating Salazar's successor, but other government branches and institutions. Under da Mota Veiga's watch an astounding number of statistics regarding Portuguese fiscal policy had been entirely fabricated. Now Franco's choice had been forced to explain himself on a daily basis as more and more information kept reaching the Spanish Caudillo's desk. Serious doubts were beginning to be raised within the upper echelons of Iberian politics as to whether da Mota Veiga could even be suitable now considering the vast amount of money he had lost the Union. Some analysts have gone so far as to claim that the losses have hit Spain in particular, further deteriorating the situation behind closed doors.\n\nFollowing a week of discussions with Franco, eventually da Mota Veiga was forced to stand in front of the national press and proclaim that his inauguration would have to be delayed due to personal reasons. Ignoring the rushing torrent of questions washing over him, the now disgraced politician stepped back from the podium to be assisted away by Spanish security guards."

 IBR.5189.t:0 "An Unlikely Outcome"
 IBR.5189.d:0 "Caetano's gaze was captivated by a lonesome workman who was chipping away steadily at the name of the disgraced man he would now replace. It looked to be a tough job; the marble inscription had the tell-tale signs of experienced artisan work. What would he replace the empty space with? There was only another day until the plaza which had been prepared so carefully for the inauguration of da Motta Veiga as Portuguese Caudillo would be filled with to commemorate his own appointment. Something which weeks earlier had been decided against by the Spanish Caudillo. He continued to watch him, now wondering whether many would come to watch at all. The local police could surely procure some 'willing' spectators but what did it matter. The damage had been done.\n\nFranco had put his name behind a man destroyed by the most astounding corruption scandal Iberia had faced in its miniscule history. The public, despite being force-fed lies and half truths about the situation, had been able to receive enough real information from local papers and intuition to recognize the significance of the horrible blunder which had occurred at the locus of power in Iberian politics.\n\nFinally turning away from the worker who had by now cleanly removed da Motta Veiga's name, Caetano wondered how long and how much work it would take to scrub away a misdeed from a nation's consciousness."

 #Franco's Speech Chain
 
 IBR.5190.t:0 "A Message to Iberia"
 IBR.5190.d:0 ""My fellow countrymen, we stand united in our deep sorrow at the loss of the great Caudillo Salazar. His friendship and wisdom were great assets in our ruling of this eternal Union of nations. The memory of the work he has done to promote the ideals of Iberia shall live on forever. Now however I stand alone, having to face the gargantuan task of managing without him. I ask you, my brothers and sisters, to assist me, to support me now that I and this Union are in the greatest hour of need."\n\nFranco sat in front of the cameras and microphones rigidly. One could sense the excited energy in the air, almost as if a single spark could set it all off. The crew assembled and working to broadcast the now sole Caudillo's message to his people around Iberia often throughout his speech looked at each other tellingly. Hidden smirks and grins were exchanged.The Spanish dictator almost couldn't contain his immense glee; he was abuzz, with every sentence of his long speech reminding of the bombastic public speaking his hated enemies in the Reich used to practice. Despite the message proclaiming extraordinary measures in uncertain times in a similar vein in which the Union had first been announced, the significance of the political reality that was hidden behind Franco's words were not lost on those watching and listening. The Union was now solely governed by a Spaniard from Madrid. The consequences of this are still uncertain."
 IBR.5190.a:0 "He stands alone at the precipice."

 IBR.5191.t:0 "Protests Across Portugal"
 IBR.5191.d:0 "Following Franco's address to the nation there was first an unnerving quiet. Reactions were muted to the extent that public officials deemed that Salazar's death had created a temporary culture of mourning across the Union. The more capable ones however recognized the phenomenon for what it was. The calm before the storm.\n\nFirst signs of protest in Portugal were quickly squashed by authorities. Initially it was solemn and quiet marches in the larger cities that could be dispersed at the first sign of police presence. However, as the days wore on the marches did not stop organising and in fact began to grow considerably in size. Soon they also began to take on a much more radical tone as people began to bring along signs and sang traditional Portuguese songs. Again, authorities were called in to deal with what senior Spanish officials started to call an official show of defiance against the Iberian state. This did not the stop marchers either as their numbers continued to swell and their actions began to negatively affect the economy. Arrests and show trials were not putting off those who were now calling for the formation of an independent Portugal, free from Spanish oppression. Local officials and newspapers began to stop toeing the line officially mandated by an increasingly nervous Madrid. State oppression began to become visible as sweeping arrests were made and curfews began to be set in place."
 IBR.5191.a:0 "The situation is spiralling out of control."
 
 IBR.5192.t:0 "Portuguese Bureaucrats Resign"
 IBR.5192.d:0 "Portugal was in uproar. Not only was the public rejecting the imposition of Spanish rule, but now even Portuguese officials of the Union government were beginning to boycott the decision. An unofficial strike has been called with many government workers simply staying at home or joining the continuous marches through the towns and cities. On top of this ministers and high-level officials were handing in their letters of resignation, citing an inability to work for an administration they did not believe in.\n\nThe newspaper censors were working restlessly as most major and minor publications within Portugal were reporting on this mass desertion from the Iberian project. They could not however censor the foreign observers effectively who had begun to spread seditious rumours that army units were amassing at the former border.\n\nAll the while Franco watched his empire burn and crumble around him. His hard work uniting two peoples, his grovelling to Portuguese officials, his compromises while Salazar was still around. All for nothing now that he had made one bad decision. He would be damned though if these traitors would crush his ambitions without a fight. So, he stood over his desk like Nero, singing maniacally in his head as more news of sedition reached his office, waiting for the rot to burn and the just to take their righteous place afterwards."

 IBR.5193.d:0 "The room was half filled with the Spanish representatives of the legislative council already in their seats, anxiously awaiting both the arrival of the Caudillo and the Portuguese representatives. 20 minutes after the allotted starting time of their session the other half of the council filed in, deadly silent and not event offering a glance at the already assembled men. Yet surprise filled their faces as it was noticed that they had not been the only ones to show disrespect to the council.\n\nAs the Portuguese began to whisper amongst themselves the door opened again and the aging Caudillo marched in, taking his seat at the head of the table. Looking around the room shortly he coughed and began to speak, only to be interrupted by a Portuguese member of the council. The Spaniard's eyes virtually bulged out of their sockets in rage as he waved for the man to continue. Denouncing the inability of the council to restrain the Caudillo in acting against the virtues of unity and shared responsibility upon which the Union had been established, the Portuguese rattled down a list of condemnations to which all his fellow countrymen of the council had put their names to. Even if the council had no real power in stopping the power-hungry Caudillo, they could at least show their discontent. If looks could kill, then the speaker would have turned to ash. The Spanish dictator was not pleased. He however motioned for the remaining topics of discussion to now be addressed, an irony not lost on the poor man who would soon never be able to see his beloved homeland again."

Some of the more friendly Spanish members had attempted to make conversation with their Portuguese peers only to be rudely ignored. The air was heavy with tension as everyone waited for the final participant to arrive. Strutting into the quiet conference room Franco immediately observed the small pin badges on each of the Portuguese members' suits. He laughed inwardly at the ineffectual sign of protest. Wearing pins of the Portuguese national flag would not change their situation in the slightest. The Spanish Caudillo now held total control after all.\n\nSitting down he observed that his bones creaked slightly; hoping that no one heard he quickly went on to highlight the sessions agenda of topics that needed to be addressed, putting a high stress on foreign policy issues. In the middle of his monologue however, all the Portuguese members of the council stood one by one. As Franco and the Spaniards looked on aghast, they began to slowly filter out of the room without making a single noise. Finally, Franco stood, his face ablaze in fury as he ordered them to immediately return to their seats or have their privilege of advising the Caudillo forever forfeited. A few grimaced as he went on to claim that Salazar would have been ashamed at the childish foolery they were now acting out. Yet none of them even turned to acknowledge the Spanish dictator. Sitting back down and grumbling to himself, Franco made a mental note to pass on all of the traitor's names to the police."

 IBR.5195.t:0 "Caetano's First Day"
 IBR.5195.d:0 "Following the grand inauguration Caetano quickly delved into administrative work, attempting to gain an even clearer picture of the situation Iberia was finding itself in. Knowing the problems facing regional representations he recognized his own important role, not just as a competent replacement for Salazar but also in being a figurehead of Portuguese interests in the Union. He was able to ingratiate himself effectively with the members of both the legislative and advisory council. Caetano figured that despite their seeming lack of power in opposing Caudillo decision making that they were still extremely important in the process of smooth governance. If an issue were to divide the two dictators it may also help to gain their support to overwhelm Franco's arguments.\n\nThe first day was over, a flurry of meetings and paperwork to establish his authority behind the closed doors of government in the same way his inauguration had cemented his standing on the international stage through foreign press coverage. A small rest in his new office finally allowed him to clear his mind slightly. He looked out of the grand windows on a bustling Madrid, still heaving with activity despite the late hour. Pleased that he could now begin to shape the direction that Union would take in the future he smiled happily. Important work had to be done and he was prepared for it."
 IBR.5195.a:0 "A bright future ahead?"

 IBR.5196.t:0 "Caetano's First Day"
 IBR.5196.d:0 "The inauguration ceremony had not been an easy affair. Franco's introductory speech had drawn hefty criticism from both the crowd and papers afterwards as being disingenuous and displaying an inability to face the mistakes of the regime. It set the tone for Caetano's speech after, as many had already left and those who remained only seemed to be half listening. Dejected the new replacement for Salazar had left early, only quietly answering a few questions from the press before slipping off.\n\nHis first day in office was no better as there were still arrangements underway to change the administrative structure in order to erase the last remnants of da Motta Veiga's preparations. Assembling his staff from a pool of trusted and effective civil servants he knew, Caetano could at least start working on healing the ills of the Union. Not surprisingly the scandal had exacerbated many of the issues he would have needed to deal with anyway. Separatists took Franco's first appointment as another sign of Spanish oppression and incompetence, blaming the federal government for not being a truly representative body. Many Spanish, both in government and in the public sphere, however painted da Motta Veiga as a rogue Portuguese agent, a symbol of Portugal leeching off and abusing its position within the Union. Then there were the financial issues which had been incurred by the scandal; the sheer amount of administrative work to first establish the losses and their consequences and then to begin to remedy them was a mountain which seemingly grew exponentially. Yet the reformer had not entirely lost his spirit. No matter how dire the situation may seem with an effective work ethic and constructive solutions anything was possible. And so, he ended the terrible day with the hint of a smile, he was now part of the solution that would transform the Union into a better place."
 IBR.5196.a:0 "A step in the right direction?"

 IBR.5197.t:0 "Touring Iberia"
 IBR.5197.d:0 "Population centres all over the half peninsula were surprised by the unannounced visits of the new Portuguese Caudillo Caetano as he was making his way around his realm. Only briefly notifying his Spanish counterpart Caetano shortly after establishing the bureaucratic framework for his administration, he set out to tour Iberia. It was necessary to gain a more complete picture of average life and to assess the extent of the divisions were politically unstable for the nation.\n\nOne of the stops he made was in the border city of Badajoz, situated on the left bank of Guadiana river and extremely close to the unofficial Portuguese border. Caetano's motorcade drove through the city making a stop at the bullring, a site where according to regime dissidents the Spanish Nationalists had murdered 100s of Republicans. Choosing to only take a small security detail Caetona then made his way around the streets on foot. He was recognized very quickly, and crowds began to form, following his walk and cheering him. Once he was at the town hall, he requested for a desk to brought out which he sat behind. Motioning for the onlookers to come forward he instructed his security detail to pick out a number of individuals to line up in front of his new desk. He then began to question them in a friendly manner, taking the time to get to know each of the ones picked. Listening to their concerns he made a few notes and asked for their personal opinions on the regime. As none would answer openly he again wrote down a few notes and then made his way back to the bullring.\n\nNewspapers around the country began to follow his journey, documenting each visit and guessing where he would turn up next. Dubbing the event 'Caetano's grand tour' it quickly went down into Iberian conscience."                                                   
 IBR.5197.a:0 "A commendable effort."
 
 
 IBR.5198.t:0 "For the Good of The Union"
 IBR.5198.d:0 "It almost felt like continuity. That was the beauty of effective reform. In the critical eye of the public Caudillo Caetano had already taken great efforts to ease his transition into power without hitches. His numerous visits and attempts to understand the mood and problems of localities around the Union had given him impetus to carry forth his ideas and display them proudly to the various councils and to his Spanish counterpart. It was not his will he was representing but that of the Iberian people. Not only had he effectively positioned himself in his new role, so the general populace supported him, but he also had managed his staff and administration well. This had given him the support of many in the civil service.\n\nHe now stood at the pinnacle, admired by many and without the ruinous taint of scandal. Caetano was positioned to be a unifying, stabilising figure in Iberian politics. His reluctance to immerse himself in the cheap power politicking that Salazar and Franco had been engaged in was refreshing to those in higher office. Seeing a change from trying to gain relative gains over one another to working for the absolute gain of the Union made Caetano one of the first true Iberians. Not a Portuguese nationalist but a product of the ongoing integration between two historic nations. Under his rule the future began to look a little brighter."

 IBR.5199.t:0 "A Report From Lisbon"
 IBR.5199.d:0 "The report in front of him was brutal, its official emotionless tone managed to cut as deeply as the most realistic prose. The dictators blood began to boil with anger as each word further compounded the disgusting treason the report was spelling out. It painted a stark image of a vengeful chaos that had engulfed a city. A small glimpse at what the union could soon look like if the crisis was not handled effectively.\n\nFranco's message to the nation had been received by many in Portugal as an address to the Spanish people, not to the united Iberia. In protest they had held civil rallies which had just invited the Caudillo's harbingers of order. Retaliation was the only order they managed to establish. Lisbon rose in a violent uproar. The previously civil marches now turned violent as police and security forces began to be driven from key parts of the city. Like other revolts it even inspired many of those who were ordered to quell it to join it. Public services and other semblances of normal life had been abandoned in favor of opposing Madrid.\n\nThis delicate political climate required conformity, it was not simple to craft a state out of the fresh corpse of another. Of course, the sheep would not understand. In situations such as these a strong guiding hand was required to guide them back to their pens, to bliss and safety. The Caudillo was the right man for the job. In his eyes at least."

Discussions in the advisory council were bleak as two camps had clearly formed.\n\nThe moderates, arguing to be more in touch with the plight of the Portuguese people, recognized the need to restore order and set an example for the rest of Portugal but also not inciting more revolts by establishing martial law and sending in more men. The hardliners on the other side set forth a clear plan of action, almost like a military campaign, in order to not let the revolt turn into revolution. Both sides debated heavily while Franco listened, every now and again shushing one speaker to hear an argument particularly in line with this own thinking. His considerations lasted long, not even being revealed in the space of the meeting. He initially had the plan to converge on Lisbon with the full might of the state behind him, but deeper thinking was required to not be too rash in the decision making. Finally, he had come to a conclusion."

His eyes widened as he saw a menacing column of armoured cars and crowd control vehicles rushing towards the main road, not slowing until people began to scream and back away. As the cars began to disperse the equally armoured Guardia Civil troopers the long line of protestors halted and moved further away. Orders were being barked as the soldiers began to surge forward. Again, people began to scream, this time the whole march was affected. The crowds began to disperse quickly in all directions as the troopers hunted down those defiantly staying or unfortunate enough to be stuck in the middle of the tumult. Within a few hours the guards had established a semblance of control over the city, quickly taking control of vital buildings such as local administration buildings and communication centres. The revolt had effectively been squashed, this time without the iron hand of violence being necessary."

Yet, despite the initial surprise caused as the soldiers swept into the crowd in full riot gear, they would not disperse. Rather than making room for the Guardia Civil troopers protestors began to throw rocks and bottles, hurling abuse and slogans all the while. As the soldiers barked orders the crowd even surged forward, closing the distance and attempting to disarm them. The situation continued to deteriorate as shots rang out. No one had been harmed yet it had the same effect as if the protestors had lost a number of their own. The shouting and violence worsened, forcing the now embattled soldiers to retreat back to their armored vehicles. Cheering the retreat of their oppressors the protestors began to continue their march only to soon be assaulted by even more riot police, this time far greater in number and with crowd dispersal tools. Again, the marchers were unwilling to back down. Yet this time neither did the soldiers retreat."

Yet that order was hated, now no longer associated with true representation but oppression. As the riot police arrived onto a square which the march was passing through, events quickly began to take a bloody turn. Protestors surged forward with makeshift weapons, trying to mob the surprised security forces and seal off their route of escape. They had however not expected the guards to have real weapons with live ammunitions. The first few shots rang out managing somehow to even surpass the din created by the discord. Dazed for a few seconds the protestors stopped in their bloodthirsty vigour, standing almost entirely still until the first screams rang out. Then the next shots plastered the human mass forcing a frenzied stampede in all directions. The riot police switching back to non-lethal weaponry drove the last few demonstrators out of the square only to find that a good number of them had been killed in the commotion. With grim expressions they still recognized their victory. Now order could slowly begin to be restored."

His training had been brutal and fear inducing but to now be in the position to translate that into a real-life experience terrified him far more. Finally, his armoured car stopped, and the sergeant barked the order for all to rally out. After a long, silent ride with tinted glass windows the sun blinded the young recruit for a short while while the incredible noise of the demonstrators halted him in his tracks. Then, however the adrenaline pushed him forward to stand alongside his comrades, facing off against a wall of seething flesh. He could see the anger visible in their wide-eyed glares and was glad that his face was hidden behind a mask. Suddenly the mass rushed forward. In a panicked flurry he drew his gun. Time froze. The mass abruptly became irrelevant as his entire focus was now on the young woman before him who he was aiming at. No older than he was himself she however stood defiant, inching forwards until her forehead rested against the cold steel. With a start she threw her hands up in an attempt to grab the gun, yet the recruit was quicker. The shot was startlingly loud and the young security man drew in a sharp breath. Time began to move again but now too quickly. All around him his fellow Guardia Civil companions began to shoot too, peppering the now utterly frenzied demonstrators. Yet the recruit could not fire again. His gaze never left the lifeless form before him. Taking no notice of the carnage around him he knelt down and took of his helmet. Putting his gun to the side of his head he whispered a silent apology.\n\nThe massacre in Lisbon was legendary. Once the crowds had broken out into savage rioting, orders to fire at will had been given. This bloody day for Portugal is likely to hold deep political charge for a long time to come."

The previous vigour with which the demonstrators engaged in civil disobedience has been lost through the careful use of attrition and intimidation by the security forces. Redirecting the marches, not allowing them beyond a certain point, cutting them in half with armoured vehicles. All added to the fatigue felt by the residents of Lisbon. The conviction with which they had started their demonstrations against Spanish centralization within the Union structure slowly evaporated day by day with the constant harassment.\n\nOne side had to break eventually and as it was the Guardia Civil's duty to make sure that it would not be them the result was that protests finally weakened. The mood had not entirely settled but the imminent threat of revolt seems to have for the foreseeable future been quashed."

The voice of the masses still calls for an end to the regime's oppression and return to true representation.\n\nSome voices in Madrid are calling for more radical action to be undertaken to deal with the dissent yet others oppose anything to radical in order to not tarnish the regime. This has resulted in conflicting messages for the forces on the ground who now cannot truly trust those above or effectively deal with those below. A senior officer has in this confusion written a memorandum asking for clear measures to be put in place to put the protestors in their place. In his eyes by allowing the protests to continue any further the state is running into the danger of the shouts for representation changing into ones calling for emancipation and freedom. His notes have been taken seriously as state officials have recognized the need for an image of stability to consolidate the new regime both internally and in foreign affairs."

However, once they did the protests seemed to lack the organization and purpose it had just a day prior. Important speakers and those who were vital in rallying more people to the cause seemed to be missing. In the vacuum a number of other protestors took to the limelight, attempting to rally the demoralised marchers back to the cause. Yet they in general lacked the charisma and vigor of the previous organisers which had the effect of marcher numbers steadily haemorrhaging. Despite this the protests continued and hence remained problematic to security forces."

Stuck in a constant grind between the heckles and jeering from below and sneering naivety from above, their morale quickly began to plummet, none of this helping in the efforts to resolve the situation.\n\nAs the Guard's activity becomes more sporadic and the protests continue to gather more momentum, it seems the situation is quickly spiralling out of control. It has even become clear to foreign observers that the regime in Madrid has become incapable of dealing with the Lisbon uprising. Some of them, those who view the new government with distaste, are even claiming that the protests are gathering such strength that soon the world could see the rebirth of the Portuguese nation from the carcass of Iberia.\n\nHaving to focus on balancing the fine scale of maintaining good foreign relations and quelling domestic unrest has indeed allowed the protests to grow to an unprecedented scale. More disturbingly is the effect this could have on other movements calling for representation, or worse even, "liberation"."

He could now centralize control of the legislature upon himself, not having to worry about the interjection from an authority, in theory, as powerful as himself.\n\nYet not all were willing to cede the Caudillo this level of power. Especially amongst the Portuguese Iberians there is now great unrest. This has translated into a number of members of the political class also passively resisting the newly instituted transition of power. They will have to bow, in one way or another.\n\nThe Caudillo has called for an emergency meeting of high level officials. Given the timing, many expect the Spanish dictator to only really approach one topic of discussion. Many are however unsure as to what his decision ultimately will be. Will he concede some aspects of his power to sate those calling for representation? Or will Franco stay true to his nature, crushing the rebellious politicians through dismissal, sidelining and exile?

 IBR.5210.d:0 " After Franco's fiery address a number of the assembled officials looked at each other with sheer disbelief. Instead of following a more moderate line, the Spanish dictator had decided to dismiss all legitimate concerns raised about his clear power grab. Only a few of the more diehard authoritarian Spanish politicians had enthusiastically clapped after his speech, cheering on the demise of the last semblances of pluralism. The rest of the hall was silent in shock and contemplation. Some even openly looked disgusted.\n\nA list of the likely candidates to rebel had already been conjured up prior to the members leaving the hall. Security forces around the Union were ready to move in once the targets seemed likely to revolt. Only a few hours after all the officials had left, did the first begin to show signs of abandoning the regime. However, as the officers moved in, more and more dispatches were sent from headquarters. It seems a larger than expected number had decided to resign their post and publicly declare their condemnation of the new government. Once the wave started it did not stop. Politician after politician took to the press and podiums, forcing the crisis-laden state apparatus into near exhaustion. The fallout of this could not be effectively contained. It was clear from the outset that many officials, especially the Portuguese ones, had favoured the more collected and dignified Salazar. Yet this crowd now merged with politicians from all over the Union who called for a representative Union or none at all. Seemingly Salazar's ghost could not stop haunting the Spanish Caudillo. Obstructionism and protest now marked Franco's accession to be the sole locus of power in Iberia."

It clearly had been abandoned by its flock. The dictator struggled to get his attention back to the papers before him on his desk.\n\nResignation after resignation. A majority of the council had decided that this would be the point to make their principled stand. They were nothing but spineless cowards still in the pocket of a dead man who now couldn't even give them favors or patronage anymore. He had expected that a few would follow their revered master but not this many. This rump council would take weeks to replenish with men who were both loyal and of the same technocratic stature as their predecessors. More work to add to an ever growing list.\n\nFranco turned again to the bird. How he longed to be as free in his now seeming solitary existence.

Loyalty to a regime which had managed to stand against the recent tides of history? Certainly, some of the politicians had to have enough pragmatic bones in their body to recognize the futility of questioning the legitimacy of the Iberian regime. The fear provoked by the looming threat of the state apparatus? The officials certainly should be most aware of the power it could exercise. Promises of patronage and favor in exchange for unquestioning obedience? Officials did make the greatest lackeys.\n\nThe reasons did not matter, what did were the results. Only the most extreme Salazar loyalists refused to conform to the new reality and treasonously resigned. Their actions and fates would remain unbeknownst to the public and most of their colleagues. The majority of Iberian politicians have decided to remain loyal following Franco's reform of the Iberian regime. They could bring much needed immediate legitimacy and strength to resolve tensions with certain identity groups of the wider populace.

Not only had the Portuguese officials decided to follow their recently deceased figurehead's constant desire to impede progress, but now also many Spaniards had thrown in their lots with them.\n\nFollowing the rejection, Franco's office door seemingly was not shut for a few days. The Caudillo desperately tried to convince leaders of cliques and interest groups to disavow their previous declaration. To many, the lack of success appeared to drive Franco insane. Once the last name on his list had also sworn to never cooperate again unless Franco allowed the old balance to be restored, he realized that he should have been harsher with these traitors. Salazar had poisoned their mind with his ceaseless obstructions holding back Iberian greatness. Even beyond the grave his dirty fingers could not help but meddle in state affairs.

He could not trust many of his underlings to undertake such important meetings on his behalf, continuing to push himself as he knew the end result would give him what he so desperately desired.\n\nA clique he thought he had placated with promises of patronage and other concessions now again rallied against him. Officials and politicians within the rotting carcass of the previously representative Union government were calling for even further compromises to be made in order to limit Franco's power. He had believed that these opportunists would resign themselves to the flow of events once they recognized which way the winds were blowing. The Caudillo was astoundingly mistaken.

Little did they know that this was one of the few designated private spaces for politicians and officials of the Iberian government to meet and discuss ideas away from prying ears. Despite the wonderful weather all of the outside tables had been folded up and the heavy curtains had been drawn.

The man still has the power to make us disappear if we don't cooperate,' his bellicose Spanish counterpart shot back.\n\n'He is pushing the Union into ruin, the masses of Portugal will not follow him willingly and I suspect even if we concede many of our colleagues will continue resisting,' came the cynical retort.\n\nThe last member of the group raised his hands slowly to calm his two friends. 'You sadly are both right. And this is exactly why we cannot risk action right now. If the masses were to lose their potential leaders before the spark could be properly ignited, then Franco would win. We cannot allow this.' His companions considered this shortly but then began to nod in agreement. 'Good. Let us see how much we can draw out of the old man. Our acceptance will ingratiate us further with him also.

Some in this pursuit alienated others to ensure greater cooperation between initial participants. One of these particular stories is that of nationalism. Now this story was in the process of tearing another apart. The Iberian Union, fundamentally flawed since its conception through the contradiction of its insistence upon equal representation, now stood ready to collapse by political and ethnic tensions. The suppression of minority groups throughout the peninsula by the use of state bureaucracy and force has given rise to an ugly hatred of the political structure in place.\n\nMore severely for the health of the Union however was the gambit played following Salazar's death, by an opportunistic Franco to centralise power upon his own person and hence Spain. Many parts of Portugal had in reaction seen economic standstill, and in some cases open rebellion with Lisbon still in flames. The whole region being in lockdown only further catalyzes the fervor of those who believed more in one story than another.

Believing that his people would welcome the idea was a given. After all it promised progress under the steady direction of a man who had led the Spanish nation out of tremendous turmoil.\n\nHad he been naïve? Of course, Salazar still had many of the Portuguese in his pocket, able to make them dance to his tune from beyond the grave. Neither should it have been surprising that the useless politicians and officials that lined the vast bureaucracy of Iberia would fear for their positions and promptly oppose him. Rather than being localised, the crisis laid bare nationwide opposition and highlighted structural issues which years of political squabbling had not effectively remedied.\n\nFranco knew he now had to swallow his pride or commit political suicide.

Growing more forceful by the minute, it will take the Guardia Civil to properly disperse the rioters."

 IBR.5306.t:0 "Guardia Civil Crushes Protests"
 IBR.5306.d:0 "Protestors fight with the collective ferocity of lions. Tear gas is thrown back at the police, rioters crash against shields like an ocean, and men and women from all professions combine their specialties in a display of solidarity able to shake the Earth. They have one goal - to defeat the Guardia Civil, and use their momentum to crash into the government. There, they will demand the release of the men in Tarrafal, and by now much more besides. The dissidents could go on for hours, giving their all to break the Guard.\n\nIt isn't enough.\n\nThe crowds go on for hours and hours, but no matter what they do they cannot break the Guardia Civil. Armed with vastly superior equipment, and the motivation to match, the energy of the mob peters out. Some desert, even more are incapacitated, and with the rest arrested the crowds were forcibly dispersed.\n\nThe streets are quiet, now, as those who would think to resist have been arrested or cowed. Nobody dares object to the dictates of the Caudillos now."
 IBR.5306.a:0 "I hope not. Making another example would be so uncivilized."
 
 IBR.5307.t:0 "Protests Contained by Guardia Civil"
 IBR.5307.d:0 "The protestors take to the streets, rowdy but ultimately collected. Their anger at the government is directed and given a face by the Guardia civil attempting to stop them. They oppose the Guardia Civil full-heartedly, with men and women from all walks of life using their specialties to attempt to break the law enforcement opposing them. The Guardia Civil, in response, digs in, expecting a siege to last hours.\n\nIt lasts hours. Without the equipment, or the confidence it affords, the riot police lack the means to effectively stop the separatist sympathizers in their tracks. Of course, they have enough to stop the rioters from gaining ground, and that's exactly what happens. The riots lose steam, as their numbers are eroded from being incapacitated and arrested. Eventually, the protestors are none, as they are totally dispersed and the Caudillos reign supreme."
 IBR.5307.a:0 "Finally. I thought they'd never see reason."
 
 IBR.5308.t:0 "Unrest at Tarrafal" 
 IBR.5308.d:0 "Prisoners arrive, more and more every day. Once, as many as 100 were brought in all at once, without any extra supplies to keep them in check. Even after the notice of Tarrafal being filled to capacity, still prisoners kept coming. There were no extra supplies sent to aid them, no more guards to keep the incarcerated in line. They had been filled past capacity and didn't get a moment's extra notice for it!\n\nThe prisoners noticed this too. Every day, the ratio of guard to guarded grew larger, far beyond safe levels. As the number increased, so did the unrest. As incidents increased, punishments became increasingly severe for increasingly minor offenses, as a small few tried to cow their numerical superior. No matter how much they asked for aid, none was able to be provided. It was only a matter of time before something happened.\n\nMeanwhile, the ability of the prison guards at Tarrafal was celebrated in the Iberian media."
 IBR.5308.a:0 "The unrest is still at manageable levels - they are prisoners, after all."
 
 IBR.5309.t:0 "Prisoners Take Over Tarrafal" 
 IBR.5309.d:0 "The morning in Tarrafal had been quiet... Which was surprising, since the prisoners had been getting more restless by the day. Something was obviously up. Once it was discovered that several of the most rebellious prisoners were missing from the headcount, it was enough to send the guards into a frenzy. Their frenzy wasn't enough to stop the prisoners, armed with stolen weapons and numbers to beat the guards by a large amount. While some put up a fight, it was only a handful of hours before Tarrafal was in the hands of its former prisoners.\n\nIt appears most guards are dead, having been slaughtered. Those few that remain have been taken hostage, as the terrorists attempt to bargain their life for another. A large amount of Guardia Civil - and some advisors from the Axencia, separatism never changes - have been deployed to Tarrafal with orders to subdue who they can and kill those who refuse to surrender. We can only hope an effective reconquest will be mostly quiet."
 IBR.5309.a:0 "Just as we held it up for the public eye, too."
 
 IBR.5310.t:0 "A Bloody Battle"
 IBR.5310.d:0 "Like the several hours it took for the prisoners to dominate Tarrafal, it took several hours more to expel them from the penal colony. For a long while, it was nothing short of open warfare. A media crew had been brought along in order to publicize the pacification of the prison, in order to show the strength of the Guardia Civil. What they saw was long and bloody, oftentimes bloody enough to give the floor and walls a new coat of paint. Many prisoners were holed up, and the process to get them out was incredibly destructive.\n\nBy the time the prison was Iberian once more, Tarrafal hardly resembled somewhere people would live, let alone a containment area. Combined with the prisoners who surrendered, a hasty provisional prison had to be established.\n\nEven though this was an embarrassing sight, the worst to be caught by the media team was one last prisoner, who had managed to catch a squad by surprise. Screaming one last cry, he killed several men before he could be brought down himself. It is already obvious this man will become a martyr."
 IBR.5310.a:0 "Bah! Let the dead show the price of resistance."
 
 IBR.5311.t:0 "Massive Protests Against the Slaughter"
 IBR.5311.d:0 "As predicted, the lone prisoner has become a martyr. His cry - a shout in Basque for freedom - has become immortalized, though the language eludes most. The man's death has become a symbol, used by terrorists to represent all who have died in Tarrafal. From here it is a propaganda battle between Iberia and the separatists, a competition to mobilize the populace in their favor.\n\nSo far, the separatists are winning.\n\nLarge numbers of citizens around Iberia, particularly in minority regions, have been mobilized by dishonest publications and pushed to take to the streets. They have been infiltrated by terrorist agitators, which are constantly pushing anti-government messages. It will turn into a riot if it continues on much longer."
 IBR.5311.a:0 "Send in the Guardia Civil!"
 
 IBR.5312.t:0 "Protests out of Control"
 IBR.5312.d:0 "The rioters were a sight to behold. While they were not particularly organized, they worked together well enough to offset the disadvantage. Many different people, with many different skills, were pushed on and covertly supplied by separatists, adding fuel to the fire. It would take a strong effort from the Guardia Civil to stop the rioting advance. On the other side of the city street...\n\nThere was nothing resembling a strong response. They had shields, sure, and they were organized, certainly, but the Guardia had nothing else going for them. Greatly underfunded, they did not have the means to acquire the necessary equipment. No matter how hard their fighting spirit, they simply did not have the means to defeat the protestors. What was a riot soon became a battlefield, and what was a battlefield soon became a rout, as the Guardia realized they couldn't keep up the fight.\n\nThis did not only happen in one isolated street in a city. All over Iberia, the Guardia Civil lost battles with the rioters, as the situation grew large enough to become totally uncontrollable. The public faith in the Caudillos has been deeply shaken by their inability to maintain peace and order, and with how bold separatists are growing this is only the beginning of our troubles."

 IBR.5313.d:0 "Several complaints have been filed by the Axencia, particularly from their high command. As is fairly obvious, they are the leading anti-separatist force in Iberia, and with this position comes many advantages and privileges. As of recent, the push towards an expanded military presence has brought their ire. Their primary concern is redundancy, they say - the army surely does not need more power to handle anti-separatists, since the job of separatist-busting is already handled by them.\n\nWhat they do not mention are their real reasons for the protests, hidden behind a veil of honeyed words. The Axencia is a governmental agency, much like the army. They feel that their work is threatened by the extra resources going to the military: A classic case of inter-governmental conflict. Regardless, some consideration needs to be made to their concerns, as regardless of purpose they are valid points."

As the man zoned out of his paperwork once more, fighting off an all-encompassing boredom, he could see even the rims of his glasses. He didn't see the paperwork anymore, no, he had started staring at a wall. This was the nature of what he did, he supposed, without frills but one of the safest places in the country. Safe from anything external, anyway. He refocused back on his job - his break was in a few minutes anyway, he could take it to reflect on his life.\n\nCarrying the same sobering weight of an alarm, there was a Noise.\n\nIt was no regular, supposed-to-happen Noise, it was something wrong. A ring, an echo, it was hard to tell. Perhaps a gun? He didn't know how far that sound could go, however. As he stepped out of the cubicle in one-half curiosity, one-half concern, he was pleasantly surprised to see that he wasn't the only person to notice the Noise. Though they all knew there wouldn't be an answer, they asked one another anyway."

 IBR.5315.d:0 "Another discussion had graced the council. The Caudillos had sent them some more laws to review, and to advise on the best modifications to them possible. It wasn't very glamorous a job, but the duty to the Union overshadowed the fame. At least, everyone seemed to put on the act well enough to look the part.\n\nA man walked in through the door, with seven more besides him. They were very quiet, and exceptionally casual. Were they any more energetic, someone would probably have noticed the firearms and military garb. There were no regular men - these were officers, behind them soldiers. It seems the council noticed when the first man raised a pistol into the air and fired several rounds, creating a Noise great enough to silence any conversation.\n\n"Have I gotten your attention!?" he screams, making sure everyone can hear him."Good! Now, me and my colleagues have a few things we'd like to say..." So the officer spoke. He was Spanish, and his second-in-command Portuguese. They were not Iberian, because Iberia was not a country worth being in- at least, not until a few changes were made. Firstly, the council needed some real power...\n\nOn he spoke, outlining his manifesto for his coup. There would be no negotiation but the capitulation of the government to ending injustice, for the Iberian Council would be staying right where they were until then.

According to generals in the area, a contingent of soldiers and their commanders have mutinied against the Union, holding the Iberian Council hostage in their own meeting place. Numbers are uncertain, but an entire armor crew has defected to them, meaning that the rebels are even more dangerous! They have one particular weakness - their willingness to negotiate means that they could be caught off guard, potentially.\n\nThey need to be dealt with immediately. There is already a mess in Madrid, as law and order dissolve in the face of an attempted coup. The public opinion hit would be devastating! If the Council can be evacuated safely, then this could still be spun as a positive for the masses."

 IBR.5317.d:0 "The speech was delivered in a meticulous manner, in such a way that nearly everyone in Iberia would witness it. To those using the radio, it was simply voices - the unknown one Caetano. On the television, the matter was much more serious. The Caudillos stood next to one another on separate podiums, both lined with microphones. Iberia was watching, from the highest politician to the lowest worker.\n\n"An unfortunate incident has unfolded in the capital," Franco began. "Some rogue elements have attempted to seize control of the city of Madrid." It was here the mutineers stopped listening, turning their attention back to the affairs of their rebellion.\n\n"In the face of these exceptional circumstances," spoke Caetano, "we request your serenity and trust, and that we have given the Captains General of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force the following order:" The separatists stopped listening, laughing and joking over the rest of the speech. "Any use of force necessary to maintain the cohesion and the unity of the Iberian Union will be utilized without a moment's hesitation."\n\nFranco continued, "We will not tolerate any attempts to, in any degree whatsoever, undermine the Iberian Union by use of threats of violence and treasonous behavior."

 IBR.5318.d:0 "There were a lot of defectors around the Cortes, variably armed but with enough morale to back it all up. Of course, this was before they were more than doubled by the military bearing down on them. When the tank crew defected in exchange for a lighter punishment, the rest didn't take very long to go with them. Lines of arrested traitors were paraded through the city by their loyalist counterparts, using every scene as a show of strength for the media. It truly was an impressive scene to behold.\n\nMeanwhile, those within the Cortes were much more resilient than their outside defectors. Perhaps it was a revolutionary zeal, or maybe just the confidence that the Cortes provided them. They stood, with every prod towards them declaring that they would not fold except with the acceptance of their demands. It could have been that they expected this, or more likely they had raided the stored provisions the building held. The revolutionaries waited for several days, refusing to be smoked out. More persuasive means couldn't be utilized, since killing the councilmen was a risk - and it would be a disaster if it happened.\n\nAs the situation stagnated, the environment grew more uneasy. What would this do to Iberia, everyone wondered? Could this be a death blow, or a sign of horrors to come? It seems this concern pierced up to even the Caudillos themselves, for the men surrounding the Cortes were given a simple order, to be carried out how they pleased. Straight from Franco and Caetano themselves, it was said."

 IBR.5319.d:0 "Isto remata hoxe - this ends today. It was a very simple order on the surface. The mutineers needed gone, and the Cortes needed to be freed today. The only weapons left that would for sure end the siege were the big guns. Very destructive things, sure to cause collateral; but collateral damage was excusable for the sake of sticking to orders.\n\nThe soldiers went in no holds barred, yet they found their opponent ready for them. Fighting on to the last man, the Cortes was totalled after the last mutineer was pronounced dead. It took several hours to tally up casualties, and worst of all was that many councilmen had been found on the list of dead. Too many. Their bodies could be hidden, but with time their deaths could not be.\n\nThe hamfisted attempt at salvaging the situation had only made it worse, with the damage to the Cortes a monument to resistance, emboldening the separatists with the hope that their struggle was not in vain. They struck at who was not slain in the siege, and without their loyal middlemen the Caudillos had next to no influence, nor the information needed to stop what was about to happen. Their control had faded, and Iberia was quickly beginning to slip the leash."

We have managed to play up faith to such an extent that many religious groups have taken us totally to our word. Of course, while this is normally not a bad thing, it is a very good idea to back up the rhetoric with some token concessions. We have neglected to do this.\n\nMultiple religious groups across Iberia have criticized the government for hypocrisy, such as how we have neglected a faithful education, even though we have emphasized faith in Iberia. This has brought the more religious sects of the population towards a critical angle of the Union, and it will take some time to repair the sentiment."

The primary way to do this is their education.\n\nIf we take the initiative to give our students political education, we can effectively control the way they see the world - lasting or otherwise, the legacy will leave a deep mark. Of course, we should still aim for an effective control of their education. We could push the youth into organizing in politics, mobilizing their support to help Iberia.

Madrid's streets were very busy all day, even through midday, as crowds watched and journalists sought to record the scene and take plenty of photos.\n\nAfter everything was said and done, it seems that the parade has left an impression on many.

Not harming this, of course, were the news reporters - they had found a particularly flattering angle, and enhanced the parade beyond regular levels using their PR trickery. Not a single thing went wrong all parade.\n\nOf course, the separatists are not terrified by this display, but it has definitely knocked some sense into them.

Of course, it was also fair to reason that quantity was being used to offset quality. The only way to tell for sure was to see the event itself.\n\nAs the soldiers marched down the streets of Madrid to the scrutiny of regular people and journalists, the latter proved true.

There are two options:\n\nWe may direct our attention towards mobilizing public attention, to inspire them to act in ways beneficial to Iberia. Were we to make use of public mobilization, it would likely come in handy when attempting to garner public opinion regarding public events. Alternatively, we could make use of subtle propaganda. By nudging perceptions slightly here, and doing so again there, we could slowly turn public support away from concepts we do not support. As well, there is also a third option.

The unclear part of the solution is how. It would be most obvious to launch a grand national campaign, garnering the support of the people and turning it against liberal forces. We need to be careful - if we were to allow such a movement to proceed on totally unhindered it would quickly turn on us.

 IBR.5335.d:0 "The best way to stop dissidents is to cut off their information. There are several media sources across Iberia - regionalist, separatist, and otherwise treasonous in attitude - that these would-be rebels get their information from. They refuse to get their news anywhere else, so we cannot reach them regularly. Therefore, we will need to get onto the dissident networks. This is the plan - we will infiltrate the worst offenders and slowly shift their perspective on the Caudillos, under the pretense of fairness.\n\nIn slowly changing the information given, we will deprive the worst rebels of evidence in their arguments and change the minds of the more malleable. The people will love us, or they will hate us without reason."
 IBR.5335.a:0 "Let it be done."
 
 IBR.5336.t:0 "Slowly Changing the Narrative"
 IBR.5336.d:0 "From our informants come a series of very promising events. Firstly, they have reported that graffiti upon Iberian state media has decreased drastically. Posters are cleaner on average, with vandalized contents reaching an all-time low. In public, those identified as potentially troublesome have appeared more genuine in their praises - it no longer seems coerced. Undercover operatives have corroborated with similar reports. In more private settings, where open opinions tend to flourish, the worst examples of rebellious thought seem to have cooled considerably, with arguments frequently muddying the waters.\n\nThe Caudillos are starting to be seen in a more understanding light by even their dissidents, at least the reasonable ones,and these people have become less inclined to disagree. This success has only been reported on middle- and older-aged adults. How it will come off to the younger sections of Iberian society is yet to be determined."
 IBR.5336.a:0 "What are you waiting for? Let's see how we did!"
 
 IBR.5337.t:0 "Laughable Attempts at Influencing"
 IBR.5337.d:0 "The infiltration has gone as planned. Loyalist agents have found their way into dissident networks, using modified stories and grand - but not totally fabricated - tales in order to sway public opinion about the Caudillos. Designed to rile up those who watched it, the emotion elicited would then be redirected into support for the regime. Unfortunately, nothing has gone to plan beyond that.\n\nInformants have reported that the "special dispatches" used to rile up emotion have been perceived as ridiculous, taken as satire or as humor by most dissidents who watched it. Lacking in subtlety, the propagandized reports have failed to shift opinion. It is unlikely we will get another chance at this, and we have failed to garner more support."
 IBR.5337.a:0 "I see we've used a hammer when we needed a scalpel, excellent."
 
 IBR.5338.t:0 "A Closing Generational Divide" 
 IBR.5338.d:0 "According to informant reports, the youth of Iberia seem to cherish their Caudillos more than before. They do not have much in the way of definitive proof, however the ways in which younger citizens express discontent - such as vandalism and seditious humor - are reported to have declined. More concrete, probable dissident organizations are reported to have plateaued or even declined in membership. The youth have gotten tired of their treason, likely thanks to our influence.\n\nAll together, the conclusion is that our subtlety has paid off. Because of our effort to specially tailor the message to the youth, the younger Iberians have taken the bait perfectly. Our regime has grown to their liking, with nothing but a coat of paint to bring them along that way."
 IBR.5338.a:0 "If only the rest of the world was this simple."
 
 IBR.5339.t:0 "The Disinterested Young" 
 IBR.5339.d:0 "When the preliminary reports showed no strong change, it was accepted without a second glance. Surely, it was reasoned, this was only because the program had just begun. Waiting for further reports would show the desired trend. Normally this would be so, if somebody had fabricated reports or things had worked as desired. As the results filtered in, and nothing seemed to change, it finally became obvious that something wasn't working. Once the clerks had stopped looking for success, they instead began to look for answers.\n\nAfter much research, they found, without surprise, that the younger segments of the population weren't very interested in our influence. This didn't solve why, to the displeasure of the Caudillos. Facing some proper consequences for failure, the informants have discovered that our influence wasn't popular with the young because it wasn't compatible. "
 IBR.5339.a:0 "All of that for nothing? Who suggested this again?"
 
 IBR.5340.t:0 "The Powerful Traitors"
 IBR.5340.d:0 ""Look at Iberia. I know this union was forced upon you, the people, as it was forced upon us. But how it was created means nothing! We must focus on the now. What has Iberia brought for you now? It has created unity. Our unity of purpose, of faith, and this unity has propelled us to great lengths. There is prosperity and happiness, and morality to keep it all in place." Franco pauses. Some scarce applause comes from the crowd, until people realize the speech isn't concluded. Once it dies down, Franco looks at his fellow Caudillo. Caetano glances around, before speaking himself.\n\n"It has come to our attention that some- traitors have sought to destroy Iberia. A democratic deep state, dedicated to instituting mob rule. From that mob rule, they will create bolshevism. They think that they can simply destroy Iberia, but that is not so! We are onto them, and with the help of you, the people, we can destroy this menace!" Caetano glances around again. "Now you may clap.""
 IBR.5340.a:0 "Applause ensues."
 
 IBR.5341.t:0 "High Ranking Officials Resign"
 IBR.5341.d:0 "Following our speech against the democratic elements of our government, there have been a number of incidents in the government. Several officials, some definitely rebellious, some unexpectedly so, have begun to make a scene by resigning. Normally this isn't an issue, as they can simply be acknowledged and then sent on their way to irrelevance. This will likely not happen this time. Usually, protesting officials take the form of lower clerks or bureaucrats, gears so caught in the machine that nothing happens from them leaving it.\n\nThe resigning cabal is significantly higher in rank than usual, which could give their protests much more credibility. If we do not silence them - for they will undoubtedly speak out - then many formerly high ranking officials will become figureheads, or even worse, martyrs."
 IBR.5341.a:0 "Find them. I knew loyalty was secondary to nothing."
 
 IBR.5342.t:0 "Traitors Speak out Against Caudillos"
 IBR.5342.d:0 "Somewhere in the countryside, a place that looked so nondescript it could have been anywhere, a man faces a reporter, the sort with a penchant for too-many-questions and too-many-answers. The man himself is formally dressed, with clothing that seems perfectly designed to simply melt into a crowd. The reporter does his best to hide the concern on his face as he brings the microphone back to his mouth.\n\n"Well, that... is something, yes. One last question: Do you have anything left to add?"\n\nThe official takes the microphone. "I, uh, think I do. Don't listen to Franco. He is, well, quite simply a snake. He'll stab you in the back and, uh, my message to anyone listening is to get him and the other one gone."\n\nThe interview concluded not long after the final statement, as one damning statement after another found their way across Iberia. First across underground outlets, then through more legitimate stations, the words against the Caudillos managed to find themselves reported to many people, and worse than that, they seemed to be listening."
 IBR.5342.a:0 "Bastards, can't keep their mouths shut."
 
 IBR.5343.t:0 "Protests in Support of Democracy"
 IBR.5343.d:0 "In Madrid, protests were contained early by the overwhelming police presence. In several other cities, the government was not nearly as fortunate. Protests had sparked up, spurred on by the damning comments against the Caudillos, as thousands of people rural and urban alike had taken to the streets in order to defy the government. As the demonstrations were victim to attempted containment, they quickly devolved into plain riots.\n\nThe flash riots took several days to put down. More than that, during that several days democratic ideals had been planted into the populace. Not from any deliberate strategy, but in opposing the government they had come to support what it detested most - democracy. There are now many calls for further freedom, the protection of whistleblowers, and many other liberties that were only conveniences before, but were now mandatory.\n\nThe odds are significant that now, with a populace more conscious of politics than ever before, solidifying our control will be nigh-impossible. Any moves to remove dissidents will be met with outrage, for it seems that most people are more in favor of no Iberia than not getting their way."
 IBR.5343.a:0 "Well..."
 
 IBR.5344.t:0 "Cutting the Head Off the Snake"
 IBR.5344.d:0 "It was a regular day for Enrique. He did paperwork, made sure all the forms were correct and that the government was running how it ought to. Quite personally, he was proud that-\n\nHe was stood up by two uniformed men and turned to face them. One simply looked at him, while the other looked him up and down, before speaking.\n\n"You are under arrest for treason and the advocacy of ideas destructive to Iberia." They placed him in handcuffs and walked him out of the office, as his coworkers watched on with stupefied amazement.\n\nSeveral others were walked out with similar stories - picked up by uniformed men, charges read to them, and then walked to some form of transit, from which they were driven off to somewhere unknown. This wasn't the only place this had happened, either. Countless individuals were removed and imprisoned in what had quickly become, for them and the ones who had signed the warrants, a purge."
 IBR.5344.a:0 "Death to traitors."
 
 IBR.5345.t:0 "Paraded for All to See"
 IBR.5345.d:0 "Unlike the bureaucrats and clerks, the politicians, the higher echelons of the government, were far more valuable for courting opinion. On live television, reporters were escorted to the homes and workplaces of various politicians, conveniently ignoring their common thread of liberalism, and guided by officers through raids and arrests. Several major officials - and many lesser - are detained and walked to a vehicle, surrounded by camera men and reporters from several different news networks.\n\nThankfully, no reporter ever got in earshot of a rebel, and any dissenting opinions were talked over by guides. Nearly every (legitimate) media station in Iberia had someone at several arrests, and we were able to put on an impressive show of force as an example to any would-be traitors."
 IBR.5345.a:0 "Well done to everyone involved."
 
 IBR.5346.t:0 "Televised Trials"
 IBR.5346.d:0 "The man behind the camera signals to the judge that they are recording. The judge glances at the camera, then glares at the persecuted.\n\n"Enrique Velasquez. You have been accused of treason and conspiracy to undermine Iberia. How do you plead?"\n\nThe court case lasted just under an hour, as Enrique was unable to defend himself. Forced to defend himself, against fabricated but numerous evidence, he was stuck in a losing case. Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence was the testimony of his coworker, who was able to corroborate many of the bureaucrat's conspiracies.\n\n"I do not know-"\n\n"Do not lie to the court!" snapped the judge."We have documents in our possession proving that he was an accomplice in all of your crimes!"\n\n"I sentence you, Enrique Velasquez, to spend the rest of your life in prison in order to atone for your mistakes."\n\nSuffice to say, Enrique would not be without company."
 IBR.5346.a:0 "Let them see the consequences of betrayal!"
 
 IBR.5347.t:0 "Caudillos Victorious"
 IBR.5347.d:0 "Today, there was only one Caudillo on stage, surrounded by no smaller amount of microphones. Franco was in Lisbon, while Caetano stood in Madrid - an oddly segregated display, even more so as they began speaking.\n\n"We understand that you may have been witness to a very unpleasant campaign across Iberia. Firstly, we would like to apologize for the way we were forced to carry it out. However, you, the people, must understand that these steps, while harsh, were necessary to save the Union..." It was perhaps one of the longest and most winding speeches yet, both Caudillos speaking the same words - as Franco was broadcast to Portugal, and Caetano was broadcast to Spain.\n\n"...Finally these matters have been dealt with, and the security of Iberia is nearly assured. All it takes is one last thing: You, the people, the brave citizens. You must help us walk to the future, and with your help we may enter an era of prosperity." At the rallies themselves, applause. Though those watching from home could not applaud, they were no less impressed."

Thousands have taken to the streets, protesting the actions by the government. Normally, this would not be an issue - it would warrant a great crackdown, surely, but that is nothing truly ridiculous - but there is something fundamentally different about these recent protests.\n\nThe numbers who have shown up are in the tens of thousands, with significant portions of entire cities showing up to protest. Traitorous media stations, some of whom even aired our crackdown, have turned against us and spread the dissenting ideas even further, increasing the numbers on the streets dramatically.

Entire areas of minority regions have been slowly wrested from government control, as terrorists undermine the Axencia at nearly every step. Tens of thousands of citizens line the streets of cities, marching against a government that cannot even stop them effectively.\n\nNothing can get done even in the higher echelons of government, as the officers and ministers turn and snap at the Caudillos like rabid dogs.

If you allow elections to let your regime's policy goals flip-flop all over the place, then you'll never get anything done but secure twenty more years of bickering. Without strong central figures, nothing could ever get done. With these men to assert their visions, a country will know what to expect. A stable, unchanging, uncompromising, vision.\n\nAnd that is exactly what Iberia has! Under the firm hand of the Caudillos, Iberia will be able to pursue a consistent policy. The twin rulers of the Union have cemented their positions in charge, and so will now be able to lead Iberia on to their other goals. Nobody may dispute their directives now, and that is the way all effective governments should be."

Of course, not everyone in the Union felt the same, but those who truly cared were in the minority. No major events occurred, and the streets of the country's cities remained the same - only men and women going about their day.\n\nIt seems that, following the successes of Tarrafal, dissidents are afraid to protest, fearing their own incarceration.

 IBR.5353.d:0 "Nearly as soon as Franco had concluded his speech, Iberia had found itself in yet another uproar. Crowds of angry nationalists took to the streets, encouraged by their coverage from an ever-fickle media. Attendance surged far beyond what was expected, as a day-long riot evolved into a multiple day affair.\n\nMotivated by the overseas debacle, "Remember Tarrafal" became a rallying cry, a phrase upon which the rioters based themselves upon. Despite having the arms of a crowd of people taking to the streets, they also had a fight on their minds, and they easily found that fight against the Guardia Civil. The riot was not fully contained until several days after, and by the time the last head was given a taste of baton the damage had been done - several minority cities had been victim to rioting, looting, and a whole host of other nasty consequences."

Without their aid, we would be nearly blind to the actions occurring in areas such as Catalonia. This by itself, however, is not their only use. These collaborators also form the backbone of our bureaucracy, not only supplying the state with information but processing it too. We should, of course, reward these men and women for their deeds in service of Iberia, but an issue of more uncertainty is the method we will go about making use of our collaborators.\n\nThese people have worked with the state for many years, and as traitors have long since been weeded out we will never have to doubt their loyalty. There is an issue, however - these people are mostly despised by the natives of their regions, and might have grown complacent in their positions. We could use a potential solution to this by recruiting new collaborators, whose fresh blood could transform their regions into something more productive.

While this would guarantee loyalty, it may not provide us enough manpower to keep things functioning. Therefore, we could let more than just the most trusted individuals participate in higher echelons.

There is a hitch - not everyone in Iberia realizes this, and separatist terrorists would stop at nothing to turn this entire turn of events to their advantage through trickery and deception. Our objective is to make up for that.\n\nWe could play the political game, and use our agents to cut out slack in the regional bureaucracy. This way, we could prepare it for anything thrown at it, offsetting any terrorist gains with gains of our own.

Against the cynical bureaucrats of the regional administration, these agents have been mangled by the political games and, between them, have frequently left humiliated or worse-off than when they began.

Our new collaborators, new faces with believable stories, have been received far better than expected.\n\nThanks to their ability to really provoke a crowd, the new collaborators have seen stunning success in singing our praises.

It was more than likely a mistake to direct our collaborators to disperse propaganda.\n\nKnown thoroughly by the inhabitants of their given regions to be puppets, their hostility to the Union was directed towards the informants.

After all, nobody knew the regions quite like the informants, whose insights could place the Union one step ahead of its detractors.\n\nPerhaps there was sabotage, or maybe there simply weren't enough informants to work on intelligence. No matter the cause, the local Guardia Civil was victim to a shocking revelation, as they prepared to move to stop regionalist dissidents; They didn't have what they needed to work effectively. Depending so greatly on a relatively small number of collaborators, there just wasn't enough insight to get ahead of protests. As such, the Guardia has been on the defensive ever since the protests started, which had now turned into riots. It will take a long time to get rid of their stain."
 IBR.5368.a:0 "Not good..."
 
 IBR.5369.t:0 "Low Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5369.d:0 "There remains one all-important matter beyond the in-the-moment rush of protests and riots: The lasting backlash. No matter how well you stamp a rally, it counts for nothing if you can't stop them after the fact. This is a very difficult affair, requiring the dedicated work of administration to keep ahead of the opposition - the only way to stop backlash and lasting opposition is to stop their growth before it can begin. Hence, the administrative importance of being able to outpace them.\n\nThankfully, it seems we have totally succeeded in that regard. Our administration is strong and nimble, with the lethal slack cut out before it was able to kill us. As well, we have enough skilled, trustworthy collaborators to keep it that way, as they all put their masterful abilities at the pointical game towards chasing out corruption and inefficiency. Any meaningful backlash has been snuffed out, but some has still slipped through the cracks."
 IBR.5369.a:0 "So they keep earning their positions, I see."
 
 IBR.5370.t:0 "Sizable Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5370.d:0 "What matters much more than snuffing out protests is making sure they create no backlash. Here, the real art of silencing dissent shows herself. Containing a protest means nothing if it has left martyrs and an opposition willing to take up the cause the next chance they get. It takes a strong bureaucracy to handle the backlash - it is of critical importance they have the size and scale required to outpace the opposition, no matter how large is necessary, for it is a war of scale.\n\nThis war is one we appear to be losing. The bureaucracy is not large enough to keep up with what is demanded of it. The enemy is gaining pace, capable of sowing dissent and spreading its rebelliousness to previously uninvolved citizens. It is going to leave a legacy of opposition, which will take far longer than any single protest."
 IBR.5370.a:0 "I suppose it could be worse.."
 
 IBR.5371.t:0 "Great Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5371.d:0 "If you cannot stop the following outrage, then there is no point to even trying to snuff out a protest. It is an art in its finest variants of execution, as backlash is snuffed out before it can even blossom, and martyrs are eliminated while any still spouting rebellion are silenced. There is a process - the bureaucracy must snuff out the backlash, in order for it to truly go away. To do this, the administrative capacity must be greater than what the dissidents can put out.\n\nIt is not. It is totally insufficient for the purpose we require it for. Dissident is growing nearly unchallenged, and with the way it is growing it will not matter how well we suppressed the initial reaction. We should not mention what has slipped through the cracks, but rather what has slipped through the holes. Our administration has totally failed us."
 IBR.5371.a:0 "Useless bastards!"
 
 IBR.5372.t:0 "Voting on Regional Law Bombed!"
 IBR.5372.d:0 "As the day carried on, the deputies assembled to vote on - and pass - the Regional Law that was going to take Iberia by storm. The Guardia Civil had been deployed en masse to the minority regions, as the Union was providing everything they needed in anticipation. With the new equipment came even more gear than requested, and officers from non-separatist regions - unquestionably loyal - to help use them. A storm had been prepared for in all places possible, including even the chamber of deputies. Three guards had been assigned to thoroughly search all non-representatives, so that nobody could sneak in a device designed to hurt the representatives during voting.\n\nThis made it all the more shocking when a bomb was detonated during voting. A remarkably high-yield explosive, as evidenced by the building being judged as "unsound enough to warrant an evacuation", though the chamber was not irreparably destroyed. Two of the three guards were killed, with the third remaining steadfast and performing the evacuation order.\n\nThis is an absolute disaster. Somehow a separatist organization has snuck in contraband, even through all of the security precautions. Though no councilmen were hurt, it is shocking that they still managed to sneak through the security precautions. More surprising, however, is that the perpetrator is still unknown - usually by now a group finds some way to claim responsibility for an attack, using it as a point of pride in their propaganda.\n\nNobody has taken responsibility."
 IBR.5372.a:0 "How did they slip through!?"
 
 IBR.5373.t:0 "Guardia Civil Arrests Regionalist Officials"
 IBR.5373.d:0 "A man speaks to an assembled crowd. He speaks with fire, a passion in his voice so contagious it cannot help but begin to rile up those he speaks to. His screams, bordering on ranting to the crowd, speak of freedom. He tells of his time near the council, and of how the Caudillos - without even sparing a glance - ordered them around, as nothing but a formality. He speaks of democracy, of how the country ought to be free. Once he has found himself enough support, he breaches the most sacrilegious topic yet: Independence. No country ought to exist under another that would eras-\n\nThe Guardia Civil arrived, swarming on the scene like angry hornets. Over a megaphone, an agent speaks of a crowd, and of how they ought to disperse before they are arrested, or worse. He was not nearly as effective at speaking, until the Guard brandished their weapons. Most had the sense to leave, while those that didn't found the agent's promises true.\n\nOf everyone we let in, many were terrorists. This is a total disaster - we let in far too many people, and we didn't have the capacity to totally vet them all. Some were separatists, and not all of them made gestures grand enough to get themselves arrested. To make matters worse, the Regional Law was passed after the bombing, which has been used as a very effective talking point against the regime."
 IBR.5373.a:0 "Who could have predicted this?"
 
 IBR.5374.t:0 "Purging Regional Politicians"
 IBR.5374.d:0 "Comunicado\nFrom: Marcelo Caetano, Francisco Franco\n\nYou are aware of the situation regarding the so-called "Regional Law" and the regional politicians, we presume. If you are not already informed, then be advised that at least twelve (12) native-born regional officials are confirmed separatist terrorists and an unknown number more are associated or sympathetic.\n\nYou are to identify and arrest all individuals associated with the government in designated "minority regions" that are also native to a designated "minority region". The way this operation is carried out is up to your discretion, as long as it is minimal in collateral damage.\n\nYou are to inform us once the directive is totally fulfilled. The offending targets will be stripped of their posts and replaced with Spanish/Portuguese natives."
 IBR.5374.a:0 "Traitors, all of them!"
 
 IBR.5375.t:0 "A Bullet Dodged"
 IBR.5375.d:0 "Somehow, Iberia remains standing. As the native politicians met the end of their careers to be replaced with Spanish and Portuguese, it seemed as if everyone from the regions had taken to protest, rioting on such a scale it seemed impossible to truly contain. The situation seemed the end of Iberia, just waiting for some seperatist to grow bold and strike it all down.\n\nThat was not so. It seems as if everyone who was out to protest has lost their steam, with most returning home and those remaining easily subdued and detained. As the crowds left the streets, the Guardia Civil was far more capable of stopping separatist plots, slowly dragging the nation back from the brink. Only a short while ago, a well-placed plot could have destroyed the country. Now, we are back in a situation where it will take more than a scheme to obliterate Iberia."
 IBR.5375.a:0 "God has saved the Union - that is the only possibility."
 
 IBR.5376.t:0 "Unrest Growing in Regions"
 IBR.5376.d:0 "The new Regional Law has appeared to be the breaking point for many citizens of the minority regions. Agitators - no doubt aided by their separatist brethren - have started rioting. These riots are much more violent than any preceding them, as the protestors have struck back at the Guardia Civil in ways that nearly didn't happen before. Tear gas is being thrown back at the Guard, several groups are getting physical, using improvised weapons to attempt to compete with riot gear. Most worrying, however, is that the men sent in have been shot at, as rifles and pistols are being confirmed as being used against them.\n\nThe situation is primed to only get worse as time goes on, as separatist support seems to do nothing but grow. The Guardia Civil seem totally under equipped for the situation, and the prospect of large casualties dampening morale hasn't done anything to help them either."
 IBR.5376.a:0 "I hope they can hold out long enough.."
 
 IBR.5377.t:0 "Regions in Lockdown"
 IBR.5377.d:0 "Regional unrest is continuing to reach all-time highs and break records. Even though the Guardia Civil put up an extraordinarily brave struggle, the visible turning point was when separatists hijacked a Catalonian media station, broadcasting propaganda to bring more rebels out against the Union. After this event, and a skyrocketing attrition rate with the Guard, the decision was finally made to deploy the military to the regions in order to enforce law and order.\n\nThey haven't succeeded.\n\nThe military presence seems to have inflamed the separatists, and the riots have gotten so intense they likely cannot be contained anymore. With the situation so destabilized, it would only take one decisive hit to the structure to bring it all crashing down on our heads..."
 IBR.5377.a:0 "Fuck!"
 
 #Focus: The Issue of Languages
 
 IBR.5378.t:0 "The Language Problem"
 IBR.5378.d:0 "The Union is extremely diverse, and the same should be said of its languages. In fact, there are so many languages in Iberia that you cannot count them all on one hand. While this would normally be an object of no concern, recent events have brought to light the downsides of having such an excessive number of languages present in the country.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that attempting to run administrative procedures through several different languages will only end poorly, as important descriptions are lost in translation and unnecessary strain is placed on the system as it has to cope with translating to this and that and this dialect and that sublanguage, when the entire process could be a fraction of the difficulty by simply printing in two languages - Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nThis would have its drawbacks, however. We are still currently running the government on Galician, and suddenly shifting over may have consequences. Not to mention that the unrest generated by simply swapping formal languages may outweigh any gain we could create. For this reason we could make a few concessions as a transitory stance, but segments of the government may not approve. "
 IBR.5378.a:0 "Spanish and Portuguese will reign supreme!"
 IBR.5378.b:0 "We can do small concessions..."
 
 IBR.5379.t:0 "Protests for Regional Languages"
 IBR.5379.d:0 "Another crowd has taken to the streets. The same group as always, a core of separatists backed up by a large number of people who, with the new law, had found themselves particularly aggravated against the government. They have assembled to protest the new language policies, chanting nationalist slogans and - in case somebody couldn't hear it - made sure to brandish them on signs, too.\n\nWhile the protests were very simple affairs for the Guardia Civil, a less-than-ideal handling of the situation has created a martyr out of the protests. We have drawn the ire of more previously neutral bystanders, which has in turn given the separatists a larger recruitment ground. "
 IBR.5379.a:0 "To be expected."
 
 IBR.5380.t:0 "Minor Language Protests"
 IBR.5380.d:0 ""These minor languages, perversions of Spanish and Portuguese, infect Iberia, always demanding the world from us for nothing in return..." Franco seems agitated, but stops talking. Caetano instead speaks,\n\n"...We owe them nothing. The strain of even acknowledging their existence is great, and for the Union's sake they will be brought back into Portuguese and Spanish."\n\nIt was quite an irritating message, to put it diplomatically. It seemed that everything was in order to create riots, perhaps even ones large enough to topple Iberia, but then the collaborators intervened. Using careful rhetoric, the collaborators were able to soften the message for relevant populations. As they are seen as quite trustworthy most of the minorities they represent, our collaborators were even further able to soften the message. The end result was a group far smaller than they could have been, easily suppressed by the Guardia Civil."
 IBR.5380.a:0 "Perhaps a raise is in order."
 
 IBR.5381.t:0 "Hardliners Denounce Weakness"
 IBR.5381.d:0 ""We find that the direction the Union is taking, with regards to its stance on languages, to be an insult to all righteous men and women within Iberia. Allowing separatist languages, encouraging them even, is a hypocritical act which..."\n\nFollowing recent concessions, several factions within the government have issued an official protest against the government, backing up their protest by obstructing several functions of the government. Normally even the wildest of the hardliners would not even think to do something like this, but our recent shifts in governing policy have emboldened them, and going back on our course even slightly seems to have knocked them collectively into overdrive. They will, eventually, fall back into line, but their defiance has disrupted some functions of state already."

 IBR.5382.d:0 "Casimiro Morcillo González, the newly consecrated Archbishop of Madrid, delivered a speech to a large congregation of citizens. Unusually for such an event, it was broadcasted over the radio and live over television.\n\nHis Eminency spoke first of the power of faith, of how a common religion can bind its believers in friendship, solely by the power of the cross. He spoke of union - as Iberia joined together, its people must also come together to work for a better country.\n\nHe addressed God's plan. Nothing happened just for the sake of happening. Rather, everything that happens was a part of God's greater plan, and so anyone who came on hard times had to have faith, for everything would work out in the end, as planned.\n\nGod, he says, put strong men on Earth to guide the weak, to serve as teachers, stewards, and mentors. These strong men are agents of God, and so it is His desire that the same faith be placed in them as is placed in Him. The Caudillos are some of these strong men, and so they must take absolute power. The country must have faith in them, he reiterates, for they will guide it in the correct direction.\n\nHe ended his sermon with a call for prayer. During the sudden silence, many were left to wonder just what this would all mean for Iberia. "

 IBR.5423.t:0 "Responses from Iberian Homes"
 IBR.5423.d:0 "It has not been very long, yet we have already received enough complaints and responses about our new policies that we cannot count them all in a short time. However, it was easy enough to take a small sample of complaints and interpret them instead. If they are at all representative, then our new policies are unanimously disliked.\n\nPeople do not appreciate our austerity measures. Given our status as a rich, western country, in this day in age it is unfathomable to most that they might need to use candles instead of other sources of fuel. They do not understand the value of oil, and want to keep wasting it away. We could divert some oil to civilian usage, which would alleviate most of these complaints for a time. However, we do not have much oil to spare, so we must decide whether using some of what little we have is worth getting people to shut up."

 IBR.5424.t:0 "Problems with Food Distribution"
 IBR.5424.d:0 "We have gotten people to cook less. It took shipments of food that do not require cooking to the areas around the country, but we have managed to mostly wean people off of food that needs oil. We have drafted a plan, detailing how to feed the country. There are regular food shipments, of fixed amounts, to areas around the country. We do not send more, and we do not send less. So far, it seems to have worked.\n\nSome of the rural areas are complaining that they do not get enough food delivered to eat. They say that our shipments were not enough to distribute, so some have gone hungry. While it is possible that we miscalculated the shipment amounts, it is infinitely more possible that they have not yet learned to ration. Everyone in this country was instructed to eat what was necessary, and perhaps the issue is that they are eating more than their fill?"

 IBR.5425.t:0 "The Pains of Virtue"
 IBR.5425.d:0 "The people of Iberia ought to see the silver lining in their situation. A time like this is absolutely perfect to devote themselves to their faith. With the perfect circumstances to fast, and keep along with one another in monklike contemplation, there is no time like the present to truly follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Surely, they would be closer to God if they followed an ascetic lifestyle like Jesus Christ.\n\nHowever, it seems that people have refused to accept this opportunity for religion. According to reports, a growing number of citizens have grown displeased with austerity. Yet more complaints still have come in about the daily lives of many politicians, who have neglected the burdens of faith for proper political aptitude. Why should we compromise, when the souls of Iberians are at stake? Perhaps, this time, the soul of Iberia is at stake too..."

 IBR.5426.d:0 "A new atmosphere had come over Iberia. Where the oil crisis once created uncertainty, there now lies another emotion. Slowly, the collective wonderings of what was to become of the country faded, replaced by a growing resentment of what had become of the country.\n\nHorses plodded through the streets, as burnt wax and hunger returned to Iberia. They were a modern country, right? If they were, then why did they need to regress to such horrid depths? This resentment grew into anger, once they beheld the lives of their betters. The politicians and the generals still lived lavish lifestyles, as if they had stolen all of the people's goods to use for their own. From this anger, Iberia began to decay.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the situation degraded. Terror attacks grew more constant, shielded from retribution by a populace with nothing left to lose. Tensions between the government and the people grew, the perceived injustice too great to bear. Society is ripping itself apart, and it will only take one strong shock to send the entire country tumbling down."

It's become clear that the effects of the Oil Crisis will be felt in Iberia for some time to come, as we are in the midst of a slow recovery. While spokesmen say that the economy is recovering from the lows of the Crisis, the skyrocketing unemployment rate, and the astronomical price of gas shows that there will be more pain in store for Iberia. The price of oil is still stubbornly high, which will retard our efforts for economic growth and prosperity for a very long time to come. Economists are already speaking of slow growth, perhaps even a recession due to the government's failed plans and lacklustre initiative.

Not even the steadfast bakers or milkmen had started their gruelling shifts when a small group of blackclad figures descended upon the quiet streets. Their efforts would spell a very different morning for the generally peaceful townspeople.\n\nAlong the stark granite walls of the police station and mayoral office a message of defiance was painted in a horrifying shade of red, a message to be received all around the Union. News of it quickly made its way up the large chain of bureaucracy that defined the Iberian government and landed right in the hands of the security apparatus of the AAS.\n\nElsewhere, similar messages had also begun to appear, whether graffiti, sloppily designed posters or other illicit publications. One thing was certain, a wildfire had been set, with opposition to the regime becoming visible on the streets and walls of Iberia. While some within the Axencia little more than youthful delinquency in the propaganda, others see a dangerous movement in need of stamping out."

The teenagers, both believed to be of the age of 14, were immediately apprehended at the scene to be taken in for further questioning.

With a quick pause and steady breath he opened them to the unwelcome greeting of harsh camera flashes and unintelligible questions. Raising his hand to try to soften the din he went over the message he had to relay again, already gritting his teeth in anticipation of what was to follow.\n\nThe tragic death of the two youths who had vandalized the AAS Station in Bilbao only to be arrested immediately on the scene was a travesty. Local police had been due to transfer the delinquents into custody to await trial only to find both had died under mysterious circumstances while being detained by AAS agents. Without having the full consequences in consideration the transferring officers had contacted the family of the deceased soon after.

Letting her eyes flit momentarily onto her guide just behind her she was again taken aback by how innocent and normal these people looked. He could have maybe been a school teacher, likely actually was; academia was starting to be filled with these people. The pair stopped at the heavy door blocking the view of what sounded like a relatively large meeting room, larger than what you would expect to find under a regular storefront. Without further thought the undercover AAS agent let herself in.\n\nWith this extremely fortunate infiltration of a large anarchist CNT terrorist group the government security agency has been able to finally map out further plans of revolt and also gain insight into their high morale.

The profusely sweating and overweight leader of the small group rushed in almost 10 minutes late, excusing himself with hushed whispers about how dangerous it was these days and the extra precautions he had to take. At the sight of this walking disaster the security man let his cover slip for just a brief instance, smirking with glee, only to resume his half bored normal state. His reports in recent weeks had been enlightening to the agency. The state of the CNT had been heavily affected by the news of the decisive defeat in Barcelona, recruitment was at an all time low and the situation within active cells was not much better.

Yet this was not a parade, nor a military march; were you to listen closely to the deafening cacophony of these proud Portuguese you would realize that this in fact was a strong statement of resistance. Incessant shouts of 'long live the Republic' and 'remember the last union' erupted every few minutes to the great dismay of state press that had gathered along the cordoned off sides of the protest.\n\nThe Portuguese will not tolerate subordination in a union originally formed out of desperation. Franco's iron fist likely will neither help quell nor hinder their capacity of opposition. In fact it may even bring rise to something else entirely. With other separatist action also springing up around the country the stability of the union is at threat on a fundamental level if reform is not enacted quickly and effectively. "

We therefore have to sort this situation with minimal press coverage and wider government interference.

An elderly man who lived in a rather rundown apartment block on the outside of the city had seen multiple suspicious looking men enter the rooms next door and heard them shout and sing rather incriminating things throughout the space of a week. With due diligence he had informed local authorities who quickly came to the scene to discover the group had been plotting an attack in the city center.

Finally the call was given and he watched them storm in, hearing the faint noises of panicked shouting mixed in with a few silenced shots over the radio and across the street. After 5 minutes the street went silent again.\n\nThe successful AAS raid on an earlier infiltrated CNT terrorist cell has brought great spoils, both in terms of information obtained after interrogation and material loot.

Yet now  signs show an increase in leftist organisational and political activity, coalescing around the demand for an independent and socialist Portugal. The forces of the Portguese left seem to be abandoning their differences and uniting across ideological and party lines, something that the Spanish left was not able to do truly 20 years ago during the Spanish Civil War. A single name and banner has been appearing around the cities in the form of anti-Iberian posters and other propaganda: The FSLP, the Socialist Front of Portugese Liberation.

Rooting out this dangerous disease is however proving to be less of a simple operation and rather a self perpetuating cycle of reciminiations and violence.\n\nSecurity agents in Asturias have uncovered a particularly bizarre phenomenon. It seems that the growth of armed separatist groups has not simply been a product of Iberia's tumultuous political situation, yet had been spurred on by the arrival of more and more illegal arms shipments at Asturian ports, divied up to support small local groups as well as those further across the nation. Interrogation of the smugglers has so far failed to reveal much more about the situation, though it seems increasingly obvious that outside forces are helping spur on the speratist radicalism inside our borders.

Agency performance is down, and reports have gotten progressively less detailed as the whole organization seems to be sputtering to a standstill. At least they have for the most part been attending to an adequate number of separatists, and are generally passable enough to let be.\n\nThat is, until distressing alerts as to the true function of the department surfaced. The whistleblower is very anonymous, and the information traveled through very tight channels to make sure it was not intercepted. The levelled allegations are very serious, of extreme corruption, rampant nepotism, and a system designed to keep it all from leaking out. The most disturbing implication of all was the suggestion that some reports are faked, meaning the Axencia is not as effective as hoped.\n\nThis is clearly a very serious issue, and making sure it is resolved - if there is something to resolve - will be a high priority. The first question is where to start; there are many facets to the Axencia, and only one can have sustained scrutiny. It may be the fault of a horrible administrative class, which cares only for their own pockets. The military cannot be ruled out, however, as they have very close ties with the organization. No matter where the corruption might be most concentrated, if the rumors are true then both parties will share some level of blame. The investigation has to be very careful.

Much of the evidence is not totally verifiable, but enough circumstantial pieces of evidence have come together to make much more than a coincidence. There is clearly something afoot, even if it is not as bad as accused.\n\nThis is something to be taken very seriously. If we take the wrong steps, then it could very well happen that any leads we could have will be squandered under the boot of a corrupt official, covered up and prevented from reaching the higher-ups eyes, one way or another. More investigation is needed, and it needs to be determined where this investigation will be directed. It could be put towards the bureaucrats directly, using force and coercion to force the information out of them. This could go badly, but it has the best promise of results.

To this end, a route of investigation is necessary. Every option needs to be carefully considered, or else any chance at reform will slip out from under us. The general staff responsible could be directly interrogated, and if they do not clam up could prove a valuable source of information.

There wasn't enough between him and his benefactor to keep all hell from breaking loose on him if he slipped, so he had to make sure he was kept safe... or that his higher-ups had a brick wall around them. With this in mind, he found a thread in his mind, and began to spin a yarn for his captor audience.\n\nMany critical details have been gained from the interrogation of bureaucrats involved for certain with the case. While what brought them to a confession is uncertain, what is known is the damning length the entire case has within the Axencia.

How they knew, the soldier didn't know. What he noticed was how, in their endless droning and questioning, one of the interrogators mentioned leniency. It wouldn't be hard to strike up a deal, and how so much of this could go away if he complied. With a choice like that, the soldier knew what he had to do.\n\nInterrogations have revealed a shocking connection.

Therefore, something needs to be done.\n\nThe first question on the long road to reform is what to do with the corrupt officers in question. They may be liable to a deal, and if proper force is put behind the offers then they may become compliant once more.

Between the two unquestionable fields was an endless number of conditions, terms, and other minutiae that bureaucrats were so good at forcing into the spotlight, choking anything of necessity with minor detail after another.\n\nPitted against such resilient enemies, the Caudillo was tested in a way he hadn't been for a long time. No men were to die today, but words fought and killed just as well in their place. Finally, after the product of many hours work, a deal was created, agreed upon by both Franco and the officials he wrestled tongues with.

When pressed on why they were able to give no end of justifications, the most common of which was their views on other departments. They did not ever get terms like this, they argued, so there was no reason for the Axencia to get them either. For every term they were able to find a similar argument, of how no other organization ever got a deal of this sort.\n\nIt took every part of Franco's persuasive ability to stop them from walking away entirely with their ill-gotten gains. The bureaucrats were unresponsive to a deal, and to even slightly interest them it was required to budge on many terms. It is likely impossible we will get a good deal out of them, but the Caudillo will put up a strong showing regardless. Strong enough, as it happens, to attempt to compromise on many of the issues.

His persuasive acumen is one to be admired, however, and managed to salvage the best out of a less-than-ideal situation. Engaged in a contest of words, each side presented issues and tried to split down the middle until they found something to both their satisfactions.\n\nThe end result was the birth of a deal, created not to satisfy both camps but to make both the bureaucrats and Franco agree. It bound the Axencia bureaucrats, if only slightly, but did not stop them to nearly the degree that was intended. Even so, they still appear to be following the compromises laid out, and to that end they have kept the bargain they struck. "

At first, it was just gear, weaponry, and all sorts of equipment made for the military, put to use in a conflict more relevant than nearly any other. The general staff began to request for joint programs with the Axencia, in order to "better teach them how to use what they were given." Tentatively accepted at first, these programs have grown to become a central pillar of the growing agency.\n\nThese programs have proven the suspicions of their skeptics right. When cautioned against, the corruption threatened by cooperation was typically a central argument. More and more money has been thrown into the fire for the sake of better integration, while it was put into the pockets of those leading it.

For a long while, these programs were a massive money sink, with money being constantly siphoned out by corrupt bureaucrats. With recent circumstances, it seems that the decision to intervene and keep it around in spite of that was a wise idea.\n\nAxencia operatives have grown better equipped by orders of magnitude, and military equipment that was once rarely seen except with privileged agents is now commonplace. They have demonstrated adept knowledge on the operation of the equipment, and the reports show a large increase in captured separatists. On top of all this, the program's costs have decreased from their extortionate levels to costs that are not only reasonable, but even cheaper than expected.

This, too, was a very good sign.\n\nIt should be no secret, then, that the Axencia has become a hawk watching over Iberia. Known criminal hubs have been busted, leaving almost none to ever escape. Double agents and informants have ripped up the terror information networks, able to throw even the most clandestine of the groups to the wayside. New hubs, safehouses, and resource routes have been raided, detaining all within. Information extraction efforts have skyrocketed in quality, bring news of networks we weren't even aware could exist.

In hindsight, this was a terrible idea.\n\nAlways considered a 'black hole' of money, where funds would go in and never be heard from or mentioned again, the joint programs were hoped to have improved through Franco's deals. This was not the case. The partnership is nearly identical to the way it was before, where funding would go in, and nothing would come out. There has been nearly nothing tangible to come out of the equipment transfer or the training programs, and when pressed it would always require more funding, or more time, or some other similar excuse.

While it's certain to resolve the problem quickly, it could leave a hole that would be difficult to fill quickly. What will the plan be?"

This is particularly true for the Axencia, for whom corruption is a serious affair - the likes of which could mean the life or death of Iberia. The military is much the same way, in that allowing just one bad apple to act out could mean the destruction of the country. When the Axencia-military partnership was at its most corrupt, bureaucrats and army officers alike siphoned off resources by the truck full for their own gain.\n\nThere is no question as to their punishment. Corruption is a very serious matter, and will be handled accordingly. What is in question, however, is who is to receive the punishment. A safe option would be to prosecute those directly involved with the conspiracy, and whose participation could be easily verified. This would not make as much of a stir. Of course, this would mean not removing their corrupt superiors with them. These generals are those who allowed this to continue on in the first place, and so are equally as guilty. Risk is significant here, as the targeted generals will surely cause a stir large enough to make the benefit of their termination worth the effort. How extensively will punishment be applied?"

Performance has been at an all-time low, morale has taken a nosedive, and no matter how much is allocated to them it simply isn't enough to effectively foil separatists. Whenever an audit into the department occurs, it usually is shot down or given conspicuously conclusive results in a short time. No matter what steps are taken at the lower levels to make the department operational, nothing seems to have a permanent effect. Therefore, the lower levels are not the ones to target.\n\nIn order for Iberia to survive, something has to be done with the Axencia. It is obvious that corruption in some form is present in the upper echelons of the agency, evidenced by the lack of effectiveness of reforms. These upper levels will need to be curtailed. The only question is, how? It has been suggested to increase oversight of these critical roles, as to prevent them from getting away as much. Of course, this could just be subverted too, but there is always the chance it won't be.\n\nA more radical solution has been proposed too, and it calls for something far greater than just oversight. This radical suggestion is to completely restructure the Axencia, and sweep the rug out from the suspected criminals. While much higher risk, it is also higher reward. Even though the dislodging of the old guard will be extremely unpopular, it could provide just the opportunity needed to bring lasting change."

Where warmth and joviality towards the regime once stood, now one could only find a polite, cordial attitude evidencing stronger feelings. This attitude was the strongest among those in higher sections of politics, who presumably took the sweeping changes to the Axencia as a threat- a threat to their prosperity. There was no celebration among them.\n\nNor was the Axencia particularly celebratory, at first. This demeanor took a change for the positive - especially with the ground agents - as they found themselves with larger stores of resources, improved intelligence, and far sounder ideas. The new bureaucrats, fresh to the positions shaken up by recent reforms, were grateful for larger budgets. Nobody among their elder management was happy, but many of them were replaced by enthused young prospects until the rest took the hint and began to smile, even as they were given the whip.\n\nFranco had made the enemy of a large segment of the older guard of his administration, as they all saw the reforms and removals to happen to their cliques and niches too. In the end it was worth the grumbling for the Axencia has broken their records for productivity and have been able to much more with the same. There may just be the beginnings of an agency prepared to tackle terrorism, and the future is only looking up."

If our suspicions are correct, then it will be only a trifle to extract the conspiracy from its veil of secrecy. However, what if they aren't the masterminds? As soldiers are only the arm of the military that carries out plans, and the generals conceive them, then it is also possible that the bureaucrats are only the soldiers in a war of deception.

The plan was simple: get these people to slip up, and use that to crush anyone who did. One at a time, every issue the Axencia was facing would be presented, and eventually it was all to be tied in to corruption. Reactions would be monitored, and those that seemed to recognize the plans would be forcibly removed. The bait was set, and all that remained was to see if any would take it.\n\nFranco was seated, and with practiced confidence he placed an open manila folder on the table, full of paperwork only half secured within it.\n"...and this, gentlemen, is what I believe the cause of our woes is." All around the room, gasps and almost comical inhales of shock deprived much of the room of itx oxygen.

Pointed questions, almost loaded yes-or-no inquiries shrugged off by the questioned, leaving a sour taste in the mouth of the investigators with nothing to show for their frustrations. The most direct requests, such as basic records, sidestepped or subverted, except for when they were stopped entirely. Never before had documentation gone missing in such vast quantities, a record the Axencia was sure to soon break.\n\nGiven the resistance to investigation efforts, the hopes of anything fruitful being found is dashed. Our chances of success are rapidly dwindling, and with them go the goodwill of the administrative cliques. The higher ups presented this line of reasoning when questioned on the progress of the search for corruption, and wish to change pace in order to find something in another field.

Manuel had never kept a secret like this in his life and it was only a matter of time until he slipped up. If he went down, then so would everyone else, and he had no doubts that they would drag him down with them.\n\nHours pass, and he's never pulled aside for a 'quick question, never tapped on the shoulder and requested to 'satiate some curiosities'. He pulls open a drawer on his desk, and views the paperwork. That damned paperwork, putting this here and that there. It was going to be the death of him.\n"Manuel?" He stiffened. Slowly the drawer slid closed, and he turned around very slowly, as if pretending nothing would be there would make it all go away.

Police could storm the plane at any moment, and drag him out with tears in his eyes and shackles on his hands. It was only once he was in the air that he felt truly safe, and the pull of sleep gradually replaced all his stress.\n\nAfter their location, several suspects who had been key to the investigation have fled the country. It seems that our renewed audit was at fault for driving them off, and as they make their exodus to other countries the chances of getting any conclusive evidence rapidly drops to zero.

Without that leverage, nothing could be done.\n\nEven though there seems to have been at least some moderation to it all, things have barely changed. The Axencia is a black hole of resources, and has proven immune to anything trying to change that.

When the authorities went to arrest those involved, they found that they could not, as they did not have any proof as to work with. When the issue of reform was left to the department itself, promises and assurances made way to nothing at all.\n\nWithout anything to moderate the filth of the department, it has certainly changed - for the worse. Resources go unused as much as they are stolen, and with their equipment the best agent could struggle to catch even a petty thief. Everyone has noticed this, and the Axencia has become the butt of countless jokes by the public. Even worse, seperatist organizations have taken this as their opportunity to run rampant, and with the Axencia's state it cannot hope to stop them. It is all because of Franco that it did not improve, and so he must approve of it. Many are displeased, most of all the upper echelons of government, that this was what he would call a department. "

Presenting records showing a much cleaner record than suspected, they conceded that there were some small inefficiencies, but nothing of the sort which was being leveled against them. As well, they also called the legitimacy of the accuser into question, stating that an agent with 'something to hide' probably did not have genuine allegations.

Two methods have been determined, and each is roughly equal to one another, so a final authority is needed to decide between them.\n\nThe first method is to just take a group and bluntly inform them of what we want from them. We will lay out the allegations, present the evidence, remind them of the consequences of this crime, and how they may receive amnesty if they cooperate. While it runs the risk of galvanizing those interrogated into not speaking, by reminding them of the consequences, some may be more inclined to cooperate.\n\nThe second option is to attempt a more subversive strategy, and instead of just asking directly to instead deceive the accused. We may get what we want out of them by using false circumstances, and luring them into making a mistake.

It was full of documents, photos, and even a testimony.\n"You are involved in a corruption scandal, and you know it, and we know it too. Why not give yourself up now?" Examining the reaction on the bureaucrat's face was enough. He had him. "Besides, I'm sure you know what happens to enemies of the state... Unless, of course, you cooperate. I'm a very reasonable man, and I can tell you don't want to have a bad end."\n\n"Okay, okay! For amnesty, I'll tell you. What do you want to know?"\n\nMost denied their involvement outright, but when faced with the proof that showed their involvement without a shadow of a doubt, some changed their tune.

Something will need to be used to justify the lure, and for that we will need to come up with a pretense.\n\nSince there is a routinely scheduled inspection coming up, it would be possible to replace the usual corrupt, ineffectual administrators that man it with loyal agents, who would interrogate bureaucrats about the minutiae of daily operations in the Axencia. No-one would know any better, and since it is only a small modification to what they are used to, they may still answer honestly - as it was already set up so that they do not compromise any of the information we need to know. Some may not fall for it, but others certainly will.\n\nAlternatively, though it may cost much more, would be to set up a celebration to commemorate their successes. This could be used as a front to ask them compromising questions, and for the promise of money they will certainly fall for it.

So he did, and his name was drawn. He was escorted off to a side room by a clerk, who held up a check, for an immense sum of money.\n\n"So, I heard you were good at keeping up with your work.

Though he still kept the ruse up for a while, he was so fixated on the bonus that he wasn't entirely aware of when he went through the less legal sides of his daily work, nor did his interviewer care to alert him.

For the most part, the money crossed hands under the table, from governmental coffers, to the unhelpful clerks.

Alternative methods need to be applied, and the only question is what kind.\n\nThere are very many obvious suspects, of whom have dubious track records and a less-than-stellar character. The common link between them is that most are involved in the Axencia-military joint programs. It would make sense to investigate them primarily, for if anyone were to want to leech off a government program, it would definitely be them.

 IBR.5563.t:0 "An Official Steps Forward"
 IBR.5563.d:0 "Shocking news! While we have been waiting for more information to be uncovered by our investigation, some of that same evidence has instead come to us. An official, of a mid-tier position, has approached us with information. He claims to be critical to the entire scheme, and his information could be used to help further the case against them.\n\nWhen he was pressed on his credentials, he offered a leak that he requested be verified. As it turns out, it was correct, and so he became a new informant. He had two simple requests in exchange for working with us: that his identity be kept anonymous, lest someone carry out a reprisal against him, and for a pardon for his crimes. He swears off participating any further than he needs to from here on out, and assures us that the information will be worth the pardon. With every passing day, the case built against the military grows larger and ever-more complex."
 IBR.5563.a:0 "Then he will be pardoned... so long as we get good information."
 
 IBR.5564.t:0 "The Pressure Auments"
 IBR.5564.d:0 "Though the worst of the joint programs are, as a whole, aloof and uncompromising, a new development has occurred. Nothing is free from pressure, and everything is liable to break in the face of enough of it. This is a phenomena we observed with the suspected joint programs - codenamed 'The Rots' for ease of recollection - in which they have finally buckled and burst from the weight of pressure. For quite some time, accusations have been building up against many of them, with most pointing the finger at nearly all of them combined.\n\nInformation and allegations have come from all sides. Some are from disgruntled former employees, others from the wronged seeking comeuppance. At least one, as not all of them describe their relationship, was of a current employee knowing he will be caught, and offering evidence for a pardon. Even though they have been entirely unresponsive to these, their build-up has finally caused The Rots to crack. They have admitted to some wrongdoing, and to that end will be willing to make some concessions in exchange for terms that are 'yet to be negotiated'. We have brought them to the negotiating table."
 IBR.5564.a:0 "Even Atlas can be crushed, if you put enough on his shoulders."
 
 IBR.5565.t:0 "A Weak Deal on Joint Programs"
 IBR.5565.d:0 "Regardless of his situation, Franco has brought his targets to the negotiation table, and has put his bargaining skills to the test against some of the most corrupt and greedy of the lot. He knew what they wanted, and it was money -  and lots of it. They knew what Franco wanted, a cessation to their illegal activities, the sort of which turned a great profit. Both were willing to make some concessions to their goals, but for the most part they were irreconcilable. One should never say they didn't try, however, as both were aware some sort of deal was necessary, and they tugged it towards their favor.\n\nDealmaking and speech were put to the test. It was a duel of words, and were it physical it would have gone down in history as one of the greatest battles to be fought. Its duration was of a similar stature, taking several hours before a final arrangement was reached.\n\nNo matter how hard he had tried, the Caudillo simply did not have the upper hand in this session of Iberian Negotiations - that is, glorified arguing. Faced with a group willing to make some concessions but not many, and on a base that was only questionably solid, he simply was not able to subdue his targets. The end result was something that could be considered weak, stopping the worst of the worst but hardly even touching on the rest."
 IBR.5565.a:0 "Things didn't go quite as planned. So what? It could've been worse."
 
 IBR.5566.t:0 "Documents Point Towards Policía Armada"
 IBR.5566.d:0 "Some of the suspects were more cooperative than others. The first brought in for questioning refused to answer questions, no matter how badly coercion attempts pried him, and instead redirected towards another one of his co-workers. The second man brought in for questioning followed a similar routine. Many of the suspects were exhausted, with nothing to show for it but a constant chain of referrals. When the first day of questioning ended, there was still nothing to be found for results.\n\nA few hours later, a suspect finally broke. In almost exaggerated fits of tears, he described that he knew where some evidence could be, and that he had some paperwork he thought would help. All he wanted was to be spared, and to go home to his family. He directed the location of these documents to his interrogators, hidden in his office, in a very particular location. A few men were set out to find these documents, and verify their legitimacy. Unfortunately, what they found was very worrying.\n\nThe documents uncovered were very explicit, and the information they contained was damning. There were certainly money transfers happening, the volume of which matched the funding reported missing by other clerks. When examining these documents, a surprise had come up - the money had been routed through another department to wherever it had gone. This department was the Policía Armada! Out of every group, this one was certainly the one we suspected least. Something needs to be done immediately."
 IBR.5566.a:0 "Confront them, now!"
 
 IBR.5567.t:0 "Policía Armada Denies Claims"
 IBR.5567.d:0 "As expected, the Policía Armada leadership reacted with shock and confusion to our accusations. Every guilty party does this, whether it be genuine reactions to their conspiracy being discovered, or just false emotions to tug at the heartstrings of their prosecutors. Even though they were probably dishonest about their reasoning, it has been said that the documents we presented them with are fabricated!\n\nWe have no reason to believe their claims, as the legitimacy seems bulletproof, even if the document itself isn't. Regardless, in our zeal to end the investigation it does not seem like we evaluated our evidence, and so it would be a sound idea to do so. There are some very particular quirks about the Policía Armada's documents that prove them to be very unique. More than once this has foiled forgers, and so it would be a good idea to check them with someone who is able to evaluate them properly. There are many loyal bureaucrats, and their word may be trusted on the matter."
 IBR.5567.a:0 "What are you waiting for? Call them up!"
 
 IBR.5568.t:0 "Allegations Proven to be False"
 IBR.5568.d:0 "The test results from our loyal agents have come in. They have carefully checked each seal, design, and pattern on the document to analyze it for abnormalities. As it turns out, they found some. A lot of them. Though there is some tolerance for a few errors, to account for printing defects, there are far too many for this to be a simple printing error. Our documents have been forged! None of them are true.\n\nThe Policía Armada has been cleared of their crimes, and issued a sincere apology for misunderstanding their involvement in the situation. The shock and confusion was legitimate after all. While they are also probably corrupt, they are for sure not involved in this particular case. We were played for fools by those corrupt bureaucrats! In hindsight, we shouldn't have been so ready to trust their scheming members. There is only one thing we can do to make up for it now, and it is to find those original documents and investigate them. Their crimes will not go unpunished!"
 IBR.5568.a:0 "You know your targets, you know where to find them. Go on!"
 
 IBR.5569.t:0 "A Trail Run Cold"
 IBR.5569.d:0 "It took several days to run tests, investigate, and ultimately invalidate our supposed 'shocking evidence'. During that time, we were none the wiser as to the doings of the first corruption suspects. The frenzy was too caught up on prosecuting the Policía for their current crimes and returning to the first bunch later to keep so much as basic tabs on them. We have had nothing on them since.\n\nIt was reasoned that the bureaucrats, if they had plans to create false documents, were for sure guilty. Because of that guilt, it wasn't unreasonable to assume they had the real documents somewhere. If that evidence could be found, then there would be a bust like no other, and there would be wrath the likes of which could rival what was delivered to separatists and other terrorists. All that would take was the proof, and so the proof was what they scoured for.\n\nHomes, offices, personal accessories, nothing was spared the combing of a lifetime. Nowhere was spared, and none of the locations searched had the documents. Even with a triple check, they were nowhere to be found. It seems that there will be no finding them. Given the time it took to complete the investigation into the Policía, they probably destroyed the documents at the time. If we had kept surveillance on them, then it could have been stopped before it happened. Without that paperwork, there was no evidence, and with no evidence there could be no purge."
 IBR.5569.a:0 "Please, tell me you're joking!..."
 
 IBR.5570.t:0 "An Unlikely Voice Speaks Up"
 IBR.5570.d:0 "After we expanded the scope of our investigation into the military, the investigators were unsure how quickly we were going to find something of interest. With how much time it took, there clearly wasn't much to find. Just as they were preparing to give up and focus elsewhere, someone has gotten in contact with them. What they heard next made up for all of the waiting ten times over.\n\nIdentifying himself as an anonymous agent within the Axencia, he had noticed that we were investigating the Axencia-military partnership. As he himself was closely working in that partnership, he had quite a few things to say. There was talk of corruption, bribery, and all-around unprofessionalism from within the joint programs, elaborating on these issues in such a way that left nothing to imagination. Nothing could be doubted: This man was associated, and his allegations said nothing good about the whole affair.\n\nWe could raise this issue with the military officers, who could take a decisive stance to force this issue to closure, but this isn't without risk. If the officers are involved, then they may just dismiss the claims outright and stop our leaker from speaking any more. If we wish to do this instead of allowing the evidence to pile up to an overwhelming level, then it is done taking the chance that they are compromised."
 IBR.5570.a:0 "Raise the issue to higher ups in the military"
 IBR.5570.b:0 "This is too risky..."
 
 IBR.5571.t:0 "Military Higher-ups Reject Claims"
 IBR.5571.d:0 "The allegations were provided to the generals presiding over the military, with proof to back it up. They were instructed to consult their records, and themselves, to see if anything of the sort was true. If it was, then it was to be fixed and the steps taken described. If not, then they were to prove they were not true. They were given three days to respond.\n\nMuch than quicker than three days, they bit back with a flat-out rejection of the claims, and called their validity into question. Presenting records showing a much cleaner record than suspected, they conceded that there were some small inefficiencies, but nothing of the sort which was being leveled against them. As well, they also called the legitimacy of the accuser into question, stating that an agent with 'something to hide' probably did not have genuine allegations. Finally, it was added that, while they were always free for further inquiries, it was requested that they be actual inquiries, since these took large amounts of time and effort."
 IBR.5571.a:0 "Bah! How honest are they really..."
 
 IBR.5572.t:0 "Where in the Armed Forces to Look?"
 IBR.5572.d:0 "There is no mistaking the Iberian military as the pride of the country, and its size only serves to better make the case. It has many departments, subdivisions, and internal division, forming an almost byzantine level of bureaucracy and size. As we are investigating corruption, we must be expedient. There is no time to waste wading through red tape, and there is no simply cutting it and moving on. We need to pick our targets carefully, though we have plenty to choose from.\n\nThe military is vast, but the targets are narrowed down by their relevance to the Axencia partnership. The obvious choice would be the Policía Armada,who is notorious for maintaining a fierce rivalry with the Axencia in the cutthroat political environment. Since they are so hostile, it could be reasoned that they both have incriminating information on one another. Taking this information and applying it could be a great boon to investigation efforts, and they would be glad to hand it over for the sake of a rivalry. Alternatively, there are the units who have partnered with the Axencia. Responsible for much of the equipment and all of the training, they are very closely associated with the agency. If anyone will have an idea on the corruption, it would be the groups working with them. Who will have the evidence we are searching for?"
 IBR.5572.a:0 "They have rivals in the Policía Armada who could help"
 IBR.5572.b:0 "The units tangential to the accused should know"
 
 IBR.5573.t:0 "Policía Armada Pledges Internal Investigation"
 IBR.5573.d:0 "When they were inquired about their documents, the Policía Armada were somewhat lethargic to respond, but seemed to grow much more spirited when it was mentioned that it was about the Axencia. They were even more eager still when it was brought up that the investigation was over Axencia corruption. Off the record, they were very willing to see if they had anything on the agency's corruption, especially if a bit more funding was in it.\n\nThe Policía Armada leadership pledged to commit to a thorough internal investigation and audit of all their documents, from start to finish. They were going to see if they had absolutely anything on the Axencia-military joint programs, and if they did they would share it with the government immediately. Since this is a total audit, it will probably take several weeks for them to finish. The department is remarkable for breaking records in efficiency for sorting through paperwork, and with such a motivator they will probably be even more efficient than normal. It should indicate the size of their bureaucracy that it will take them several weeks to fully evaluate all their reports and information. On the bright side, we can rest assured that they are certain to have something, as the odds are better than not that there is something hidden within their records."
 IBR.5573.a:0 "What will they find?"
 
 IBR.5574.t:0 "Documents Prove Corruption"
 IBR.5574.d:0 "It has only been a short while since the Policía Armada initiated their internal investigation. They have stated that, while it was much swifter than usual, the speed was due to their specific targeting. Their documents had been very well sorted, and so it was very easy to comb the relevant section to find what they wished to find. The rest is still ongoing, but they had found what we wished for them to locate. We would be informed if they come across anything else that was out of place.\n\nOn investigation and verification of the documents, the designs check out and do not appear to be forged documents. Going off of the information contained within the papers, our suspicions seem to be true. The Policía Armada had located the exact transaction, and it took just one look to see that something was off, and just one more to see what was being done wrong. With this information, we have the case we need, and all we need to do now is to act on it."
 IBR.5574.a:0 "Confront them!"
 
 IBR.5575.t:0 "Collaborating unit Provides Proof"
 IBR.5575.d:0 "After placing an inquiry with a unit closely involved with the training and equipping of Axencia operators, it seems we have a definitive lead. They were reluctant to oblige at first, not appearing to wish to so much as acknowledge our request. That is, until Franco himself ordered them to investigate the case. They answered our call very quickly following that, and said they would look right away for evidence. The unit's officers tripped over themselves to provide a vast amount of information, of which seemed legitimate enough at a cursory glance. They were also able to hand over the most valuable proof of all - financial records.\n\nThe Caudillo was quizzical, what would push them so far if they were otherwise unwilling? Again, they were very quick to respond: they were the military, and Francisco Franco was their Caudillo. Their loyalty to him was unquestionable, and they were pleased to show an opportunity to demonstrate it. If he needed anything else, they would be able to provide."
 IBR.5575.a:0 "How odd... but we will not complain."
 
 IBR.5576.t:0 "Confronting the Accused"
 IBR.5576.d:0 "The evidence was ready, prepared in totality for a meeting. Franco had ordered the investigation to commence, and he insisted that he would see it through to the final steps. Even though the initial reaction was downright derisive, the Caudillo was fully confident that the next time he brought it up it wouldn't be ignored. He had an ace up his sleeve - and it was evidence. Acquired by other means, the evidence was summarized and placed into a folder, creating the nail in the coffin of his rivals of negotiation. Countless testimonies, records, and especially the financial audits created the basis for this powerful document, and he was going to milk it for everything it was worth.\n\nFranco will not stop until he gets the terms he desires, harsh contracts designed to stop any more money siphoning from happening ever again. He will place every last bit of his persuasive ability in to make sure of it. The bait is already set, as the date marches closer to the meeting which will surely doom his opponents."
 IBR.5576.a:0 "Best of luck!"
 
 IBR.5577.t:0 "Policía Armada Documents Fabricated"
 IBR.5577.d:0 "The negotiation was going forward as anticipated. The generals were skeptical, despite the Caudillo's best attempts to convince them otherwise. They seemed impatient, so Franco played his master stroke, and slapped the folder full of Policía Armada findings on the table. It would be wonderful to see them recoil. Now he would wait for them to re-\n\n"Señor, you are aware these are fabricated documents, right? There is a man in the Policía that frequently does this. I can recognize his trademark anywhere, his statistics are always the same." To Franco's shock, the general spent the next few minutes utterly dismantling Franco's arguments, leaving him with nearly no ground to stand on. Even worse, he was slightly embarrassed by it all. Regardless, he was able to talk some way to something, with the generals conceding that something would be done to rein in corruption, but that the issue was nowhere near as bad.\n\nThe first thing the Caudillo did was order the particular bureaucrat - whose identity he had been informed of - executed. In hindsight, perhaps it wasn't a good idea to trust such quick findings. Total investigations take much longer, and that it was finished so quickly should have been a red flag. This should have been expected out of a department that despised the Axencia; for more resources these lackeys would do absolutely anything."
 IBR.5577.a:0 "Anything is much larger than we thought."
 
 IBR.5578.t:0 "Harsh Terms Accepted by Military"
 IBR.5578.d:0 "The negotiation was going forward as anticipated. The generals were skeptical, despite the Caudillo's best attempts to convince them otherwise. They seemed impatient, so Franco played his master stroke, and slapped the folder full of corroborated partnership information on the table. It would be wonderful to see them recoil. Now he would wait for them to react to the findings. Franco saw it as it happened - impatience turned to alertness, and from there to fear. It looks like this conspiracy was a bit deeper than he thought, and now in the best way possible.\n\nBy applying the threat of punishment, the Caudillo was able to ply a very advantageous deal with his generals, much harsher than what he had intended originally. The corrupt partnership programs would be adhering very strictly to this new policy, or else the generals in charge would be taking most of the punishment. After all, they would be the ones enforcing it. If they couldn't, then it would be their necks on the line. The Axencia-military partnership will not have any more issues regarding corruption."
 IBR.5578.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 IBR.5579.t:0 "Unit points finger at Policía Armada"
 IBR.5579.d:0 "In order to find the direction of the funding that seemed to disappear within the Axencia, it was opted to ask one of the units that worked with the program, whose corruption was liable to be less than the usual within the agency. Their response was sluggish, but when pressured by the Caudillo they finally gave a response. The leadership was certain they could find documents about what was wanted out of them, but it would take time.\n\nEventually they did present some evidence pointing us in another direction, as well as some testimony of their own. The Policía Armada and the Axencia had been nearly at war for a long time for resources, and so the former had decided to take budget from the latter. The money is being redirected through the Policía Armada, and into the pockets of their leadership and the officials who stand by it. There is no time to waste!"

 IBR.5580.t:0 "A Weak Deal on Joint Programs"
 IBR.5580.d:0 "While less than ideal, what we had was enough to at least get something done. Despite Franco's persuasive ability, there ultimately wasn't enough concrete evidence to effectively pin down his opponents. The Caudillo was never the sort of man to give up if he couldn't secure a total victory, so instead he opted to push for the next best thing - a slightly weaker deal.\n\nUsing what he had, Franco was capable of placing pressure on his suspects. It turned out to be enough to bring the criminals to skip the formalities. In exchange for their cooperation, they were given leniency, and put towards creating a larger case. That same larger case was enough to bring the real masterminds to heel, and a deal put in place to stop their efforts. It isn't perfect, full of compromise and middle ground, but it is better than just letting them run amok."
 IBR.5580.a:0 "Well, anything has to be better than what we're fixing."
 
 IBR.5581.t:0 "AAS Still Struggling"
 IBR.5581.d:0 "After an investigation into the Axencia's practices - and who or what was causing them - it seems like there was no reason to conduct it. The evidence found, if it was found, was frequently inconclusive and gave the appearance more of a taunt, as we had nothing concrete to work on. Since there was nothing but gut feelings to conduct business on, it follows that there was no business that we could conduct without an innocent being affected.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems our culprits feel the same way. Since we had no arrangement to bind the culprits, they were allowed to run free. Much of the worst has continued unabated, and separatists have taken advantage. There are certain runarounds to the system, and without a reform to patch them up they have grown better-known, and commonly exploited. Most terrorists now run circles around the Axencia, and the only silver lining is that they also seem to have grown complacent."
 IBR.5581.a:0 "What does it matter if nobody is willing to take advantage of their complacence?"
 
 IBR.5582.t:0 "AAS in Dire Straits"
 IBR.5582.d:0 "There is no end to the misfortune of the Caudillo! Nobody was able to be found to assign blame, not even a likely suspect. It was the perfect crime - and the Axencia was the perfect victim. No examples could be made, regulations were undercut, and in the end nobody took the fault for their actions.\n\nWe cannot apprehend ghosts, and what we have brings our culprits to just that: ghosts. Without so much as a stray intern to put up to the firing line the suspects have no reason to stop what they're doing. We know they are in the joint programs, and somewhere within there are our suspects. They have grown wary of our audits, and the chance to apprehend them has passed. Things are deteriorating quickly and it's only going to get worse from here..."
 IBR.5582.a:0 "How much is it going to get worse? I'd have thought we've already hit rock bottom."
 
 IBR.5583.t:0 "Franco's AAS, a Public Mockery"
 IBR.5583.d:0 "In many ways, it has turned out the Axencia is remarkably similar to the military. If you were to place them together, they would seem the same in every way that counted - that is, they are both as corrupt and nepotistic as one another. Ranks are filled with the friends of those above them, money exchanges hands freely, and the situation has devolved into something horrific. It has become a saying that you cannot get anywhere in the department without a loose wallet, and the encouragement for being promoted has become the ability to eke a bit more out of your underlings. Cliques are commonplace.\n\nFunding goes in, and undoubtedly mostly goes to the pockets of the corrupt. Agents are poorly trained and have access to even worse equipment. The terrorists of Iberia cheer, for now they can work nearly unimpeded. The public groan, for now they have to work with an agency clawing and striking blindly in an attempt to justify its presence. Franco's role in the whole affair isn't forgotten either - he was the cause of it all, and many know it."

 IBR.5584.d:0 "Some time has passed, and in that period even more evidence has come out as to the actual day-to-day operations of the Axencia. Waiting time between the shreds has been long and excruciating but as time progressed they became more and more substantial. Now, there is a case to be made. Much of the evidence is not totally verifiable, but enough circumstantial pieces of evidence have come together to make much more than a coincidence. There is clearly something afoot, even if it is not as bad as accused.\n\nThis is something to be taken very seriously. If we take the wrong steps, then it could very well happen that any leads we could have will be squandered under the boot of a corrupt official, covered up and prevented from reaching the higher-ups eyes, one way or another. More investigation is needed, and it needs to be determined where this investigation will be directed. It was suggested to put it towards the bureaucrats directly, using force and coercion to force the information out of them. This path is sadly untenable with the political situation as it is, despite the possibility of great results. More subversive methods will have to be applied to glean information from suspects, a strategy that will have to be handed with tenderness."

 IBR.5585.d:0 "With further scrutiny on the programs between the Axencia and the military, the absent documents have been discovered. In a string of connected discoveries, much more evidence - albeit circumstantial in nature - has been revealed. All of these coincidences add up to a near-certainty, and the documents, involving payment and financial management, only make the case even worse. Something has to be done.\n\nThe odds are that the case isn't as deep as expected, but in the off chance that it is worse then it needs to be properly examined. To this end, a route of investigation is necessary. Every option needs to be carefully considered, or else any chance at reform will slip out from under us. The general staff responsible could be directly interrogated, but the current political climate of the Iberian leadership would not allow such bold action. With coercion off the table, we could try simple questioning tactics, and use underhanded strategies to slip a confession out of someone."

 IBR.5700.d:0 "Today in Madrid, thousands of farmers have joined in protest on the streets outside of the Iberian Council chambers for a third straight day. The issue that joins these farmers in protest is a recent announcement by Caudillo Franco, detailing government plans to ease and lift tariffs on all economic sectors. The government states that the continual abolishment of tariffs will encourage the international market to engage with Iberia, and will spur international investment into the Iberian economy over the long term. The farmers, however, remain unconvinced.\n\nFurthermore, the farmers are not alone in their protest. Many employees from the manufacturing industries have also turned up to express their displeasure with the removal of tariffs, arguing that the influx of cheaper foreign imported goods will force Iberian industries to make layoffs, and might even entice local industries to emigrate."The Caudillos put my livelihood at risk. My family has for eight generations survived off our humble farm. But now, cheap, imported, tariff-free foods will soon flood the store shelves. How are we to compete when I can hardly sell my produce?" questioned Reyes Gallego. He inherited his family farm just outside of Madrid two decades ago, but like many Iberian farmers in recent months, he has been struggling to make ends meet. With Iberian consumers likely to prefer the cheaper, imported goods in stores, many farmers such as Mr Gallego question how they will remain afloat.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to make any comment on the protests as liberalization measures continue to be passed. Government spokespersons have, however, stated that the Iberian administration remains enthusiastic about the economic opportunities that will be presented with increased liberalization."

 IBR.5701.t:0 "Mass Layoffs Cause Unrest"
 IBR.5701.d:0 "Demonstrations in cities across Iberia endure, as tens of thousands of unemployed workers take to the streets across Iberia. Following radical liberalization policies, favoured by the Opus Dei and technocrats within the Iberian Council, many manufacturers have laid off their workers, citing an inability to compete with the influx of tariff-free foreign goods. As the demonstrations continue to grow in size as well as in intensity, violence has become inevitable. Last night in Barcelona, altercations between protesters and police escalated. Following several hours of clashes, the city of Barcelona reports that 7 police officers were injured as well 58 protestors, with one police officer currently in critical condition.\n\nAs unemployment continues to rise, many call for the repeal of free trade measures and the re-introduction of tariffs. Several industry leaders have criticized the Caudillos for what they call a "brazen, radical, and irresponsible" approach to economic liberalization. The Caudillos, however, show no indication at halting these efforts, as they continue to further the liberalization programs.\n\nAs a result of the continual demonstrations, the Opus Dei have released a brief public statement, which reads: "The public may rest assured that any and all measures of economic liberalization which have been proposed and conducted within recent months have been carefully considered. Many methods currently being deployed within Iberia are tried and proven methods, in which we place our fullest confidence. The temporary setbacks currently experience are to be expected with a radical shift, but we assure the public that soon Iberia shall reap the benefits of a prosperous and free economy.""

 #Falangist Economic Backfire Events

 IBR.5702.t:0 "Cause for Concern?"
 IBR.5702.d:0 "Economic reports from this quarter have begun to arrive, and the trends are concerning. While initially the heavy investment in the armaments industry spurred growth in both the mining and manufacturing sectors, this growth appears to be approaching a plateau. The initial surge in job creation in mining and manufacturing has nearly come to a complete halt, as generous government investment into the armament industry continues to rise.\n\nWhilst Caudillo Franco continues to praise the apparent economic improvement through his Falagnist policy of state control, arms production, and autarky, many analysts have since decried these policies as an economic disaster in the works. Franco fervently opposes the recent concern, however, as government investment in the armament-related sectors continues to rise.\n\nDespite troubling economic indicators, public confidence in the Iberian economy continues to rise, as unemployment continues to slowly drop. Many wonder; is there truly cause for concern?"
 IBR.5702.a:0 "Surely we shall only benefit from this in the end"
 
 IBR.5703.t:0 "Signs of Decline"
 IBR.5703.d:0 "Within recent weeks, the reception of Franco's economic policies has been less than positive. While the Iberian economy saw some initial success with the heavy autarky measures and investment in armament production and supporting industries, fortunes have been reversed. The economy has since taken a swift plunge. With a large production of armaments and no end buyer, industries have been forced to curtail production to avoid the accumulation of unsaleable armament stockpiles. With the curtailed production came layoffs. Thousands of factory employees found themselves without work in a matter of days, as well as thousands of those working in commercial transportation and mining, as the demand for raw material plummeted.\n\nMany of the unemployed have taken to the streets, protesting the economic policies implemented in recent times. Many of these protestors take aim directly at Franco himself, blaming the Caudillo for the fast declining economic situation. With each passing day, the protests grow in size, with the largest of the protests in Madrid reaching a reported peak of 20,000 participants. As production continues to plunge by the day, it is believed that these anti-Franco protests will only increase in size, as more and more Iberians are put out of work."

 IBR.5704.t:0 "Franco's Address"
 IBR.5704.d:0 "Caudillo Franco stands nearly alone in front of an agitated crowd. The crowd chants various slogans as a multitude of signs are hoisted above the heads of the crowd. Many of the signs read phrases such as "End autarky now!" and "Kill the arms industry, not our jobs!". Franco begins to speak, and the roaring and chanting of the crowd steadily dies down, as they await what the Caudillo's address.\n\n"Countrymen, I know what gathers you all here today. Fear. Fear for your future. Fear for your present jobs. Fear of change. I speak to you today to dissuade those fears. As a nation we have made vast progress in every facet of our society. Great progress! Yet, no progress comes without struggle. This is what we see in our economy today. The comings of great progress. Yes, we must face small setbacks, as we do currently. I do regret that many have to bear the brunt of these setbacks. Yet, it is necessary. Do not be afraid, my fellow countrymen, for golden times lie ahead!" as Franco concludes his speech, the crowd once again erupts into anti-Franco slogans and agitated chatter, much to Franco's dismay. Franco quickly exits the podium behind a well armed police escort and swiftly evacuates the scene of the protest.\n\nAs the economy continues to plunge into freefall, factories and supporting industries continue to lay off workers and outright close down. As hundreds of thousands now find themselves without work, many businesses in the commercial sector have now begun to face a steep decline. The hardships aren't limited to the cities, however. Many rural towns relying on local mining industries now find their men without work, as the economic squeeze is felt outside of the cities. Unrest grows as many of those out of work are unable to find new jobs, and find themselves compelled to join in protests against Franco's economic policies."

 #Positive Middle Economic Path Events (Only for Salazar)
 
 IBR.5705.t:0 "Salazar's Approval"
 IBR.5705.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar stands proudly on a podium on the steps of the legislative assembly in front of a sizeable crowd. The bright flashes and rapid clicks of journalists cameras emanate from the crowd. All members of the assembly, be they economists, journalists, or simply admiring citizens, have gathered for the same reason. To witness Salazar's announcement upon the next round of economic reforms. Salazar stands confident as the congregation vibrates with a tangible approval.\n\n"Ladies, gentlemen." Salazar began. "We have seen some difficult times together. As a nation, we have struggled with disunity, and as well as with our economy. We have hardly been experiencing a golden age. However, I am proud to confidently say that after much effort, our situation truly looks to be improving. That being said, I am not a man to halt at minor improvements. No. I believe I would share the nations approval in saying that we should stop no further than absolute success." With that remak, the crowd erupts into an approving cheer, as the flashes of the cameras endure. As the cheers die down, Salazar goes on at length to detail the next round of imminent economic action.\n\nWith the implementation of Salazar's economic policies now proceeding in full force, Iberia's economy has begun to make decisive improvements. With this comes the benefit of increased public approval for Salazar, as many attribute Salazar to the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities. While the reforms remain largely in the preliminary stages, the public approval indicators are remarkably favourable."

 IBR.5706.t:0 "Economic Rebirth"
 IBR.5706.d:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar could not have hoped for better results from his economic actions. The economy is now thriving. Industries both new and old continue to prosper, and the demand for employees is at a several decade high. As a result, unemployment continues to plummet. The newspapers praise the current economic success as an Iberian economic rebirth. And they all recognize one man, one catalyst for this national boom. Caudillo Salazar. Salazar's fervent and unending struggle to embrace the status quo and undertake responsible and careful economic management was nearly defeated at several turns, yet he did not falter. Not when opposed by the Spanish Caudillo, and not when the skeptics of the Falangists and Opus Dei pushed their agendas of radical reform.\n\nBut even Salazar did not foresee the economic upswing that Iberia now enjoys. While through the loan-fuelled investment growth was confidently predicted, the current figures of economic growth far surpass any projections. As a further benefit, approval ratings of Caudillo Salazar, collected by various newspaper media outlets, show to be as high as seventy percent. Truly, nobody could have anticipated a better outcome."

 #Franco Morocco
 
 IBR.6000.t:0 "Making an Entrance?"
 IBR.6000.d:0 "Morocco, a place of great significance to the proud Spanish Generalissimo, the place where he began his arduous journey to rescue his beloved nation from the grips of communism. Yet now the land he had once known like the back of his hand, where he had once conducted extensive military exercises with his hardened veterans, had greatly changed. It had been over 20 years since his reconquista of Spain, enough time for the German instability and the new Iberian wedding to leave its toll. Franco considered that a proud showing in Morocco may prove his legitimacy and reign in any unruly colonial officials, but he had also always been a man of simple action, not a bombastic dictator like those two men who had helped him cross the narrow sea. Should he perhaps arrive quietly and get straight to business?"
 IBR.6000.a:0 "Roll out the red carpet."
 IBR.6000.b:0 "Avoid the limelight."
 
 IBR.6001.t:0 "Meeting with Local Leaders"
 IBR.6001.d:0 "Franco's arrival in the north African colony has reinvigorated local Morrocan elites into pushing for further autonomy while maintaining Iberian suzerainty. The argument for this is simple: having a puppet state will allow the Iberians to better galvanize resources from the area, whether that be manpower, labor or natural resource extraction. Yet giving any form of concession to the Africans may be met with ridicule from European neighbours. Italy in particular could see this as a sign of weakness and could then push for a strengthened presence in the Meditterenean. However, the flustered Spanish strongman has to make a decision now, the men before him waiting eagerly for a response. Prestige or a decline in efficiency?"
 IBR.6001.a:0 "North Africans should have more autonomy."
 IBR.6001.b:0 "This land is Iberian."
 
 IBR.6002.t:0 "Meeting with Settlers"
 IBR.6002.d:0 "The Iberian settlers in Morocco have met with Franco today in Ceuta, and after Franco delivered a heartwarming and praiseworthy speech, the settlers unceremoniously bombarded our great Caudillo with their grievances and troubles. Over the course of several hours, it became clear that the settlers were agitating for more subsidies from the Iberian government to lessen the burden on them. They agonised in painstaking detail the hardships the face in trying to settle the arid deserts of Morocco, from worthless and parched soil in the hinterlands to lack of any honest work in the cities. While it will place further strain on the Iberian economy, it may be advisable to promise them more financial support, even if it is just to keep them quiet and loyal. Either that, or some token and inconsequential gestures to appease them for the remainder of Franco's visit are in order."
 IBR.6002.a:0 "Promise to increase funding."
 IBR.6002.b:0 "Give token concessions."

 
 #Salazar Military
 
 IBR.6003.t:0 "What to Wear?"
 IBR.6003.d:0 "The old man's face reflected not just the weakening capacity of his tired and overworked body but also his inner fears. As he stared deeply into the mirror, looking for small imperfections just like with his paperwork, he began to brush away a small crease that he must have forgotten to iron out of the military uniform he was wearing. The uniform of the Iberian army. How could he defeat his greatest fear, militarism as personified by his Spanish counterpart, if not by at least trying to shape into something less threatening if not possibly useful? However it spoke against his entire nature and persona he had so carefully crafted over the years. After all was he not the moderate to Franco's delusional grandeur? The question now is should he try to become more of an iron fisted dictator, at least for show, or stick with his usual statesman appearance?"
 IBR.6003.a:0 "A uniform will impress them."
 IBR.6003.b:0 "Stick with the suit."
 
 IBR.6004.t:0 "Several Generals Visibly Offended"
 IBR.6004.d:0 "The grand entrance of Salazar's new persona was about to begin. An important meeting with several key generals of the Iberian armed forces concerning new doctrines and logistics was the perfect place to practice asserting the characteristics of the man he had emulated. As the grand oak doors were opened to the stiff yet resolute Portuguese Caudillo all heads turned to inspect the new entrant. The accompanying soft murmur began to eat at the now very uncomfortable aging statesman as he began to make his way slowly to his seat. A quick scrutiny of the bitter looking faces of the men he was about to address told Salazar all he needed to know about how his gambit had transpired. None would speak out against him openly but his image had now been tarnished considerably."
 IBR.6004.a:0 "Damn it."
 
 IBR.6005.t:0 "The Speech Begins"
 IBR.6005.d:0 "If there was one thing Salazar could always fall back upon it was his eloquence and strength at public speaking. For all his animosity towards Adolf Hitler he still admired his ability to mesmerize and work an audience. The seasoned Caudillo walked slowly towards the podium, all eyes in the room again on him, with the only sound heard coming courtesy of the din of the living city outside the steadfast walls of the palace. As he stepped up to the wooden rostrum he looked down briefly at the collection of notes he held in his hands. He was surprised to see them shake slightly. Age was beginning to get the worse of him. He quickly recovered again, placing both arms first across his chest while surveying the assembled men and then onto the podium itself. He had gained their fixation, and it was time to begin."
 IBR.6005.a:0 "Begin with a promise of further resources."
 IBR.6005.b:0 "Start off with vague platitudes."
 
 IBR.6006.t:0 "On the Issue of Minority Groups"
 IBR.6006.d:0 "The next topic was an uncomfortable one for him to address considering the room he was in. No matter how this would be played he would likely lose. He sighed to himself briefly, then began his tirade against the terrible terrorism that has swept the Union. How these so called freedom fighters dared to undermine the much needed stability of the Iberia, not caring in the slightest about the consequences on real people living their ordinary lives. Clearly these dastardly scum had to be expunged from the nation like the parasites they were. Yet how was this to be done effectively when most of them came from minority groups which currently still enjoyed the protection of the Union? The question of how to approach the next part of his speech was not an easy one for the old man. Should he push for a harsher policy towards minorities in order to safeguard national security, or take a more moderate approach, in the process likely losing a hefty amount of political power to his more hardline Spanish counterpart?"
 IBR.6006.a:0 "They are terrorist sympathizers. A hard line is needed."
 IBR.6006.b:0 "The terrorists do not represent these people."
 
 IBR.6007.t:0 "Transcripts from High Command Meeting Leak"
 IBR.6007.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar had to experience the repurcussions of the largest political flounder he had ever commited following his address on the importance of minority groups in regards to quelling terrorism. Seemingly someone in the high command had committed absolute treachery by leaking his radical views on how to tackle the issue to the public. The poor display had managed to make its way around the country at a terrifying pace despite the best efforts of state censors. Considering the vast majority of the Iberia supported a tough stance on national security due to recent developments in global political affairs he possibly could still spin this to reduce damage to some extent. Yet the views of those minority groups he had talked so poorly of could now not be changed anymore, he had betrayed them for which his political career would bleed heavily."
 IBR.6007.a:0 "A blow to Salazar's popularity among minorities."

 
 #Salazar Church
 
 IBR.6008.t:0 "Salazar Enters Sanctuary of Fatima"
 IBR.6008.d:0 "It was a crisp, clear morning in the Portuguese municipality of Ourém. The white marble running all around the Sanctuary of Fatima reflected the morning sun's brilliance, bathing the plaza in warmth and light. As usual, Salazar's modest motorcade arrived early, and the Caudillo of Portugal found himself with time to burn before his appointment with the Portuguese bishops. Waving off his bodyguards to permit them a cigarette break, Salazar squinted up at the gold-plated cross atop the spire of the central cathedral as he pondered how to go about his discussion with the bishops. It had been some time since he had dealt with the clergy directly, despite their major role in the Estado Novo. Would they be simple, honest men like the ordinary priests he had known growing up, or illustrious and regal figures representative of the Church's wealth and power? What approach would best speak to them, and win them over?"
 IBR.6008.a:0 "Salazar talks about how he once considered becoming a priest."
 IBR.6008.b:0 "Focus on the issues."
 
 IBR.6009.t:0 "Muted Reactions to Personal Anecdotes"
 IBR.6009.d:0 "If Salazar was hoping to find some kind of personal connection in his story of how he ultimately DIDN'T become a priest, he was sorely mistaken. Clearly the bishops had no interest in hearing excerpts from his biography when there were serious matters to take care of. Gritting his teeth and kicking himself mentally by the end of the meeting, Salazar was several shades redder and looked a few years older as he marched back to the limousine afterwards, having gotten nothing out of the discussion besides an embarrassing anecdote about himself."
 IBR.6009.a:0 "Perhaps they were expecting a more substantive conversation."
 
 IBR.6010.t:0 "Bishops Warm Up to Salazar"
 IBR.6010.d:0 ""I had no idea, Senhor Salazar." Bishop Anselmo had said, clearly impressed. "To be so personally invested in the church at such a young age was rare even amongst my own generation. Though you were surely called by God to your vocation, I feel the Church is diminished simply by its inability to count you amongst its servants." If that wasn't the sound of successfully charming his way into the confidence of some of the most influential men in Iberia, Salazar didn't know what was. Despite his age, the chauffeur noticed a confident energy in the Caudillo as he took his seat in the back of the limousine and opened up some light reading.\n\nThe bishops, too, parted ways with Salazar feeling decidedly more relaxed about dealing with the Caudillos in future. Franco had been so... coarse, despite his faith and good intentions. Their own quiet, charismatic countryman was far more agreeable and clearly a reliable brother in Christ. A cordial smile, it seemed, answered far more of their questions than a stack of government pamphlets."
 IBR.6010.a:0 "Salazar has clearly gained trust from the church."
 
 IBR.6011.t:0 "Attempt to Bring up Issues Fails"
 IBR.6011.d:0 "Even Salazar felt himself sweating a little under the collar as the bishops stared at him, stone-faced and dull-eyed. He couldn't tell whether they were annoyed or just plain bored. Whatever the answer, there was little in the way of mutual exchange, with the increasingly weary Caudillo mostly just talking "at" them rather than "with" them. The longest response to any of his statements had been "Yes, Senhor Salazar."\n\nAfter the meeting, as he stood out in the hot sun dabbing at his creased forehead, Salazar found himself grousing out loud to his bodyguards about how obtuse and unhelpful he found these meetings with the clergy. "I'd never get stonewalled by old Father Pedro!" he exclaimed."
 IBR.6011.a:0 "Perhaps they think some bounds have been overstepped."
 
 IBR.6012.t:0 "Bishops Agree With Several of Salazar's Opinions"
 IBR.6012.d:0 ""Which is, of course, why regional particularism is such an issue for us. Regardless of how the people feel about their own nations, we cannot risk a breakdown of the state, as happened to Spain during their civil war."\n\n"Of course, Senhor Salazar," replied Bishop Manuel. He turned to his colleagues. "We are in agreement then, brothers? No support for our regionalist friends?" He was met by a round of nodding.\n\nSalazar smiled broadly, his shoulders finally relaxing. "Then I believe that's everything for today, your eminences. If you'll excuse me, I am due to return to Madrid within the next few hours and must keep to schedule. My secretary here will answer any further questions you may have," he said, gesturing to the cheery-looking, dapper young man beside him. "Until next time, my friends."\n\nScore one for statecraft. Get the right words out there, and men of the cloth are as pliable and easy to understand as any man in the street. Salazar could report back to Franco that their mutual understanding with the clergy remained as healthy as ever, and they would not have to worry about opposition from them anytime soon. Some consolation in a time of troubles, at least."
 IBR.6012.a:0 "A productive conversation, indeed."

 
 #Franco Business
 
 IBR.6013.t:0 "Choosing a Stage"
 IBR.6013.d:0 "In order to better address the economic situation in Iberia, the Caudillos have opted to host a discussion for business leaders in order to encourage cooperation with the government. Because of his talent for speech, and the predominantly Spanish makeup of the business leaders, Franco was the obvious choice for the job. Hosted at the Westin Palace hotel in Madrid, the function was primarily for business leaders, and brought to their attention specifically. Even though they are the main target, it is not yet too late to hold the speech in a public area.\n\nThere are two locations that are most easily secured for a summit, the main stage of Westin Palace or in a private undisclosed location. Hosting the speech somewhere more private will be an easier job to secure, as well as allowing for only the businessmen to be present. That way, they can be better catered to. The only threat there is of leaks. Alternatively, the speech could be made public, for a larger crowd. This will eliminate any risk of someone compromising secure conversations, and will prevent any unpleasant accusations about the loyalty of the Caudillo. It will cost more to secure the public location, and the speech will have to be broad in tone. Otherwise, some groups could be lost by catering to others. The obvious choice is to..."
 IBR.6013.a:0 "Hold a speech on the main stage"
 IBR.6013.b:0 "Hold a speech behind closed doors"
 
 IBR.6014.t:0 "Choosing a Posture for the Speech"
 IBR.6014.d:0 "A location has been selected, announced, and set in stone. Franco would be speaking to a large audience, and marketing his ideas to the public, and not just businessmen. This is no time to forget who this is dedicated to, however- just because the speech is more public doesn't mean it isn't for businessmen first and foremost. To this end a new strategy must be devised. No speech is complete without posturing, and can be ruined with the improper application of it. It needs to be decided how the Caudillo will present his ideas to his audience, as to best ensure retention among the businessmen.\n\nThe first, and most obvious, tone is to take that of someone in favor of a free market. It is sure to win over many business owners, as the promise of an environment suited to them is one tantalizing enough that they are sure to be lured in. While this may anger some elements of the government, these can be mostly mitigated by taking a more conservative position on businesses. Alternatively, it has been proposed to take a tough stance on corporations, asserting authority over them. If there is anything they will respect, it is a leader that is willing to take executive authority. What form will the Caudillo's tone take?"
 IBR.6014.a:0 "A free market posture"
 IBR.6014.b:0 "A business friendly, but conservative posture"
 IBR.6014.c:0 "A strong, authoritarian posture"
 
 IBR.6015.t:0 "Making promises?"
 IBR.6015.d:0 "More easily guarded, a private setting was the obvious choice to hold a speech at. Only the higher echelons of businessmen will be actively attending, amounting to a small group. This will make the situation much less formal, allowing for a few targeted incentives to be made. With the public not watching, making assurances becomes far easier, and much less risky.\n\nOnly, it is a conscious choice to make these assurances. If one were to promise to the business leaders that the Iberian economy would get just a touch more free, it could go a long way towards getting their attention. These reforms will nearly ensure their support, if the trouble is taken to address them. However, making what is essentially a bribe for political capital is frowned upon. If it were to be found publically, then it would create new issues. Therefore, the speech could be made vague and simply assuring the targets prosperity and growth. This will not make any particular friends, but on the other hand it would mean the speech would be mostly bulletproof politically. Is the risk worth the potential gain?"
 IBR.6015.a:0 "Promise to push for free market reforms"
 IBR.6015.b:0 "Make no promises"
 
 IBR.6016.t:0 "An Offer is Made"
 IBR.6016.d:0 "The speech had concluded exceptionally well. It was positively received, the oral delivery was spot-on, and the audience seemed convinced. The summit itself seemed to be winding down, and as it prepared to end and everyone to go home, something of interest occurred. A group of highly influential businessmen, introducing themselves by rank, have shuffled their way into Franco's notice. Introducing it by scraps and pieces, they construct an offer for the Caudillo.\n\nCorporate profits are fair, but they are not as fair as they could be. The Iberian government has the means to fix this error, and they may do so very easily. All it would take is recognition of the superiority of the companies in question. Since they are more powerful than the rest, then they ought to be better appreciated for what they do to the country. As it would happen, some of the resources Iberia would save by helping them could be used as reciprocation. It is an easy decision, they say. All that support, for just a little bit of favor..."
 IBR.6016.a:0 "Accept the offer"
 IBR.6016.b:0 "Decline the offer"
 
 IBR.6017.t:0 "Franco's Corruption Exposed"
 IBR.6017.d:0 "Apparently, the deal was not as private as expected. Someone present at the meeting between the Caudillo and the council of businessmen took a recording, and has only leaked it a few days later. Anonymously shared, it is hard to tell if the guilty party was a traitorous guard or a man hiding a recorder in his suitcase. Who did it matters little now, as they cannot be readily found.\n\nWhen it was leaked, it was especially directed towards the press. Being the predatory vultures they are, they took the bait and published it sky-high. Now the information cannot be stopped, so the whole country is scrutinizing Franco for his seeming corruption. Most crucially are the intelligentsia, who feel betrayed that a leader would resort to such hypocritical means for little of actual value. The bureaucrats feel the same way as well, drifting more towards Salazar - who is seen as a far more upstanding example of a politician."

 #Salazar Intellectuals (Book)
 
 IBR.6018.t:0 "The Genre"
 IBR.6018.d:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar has recently finished writing his first book after over thirty years of political experience, first at the head of the Estado Novo regime, and now as one of the Caudillos of Iberia. During this time he has surmounted many challenges, both political and personal in nature, and he has drawn on this wealth of experience in creating this masterpiece of Iberian Literature. Painstakingly dictated to his secretary over the course of several months, the first draft is ready to be composed. Salazar however has yet to decide what to keep and what to cut from this unwieldy transcript, ever so diligently copied out and perfected by his assistants.\n\nTwo directions to take the book in have been suggested to him by his close associates, that of a manifesto of his own political beliefs, or an autobiography of his personal struggles during his life. Salazar himself has expressed that a political statement to guide the Iberian people would be an apt legacy for him to leave behind, but the idea of an inspiring personal epic appeals to him greatly as well. With the Caudillo remaining indecisive, and papers continuing to pile up on his desk, it may be pragmatic to convince him to make a final decision. What should it be?"
 IBR.6018.a:0 "A manifesto of Salazar's political philosophy."
 IBR.6018.b:0 "An autobiography detailing Salazar's personal struggles."
 
 IBR.6019.t:0 "The Content"
 IBR.6019.d:0 "With the genre of the Caudillo's new book having been decided upon, Salazar's secretary and his assistants have religiously prepared suitable extracts from the initial transcript over the course of a few weeks, every extract having been chosen for its particularly inspiring and powerful advice, vivid descriptions of Salazar's experiences or Salazar's enlightened political philosophy. Salazar has so far been delighted with the choices presented to him by his assistants, but has yet to decide on specifically what he wants in the book, whether it is to be a personal and heartfelt book, aimed at imparting Salazar's enthusiasm and advice to the reader in order to rouse the Iberian people to greater things, or to be a ceremonious and authoritative text containing Salazar's prescriptions for society, aimed at safeguarding the Iberian state, guiding the politicans of tomorrow and preserving the legacy he has painstakingly worked to build during his time in office.\n\nEither way, the Caudillo doesn't seem to be rushing to make a decision, and the book has taken up enough official time as is. Salazar should be encouraged to choose the passages he wants to include in his masterpiece post-haste, as not only do state papers lie on Salazar's desk unread, and urgent bureaucratic work left untouched, but the second Caudillo Francisco Franco himself is becoming concerned with Salazar's apparent idleness. A decision must be made."
 IBR.6019.a:0 "Inspirational and powerful advice to the reader."
 IBR.6019.b:0 "Salazar's prescriptions for society."
 
 IBR.6020.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 IBR.6020.d:0 "Now that the Caudillo has decided on the specific contents of his book, he has one final decision to make before this paragon of Iberian literature can be sent to the printing presses. A conclusion has yet to be written, and Salazar is torn between concluding that it will be the educated elite that will guide Iberia towards a bright and proud future, or that it will be the common Iberian toiling away that will bring about a golden age for the Iberian people.\n\nWhile favouring the intelligentsia would most likely cement Salazar's book as his magnum opus and possibly increase the loyalty of the intellectuals to the Caudillo, concluding that the common people will determine the future of Iberia could help to foster wider support for the regime, as well as cynically generating a larger profit for the publisher and himself to pocket. Salazar however is more concerned with its popular reception than what a few jumped up toffs think, and while it will be a difficult and lengthy series of arguments needed to convince him of the political benefits of dedicating it to Iberian intellectuals, it may be expedient to make him see this point of view. Alternatively, letting Salazar have his way is surely the quicker route to publication, and more importantly, back to work for Salazar. What should he be convinced to conclude the book with?"
 IBR.6020.a:0 "A declaration that the educated will guide Iberia towards a great future."
 IBR.6020.b:0 "A declaration that the common Iberian will lead the way towards a great future."
 
 IBR.6021.t:0 "Intellectuals Impressed by Salazar's Manifesto"
 IBR.6021.d:0 "Salazar's political manifesto has been met with great acclaim within the intellectual community since being published, as the wise ruler expected it would be. His work received not only favourable reviews from Iberian literary groups and authors, but also internationally his book has also been received well, especially in neighbouring Italy, and to a lesser extent in America, with most copies having been bought by a minority of NPP members. The only frankly minor criticism voiced by the intellectuals is that it might be a little too high brow for the masses, but that doesn't seem to bother Salazar, who appears to be content with the other praise he has received.\n\nUniversally, his theories and guidance have been praised as comprehensive and well thought out, with the rhetoric and ideological dogma usually found in political literature to be mostly absent. Iberian scholars agree that it has a clear vision for society under Salazarian ideals, and some have even written to the Caudillo to express their support for the society envisaged in his book, an occurrence that greatly pleased him. There has yet to be a particularly critical or scathing review of Salazar's work, most likely because the ideas and content are simply indisputable of course, not that there are any other reasons for no one speaking up. Overall, Salazar is incredibly pleased with himself and the book he has worked tirelessly to create, and now he can finally focus on official work once more."
 IBR.6021.a:0 "Recognition from the Iberian intelligentsia is highly appreciated."
 
 IBR.6022.t:0 "Salazar's Book Gets Lackluster Response"
 IBR.6022.d:0 "Much to the dismay of Salazar, his book has been a complete flop both domestically and internationally! No intellectual of significance anywhere, let alone in Iberia has commented positively of his work, with it most commonly being described as "confused, unfocused literary mess" by the Iberian intelligentsia. Not only have intellectuals described the book as a muddled and tangled web of political ideas and personal experiences, but they have also said the ideas included are vague and difficult to digest and the experiences are particularly tedious affairs, and at some points painfully boring to read through according to one particularly scathing reviewer. The common Iberian has also found the book hard to engage, citing many similar criticisms that the intellectuals have expressed, though quite often in much coarser words. Francisco Franco of course has endorsed his fellow ruler's work, though it seems more out of professional courtesy than for its own merit.\n\nPoor sales and a bad reception make it unlikely for the publisher to agree to a second production run of the book, and Salazar is reportedly distraught to see the sale price of his work in shop windows be struck down lower and lower as the proprietors try to make at least some return on their purchased stock. For now it seems, Salazar's career as an author has come to an abrupt end, and the Caudillo has been left greatly disheartened and bitter by the whole affair."
 IBR.6022.a:0 "Perhaps it could have done with a clearer message."

 IBR.6023.t:0 "Salazar's Autobiography Takes Iberia by Storm"
 IBR.6023.d:0 "Only a week after being officially published, Salazar's new book has sold out. Demand for his inspirational personal epic has far outstripped supply, and a second production run is already being organised to cover the shortfall in copies. Reportedly, the personal perspective of the book and its inspiring life advice has found a receptive audience within the lower and middle class, and a newfound respect and sympathy for the premier has been fostered.\n\nNot only has the Caudillo's office been inundated with letters of praise from across Iberia, a whole series of spontaneous patriotic celebrations have broken out in Portugal. Street parties complete with overhead banners and fireworks have clogged Lisbon's streets for several days now, having quickly assembled after the last copy sold out in the city. The same phenomenon was repeated across several of the larger towns, and while some have suggested that this was not entirely natural, Salazar has dismissed these hearsay accusations and is content to bask in the popular acclaim being afforded to him.\n\nFellow Caudillo Franco also has apologized in private to Salazar over his misgivings about his publication, after acknowledging the increase in popular support for Salazar. The success of his work has far surpassed Salazar's own private expectations, and what he initially self-proclaimed as a masterpiece is now undoubtedly regarded as a cornerstone of Iberian literature by popular decree."

 IBR.6024.t:0 "The Ministry of National Education"
 IBR.6024.d:0 "In a drive to stabilize Iberian internal divisions and show that the current administration is not politically inert it has been announced that Caudillo Franco will tour various government ministries to gain an insight into their workings and current conditions. Some have already labelled this as a pointless and insulting PR move; something to put in the daily tabloids to distract from other more pressing news. Official statements however hail the proposed events as a turning point in Iberia's current political and economic fortunes, dismissing the criticism as pointless fearmongering.\n\nThe elderly dictator's first visit would be to the education ministry. In the run up to the day lobbyists have been arguing for more funding to increase Iberian standards of education both in order to help the national economy while providing better employment opportunities and to help the Union better compete on the global stage. Whether Franco will heed their advice, make only slight reforms in order to balance the national budget or just ignore them entirely will be seen on the day."

Land reform and the future of farming are always hot topics during election cycles, especially in more rural Iberian settings, which resulted in the upcoming meeting tripling newspaper and analysis sales.\n\nAmongst the concerns that the Spanish Caudillo may not be entirely suited to discussing such matters of state, were some more particularly scathing attacks published by left wing organizations who see the strong man as a growing tumour wasting away Iberia's societal and economic wealth. The decisions made at the meeting however could signal a new direction for rural prosperity which had long been lagging behind urban development. It is not clear yet what will be decided."

Road expansion and public works in general are always a good way of improving the national economy and provide jobs for the people, but their downside is, as the name implies, that they need state money to actually happen.\n\nHowever, due to the promises made to the previous ministries, it seems like the Caudillo will only have bad news for the minister, as there is now not only not enough money for the Development Ministry, but that some cuts will have to be made if the minister hopes to keep the department running. The meeting looks like it will be a very short one, with Franco delivering the bad news and getting out as soon as possible."

 IBR.1015.d:0 "Adolf Hitler received great applause on television today as he announced that the Reich has successfully defeated both America and Japan in its race to the moon. Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, successfully landed on Luna, broadcasted in multiple angles and with thousands of pictures taken. Celebrations have sparked across Germany, while America and Japan have both proclaimed they will continue the race and that it does not end with simply one man landing on a rock.\n\nThe news has received mixed responses in Iberia, and Caudillo Franco released a short and terse statement in response. Rumors from his inner circle state that all members of the government were greatly displeased that The Union has yet to even develop such technology, and was quite angry that the Germans were the ones to land first.\n\nAlready, several speculators have begun to question whether or not the Germans staged the landing for the propaganda, and conspiracy theories are abound."

The Germans had just invaded the Portugese colonies, which brought realization to the Portuguese and Spanish that Hitler had no plans for non-Germans in his new world. The German Reich was massive, so to counter it, Portugal and Spain united into the Iberian Union. Germany soon built a dam in the Gibraltar Strait but this quickly decimated the economies of all the Mediterranean countries who relied on trade through the now shrunken sea.\n\nWith a profound dislike for the Germans as their only bond, The Iberian Union formed the Triumvirate with Italy and Turkey, but relations with the two have been souring lately, and it seems the only possible way to save the Triumvirate, is the upcoming Malta Conference between the three."

 IBR.1020.d:0 "Today, the housekeeping staff of São Bente Palace were horrified to find the corpse of Antonio Salazar in his bath. The body was quickly removed for an autopsy and burial, but the knowledge of his death managed to quickly escape the circle of secrecy that it was intended to remain in until the Iberian government can come up with an official story. Already, numerous underground forces within the Union are mobilizing, and worrying rumors of sedition within the Portuguese state have come to our attention.\n\nWith keeping the beloved Caudillo's death a secret being no longer an option, Iberian authorities must put all of their resources in play in order to keep the Union stable. Already, tanks have been spotted moving down roads in Lisbon, and martial law has been declared in several regions in Portugal.\n\nCaudillo Franco and Salazar's designated successor, Marcello José das Neves Alves Caetano, have already condemned any forces conspiring to take advantage of Salazar's death, but it does not appear that this will provide a conclusive end to the political chaos in Portugal. It appears that the only thing left to do is crack down as hard as possible, and divert every possible resource to ensuring the Union stays together."

 IBR.1022.d:0 "Iberia had always been naught but a geographical construct. Kept together not by common identity or purpose but by fear. When the dreaded German invasion failed to materialize the Union quickly lost its purpose. With any hope of genuine reform being killed in the cradle the Union could only survive through the sheer force of will brought by its twin Caudillos. When Salazar died and the Union endured some had hoped that it had turned into something more. That something genuine had been born. A common Iberian identity that could endure beyond the passing of the giants that had founded it. These dreams were foolish\n\nWith the passing of Francisco Franco, some mourn the loss of their savior, some rejoice at the death of a tyrant, some shed tears of regret at what could have been while others vow to maintain his legacy. Yet all fear for the future. The last pillar maintaining Iberia has fallen. The second Union seems doomed to end in the same way as its predecessor did."
 IBR.1022.a:0 "By the sword."
 
 IBR.1021.t:0 "Tensions in Portugal Explode"
 IBR.1021.d:0 "The powder keg has finally exploded.\n\nEver since the death of Caudillo Salazar Iberia a fuse had been lit and had been heading towards an end from which Iberia could never recover. Each political event that had followed the unfortunate demise of the Portuguese Caudillo had added to this flame. First a number of Portuguese politicians had secretly initiated talks on how to manage a peaceful secession from the Union. Seeing the writing on the wall with the way Franco dealt with the political crisis they knew the only successful future Portugal could forge in the future was one on their own. With their political considerations that Portugal would lose influence in the Union they increased the strength of the flame.\n\nSome documents from these meetings have however made their ways into the hands of Basque separatists who without having the full picture came to the joyous conclusion that an imminent armed struggle would ensue between the secessionist Portugal and the remnants of the Iberian government. For them it was hence the perfect time to finally stand up for their own freedom and independence. The next bit of fuel to the flame was added.\n\nAs the news was carried in the wind, between distorted and reshaped to fit the agendas of various other splinter groups, the flame finally had found its end destination. With the uprising of the Basques following a few days of rapid preparation the peninsular began to be rocked by brutal civil war for the second time this century."
 IBR.1021.a:0 "The half island is in flames."
 
 IBR.1023.t:0 "Anarchy in Iberia"
 IBR.1023.d: "Trouble had been brewing across the half peninsula for a while now. Observers, both foreign and national, have argued that intense political incompetence in the heart of Iberian governance had detrimental effects to the stability of the Union. While localities desperately attempted to mitigate the damages caused by the poor political decisions made in Madrid, terrorist groups and freedom fighters had been quietly organising themselves to take advantage of the situation. This, in their eyes, was an opportune time to finally rid themselves of the hated Iberia yoke that had been oppressing them.\n\nNo matter the level of strict censorship applied to the national and local news, the populace nonetheless had felt the detrimental effects of decisions made at the top. Popular opinion, as much as it could be observed in these times of crisis, had switched from apathy into something far more sinister. No one now seemed to be able to stop the forces of history converging once again in Iberia. For the second time in a century the home of two of the greatest empires the world is descending into anarchy."

After all, if people cannot even afford to meet their basic standards of need what do their have to lose in hurting those at the top who have made it so for them.\n\nFranco had in his pursuit of hard-line falangist economic policy not only alienated a great number of government officials but also tanked the already struggling Iberian economy. Day by day the newspapers were filled with headlines of leaders of capital and other economic figures taking their lives. The average citizen fared no better as even the spontaneously established black market began to run out of goods.\n\nProtest and economic standstill defined each city on the peninsula. As normal people began to turn their anger against the regime into action, a number of underground terror groups and freedom organizations saw their opportunity to finally push for the results they wanted.\n\nThe stability of the once so promising union had been undermined to a point where attempts from Madrid to rectify the situation were met either with harsh opposition or proven ineffectual. Seemingly the only answer now is violence."

 IBR.1027.t:0 "A repeat of history"
 IBR.1027.d:0 "Franco's lack of action to remedy the concerns raised by opposition to his power grab, following Salazar's death, have led in many places around the Union to declare open revolt. Portugal, a particular flashpoint considering the issues around representation, has entirely slipped out of the grasp of the central government. While news of rioting and upheaval are coming in droves out of the region, Lisbon has entirely ceased communications with Madrid.\n\nThis however sadly was not the only concern. Other groups which had previously been hostile to the Iberian government have also taken this opportunity of crisis to break out in rebellion. Insurgents have been reported in a variety of Spanish cities. Their goal, unlike the Portuguese call for representation, was not entirely clear.\n\nIt was obvious to the Caudillo that Portugal would have to be suppressed on a large scale, but now even his own nation was wasting away around him. Traitors in his own ranks were making themselves visible. Previous Iberian loyalists who had seen their chance to change the system through working inside it had also lost hope when Franco had refused to cede ground to the opposition. Realizing that now the superstructure they had wanted could only be achieved through other means they as well have taken up arms against the new dictatorship. In the middle of all of this, Franco, by now besieged from every angle, still held onto his hopes for stable Iberia under his leadership. It is unlikely that he will let his opponents take that from him without a fight.

 IBR.1113.d:0 "With Iberia's days counted, the negotiation teams of Portugal and Spain are now arguing over the colonies in West Africa. Composed of Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania, the only deal that both teams have reached for now is that those territories owned by the Kingdom of Morocco will undoubtedly go to Spain.\n\nThe main area of disagreement between the two teams is Mauritania as this region wasn't owned by neither nation prior to the creation of Iberia. The Portuguese team argues it should be theirs to compensate for the loss of Angola and Mozambique, but the Spanish team is saying that the loss of those colonies were Portugal's fault. The area itself is plagued with bandits that spill over to the southern part of Western Sahara, so some members of the Spanish team believe it would be a good idea to give these areas to Portugal and that way take a weight off Spanish future responsibilities in Africa. Both teams are still arguing but a decision must be made..."

 IBR.1116.t:0 "Splitting the Colonies - Guinea"
 IBR.1116.d:0 "In what seems to be a recurring move, both negotiating teams have reached a deal over the colony of Guiné. Arguing that the colony was previously owned by Portugal and that as such most people there speak Portuguese and business in the region is closer to Lisboa than to Madrid, both negotiating teams have decided that Portugal should own the colony once Iberia fully splits. The news has been very well received by the governments of both nations, that hope to continue reaching good deals to avoid future tensions."

 IBR.1117.t:0 "Restoring The Embassies"
 IBR.1117.d:0 "As part of the process of splitting up Iberia, the process of restoring the embassies between the two soon-to-be countries has begun. While they won't be operative until the country is fully divided, records and material is already being shipped to the buildings that will host the diplomatic missions.\n\nBoth sides have already named their respective ambassadors, even if they might change the second after Iberia is gone. These two designees are now in charge of overseeing this process finish without any kind of delays. The Spanish negotiating team has declared that they don't like the naming of ambassadors so soon, specially since it comes with the full salary, but the Portuguese team has replied that the Spanish delegation in Lisbon has already occupied the building designated for the future embassy and the top workers there have began to meet with local people of power with the title of workers of the Spanish diplomatic mission in Lisbon. It seems that up until the last second, both sides won't agree on anything."

 IBR.1118.d:0 "With the focus now on splitting the armed forces, it has been decided that the first step in diving all the supplies that the Federal Armed Forces have used during their existence. Although both negotiating teams have members that believe an even split of the armament is the best solution, there are also those that disagree with this solution.\n\nThe most radical members of the Spanish team believe that, since military industry controlled by Spanish companies during Iberian times was much greater than that in Portuguese hands, the equipment should be split proportionally to that, giving the future Spanish military much more resources than the Portuguese one that way. On the other hand, the Portuguese team argues that this very reason, the disproportion of military industry, means Portugal should get more equipment than Spain, since Spain could quickly make up the difference once Iberia is no longer on the map.\n\nBoth teams have been arguing about this matter for days now and if the government wants to make sure Iberia is gone before the end of time, it seems like it must intervene and force a decision; since no team is willing to reach an agreement."

 IBR.1119.d:0 "Before the military can be finally split and the Federal Armed Forces abolished and replaced by the separate forces of the two nations, the records of the Academia General Militar, the military academy in charge of overseeing the Federal Armed Forces training, must be distributed between the two countries. As with other things, some members of both negotiating teams want the records to be split freely, with each nation taking whatever it wants, but this solution isn't shared by most.\n\nSome members Spanish team argue that most, if not all, of the records have been written and administered by Spanish military personnel and as such the records should go to Spanish hands.The Portuguese team, on the other side, says that once the Union is not united anymore, the Portuguese military will be much weaker than the Spanish one for a variety of reasons; and having the records from the academy at hand would help Portugal get up to speed with other countries.\n\nIt seems like this argument will take forever if it keeps its current pace, so the government will step in to make a decision for both teams, even if it's just to make sure Iberia doesn't exist for more than it needs to."
 IBR.1119.a:0 "Deny the request - the records belong to Spain."

The last trucks with military equipment were already on their way to Portugal, the embassies were ready to begin working, border passes were beginning to make as if Iberia was no more and the two national leaders were each in the capital of their respective countries. Due to legal procedures, Iberia could only be divided if both Caudillos signed a law that dealt with that. While the Spanish Caudillo had already signed it, his Portuguese colleague had insisted on signing the law once he was back in Lisbon. The day had come. Today, from his office, the Portuguese leader would sign the law that would kill Iberia once and for all.\n\nSomewhere in Toledo, an old Portuguese woman prayed for her life because she wasn't able to move back to her country. In Porto, a Spanish man, husband and father of three children, was attending a special seminary on the new laws that he and his family would have to obey from now on. In Tetuán, the Iberian federal flag was taken down and the Spanish flag was hoisted while colonial troops trained, now only with a Spanish instructor.\n\nAnd at that precise moment, a moment that would get lost to time, the radios throughout the whole peninsula and all the territories that up until then were under Iberian rule broadcasted the same message. Some did it in Portuguese, others in Spanish; but the message was clear: Portugal had signed the break-up law. Iberia was now part of history."

 IBR.3000.d:0 "Iberian unity has always been a rather dicey affair, especially in these turbulent times. While there are many who would use the instability to advance the cause of their own ethnic group, there are also plenty of loyal citizens who wish to keep our union intact. Artists, musicians, politicians, and even ordinary people have been known to come together to try and define a unified Iberian culture. Usually, these are mere blips on the radar, but sometimes something extraordinary comes from it, like the shared Conquistador pride, or the fact that both the Portuguese and Spanish have a hatred for Moors.\n\nAnd sometimes...these attempts end in disaster.\n\nIt all started off as a well meaning collaboration between the Lisbon and Madrid art guilds, in the hopes of producing a piece of art that symbolized the unity of Spain and Portugal. After some deliberation, the artists agreed that their project would consist of a giant mural displaying what they hoped to be "Iberia's new national animal". Taking the Spanish bull and the Portuguese rooster as pieces of inspiration, the artists slaved away day and night to create a masterpiece.\n\nUnfortunately, when it was finally unveiled before a crowd two weeks later, the reactions were less than stellar. The finished product, which for some reason ended up being a mixed up amalgamation of rooster and cow body parts with seven pairs of horns and at least three heads, immediately earned the ire of the entire nation that they were trying to appeal to. Described by onlookers variably as "an abomination", a "piece of vomit-inducing graffiti that wouldn't pass in an American art school", and "proof that Jesus died in vain".\n\nTo make matters worse, the "Iberian Chimera", as it has now been dubbed, was leaked to the international community, where in many countries it seems to have caught on immediately. Fortunately, in the grand scale of things this doesn't impact our nation too much, but the mental link between Iberia and the eldritch rooster-bull from hell in the minds of foreigners won't go away anytime soon."

The nearly complete skeleton has appeared to be that of a sauropod, with many scientists declaring it as a possible relative to the Brachiosaurus. Debates have already begun on what classification it belongs to, and many paleontologists are flooding the scene to try and find more clues of how and when the dinosaur lived. Their best guess so far is that this twenty-two ton behemoth lived during the Middle Jurassic and roamed all over the local area in large numbers.\n\nUpon hearing its description, one of the soldiers who found it stated that a large, useless, dumb lizard must be named after the infamous German project to drain the Mediterranean. The name Atlantropasaurus quickly caught on, and many citizens in Iberia have found interest in the dinosaur, including government officials. This specific specimen has even been ordered to be put on display in Madrid as a testament to Iberian strength and knowledge, and will arrive in less than a week."

 iberia.1.t:0 "The Situation in Goa"
 iberia.1.d:0 "With the establishment of the Iberian Council, order is being restored to the peninsula, freeing up the government to work on other pressing matters. It is past due that Iberia set its sights on the rest of the world, and the first step of this process will be the coastal city of Goa.\n\nFormerly a Portuguese colony, the port of Goa was seized by India shortly after the conclusion of the Second World War, near the turn of the decade, in tandem with the annexation of Angola and Mozambique by Germany. The garrison had already been substantially reduced, moved to the Portuguese colonies in Africa to defend them from German attacks. Reportedly, not a single shot was fired in defense or in assault of the port city, with the garrison simply surrendering and withdrawing from the port, allowing the Indian forces to move in and capture the colony entirely unopposed. The nature of the Goa Incident, however, raises quite a few doubts within the general staff, some of whom believe that there was more to the incident than the well-being of the troops.\n\nThere are two reasonable conclusions, according to our general staff: The attack was in whole Indian aggression, taking land which did not belong to them - and against such numbers, how could the already minimized garrison hope to resist them? After all, the garrison was outnumbered and under-equipped. Defeat at the hands of the superior Indian forces was inevitable. The second conclusion though carries far more ominous implications, that some unknown factor motivated the garrison commander to order our forces to stand down, surrendering our territories in Goa without so much as a protest."
 iberia.1.a:0 "The garrison commander is at fault here." 
 iberia.1.b:0 "India is clearly the culprit."

 iberia.2.t:0 "Interrogating the Garrison Commander"
 iberia.2.d:0 "Having had a small series of questions with Goa garrison commander Vassalo e Silva, we are now able to confirm... absolutely nothing. Our interrogation has proved entirely fruitless, having gotten little more than his insistence that he is not at fault, that Indian aggression was the root cause, and that he surrendered for the good of his men, despite repeated questioning. While he may simply be non-cooperative and attempting to hide something, it is still entirely possible that he really is innocent and India's aggression was fully to blame.\n\nThe question remains, who is more at fault?"
 iberia.2.a:0 "I don't think he's going to talk." 
 iberia.2.b:0 "If it wasn't the commander, then it was India."


 iberia.3.t:0 "Investigating Goa Documents"
 iberia.3.d:0 "Given the non-cooperative nature of Vassalo e Silva, we have been forced to follow a more complicated trail of information, and our agents have been forced to coast through an endless series of paperwork and reports, but at last they have discovered exactly what they were hunting for - reports, audits, and scores of other documents detailing just what exactly went on in that port. While the political reports appear, for the most part, normal, the financial audits are what we quickly came to have an interest in.\n\nWhile for a time the trends seemed reasonable, there appears to have been a gradual slippage of integrity culminating in an exceptionally large unexplained payment in mid November of 1961.."
 iberia.3.a:0 "I think there's something here." 

 iberia.4.t:0 "Goa Officials Bribed by the Indian Military"
 iberia.4.d:0 "Shocking news! Confirming our concerns, it would appear that unspecified payment was more than just a simple corruption scheme. According to our investigations, the payment can be traced back to several officials in the Indian army, and from there it isn't unreasonable to assume that the stand-down order was motivated by more than the well-being of the troops.\n\nNow we know, for certain, the guilt of Vassalo e Silva. Still, it is entirely possible this conspiracy reaches far deeper than we could expect, and more officials from Goa were involved in this plot than simply the garrison commander. What is our next course of action?"
 iberia.4.a:0 "We must reach the end of this." 
 iberia.4.b:0 "End the investigation and punish those involved."

 iberia.5.t:0 "The Anjediva Trial"
 iberia.5.d:0 "Today Vassalo e Silva and his cadre of officials faced trial for allowing corruption to interfere with their duty of protecting Goa. This act was viewed as nothing short of treason by all present. Throughout the proceedings it was apparent on each defendant's face recognition of the consequences they would soon face; As the damned gazed about the courtroom, they found nothing but apathy for their fate. While the trials started with at least a facade of procedure, by the end of it the men behind the show-trials clearly wanted to just get it over with. The sentences were lenient - hard labor until the end of their days."

First, they were within one of the most secure locations on the peninsula. Second, they were buried deep within, unlikely to ever see sunlight again. These audits will trouble Iberia no longer."

Under our noses, the corruption scandal has spiraled out of control to the point where we have no chance of suppressing the news.\n\nMaking matters worse the officials involved have been utterly shamed by the public. While nobody lacks the sense to say such out loud, the attitude is certainly present at any public functions they make appearances at. We'll have to keep them out of the public eye for a time and let this all blow over."

 iberia.9.d:0 "Earlier today, the Iberian Union demanded of us we deliver to them compensation for their lost colony. They demand restitution, in full, for all the territories we "seized" from them when we recaptured the port of Goa by simply bribing the Iberian garrison to stand down. What makes this even more of a smack in the face is that they also sent their so-called estimates, inflating the value of Goa far above anything it could be reasonably priced at!\n\nThey are expecting a response by the end of the day. How are we going to respond to their ridiculous ultimatum?"
 iberia.9.a:0 "We won't pay a single rupee." 
 iberia.9.b:0 "Perhaps we can find common ground?"
 
 iberia.10.t:0 "India Refuses to Pay"
 iberia.10.d:0 "What insolence! India has refused to compensate their aggression, claiming it was not really aggression. Effectively we have lost every last escudo Portugal has placed into the port. Clearly the only option remaining is to remind them the consequences of flippantly rejecting our offer to resolve the problem peacefully. Although perhaps we may be yet able to strike a deal...\n\nRegardless, we must compose a response post-haste, as we simply cannot allow such a response to go unanswered. What will it be?"
 iberia.10.a:0 "The Goa takeover is an act of war, so be careful." 
 iberia.10.b:0 "How about a symbolic payment?" 
 
 iberia.11.t:0 "Iberia Blackmails us!"
 iberia.11.d:0 "Iberia is back at it again hounding us over Goa. At least this time they had the decency to change their tactics. This time they've informed us they hold compromising information over some of our officers, of which they also threaten to give out. What "give out" means we're not sure. Regardless, they at least had the decency to demand a smaller payment. We can refuse, obviously. However, perhaps we should give them a reduced payment. Of course, they never specified what they meant by reduced, only less than the initial price..."
 iberia.11.a:0 "We'll pay, but not full price." 
 iberia.11.b:0 "We said no." 
 
 iberia.12.t:0 "Iberia Proposes a Symbolic Payment"
 iberia.12.d:0 "Rather than endlessly hound us over payment, Iberia has proposed a far better idea. They have proposed a sort of symbolic payment instead of the original sum. A trinket or something of the sort, it is argued to us, would suffice just as well as a payment. It would be far easier to acquire the resources required for a move like this, but all of this assumes we have to tolerate this hounding at all. Will we go through with a symbolic payment?"

The illusion disintegrated once we received the check, which totaled one rupee! They refuse to pay us any further, claiming that they paid the reduced sum. Goa is lost, and now so is all of our investment into the port city. This whole situation could have been avoided if we had just specified a minimum..."

 iberia.14.d:0 "India insists it will not provide us any compensation for the port of Goa. Given our position we are lack the ability to do anything else about it. If blackmail didn't work, nothing will. Our plans have failed. Our port is lost. Worst of all, our investments are also lost.\n\nThe only thing we can do now is swallow our pride and admit defeat. We need to salvage what we can and bury these negotiations. If we can't, then our government will be rendered laughingstocks in the eyes of the public once more. "
 iberia.14.a:0 "Archive this before the press gets a hold on it." 
 
 iberia.15.t:0 "Another Folder in the Archives"
 iberia.15.d:0 "Initially, the plan was to place the failed Goa negotiations near the corruption scandal. After a moment's reflection, however.. It was quickly decided these documents needed to be somewhere deeper. Somewhere even more hidden. The negotiations were taken deep into the archives, into a place more dust than paperwork. Here was stored some of the most absurd of the incidents Iberia has had to deal with in its lifetime. While the Goa negotiations were certainly not absurd they needed to be buried. There was an open slot, coincidentally between several other diplomatic arrangements, and this slot is where the negotiations were stowed away. And so they were left, to be forgotten to the forces of time."

Thankfully, our agents stopped the press before they were able to showcase our more under-the-table dealings. If they had publicized those we would never hear the end of it.\n\nFor the time being our best action is to ride this one out.

Even though we don't have something picked out for certain, we have several options that will surely make up the value of any payment to Iberia.\n\nWe have several options that they may find enticing. Firstly, we could grant them special economic rights in the port of Goa. These business rights would allow Iberia to easily make up their claimed difference, without us doing a thing. Secondly, we could propose an equal investment of sorts. Finally, we could make them an unorthodox offer: Prisoners.

They were all escorted to a prison, and treated like the prisoners they now apparently were.\n\nOver the next few days, the soldier began planning his escape.His plan was simple, slip from the eyes of the guards and glide away to somewhere else. Perhaps by fortune, this plan worked out and soon he found himself out of his confinement. Then came the next part of the plan: He ran. He kept running until his lungs failed him and he could move no longer, and he repeated the process until he was far, far away from Goa. What struck him as odd was how little of a chase was given, but he was too busy fleeing the vicinity to properly dwell on it.\n\nHe was making his way to Bombay, where he had heard there were a lot of British people. They would be willing to hide him, surely. He became a drifter, never staying somewhere for too long and subsisting off the charity of locals. He didn't know what he'd do in Bombay, but it was sure to be better than what he was doing now."

Most importantly, they seized the former Portuguese colony of Timor. In the face of overwhelming odds the garrison yielded, soldiers and officers alike promptly imprisoned. We have yet to get a word back from any of them. While recovering the colony is an impossibility, it is far more possible to recover those guarding the port from their incarceration.\n\nThese brave soldiers have been held prisoner for nearly two decades. It is simply untenable to allow them to remain prisoners any longer. We must liberate them immediately. Currently held in Indonesia, it should be a simple affair to petition the Indonesian government to allow them to come home."

We'll delay the proceedings until Iberia gets disinterested and drops the negotiations. Secondly, formally prisoners of war are under Japan's discretion. While we don't usually follow that rule we could definitely follow it here, and refer the Iberians to Japan. That should get them off our backs, at least for a while.

If the Iberians really go through with it we'll have scammed them out of a lot of money for the prisoners. We need to be careful with our pricing or else they'll call our bluff.

Predictably, most of it is to go to transportation, since crossing half the world is never cheap. As corruption isn't entirely defeatable, a small sum must go as a backup to ensure there's enough payment to cover the transportation. Finally, we have taken the liberty of preparing a grand sendoff ceremony, as they deserve.\n\nThe Iberian reaction was less-than-enthused at the breakdown of payment, but since the money had already been sent there was nothing they could do.

Then, to the offense of human decency, were used as human labor for menial projects. Because of the total mistreatment of the government, they died, alone, far away from home, and were never to see their families again.\n\nSadly, there was no proper explanation for the mistreatment, other than sheer cruelty.

 ##Santa Maria Affair##
 
 iberia.300.t:0 "Captain Galvão Speaks Out Against the Caudillos"
 iberia.300.d:0 "This morning, shocking news reached the offices of the Caudillos. Upon the front pages of national newspapers was a breaking column. Captain Galvão, a prominent naval officer with the command of a significant vessel in the Iberian fleet, has gone public to national media to speak out against the Caudillos. In this media statement, the Captain goes on at length to discuss what he perceives as continual oppression from the Caudillos, the noticeable loss of freedoms across Iberia, and mismanagement of the armed forces. Due to the status of this high ranking military officer, and the power he holds, the nation has gone into a frenzy over this breaking news. One can scarcely appear in public without hearing talk of this breaking headline.\n\nStrict rules are placed upon all members of the Iberian military, forbidding them to give opinions to the media without strict approval and guidance from public relations personnel or superior officers. Due to this, the testimony that Captain Galvão gave to the media could see him immediately tried by court martial resulting in a dishonorable discharge. To commence such proceedings we would need to speak to his direct superior officer. However, Captain Galvão's statement appears to be rather popular at this moment, and immediately silencing him might be seen by the public as a move of suppression, furthering this crisis. Letting the issue fester, however, is also far from ideal for the public image of the Caudillos."

 iberia.301.t:0 "Commanding Officer Supports Galvão"
 iberia.301.d:0 "Since Captain Galvão recently went public with his dissent against the Caudillos, the Caudillos have sent a joint request to his direct superior, a Rear Admiral in the Iberian Navy, to begin to undertake the necessary measures to court martial Captain Galvão for his unapproved and inflammatory comments upon the Caudillos. The reply from his superior officer, which arrived to the office of the Caudillos in a letter, is far from the compliance that was expected.\n\n"Caudillos Franco and Salazar,\nIt has come to my attention that the government seeks disciplinary action upon my loyal subordinate, Captain Galvão, for his comments which have notably upset the Caudillos. I wish to dispel any notions that the Captain acts independently and without approval.\nAs the direct superior of Captain Galvão, I can attest that these statements given to Iberian media were not the sole opinions of one individual. I can further attest that, due to my approval of these statements, I do not find Captain Galvão in direct breach of any media outreach policies, and as such, I shall not be seeking disciplinary action against him.\n\nSincerely,\nContra Almirante Valerio""

 iberia.302.d:0 "Following the defiance towards the Caudillos displayed by significant contingents of the naval high command, Caudillo Salazar has proceeded with his plans of extinguishing dissent within the naval high command, beginning with Captain Galvão and those who support him in his campaign of public outcry. Those apprehended in the purge of the Naval forces are to face immediate courts martial in Madrid. Those not facing direct charges within the naval forces are to be closely audited, as we search for any other possible dissidents within the ranks of the Iberian Naval high command.\n\nRear Admiral Valerio, the superior officer of Captain Galvão who defied orders from the Caudillos, was today among the first apprehended in the first wave of these purges. Captain Galvão himself however, whose name now carries significant weight within Iberia, has escaped apprehension. His current whereabouts are unknown. Some speculate that he has fled to South America, while others claim that he may have fled to a hostile nation in search of amnesty and possibly even support.\n\nWhilst the current scope of those affected by the purges is limited, and mostly surrounds those who have supported Captain Galvão, they have only just begun. The expectation rests that following the purges, the loyalty of the navy shall be unquestionable."

 iberia.303.d:0 "Franco and Salazar sit in a secluded briefing room, accompanied by admirals and colonels of the Iberian navy. The mood within is grim, as an Admiral begins the briefing.\n\n"Caudillos, three days ago at 1100 hours, an Iberian passenger ship known as the Santa Maria departed from port in Caracas. Within two hours of her departure, contact was temporarily lost. Today at 1400 hours, we have received a communique from the West Indies Federation, detailing their discoveries surrounding the vessel. This morning, the Santa Maria temporarily docked in Saint Lucia, offloading four injured crewmen for medical attention, before quickly departing once again. As the crewmen spoke only Portuguese, it was not until after the departure of the Santa Maria that local authorities could appropriately discern the situation onboard. Caudillos, the Santa Maria and her nine-hundred occupants, including American and other foreign nationals, are currently held hostage by approximately two dozen pro-democracy terrorists. The leader of the terrorists is said to be Henrique Galvão, however we are currently attempting to confirm these claims. A civilian maritime advisory has already been issued, however our naval forces are not ready to conduct a Caribbean search."\n\nThe room descends into an eerie silence as the Caudillos absorb the gravity of the situation. Quickly, Franco chimes in. "If there are Americans being held hostage by these terrorists, we must contact the American government immediately! They will not stand for this!" exclaims Franco.\n\n"No! We should not draw attention to these terrorists. Galvão has received enough attention for his treasonous actions. He should not receive any further recognition." Salazar retorts. The two descend into a fiery argument as the rest of the room awkwardly looks on."

 iberia.304.t:0 "Americans on a Hijacked Iberian Ship"
 iberia.304.d:0 "Today, news reached the offices of the Pentagon of a crisis upon the seas. The Iberian Government as well as the West Indies Federation report of a hijacked passenger ship, known as the Santa Maria. The ship was days ago hijacked by a group of radical Iberian democrats who boarded disguised as passengers, and has since gone off the radar following a quick stop in Saint Kitts, in which crewmen injured in the hijacking were offloaded. Aboard the ship are six-hundred passengers, consisting of women, children, and civilian men. Many of those aboard the ship are Iberian, however the Pentagon confirms that several occupants are American citizens.\n\nIt is possible that all those aboard the ship could meet a violent end, should all go awry, which would include the death of several American citizens at the hands of foreign terrorists. The American public would find such news unacceptable. As such, the only advisable course of action would be to commence a naval search operation to find the Santa Maria, and to liberate those on board. There are several United States Navy vessels in the Caribbean and central-atlantic region, which are prepared to commence search operations upon a moment's notice."

 iberia.305.t:0 "The Marine Raiders"
 iberia.305.d:0 "Corporal Smithley is the last in his squad to climb aboard the Santa Maria under the cover of nightfall. He carefully unslings his M14 rifle from his back, and as quietly as possible does a check of his loaded magazine, ensuring a round is readily prepared within the chamber. The intent of the mission is clear. Act fast, ensure civilians are not harmed, and take prisoner as many of the hijackers as possible. As soon as the first shot is fired, the hijackers will mobilize.\n\nThe squad leader gives a short series of hand signals, and they begin to move slowly across the dimly lit deck of the ship.\n\nNot long after, contact is made. The squad leader quickly releases two shots into the armed hijacker patrolling the deck, and the hijacker goes limp. Now that shots have been fired, the marines spring into action. Shots ring out from the other side of the deck, as other hijackers are likely killed. Smithley accompanies his squad in climbing an outer staircase of the ship, as they prepare for close quarters combat upon entering the bridge. The order is given to fix bayonets, and Smithley quickly affixes the ringed bayonet to the socket upon the barrel. Commotion can now be heard from within the ship, as several men begin shouting. Gunshots can be heard from other areas of the ship, as other marine squads quickly dispatch the oddly placed and unprepared hijackers.\n\nSmithley's squad quickly arrives at the entrance to the bridge, from where the ship is controlled. The squad leader begins counting down the entry. Finally, the count hits one, and he springs into action along with the rest of his squad. Quickly, they rush in to the bridge. Smithley, without thinking, dispatches one armed defender before a shot is fired. The other armed men within the bridge drop their rifles, and swiftly surrender to preserve their own life."

 iberia.306.t:0 "The Americans Capture Galvão"
 iberia.306.d:0 "Reports have today arrived from the United States Navy that the Santa Maria has been secured. A contingent of United States Marines aboard the USS Hermitage were able to successfully board the Santa Maria in the dark early hours of the morning. Seven hijackers were killed, and no civilians or crewmen who were hostages upon the ship were harmed. The other seventeen hijackers were captured by the United States Navy, and placed under custody. Among those captured is Henrique Galvão, who surrendered himself to marine forces once they swiftly stormed the bridge of the ship.\n\nThe United States has already agreed to extradite the Iberian hijackers to us, to be dealt with by our legal system. The Americans, after questioning Galvão, have alerted us of his intentions. The intent of the hijacking was to sail the ship to Portugal, where he intended to incite rebellion within Iberia. Should he have succeeded, he could have proven a true thorn in our side. Our concerns are not dispelled, however. While this one pro-democracy rebel is now in our custody, he did not act alone. There are others within Iberia who would risk their lives to fight for a democratic cause."

 iberia.307.t:0 "Hijackers Broadcast Speech from Cuba"
 iberia.307.d:0 "From Cuba, a radio broadcast emits. One which the Iberians had never expected nor hoped to hear. Radios across the world crackle to life with the voice of Henrique Galvão, who has recently eluded our capture. He now broadcasts a radio address from Cuba, where he and his hijackers of the Santa Maria have been granted refuge.\n\nGalvão's broadcast much resembles the inflammatory media statements he gave when he was a Captain in the Iberian Navy. This speech, however, is far more radical. Calling for democracy in Iberia, Galvão encourages the Iberian people to take up arms and to oppose the regime of the Caudillos in any way they can. He claims that any Iberian man or woman can make large strides to remove the Caudillos from office, and that should they wish for a brighter future, they should act radically.\n\nWhilst this speech was little more than revolutionary rubbish, many of our people are abuzz with inspiration from the vile broadcast. The Iberian media has been ordered not to cover the incident in any capacity, however around the globe newspapers are choked full of editorials and articles upon the supposed "Iberian democratic movements". This is a wound that we cannot mask."

 iberia.308.d:0 "A flood of occupants begin to offload from a large passenger ship, as the media and an emotional populace surround the arriving vessel. After several weeks of tension and uncertainty, the hostages of the Santa Maria have returned to Iberia. Although internationally considered to be a terrorist, Henrique Galvão and his band of hijackers did not kill any on board the Santa Maria during the seizure of the ship. Following their refuge in Cuba, the Cuban government agreed to provide transportation back to Iberia for the approximate 900 hostages of the vessel.\n\nA wave of teary-eyed friends and family rush forth to meet the disembarking crowd, as the cameras of the media flash in the backdrop. Many among the country feared that many, and even perhaps all, of the hostages would never return to Iberian shores. Contrary to concerns, however, all hostages have now been accounted for. As not all hostages were Iberian citizens, preparations are currently underway to ensure the swift return of foreign nationals to their home countries.\n\nWhilst this represents a major humiliation to Iberia upon the world stage, many count their blessings as their loved ones return home safely from a frightening voyage."

 iberia.309.t:0 "Salazar Pushes Involvement in South African War"
 iberia.309.d:0 "Within the high governmental offices in Madrid, yet another disagreement erupts between the Caudillos. Following the outbreak of the South African War, the German and American spheres have thrown their weight behind the factions of the Boer Republic and the Dominion of South Africa, respectively. As the conflict drags on, concerns within Iberia grow that the German backed African powers may soon overrun the Dominion of South Africa, creating a dominance of the German sphere within Central to South Africa. The United States has grown increasingly involved in the conflict, with a growing American force being committed to the South African War to prop up the Dominion government.\n\nSalazar argues to an unconvinced Franco that the Iberian nation would benefit greatly through intervention in South Africa. While the front lines of this conflict are far from home, assistance to the Dominion of South Africa against the Germans and the Boers could provide a barrier to the further expansion of German influence within the African continent. Furthermore, Salazar argues that within a continent rife with the rise of new nations, significant favor and influence over a well established state such as South Africa could prove an essential strategic stepping stone in the expansion and maintenance of Iberian influence globally.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to come to the formal agreement required for any official action to take place, Salazar is unrelenting in his proposals, believing firmly in the necessity of Iberian intervention in South Africa. If either of the Caudillos is to be moved in his opinion, it is likely not to be Salazar."

Following the American intervention in the Santa Maria affair, where United States Marines secured the terrorist leader Henrique Galvão as well as ensuring the safety of nine hundred hostages, Franco feels indebted to the Americans. He agrees with Salazar that the Americans deserve steadfast support in their South African interventionism, and that Iberia should do all in its capacity to ensure that they do not stand alone in combating German influence in Africa.\n\nThe Caudillos immediately prepare the necessary measures to commence the planning of operations. Franco swiftly arranges for emergent meetings with the military high command, as Salazar calls for arrangements to be made with the Foreign Ministry to begin diplomatic engagements with the Americans and South Africans concerning the war. The cogs of the Iberian diplomatic machine begin turning."

While suspicious of Salazar's seemingly unending zeal to intervene in South Africa, Franco reluctantly agrees with Salazar of the benefits of a successful Iberian intervention in the South African conflict. Franco, however, is uncertain of Salazar's convictions that Iberia should become a near equal partner to the United States in the conflict. While he believes in the strategic value of the conflict, he does not share the same unending confidence as his counterpart.\n\nThe Caudillos immediately prepare the necessary measures to commence the planning of operations.

 iberia.312.t:0 "Iberia Offers Assistance in South Africa" #US PERSPECTIVE
 iberia.312.d:0 "This afternoon, the Iberian ambassador in Washington D.C. met with the President. The Iberian ambassador, in a move that has shocked many in our administration, has pledged the direct support of Iberia in the South African War. The ambassador claimed that, should the United States accept the offer of Iberian support in the conflict, Iberia is prepared to contribute significant and direct military combat support.\n\nAlthough wholly unexpected, this news has been welcomed by many in Washington. Previously, many Americans felt alienated within the conflict. It has been widely viewed as if we were standing alone. While the scale of Iberian support has yet to be confirmed, we have affirmed with the Iberian ambassador that we will accept their support without question. Furthermore, our military is poised to provide any aid possible to the Iberians in assisting with the commencement of their operations."

The Americans have, quite jubilantly, accepted our offer of support in South Africa, and will welcome our forces in addition to theirs in the conflict. In further support of our efforts, the Americans have pledged extensive logistical assistance to commence our operations in the region, to ensure a smooth operational launch.\n\nSalazar has proven to be quite elated following this news. Already, thousands of Portuguese soldiers are poised for deployment to South Africa, as thousands more conduct additional training to prepare for near-future deployments. Many in the public remain skeptical, however, of the significance of such a conflict. People question why Iberian men must be sent to perish in a conflict thousands of miles away, over a country with no true ties to Iberia. Regardless of skepticism, Salazar has the Portuguese war machine mobilizing as much as feasible, as the countdown to Iberian operations in South Africa begins."

 iberia.314.d:0 "Following a strenuous and expensive war in South Africa, we have finally emerged as a victor alongside the United States. While our contributions pale in comparison to the immense military investments sent forth by the United States, our efforts were nonetheless significant and fruitful. Following such efforts, Salazar stands firm in his belief that Iberia has earned a significant award for her efforts. More specifically, he states, he believes that Iberia has earned back her former Portuguese colonies in Africa.\n\nWhilst the return of the Portuguese colonies is a favourable fantasy for Salazar, reality is often disappointing. For Iberia to seize these lands for herself once again would likely act counter to the interests of nearly all powers in the region. While we may put forth the argument that we have amply paid for this return in blood, it remains highly uncertain whether the Americans will see things the same way. Regardless, Salazar stands firm that we must toss the dice, and formally request that the Americans permit the return of Iberian rule to former Portuguese colonial possessions."

Their sizeable contributions significantly aided in creating the conditions for victory over the Boers and the German sphere. The Iberians themselves are very well aware of this fact, and are thus attempting to leverage it to their best advantage.\n\nRecently, a signed letter from Caudillo Salazar, the Portuguese co-dictator of Iberia, arrived for the Predident. The nature of the letter, if one could get around the complexities of diplomatic writing, was a candid request. Salazar expresses to us that, following the significant Iberian contributions in South Africa, Iberia formally requests from the United States that Iberia be allowed to re-occupy her former Portuguese colonies, seized by the Germans in prior decades.\n\nWhilst we understand the Iberian desire to reclaim her former territories following a hard fought conflict, it would be near impossible to retain a positive moral image should we accept. Our public image was one of fighting for freedom and against German imperialism and aggression in the region. Should we allow Iberia her spoils of war, it would merely appear as replacing one colonial dictatorship with another. The Iberians will not be pleased to be denied, however for our own sake, we have but one choice."

The American President spared little time in garnering his reply to Salazar. In short, the United States has formally denied our request for the official return of Iberian governorship over the former Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThe President, in his reply, states: "The United States of America cannot, in good faith, guarantee to Iberia the return of any former colonial or other overseas territories and possessions. It was our goal in this costly war to combat the colonial sphere of an imperial oppressor, and to guarantee the self determination of the peoples of South Africa. With this, we believe the Iberian request to be contrary to this goal."\n\nSalazar, in a fury, has gone on at length in private of what he perceives as an American betrayal, claiming that the United States has denied Iberia a claim in the spoils of war. He continues on in saying that the Americans bled the Iberians for their own benefit, and that Iberia will never forget this betrayal.

As a result, once the war concluded and many of the soldiers were free from their contractual obligations to the military, several thousand Portuguese soldiers opted to settle down in South Africa, calling the country their new home, much like the Dutch and British settlers of old.\n\nWhilst these Portuguese settlers had no official status within South Africa, the South African government has recently announced a change to this status. All Portuguese individuals currently residing within South Africa, as a thanks for the immense volume of Portuguese soldiers who fought for them, have been granted official permanent residency status within South Africa. As such, the thousands of Portuguese expats may now legally pursue a largely unrestricted private life.\n\nThis move acts largely as a thanks from the South African government to the brave Portuguese men who put their lives at risk for the continued existence of the South African nation, and as a gesture towards the many who fell in the conflict."

 iberia.318.d:0 "Following the settlement of thousands of former Portuguese soldiers within South Africa after the war, many have taken quite well to their new life in the region. Few have taken better to this life better, however, than a former Iberian Army Corporal named Fernando Duarte.\n\nFernando was always regarded among his peers as a good cook, who would never fail to create a genuine good meal from simple ingredients. He utilized this talent within his new life in South Africa by opening a restaurant in Johannesburg. This restaurant, focused upon home-style cooking and flavourful chicken, has seen wild success, capturing the love and craze of the South African people.\n\nThe wild success of his first restaurant inspired Fernando to open another, and yet another, as thousands packed through the doors of his restaurant to have a taste of the famed Portuguese cooking. The restaurant, known as "Nandos", now boasts five restaurants already in its short existence. One having recently opened in Portugal, Fernando's native country, and four in South Africa, with several more likely coming in the years ahead. As Nandos continues to spread like wildfire, it has become a true success story of South African-Iberian cooperation."

Portuguese, American, and South African soldiers lay dead upon their rifles, their lives extinguished by the advance of the German sphere. The war in South Africa is lost. Just as lost as the lives of those men who lay dead in the streets of Cape Town.\n\nFollowing an expensive and strenuous effort by both the United States and Iberia to prop up the nation of South Africa against the overwhelming forces of the Afrika Schild, the adversity was one that could not be sufficiently overcome. As thousands of brave Portuguese volunteers were sent forth to die in a foreign land, the forces of the Schild continued to press ever farther south, until it was realized by all that this war was one that could not be won. The evacuation of South Africa was swift, with the United States undertaking a large effort to evacuate high value personnel from Cape Town. Tens of thousands of military men boarded ships and aircraft to retreat back home in the final weeks of the South African nation.\n\nAcross Iberia, the defeat in South Africa is seen as an irresponsible military disaster and a humiliation by nearly all, to the point that even Caudillo Franco has noticeably distanced himself from the South African intervention, all too glad to allow Salazar to receive the majority of the backlash for the intervention that was initially proposed by him."

What is widely known as "White psy-ops" is seen in virtually every theater of war, with the distribution of state-approved propaganda such as newspapers, posters, and leaflets among foreign populations and military ranks. What is lesser known, however, is what is known as "Black psy-ops".\n\nThroughout the South African War, Iberian psychological warfare units have conducted black psychological operations in an attempt to dissuade, demoralize, and convince enemy forces and populations. These initial operations have seen some limited success, however in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, they hope to expand the scope of their black psy-ops.\n\nThe Americans have been proven to be rather brutal yet effective in securing a stronger hold over South African territory. In conjunction with the South African government and Iberian psychological operations units, an operation has been undertaken known as the "Phoenix Program". This operation aims to conduct a covert psychological operation upon those in South Africa who may possibly lean to support the Schild or the Boers. Through exposure, public himiliation, arrest, and even torture, the CIA and Iberians conduct a campaign of terror among the civilian populace who lean in support of the enemy, aiming to neutralize the membership of hostile organizations. This is just one of many of the black psy-ops concocted by the CIA, from whom the Iberians have been taking ample notes."

Civilians in South Africa find themselves inadvertently caught in the crossfire of this bloody conflict, and as a result, many become a casualty of war.\n\nIn the chaos of the city streets, many speak of Portuguese saviours who run through the deadly corridors, rescuing those in need. These stories, while they may appear to be fantastical, are in fact grounded in reality.\n\nAccounts from across the conflict in South Africa tell of Portuguese medics of the Iberian army coming to the aid of those in peril, risking their own life and limb to do so. Hundreds of South Africans claim to have been in some way rescued by these medics, operating far outside the scope of their mission in order to provide any assistance possible for the South African populace caught in zones of conflict. The actions of these men have truly become the make of legend."

 iberia.322.d:0 "As the war in South Africa continues to ramp up, so does the involvement of our Iberian partners. The Iberians, much to our pleasure, have stood behind their commitments within the conflict, and have continued to provide much coveted support for our forces as well as those of our allies. In a recent communication, the Iberians have pledged a significant expansion to their existing support within the war. The communication to Washington D.C. outlines many intricacies and details of current Iberian intentions within the conflict, however one pledge within the document stands out from the others.\n\nThe Iberian island of São Tome, which rests just north of the Equator, not far off the coasts of Central and West Africa, carries great potential as a logistics hub for the duration of this conflict. Following the establishment of Iberian operations in South Africa, they now believe the situation to be appropriate to lease access to the island to us, granting us an invaluable logistical asset. Senior military officials believe that the ports of São Tome may be effectively used as a logistics waypoint, and further as a possible airbase for our bomber aircraft fleet.\n\nWhilst plans for the usage of the island remain in the preliminary stages, we have gratefully accepted the Iberian lease proposal, and it is estimated that logistical operations upon the island will commence in a matter of mere months."

 iberia.323.t:0 "Stalemate in South Africa"
 iberia.323.d:0 "As the hills of South Africa grow scarred with the damages of war, and the great pastures become choked with the corpses of young men, no victor can be determined. When once, one might say the Boers had the upper hand, and at other times people may have talked of an impending American victory, no such talk takes place any longer. The war is not lost, yet neither has it been won.\n\nAs thousands of Iberian, primarily Portuguese, men now lay dead in South Africa, thousands more back home mourn for their losses in a conflict far overseas, in a land no more relevant to them than the shores of Alaska. In the grievance of their insurmountable loss, many have begun to question the war, and the motives behind Iberian involvement. The people look to Salazar for answers, yet he has none to provide for them.\n\nWhen once Salazar would have spoken at length of a restoration of Iberian glory and an Iberian resurgence upon the world stage, now he says nothing. Salazar knows the war is by no means a success, and the fervor he once held for the Iberian intervention has been all but extinguished, as has all hope of victory."

 iberia.324.t:0 "Iberia Provides Maps for War Effort"
 iberia.324.d:0 "While Portuguese colonial administration over Mozambique and Angola is a thing of the past, naught more than a mention within the history books, the recency of this history now has the potential to pay dividends within the war effort.\n\nIn a recent coordination effort, hosted in Washington, senior members of the Iberian military provided to us a plethora of dated maps and documentation, hailing from the late era of Portuguese colonial control in Mozambique and Angola. The content of the documents provided details, at great length, upon the industrial and infrastructural specifications in various vital regions within Mozambique and Angola, now controlled by the Reichskommissariats of the Afrika Schild. We estimate that the maps, while outdated, are likely to this day accurate to a high degree. The information provided by the Iberians should prove invaluable for the continued effectiveness of the American bombing campaign against our enemies, as we begin to accurately strike at vital enemy logistical and industrial centers."

 iberia.325.d:0 "Following an exchange of information between the Iberian and American militaries, the USAF has been in possession of detailed information upon the logistical and industrial layout of the Afrika Schild controlled regions of Mozambique and Angola. The intelligence has not been left to waste.\n\nYesterday afternoon, USAF bombers struck at industrial centers within Luanda, where significant arms production has been undertaken for the duration of the conflict in South Africa. Due to information provided by Iberian intelligence, American bombs were able to fall with deadly accuracy upon essential edifices within the local industry, causing irreparable damages and bringing a significant share of arms production in the region to a complete halt.\n\nDue to the quick and devastating nature of the new American bombing campaign, it is hoped by many senior officials that the productive capabilities of the Reichskommissariats will be significantly hindered for the duration of the conflict. Despite this, the overall effect of the reinvigorated American bombing campaign upon the overall effectiveness of the Afrika Schild has yet to be determined."

 POLITICS_FRANCISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "While internationally a divisive figure, it cannot be denied that Caudillo Francisco Franco clawed his way to his position through merit. With the German victory in WW2, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal approached Franco to create a protective union against the Germans. Spain found itself uniting with Portugal in a comprehensive defence-pact-turned nation.\n\nBut of course, that was the past. In the last decade, Franco has been witness to insurmountable calamities. The disaster of the Atlantropa project destroyed the economy, and Germany going into utter freefall obliterated what little remained. His erstwhile allies in the Triumvirate are at each other's throats, ready to drop all pretence of unity over the slightest dispute. The colonization of Algeria in the 1950s, considered a proud accomplishment, has revealed itself as a double-edged sword that has dragged his nation into constant conflict with Italy. Salazar's unfounded notions of a non-existent "Law of Succession", that would see Portugal absorbed into Spain under the reinstated Spanish monarchy after both Caudillos had died, has raised questions about the future of Iberia under Franco. An attempted coup by old shirt Falangists was only just stopped through their removal from power by Franco.\n\nIberia, once proud, has fallen on hard times, and even the Caudillo himself has begun to doubt their ability to stay unified, though he'd never admit this to anybody. He can see the writing on the wall, and deep down he feels that it's only a matter of time before all that he's worked for comes crashing down around him."

 POLITICS_ANTONIO_DE_OLIVEIRA_SALAZAR_IBERIA_DESC:0 "It would be quite unfair to dismiss Antonio de Olivera Salazar, the leader of Portugal since 1932, as merely an obstructive bureaucrat. Coming to power in Portugal a few years before Franco gained control of Spain, Salazar was a political power player in his own right. Only under the pressure of German troops seizing Angola and Mozambique did he decide to accept a deal with his own personal devil. When Franco approached Salazar to create a defensive-pact-turned-nation, he accepted, merging Portugal with the similarly right-wing nation of Spain. Now the Iberian Union, the two countries would work together in harmony... at least in theory.\n\nIn actuality, however, this could not be further from the truth. Salazar was not concerned with the welfare of the Union so much as the welfare of Portugal. Wielding a desire to protect his nation from anything that might harm her in the one hand, and an almost pathological obsession with vetoing proposals that would solidify the Union further in the other, Salazar quickly gained a reputation in the Council for being obstructive. His paranoia concerning "Spanish oppression of Portugal" led to many a confrontation with Franco himself, who saw him as one of many reasons why Iberia was likely to fall apart. With Franco's attempted passing of the "Law of Succession", meaning Portugal's absorption into Spain through the reinstallation of the monarchy after the deaths of the Caudillos, the divide between the two was firmly set. This was despite Salazar removing old shirt falangist elements who had attempted to stage a coup against the Union."

 POLITICS_MANUEL_FRAGA_DESC:0 "To some, Manuel Fraga Iribarne is the champion of the new democratic Iberia, a firm and fair leader who can keep the country from falling apart in the aftermath of the transition to democracy. To others, Fraga is just another Falangist, a holdover from the old regime whose project is to retain the economic and political legacy of the dictatorship while giving the same old authoritarianism a new, modern sheen. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. \n\nA lawyer by trade, Fraga's involvement in politics goes back to the 1950's, when he held various minor posts in the regime of the Caudillos. His big break came when he was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism, where he earned a name for himself by revitalizing the Iberian tourism industry, leading a campaign under the slogan "Iberia is different!" In the 60's Fraga also earned an unsavory reputation for his role as a propagandist for the regime, publicly justifying the execution of political prisoners such as Julian Grimau. Despite his complicity in the worst abuses of the Caudillos, Fraga became a part of a reformist faction within the regime, seeking to move Iberia in the direction of democracy. When the rule of the Caudillos ended, he formed the Alianza Popular, an alliance of various smaller parties led by former reformist ministers in the old regime. \n\nElected to a majority in Iberia's first democratic elections, Fraga and the Alianza Popular now seek to strike a balance between reform and order, bringing Iberia into the 20th century and doing away with the old institutions while also keeping the country together against the forces of political extremism and separatism."

With President Valcarcel's failed attempt to destroy the Iberian Council and re-establish a dictatorial regime, Fraga was forced to band together with the other democratic parties in what is now known as the Democratic Salvation Coalition. Thrust into the position of President, he must now keep the unruly transitional coalition alive long enough to deal with the Unión Nacional and ensure the continuation of Iberian democracy."
 
 POLITICS_ALBERTO_ULLASTRES_DESC:0 "Ullastres Calvo was born on the eve of only the first of the many unfathomable catastrophes that seized the reins of the 20th century. He dedicated his early years in Madrid to attaining a strong education, graduating first in Law and Commerce and later obtaining his doctorate. Initially working as professor for Political Economy he soon found his way into serving for the newly established Iberian administration. His economic knowledge was greatly needed as the Union took a harsh economic hit from the 1950s German Financial Crash and the animosity between the Unity Pakt and the Triumvirate.\n\nQuickly working his way up the civil service ladder he was soon screened for ministerial positions. Reservations about his revealed close connections to the highly religious order Opus Dei remained but Ullastres managed to finally serve as trade minister for the Union. The longer he served however the more disillusioned he became with the current direction of the Union, especially its economic policy. So when Iberia's democratisation succeeded he finally decided to act. Along with fellow business reform minded people within the administration and private organizations, amongst them notably Opus Dei, he formed the Partido Renovador Democrático. The party advocated for cutting more government restrictions in the economy and generally scaling back the size of the state. These they argued would bring greater prosperity to the people of Iberia and ensure the capacity of the Union to withstand modern challenges. With lofty promises and great propaganda Ullastres and the party were able to seize the reins of control. They could now begin to shape the future."
 
 POLITICS_TORCUATO_FERNANDEZ_MIRANDA_DESC:0 "Born on the north coast of Spain in 1915 Torcuato Fernández-Miranda enjoyed an education in law before joining the civil war and leaving the conflict as lieutenant. Proceeding to make use of his education he started work as a law professor at the University of Oviedo. His connections to the Francoist regime would however not be limited to the civil conflict. Apparently picked by Franco himself, Fernández-Miranda was chosen to serve in the education department of the new Iberian state. He was reported to be an effective civil servant yet questioned on his political beliefs at times.\n\nOnly when he was able to rise higher in the state apparatus did he choose to disclose some of his leanings. Believing that the Union desperately required a democratic transition to continue thriving and not falling to the traps of ethnic tensions and representation. He soon became a solid part of the reformist faction of the government. Watching as inactivity and caution however reined in men like Fraga and other conservatives he realized the path for the Union required a different path. Creating a new faction around him he was able to garner the support of those with more radical views on democratization and social issues. He now steers towards providing a better and more fair future for the Iberian peninsula."

 POLITICS_ALEJANDRO_VALCARCEL_DESC:0 "Alejandro Rodriguez de Valcarcel is a man from another era.\n\nBorn in 1917 in the closing hours of World War I, the man had little of note occur to him until the Spanish Civil War. A dedicatet falangist, Valcarcel served in a falangist militia during the civil war. A student of law, Valcarcel was unable to finish his studies until after the war had concluded.\n\nThe man led an uneventful life for much of the 50's and some of the 60's, serving as a medium-level provincial governor. He slowly worked up the ranks of Iberia, and by the middle of the 1960's he held high government offices in service to the state. He was noted by Franco for his apathy towards reforms, as he did not like them, but did little to stop them.\n\nOnce Iberia democratized, he saw that his livelihood was being put in dire risk, as with the rest of the politicians of his sort. He later took the role of their leader, rallying all the old guard politicians behind him to create the new Unión Nacional, a party made from the merger of the União Nacional and the Falange.\n\nValcarcel may have won the election, but he has not won the war. Now that he is in power, it falls to him to bring back the Iberia of old, where the Falange reigned supreme. Valcarcel is a man from another era, and if he has his way, then Iberia shall return to it."
 
 POLITICS_ALFONSO_ARMADA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Armada Comyn has found himself reliving his glory days.\n\nBorn in 1920 to a family with a history of fighting and warfare, he was quick to pick up the tradition for himself. Deeply religious, it is easy to say that the apple didn't fall far from the tree. At the young age of 16, he opted to carry on his family's legacy in the best way possible - saving Spain from Bolshevism. After fighting through all of Spain, he later joined the Blue Division and participated in the Fall of Leningrad, aiming to help save a second country from Bolshevism.\n\nBy the late 1940's, Alfonso had become a military instructor in several different academies. He was a natural choice for promotion, from a mixture of genuine talent and political compatibility.\n\nDemocracy treated the man very poorly. He hated every facet, every moment of the system, but for the sake of his job he bit his tongue. He learned greatly from his comrades, who lost their positions for their protests. When the new democracy began to tear down Franco's legacy, he reached his limit. He secretly organized a coup, so that he may save Iberia from Bolshevism once more.\n\nAlfonso Armada shall see himself Caudillo, and he will ensure that Iberia's new state does not repeat the mistakes that made the old Caudillos weak."
 
 POLITICS_ANTONIO_SPINOLA_DESC:0 "António de Spínola was born in 1910 in Estremoz, in what was formerly Portugal. He had a very uneventful childhood, and his path to leadership began in 1920, when he entered the Military School of Lisbon. He learned there for eight more years, and his education paid off when he was made commander of the National Republican Guard. Come 1940, he was sent to Germany to observe their troops operate during Barbarossa.\n\nAntónio was never one for political involvement, finding that politics got in the way of his duties as commander. Even so, he always leaned towards the conservative side of things - though how much this truly showed itself is debatable. This effort clearly worked, since Spinola kept being granted promotion after promotion. It was joked that he would be a Caudillo before 1970, with how fast he was promoted.\n\nWhen Franco died, the Council could not find anyone else to replace his spot as President, and it increasingly seemed like Iberia would have to make do with only Caetano. That is, before Spinola intervened. Through some "surprise politics", he was found Franco's successor.\n\nHe may not have been a Caudillo by 1970, but he still came exceptionally close. Now, with politics as the forefront of his duty, Spinola has set to ensuring that Iberia stays content within its status quo, by any means necessary."
 
 POLITICS_MANUEL_MELLADO_DESC:0 "Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado was born in 1912, in Madrid. Orphaned at a very young age, he relied on his uncle to provide him with what he needed in order to continue studies. He entered the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1929, which was then headed by Francisco Franco. Under Franco's tutelage, he also joined the Falange in 1935. During the civil war, he was quick to distinguish himself and rapidly rose through the ranks, assisting in the operations of the secret police. When World War II broke out, he joined the Blue Division as one of its high commanders, overseeing their operations from Berlin.\n\nAfter the war, Mellado continued to obtain promotions. He was seen by his peers as a righteous man, and despite his lack of political commitment, his strong moral compass often landed him as a reformist. He had no particular attachment to them, but their proposals often found a champion in him.\n\nWhen the Iberian Council lost its grip on the country, they began to take drastic measures to keep their grip. The Council's desperate flailing came to a head when Mellado was ordered to fire upon protestors. Enough was enough.\n\nNow, Mellado has been appointed the provisional President of Iberia. Now, he must create a democracy from a state that did its hardest to stop it. Manuel Mellado wants the best for the Iberian people, but can he achieve this before the infighting consumes Iberia?"
 
 POLITICS_IBERIAN_COUNCIL_PRE68:0 "Every country needs a leader, and Iberia is no exception. However, how do you determine the sole, singular leader of a state when it has two equal leaders?

 caudillo.1.t:0 "The Struggle for Popularity"
 caudillo.1.d:0 "The unification of the Iberian peninsula had been a tumultuous if necessary task. In order to prevent divisive social and political issues from tearing the new country apart, both leaders of the previously separate nations agreed to hold a position of power that shared equal political standing. They became the Caudillos of Iberia, the saviours of a union besieged.\n\nHowever, neither man is entirely satisfied with their current standing and constantly wrestle for power and influence. To do this they use the sway of interest groups such as regional ethnicities or corporate interests. Hence the ever changing political arena of high Iberian politics is a scene to behold, with both Caudillos unwilling to let the other gain ultimate control of the nation."
