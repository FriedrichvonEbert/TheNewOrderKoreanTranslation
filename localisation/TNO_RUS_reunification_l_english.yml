In fact, their forces have been concentrating heavily on our borders these past few days, and everyone can see the writing on the walls. Only two forces remain in Russia - the war that is to come shall be long and bloody, but the triumphant one will be the force to unify our people once and for all."

 russia_unification.22.t:0 "Declaration of Friendship Rejected"
 russia_unification.22.d:0 "Unfortunate news has come bearing from [FROM.GetNameDef].  They do not seem to be reciprocating our desire for an alliance in these dark times. What's more, the political capital necessary to expend in order to do this again is too much of a cost worth taking in the eyes of many in our government. We'll have to try somewhere else."
 russia_unification.22.a:0 "A path is closed."

 russia_unification.23.t:0 "Declaration of Friendship Accepted"
 russia_unification.23.d:0 "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted the agreement to bring our two governments closer. This should have an immediate effect of boosting relations between our two countries, and perhaps even begin stirring sentiments about a potential unification process."
 russia_unification.23.a:0 "Russia marches down the path of one country."

 russia_unification.24.t:0 "NAP Proposed"
 russia_unification.24.d:0 "After having agreed to a mutual declaration of friendship, [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached us with yet another offer. To cement our status as allies, they recommend that the border between our nations is only reduced to a skeleton crew of soldiers. This will show a sign that we do not need to fear each other, and that our population can rest at east knowing that one frontier is safe. Do we accept?"
 russia_unification.24.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 russia_unification.24.b:0 "Reject the treaty."

 russia_unification.25.t:0 "NAP Rejected"
 russia_unification.25.d:0 "While we have managed to get into step one with binding ourselves closer with [FROM.GetNameDef], they've unfortunately denied our non-aggression pact for reasons we cannot fully ascertain. Though our relations are not hostile, there is some disappointment in this fact. Trying again may backfire, so we will simply rest on what we have."
 russia_unification.25.a:0 "A shame."

 russia_unification.26.t:0 "NAP Accepted"
 russia_unification.26.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] has accepted our non-aggression pact! The effects of it shall come into play immediately, and if both sides are strict on enforcing it, it should mean lasting peace between our two nations. Not only that, the pact will bring a sense of solidarity in the war-torn lands of Russia."
 russia_unification.26.a:0 "Onwards!"

 russia_unification.27.t:0 "Foreign Trade Deal Proposed"
 russia_unification.27.d:0 "Previously, our nation and [FROM.GetNameDef] have had limited, if any, exports and imports between each other. However, they've approached us with an offer. To loosen border restrictions and let goods flow between it, citing that it would only bring prosperity to both sides. If we do accept, we could also negotiate an enlarged agreement, which would be purchasing a large supply of goods from them, as a way to entice our economy as well as being a sign of good-will. What do we do?"
 russia_unification.27.a:0 "Accept the deal and propose a counter-offer."
 russia_unification.27.b:0 "Loosen border restrictions."
 russia_unification.27.c:0 "Refuse the deal."

 russia_unification.28.t:0 "Our Partners Accept!"
 russia_unification.28.d:0 "It seems like [From.GetNameDef] has done more than just accept our trade deal. They've come to us with a sort of counter-offer. A large, immediate purchase of raw and refined goods from us. The offer was tempting enough that there was no real reason to refuse, and now the border between our two countries can finally begin to relax!"
 russia_unification.28.a:0 "Prosperity comes a deal at a time."

 russia_unification.29.t:0 "Our Partners Accept!"
 russia_unification.29.d:0 "We can now begin proper trading with [From.GetNameDef]! The goods from their country will flow into ours, and so shall ours into theirs. There is a healthy profit margin expected to come out of this, and we will be all the better for it."
 russia_unification.29.a:0 "Prosperity comes a deal at a time."

 russia_unification.30.t:0 "Our Partners Decline"
 russia_unification.30.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has seen it fit to deny our trade deal. This news comes to us as highly unfortunate - the potential for a trading partner in war-torn Russia has now decreased by one state. If we wish to expand our economy like this, we must shift our focus elsewhere."
 russia_unification.30.a:0 "Not every attempt is a success."

 russia_unification.31.t:0 "Incentivizing Our Allies"
 russia_unification.31.d:0 "It's come to the point where sentiments [From.GetNameDef] have grown so high that there is a significant portion of the populace that shares ideas about binding our nations together into one. We could take advantage of this fact by covertly sending funds to groups that are sympathetic to our cause - and there are two ways about this. First, we can do this discreetly, only sending a minor amount of funds that would provide a mild boost in popularity. This has a very low chance of backfiring on us, and isn't going to be a major step forward, but something is better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we could begin publicly endorsing pro-unification groups within [From.GetNameDef]. If this is successful, we could get a large boost of support. If not, this may work against us and cause relations to sour between our government and theirs. What decision shall we make?"
 russia_unification.31.a:0 "Discreetly support pro-unification groups."
 russia_unification.31.b:0 "Support them openly."
 
 russia_unification.32.t:0 "Public Support for Unification Increases!"
 russia_unification.32.d:0 "More and more of our citizens have begun voicing the opinion that [ROOT.GetName] and [From.GetNameDef] will follow a better destiny if they are one nation. We will eye this growing sentiment with caution, as it can be as much of a force of good as it can be of ill."
 russia_unification.32.a:0 "Let's see if this goes anywhere."

 russia_unification.33.t:0 "Public Support for Unification Greatly Increases!"
 russia_unification.33.d:0 "Many voices are beginning to cheer on the idea that [ROOT.GetName] and [From.GetNameDef]  should pursue unification. A large number of our populace is now in open support of that idea - and we will have to keep a close track on just where this situation leads, if we wish to make advantage of this fact or to keep them in check."
 russia_unification.33.a:0 "Sentiment grows."

 russia_unification.34.t:0 "Foreign Influence Revealed!"
 russia_unification.34.d:0 "Our government has received word that [From.GetNameDef] is attempting to influence our politics to be more receptive towards unification! We must make a decision immediately. Will we begin attempting to curb this influence, or shall we make token attempts to steer our own government's wheel, and let these sentiments rise?"
 russia_unification.34.a:0 "Curb this subversive influence."
 russia_unification.34.b:0 "Unification is our goal, let them be."

 russia_unification.35.t:0 "Our Efforts Condemned!"
 russia_unification.35.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has rejected our funding! It seems as if they would rather determine what they shall do on their own terms, rather than us giving them a push they could use. While this has had a negative effect of growing suspicions between their government and ours, it hasn't completely ruined talks of unification - even if it turned out to be a waste of funds."
 russia_unification.35.a:0 "Diplomacy marches on."

 russia_unification.36.t:0 "Amnesty for our Efforts"
 russia_unification.36.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has been quiet in their reaction about our public endorsement of the various pro-unification groups in their country. If they were against it, there was no reason to be silent about our interference, but they seem content with letting us meddle in their affairs. We are grateful for that, and in time, so shall their citizens."
