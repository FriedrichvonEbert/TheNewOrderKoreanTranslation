Many people pass through there every day, but there's a particular group of people that stand out. Fielding an advertisement agency, we've picked up on the fact that their mannerisms and way of speaking seems... awfully Burgundian. The RND will investigate these men, and figure out if they truly are agents of Himmler."

SGR_RND_infiltrate_us_banking_desc:0 "It's been confirmed. The Black State of Europe has spread its nasty tendrils to the U.S.A.

Within the warlord states lives someone named Boris Smyslovsky; an old friend of Gehlen's, and an untermensch to the Reich. It doesn't matter to him, however. He serves Vyatka, which is a regime that could be potentially friendly to us, so we will covertly send him aid in order to strengthen their chances of victory. As well as to help a time-tested ally of his."

Whatever they're doing, we can assume that they're there to cause chaos.

SGR_Gehlen_RND_leader_desc:0 "The greatest spymaster of the Cold War, the man responsible for victory in the shadows of World War Two, staunch supporter of the Reich against Bolshevists and Himmlerites alike - this is the reputation Reinhard Gehlen has carefully forged around himself, no matter what foreign eyes may say to the contrary.\n\n'Reinhard the Fox' or 'Kleiner Fuchs', as he goes by these days, is a man of many connections and accomplishments. His strong enmity with Heinrich Himmler since the days of Fremde Heere Ost and ambition to unify the German swamp of intelligence agencies into one led him to this very point, as the President of the Reichsnachrichtendienst.\n\nYet, just as in the Second World War, Germany is in danger - and just as Fremde Heere Ost was not sufficient to Gehlen then, the Reichsnachrichtendienst is only a stepping stone for him. It would be wise to not underestimate the Fox and his ambition."

SGR_Wessel_RND_leader:0 "§YGerhard Wessel§!"
SGR_Wessel_RND_leader_desc:0 "There is no man who has influenced the German intelligence community as much as Reinhard Gehlen, and no man who aided him more than Gerhard Wessel. Friends and colleagues since the days of Fremde Heere Ost, Wessel soon distinguished himself as a man of iron stoicism, yet eloquent demeanor and sharp mind. Too sharp even for his former friend, in the end.\n\nFar from an ideologue, Wessel's leading principle is safety and stability for the Reich and the German people. This also means doing away with the Reichsnachrichtendienst's nature as a shady cabal it gained under Gehlen, instead transforming it into a service that is truly determined to protect not only the Führer or the Party but Germans as a whole.\n\nIn removing Gehlen from his control over the Reichsnachrichtendienst, the Reich gained - and the Führer, perhaps, lost. It remains to be seen if Wessel's loyalty to the people may bring him into conflict with the Führer."

Already having played a significant role during the Second World War, the importance of SIGINT has only increased since then.

It does not take a genius to realize the potential in space-based surveillance of the Reich's enemies - far out of range of their ability to intervene, and as such able to observe them in peace. quipped with 24-inch focal length cameras and several thousand feet of film, these probes will be launched into space and take photographs of our enemies' lands, to be recovered following mission end by plane."

Should this be the case, then clouding the minds of potential liars should make it harder for them to lie - therefore, perhaps, make it more likely for them to resort to telling the truth. One such way to cloud their minds would be through barbiturates, the same ones used as general anesthetics, applied in just the right dosage. It is not quite the "truth serum" one could hope to have, but it is close enough."
