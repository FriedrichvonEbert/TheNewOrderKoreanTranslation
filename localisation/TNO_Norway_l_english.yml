 ## National Focuses ##
 # Initial Tree
 nor_light_of_the_reich:0 "The Light of The Germanic Empire"
 nor_light_of_the_reich_desc:0 "The northernmost tip of the Großgermanisches Reich, Reichskommissariat Norwegen is the proverbial light of Germania's ever powerful fiefdom. Under the skillful administration of Reichskommissar Josef Terboven and Minister President Gulbrand Lunde, the Norwegian nation-state is in a far more favourable economic and social position than prior to the war. Our stability is proof enough for our masters of the superiority of the Nordic-Aryan race, for we have become an important clog in the machine of the Reich and without us, the Großgermanisches Reich is nothing, we are their greatest ideological and economic asset."
 nor_tackling_civil_disobedience:0 "Tackling Civil Disobedience"
 nor_tackling_civil_disobedience_desc:0 "Two decades following the establishment and legitimization of our regime those whom resist our mandate of governance continue to cause issues for society as a whole. Regardless of the continually favourable social and economic situation the state finds itself in. Those who foolishly wish to disrupt the workable authoritative model of, the 'Führerprinzip', have begun an unexpected and ferocious campaign of disobedience and passive resistance against governing powers at-be. As a result, methods of countering said rise in disobedient passivism will be enacted by the state, to protect the majority whom wisely align with our national goals."
 nor_search_the_underground:0 "Search the Underground"
 nor_search_the_underground_desc:0 "Regardless of our attempts to brutally suppress the 'Milorg', who dare challenge our rightful mandate of governance, the Bolshevik swine continue to undermine our regime through acts of intelligence gathering, sabotage, raids and espionage. Yet, seemingly simple act of detention cannot be applied in this circumstance, as the group operates under a cloud of anonymity. However, our unquestionably loyal informats who reside in the nation's proverbial underground have identified a potential area of group occupation. As a result of such information, we shall merecessely sweep societies underbelly till we locate these traitorous elements who continue to act counter to the wishes of society."
 nor_close_the_swedish_border:0 "Close the Swedish Border"
 nor_close_the_swedish_border_desc:0 "The tumour of representative democracy continues to deface the European continent, regardless of the Großgermanisches Reich's astonishing triumph, as the Kingdom of Sweden remains intact. Since the establishment of our regime decades ago, anti-government subversives have exploited our seemingly lackluster authority on the vast Norway–Sweden border. These subversive operatives have been able to illegally invade our borders with relative comfort, conduct their pathetic activities, and then cowardly flee back into Swedish territory. To protect the nation's citizenry from the fear of terrorism, we have no choice but to permanently close and militarize our border with Sweden, thus damaging the operational capabilities of the resistance."
 nor_enforcing_german_literacy:0 "Enforcing German Literacy"
 nor_enforcing_german_literacy_desc:0 "The 'Reichskommissariat' was envisioned as the transitional phases for the future incorporation of various Germanic countries outside pre-war Germany into an expanded Nazi state. Yet, this process of formal integration into the Reich can only commence once we have successfully 'Germanized' the population. As a result, in order to strengthen our ties to the Reich and hasten our eventual integration, we shall implement legislation which shall force Germanisation amongst the citizenry of the nation. Yet, we must start relatively slow, at least by our standards. Therefore, our first act will be to enforce German literacy among the populuous to better prepare them for impending integration and life directly under the German boot."
 nor_phasing_out_norwegian:0 "German-Norwegian History"
 nor_phasing_out_norwegian_desc:0 "To encourage further support for administrative integration into the Großgermanisches Reich, we must convince the population that we and the German people are one in the same. Now, how will we accomplish said goals? Simple! By placing greater emphasis on 'history', at least our doctored version that is. By informing the population of the great and wonderful historical stories of cooperation and friendship between German's and Norwegian's over the centuries, will hopefully be able to convince those who are perhaps somewhat opposed to our plan of proper integration into the Reich by showing the loving and gentle relationship between our two peoples."
 nor_disadvantage_the_disobedient:0 "Disadvantage the Disobedient"
 nor_disadvantage_the_disobedient_desc:0 "As a means of encouraging support among the population for integration, we must send a clear message to those who dare oppose our mandate to change. To sway the citizenry, we'll exploit human psychology. Regardless of race and inferiority, all humans strive to make the most of their pitiful existence and achieve happiness through high social standing and good living conditions. Therefore, those who are unwise enough to oppose us will be disadvantaged by the government, indirectly resulting in a loss of motivation and increasing of docile characteristics of obedience as those affected will only reclaim what they have achieved through the acceptance of eventual integration. Thereby improving conformity among the citizenry, who desire to maintain what they have worked for."
 nor_the_future_of_the_working_class:0 "The Future of the Working Class"
 nor_the_future_of_the_working_class_desc:0 "For centuries the Norwegian working class has been made up primarily by those who are more agriculturally inclined, as agrarian traditionalist thought has permeated throughout these ancient nordic plains for time untold. However, our continued adherence to traditionalist economic principles has left Reichskommissariat Norwegen suffering from a severe lack of industry. Yet, regardless of thought, some pragmatic government officials have suggested our administration begin training the latest generation of farmers to adapt to more mechanical methods of production, ultimately integrating them into the potential future industrial complexes that may one-day dominate Norway's landscape. However, many traditionalists within the government have noted that the abandonment of agrarian-based working class alignments is a direct betrayal of the National-Socialist ideology, thus resulting in significant resistance from our loyal rural constituents. But ultimately, neither-side has yet yielded to the other."
 nor_mandatory_transportation:0 "Mandatory Transportation"
 nor_mandatory_transportation_desc:0 "To truly embrace National-Socialist philosophy, we must continue to discourage any form of individualism in our citizenry, as the concept of the individual poses a great risk to the collective. Although this may seem ever so slightly overkill even for our regime, the usage of personal transportation is a danger to the stability of the collective, therefore it must be banned. Furthermore, by enforcing the usage of governmental transportation to places of work it will increase the state's capability to observe its citizens, thus potentially allowing for us to gain more influence over the minds of our countrymen."
 nor_tracking_when_youre_on_and_off:0 "Tracking When You're On And Off"
 nor_tracking_when_youre_on_and_off_desc:0 "With our implementation of mandatory government transportation, it has allowed our intelligence services to more effectively monitor our citizens. However, we should go a step further... to ensure proper societal cohesion and order, it's been suggested that we should take those whom happen to act somewhat suspicious into protective custody. Yet, what constitutes suspicious behavior? Well, those who choose to take an alternative route to their workplace shall be investigated and placed into custody, which seems extremely fair! By introducing more draconian laws for mild offenses we will be able to better track our citizen's actions and ensure that nobody is willingly breaking the law."
 nor_on_the_topic_of_illegal_media:0 "On the Topic of Illegal Media"
 nor_on_the_topic_of_illegal_media_desc:0 "Illegal media has always been an issue facing the Großgermanisches Reich and its Reichskommissariats, as those whom happen to dislike our regime continue to pointlessly spread anti-government propaganda, simply attempting to diminish our power and weaken social cohesion. In these trying times, we mustn't allow anyone to negatively impact society via the spread of illicit media. Therefore, with regard to the topic of illegal media, we must devote a greater number of resources to combating the spread of these highly dangerous and damaging pieces of media for the sake of the state."
 nor_gain_traction_on_crackdowns:0 "Gain Traction On Crackdowns"
 nor_gain_traction_on_crackdowns_desc:0 "To halt the spread of these illegal media publications, we must aim for the head, proverbially decapitating, or cutting, the supply routes used to distribute these materials throughout our nation. Only through means of authoritarianism and brutalism can we hope to protect Reichskommissariat Norwegen from these dangerous and illicit materials being spread by such degenerate forces who unfortunately find themselves at home in our proud nation. We in the government are quite sure that, hopefully, through means brutal suppression we shall unite the Norwegian citizenry with us in a crusade against subversive materials. Hopefully, our prediction is accurate and our suppressive methods will prove successful..."
 nor_doing_goebbels_proud:0 "Doing Goebbels Proud"
 nor_doing_goebbels_proud_desc:0 "Although regrettably Reichsminister Dr. Goebbels is no longer with us, we must ensure his legacy lives on, at least in Reichskommissariat Norwegen that is! To halt the spread of illegal media, perhaps we should take a page from Goebbels's book of successful propaganda. According to Dr. Goebbels, propaganda shouldn't include overt political messaging, instead, it should be subtle yet effective. By employing this method, he converted millions to National-Socialism and revolutionised cinema. Therefore, to reinvigorate our media, we must employ Goebbels's methods of propaganda to ensure the Norwegian citizenry remain loyal to our government, they must be properly entertained. As a result, it's best we follow Goebbels's previously successful methods of propaganda. Thereby doing Dr. Goebbels proud and ensuring his legacy carries on whilst saving Norwegian cinema from a decline into degeneracy."
 nor_redistribute_the_forces:0 "Redistribute the Forces"
 nor_redistribute_the_forces_desc:0 "In order to successfully strike against this illicit media being imported into our nation, it's been suggested that we must redistribute our forces so that we can better monitor what is being imported into Reichskommissariat Norwegen from abroad. As it's been determined that the majority of said illicit materials seem to have been brought in from abroad, not from the nation-state itself. Thereby, we can only hope that our increased presence in areas with which illicit materials are smuggled through will lessen their import into our nation."
 nor_find_a_more_fitting_cause:0 "Find A More Fitting Cause"
 nor_find_a_more_fitting_cause_desc:0 "It seems as if our redistribution of forces to assist in the prevention of the import of illegal and illicit media into nation has been unsuccessful, as many who have taken part in the operation have received few orders and have suffered from a lack of morale given their menial task of observance and security. Therefore, it's time we find a more fitting cause for these brave servants of Reichskommissariat Norwegen, who do not deserve to be rewarded for their loyal service to the state with pathetic tasks that can be accomplished by regional and local authorities. As a result, it's time we end this current operation and place our men elsewhere."
 nor_justify_it_to_germany:0 "Justify It To Germany"
 nor_justify_it_to_germany_desc:0 "As expected, the authorities in Germania have begun to question our recent actions with regard to illegal media in Reichskommissariat Norwegen. Therefore, to avoid any potential diplomatic entanglements which may be detrimental to Norway's standing in the Unity-Pakt, we must quickly move to justify our actions to the authorities in Germania. As we're sure once we've fully explained our actions and given proper justification for them, our overlords will understand and support us in our attempts to rid Norway of such harmful materials."
 nor_where_it_happens:0 "Where It Happens"
 nor_where_it_happens_desc:0 "We are at a significant crossroad in history, a change in policy which may affect our government for decades to come. Despite our somewhat positive economic situation, Reichskommissariat Norwegen has found itself suffering from a lack of industry, especially when compared to our fellow Unity-Pakt member states. It's been noted that we will eventually lose our economic relative economic power in the Unity-Pakt if we refuse to adapt to the changing times. Yet, for centuries Norway's economy had been built on agrarianism, with generations being brought up as farmers rather than industrial workers, which may result in potential social disunity if we place greater emphasis on industry. However, we are sure that whatever decision we shall take will ultimately be a positive for Norway!"
 nor_maintain_agricultural_dominance:0 "Maintain Agricultural Dominance"
 nor_maintain_agricultural_dominance_desc:0 "Following a somewhat tumultuous debate among the Provisional Councilors of State, it's been decided that it would be beneficial for Reichskommissariat Norwegen to maintain agricultural dominance, as it's tradition. With this decision, let us hope the predominantly agrarian citizens of the countryside will greater support the government, as we have successfully protected their livelihoods from the wave of industrial expansion currently sweeping throughout the Unity-Pakt."
 nor_our_shield_to_famine:0 "Our Shield To Famine"
 nor_our_shield_to_famine_desc:0 "By continuing with the status-quo of government support for an agrarian-based economy, we have been able to expand our plentiful farms whilst updating farming technology to ensure food production remains at an efficient level. By doing this, we have safeguarded Reichskommissariat Norwegen from the ever looming worry of potential famine in the nation. Yet, we have built up a proverbial shield against the possibility of famine, and are working towards self-sufficiency from the Großgermanisches Reich in the event that they are unable to support our agriculture."
 nor_revive_the_cities:0 "Revive the Cities"
 nor_revive_the_cities_desc:0 "Whilst the countryside has thrived under the agrarian economic model which we have followed for decades, our cities have regrettably suffered due to our adherence to the past traditions. Yet, in our changing world, we mustn't fall behind. Therefore, like the majority of the Unity-Pakt, we must begin a full-scale programme of revitalisation in our major cities, expanding our industrial capabilities and maintaining our positive economic situation inside the Unity-Pakt."
 nor_from_farms_to_parks:0 "From Farms To Parks"
 nor_from_farms_to_parks_desc:0 "With the abandonment of our emphasis on agrarian economic policies, the question of what should occur to the vast amount of farms which dot the map of Reichskommissariat Norwegen has been in debate. At this current time, it's more than likely that we shall convert these farms into recreational parks for the people of our proud nation. Regardless of industrialisation, we must ensure that Norway's natural beauty is protected and conserved, as we must ensure that the quality of life for our citizens remains one of the highest in all of the Unity-Pakt."
 nor_report_it_to_germany:0 "Report It To Germany"
 nor_report_it_to_germany_desc:0 "As expected, the authorities in Germania have requested we send a detailed report to them with regard to our current economic direction, and if we have made any changes or not to our current economic plan. Given how we do not desire to make an enemy of our masters, we will report all economic actions we have taken to the Fatherland to ensure that a lapse in diplomatic cordiality doesn't occur, thereby safeguarding our relationship with the Reich whilst keeping them informed, which is especially important to Germania given their future plans for Reichskommissariat Norwegen's full integration into the Großgermanisches Reich."
 nor_an_eye_on_and_provided_by_citizens:0 "An Eye On And Provided By Citizens"
 nor_an_eye_on_and_provided_by_citizens_desc:0 "The somewhat obedient citizenry of Reichskommissariat Norwegen may prove useful to our ability of governance. At the establishment of the Third Reich, German citizens were actively encouraged by the government to play a role in state surveillance, ratting out those whom display forms of wrong-think to the authorities. Yet, despite the seemingly harmful drop in stability in the Fatherland, this system of surveillance has proven successful in identifying those who seek to challenge our governing mandate. Therefore, we shall exploit the loyalty of our citizens to expose and re-educate those who may unfortunately stray from the pack and howl against the status-quo of Fascist/National-Socialist domination."
 nor_norwegian_enforcements:0 "Norwegian Reinforcements"
 nor_norwegian_enforcements_desc:0 "It's been established that the Norwegian population is indeed loyal and supportive of the current regime. It's only proper that we use this to our advantage, as the average citizen could be seen as far more reliable than the occupiers, for they understand the nation and its people to a far greater degree than we ever will. Therefore, it's been decided that the Norwegian citizenry will be the ones to enforce our new guidelines, rather than us Germans."
 nor_german_enforcements:0 "German Reinforcements"
 nor_german_enforcements_desc:0 "It's been established that the Norwegian population is indeed loyal and supportive of the current regime. However, it's clear to us that regardless of this supposed loyalty the populus are not to be trusted with such delicate matters, for the average citizen may dislike having to enforce certain rather authoritarian policies upon their friends and family. Therefore, it's only proper that we task us Germans with enforcing our new regime guidelines, rather than the Norwegians."
 nor_without_germany_we_are_nothing:0 "Without Germany, We Are Nothing"
 nor_without_germany_we_are_nothing_desc:0 "It's about time we loyal administrators of the Führer's will, acknowledge that Reichskommissariat Norwegen is nothing without the guiding hand of the Großgermanisches Reich. If there is any attempt to flee from Germania's administrative grip, it would surely end in utter failure for our united people. Our best bet at maintaining efficiency and guaranteeing a future is to remain firmly loyal to the Reich, which has never been stronger and more united! As the old saying goes: \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer\"..."
 nor_for_an_efficient_future:0 "For An Efficient Future"
 nor_for_an_efficient_future_desc:0 "...dear god! With the Großgermanisches Reich having descended into Civil War our future is uncertain... Through thick and thin we've tried our best to maintain the Reichskommissariat over the past two decades. However, till now we always with the support of Germania, with our masters being no more who knows what the future holds for us. It's best we continue as before and hope to high heaven that our recent administrative changes will ensure the preservation of our current government. We must wish for an efficient and prosperous future..."

 #Milorg Tree
 NOR_free_at_last:0 "Free at Last"
 NOR_free_at_last_desc:0 "We thought this day would never come -no, could not come- and yet by God's grace here we are. After a score years under the German boot, the Milorg has finally occupied Oslo, and the collaborators driven out. The Norwegian people are finally free!"
 NOR_purge_collabs:0 "Purge the Collaborators"
 NOR_purge_collabs_desc:0 "The Huns have fled with their tails between their legs, and Norway is finally free from Nazi influence- or is it? Can it even be truly free when so many traitors of their people are still allowed to stand?\n\nAny and all Nazi collaborators still in our borders will be dug out and dealt with the way they earned themselves during those long two decades. And for the Nasjonal Samling -however much of it is even around after our purge- , it shall never again be allowed to have a say in government."
 NOR_assume_control:0 "Assuming Control"
 NOR_assume_control_desc:0 "The collaborating administration has been properly dealt with- and as a result, our cabinet is almost entirely empty. Yet the nation is still in complete disarray, and the Okkupasjon left no party in a condition to effectively rule even over a stable Norway.\n\nWe didn't start our fight with the ambition to rule, and yet we are the only ones who can put an end to the chaos. The Milorg shall carry the burden of establishing a provisional government and assuming control of all necessary matters in Norway until order is restored once more."
 NOR_king_returns:0 "Return of the King"
 NOR_king_returns_desc:0 "When the Okkupasjon begun, King Haakon VII staunchly refused to recognise the Quisling regime the Germans set up, and eventually was forced to flee to Great Britain and then Canada along with his family and several other nobles to escape persecution. But he never abdicated during his exile, and neither has his son, Olav V, upon his death; and even from abroad, they kept serving as a rallying point for the Resistance all these years.\n\nIt is time now for the Glücksburg family to return to its rightful place in Norway. Preparations are already underway for the arrival of Olav and his family, who has accepted our invitation back to the country, and for his true coronation in Oslo that a King of Norway deserves."
 NOR_rebuild_norway:0 "We Shall Rebuild Norway"
 NOR_rebuild_norway_desc:0 "As the violent enthusiasm that came with independence reverts to the boring, sometimes bleak reality of life, the people start to show their wear and tear. The Norwegians have been through many hardships those two decades, and even freedom has yet to lift the weight of life for many. Now that we're no longer at the actual brink of ruin, our citizens at best have almost no motivation to keep working, at worst seek to be finally left alone to tend to their estate in peace.\n\nThis attitude is understandable, but the road to national recovery is still long, and we cannot afford to go on in this state. A massive propaganda campaign will take place within the next few day to reignite the people's vigor and remind them of their duty to help in the reconstruction of the country at this time of need- starting with the King himself addressing the people."
 NOR_abolish_nazi_codes:0 "Tear Down the Nazi Codes"
 NOR_abolish_nazi_codes_desc:0 "With the nation we inherited from the Germans, we also inherited the bureaucratic mess they left behind: a complicated slew of organizations and legislation needed to handle the exploitation of Norwegen, many of them as nonsensical as they are cruel. It is time for all those codes to go the way of their creators and be phased out of our systems, so in their place we can restore old legislation where it still works, and replace it with brand new laws where it doesn't. As for the rare German organization which actually serves to modernize the nation and not oppress its people, it shall be given a new coat of paint, have the Nazi rhetoric peeled off, and be integrated into our own."
 NOR_free_speech:0 "Let the People Speak Freely"
 NOR_free_speech_desc:0 "Now that the Nazis era legislation have been erased and replaced, the Germanization policy nationwide has been, needless to say, what we would call indefinitely postponed. Now we can officially restore the status of the Norwegian language as the official tongue of the nation.\n\nAdditionally, with the German censorship laws revoked, the time is right to legally reinstate unrestricted freedom of speech as part of our new constitution. For the first time in twenty years, the Norwegian folk will once again speak their mind."
 NOR_settler_question:0 "The Settler Question"
 NOR_settler_question_desc:0 "Even as German rule has finally been overthrown in our lands, the effects of two decades of Nazi administration are quite more permanent: foremost of which being the numerous Germans who have settled in our lands during Nazi rule, some for many years now.\n\nDeciding what to do with those settlers has been... problematic to say the least. On one hand, most of the settlers didn't actually participate in Norwegian politics or in the atrocities committed, and many of them actually are behind fairly lucrative enterprises that could help us. On the other hand, these people still knew what was happening in Norwegen when they came here, and why the Germans wanted them here, and they were perfectly content with the implication. And as for the people- oh, the people seriously want them gone."
 NOR_back_to_germany:0 "Back to Germany"
 NOR_back_to_germany_desc:0 "What even was the point of our valiant struggle sacrifice if, even after our moment of victory, we still let the Huns free to roam? Free to live on our land and to feed off our fields and to thrive off our labor? Free to boast that they were never truly defeated!\n\nInnocent as they may seem, the settlers knew what the Okkupasjon meant for us when they arrived to enrich themselves- and if they don't leave willingly- to their homeland, abroad, wherever else they damn well want to except here-, they'll learn what the Reign of the Lion means for them now."
 NOR_repatriate_their_stuff:0 "Seize Their Properties"
 NOR_repatriate_their_stuff_desc:0 "The many many years of the German tainting our land and feasting off of our soil and toll are finally over as the settlers have been driven away from our homeland- and in their let's say abrupt leave, they have left behind them a sizable gift: all their personal properties, in assets, real estate and more, some arriving from Germany but most cultivated during their stay here.\n\nOf course, all this treasure is sitting on Norwegian soil, made of coveted Norwegian materials, built from Norwegian hands, and no one but Norwegians around to claim it as their own. Clearly, it is all Norwegian property, and it shall be acquired by the state as such. Let the suits in Germania protest all they want; we'll just consider this their long overdue rent."
 NOR_cautious_acceptance:0 "Cautious Acceptance"
 NOR_cautious_acceptance_desc:0 "No matter how and why they arrived here, the German settlers came here as civilians looking to make a new life away from their past- away from Germania even- and at any rate most of them have truly stayed here long enough to consider this place their home. If we were to oust them from their new lives back into a land that might not even consider them their own anymore, how are we any better than the Germans?\n\nOf course, this does not mean that everyone will be allowed to live like they used to during German rule. The settlers must be integrated into our society post haste, and those who do not become upstanding Norwegian citizens just like they owe to will be sent back to their homeland anyway."
 NOR_tolerate_german:0 "Tolerate the German Language"
 NOR_tolerate_german_desc:0 "One of the main roadblocks in the integration of the settlers proves to be the language barrier; the Quisling Regime had established German as the nation's official language, and indeed many of the settlers have never learnt a lick of Norwegian. Unfortunately, if we expect the integration process to go smoothly we will have to contend with this for a while, and tolerate the German language long imposed on us for at least a little while more as the German settlers learn to speak Norwegian on a sufficient level."
 NOR_matter_of_partisans:0 "The Matter of the Partisans"
 NOR_matter_of_partisans_desc:0 "Dealing with the Germans was an easy choice, but sorting our schisms at home might not be. The support of the leftist partisans both within the Milorg itself and through the NKP's free army proved to be an immense and crucial help in missions during the Okkupasjon, as well as our final victory against the Germans; some even say victory could never come without them.\n\nAnd yet with our freedom secured, this help is now starting to prove regretful. The communists expect their voluntary sacrifices to be recognised and rewarded for, and now demand representation in the government-to-be. Many in the bureaucracy -as well as our own ranks- are repulsed by the idea of working with the socialists, and would gladly take any chance to nip the left wing in the bud. On the other hand, at this point it is unsure if we could actually contain the growing socialist influence even if we tried."
 NOR_work_with_left:0 "Work With the Left"
 NOR_work_with_left_desc:0 "The NKP's influence in our politics and our peoples both is already too big to counteract at this point in time- and frankly, their contribution to the Resistance too great for us to deny without seeming hypocritical to everyone. Besides, the reds are a persistent lot; kick them out now and they will simply keep lurking about, organising their ranks underground and scheming their eventual takeover- just like they have been doing against the Germans for the last twenty years.\n\nOur only sensible choice right now is to work with the left best we can, not only so they will be appeased enough to let us do our work, but also to keep their activities in check, and attempt to steer them towards the immediate rebuilding of the nation more than our deposition. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, the saying goes."
 NOR_national_unity:0 "Emphatise National Unity"
 NOR_national_unity_desc:0 "Oh people of Norway, united against your former oppressors, will you now waste your freedom raising your arms against each other? Will you let your allegiance to your cause influence your decisions more than your companionship to your fellow man? Will you, oh people of Norway, let the Führer laugh from his office as he watches us tear each other to the ground harder than he ever could?\n\nEach of us has a different idea of what a new, rebuilt, great Norway must look like- vastly different at times- but in the end, this is what we're all here for- to rebuild Norway anew, to restore its former shine and glory. And this is what we must concentrate now- not to the petty details of tomorrow, but to the work that needs to be done here and now! And to this, let us all drink this evening, in the company of everyone who wants to see this nation strong."
 NOR_no_king_of_commies:0 "No King of Communists"
 NOR_no_king_of_commies_desc:0 "No King of Norway is going to bow down to the will of the communists! Did they really think we would break the shackles of the dictators past just to willingly tie ourselves to new ones? Haakon didn't realise the fault of his decision until the Germans came; whether he understands it or not, we must not let King Olav repeat the mistakes of his father.\n\nAnd in this day of glory, with the leftist threat growing in power by the day and -if only for a little more- our power to stop them at an apex, we shall strike while the iron is hot and free our young Norway, and our King, of their tainting touch. Alt for Norge!"
 NOR_fate_of_the_unions:0 "But What About the Unions?"
 NOR_fate_of_the_unions_desc:0 "Now that the communists themselves have been dealt with, we must take measures to make sure they shall not reemerge again; with this in mind, we'll need to take a lot at the nation's labor unions, a known breeding ground and rallying point for all kinds of leftists and radicals ever since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nOf course, the trade unions explicitly socialist in nature will have to be banned- that only makes sense. But there are some individuals in the Milorg that are not necessarily convinced that there's such a thing as a non-socialist union; in fact, they believe, all unions harbor socialists inside them, and the only way to keep them under control will be to have the state control all of them. A contentious matter, really- and one that needs to be debated soon."
 NOR_disband_provisional_government:0 "Our Job is Done"
 NOR_disband_provisional_government_desc:0 "It has been many arduous months since we took the reins on a nation young and broken, but we have finally accomplished all we set out to do. The collaborationists have paid for their treason, the policies and institutions still clinging from the days of the Nazis have been erased and replaced with our own, and order has been restored throughout the nation. The transitional period is over, and Norway is finally ready again to function and develop as a modern, functioning nation.\n\nThis in turn means that our job here is done, and our services will no longer be needed.

 norway.1.desc:0 "Stretching into the distant north far beyond the metropole of the Reich lies its northern outpost, Reichskommissariat Norwegen, the dark highways of the Autobahn cutting through its picturesque fjord valleys. Secured in 1940 as a "protectorate against British invasion" by a vast combined arms operation by the Wehrmacht, their control of the Kingdom of Norway would prove a persistent headache for the German government both during and after the war. Unlike their more cooperative cousins in Denmark, Norwegian civilians and military alike proved far less apathetic to the German intervention even in the early years of the occupation, a problem compounded by the consistent failure of the Wehrmacht to capture the King and cabinet in 1940, the royal family and leading politicians escaping with the remnants of their Navy to Scotland. Without anyone to sign a formal surrender, the unstable military administration of von Falkenhorst would prove unable to effectively cope with continued civil disobedience and increasing partisan and commando activity from the locals.\n\nThe solution was a compromise government with a power sharing agreement with the judicial, executive and later legislative branches of government controlled by the native National Unity (NS) Party, led by Minister-President Vidkun Quisling. The Reichskommissar supposed to oversee Norway's eventual integration into the Reich, Joseph Terboven, was much to his chagrin left with little power besides that of the veto and the ability to pass executive orders.\n\nAfter the war, Terboven was able to leverage RK Norwegen's contribution to the German nuclear program into solidifying his position, but Germanization was still limited due to the native Parliament (the Storting) ousting Quisling for his lies about the Germans withdrawing after the war and failure to secure the Kola peninsula for Norwegen in the peace settlement. A few short-lived Minister-Presidents later the NS coalesced around the new Riksfører, Gulbrand Lunde."

Lie is a useful tool for Terboven to contain the popularity and resentment of Lunde, since the executive branch would be seriously hampered without a police force to enforce their edicts. However, with mounting challenges from the moderate reformer and agrarian firebrand Per Borten, the traditional rural heartland Lunde's support is rooted in is eroding, and he feels pressured to take an increasingly hardline stance against the Germans he secretly loathes. Should the German garrison be forced to withdraw, it is uncertain if Lie could maintain the status quo even with brute force, and it is even less certain if Lunde would even be bothered to try to maintain his servile facade without the threat of the garrison. The Germans have made multiple attempts to assassinate him over the years as an intervention against his harkening back to the nationalist days of the party,, but always failed and the status quo restored, giving Lunde a firm grit of what power remains to him. Should a crisis emerge between Lie's national socialist true believers and Borten's local nationalists, there is no telling if Borten might make a move to cement his own position as Riksfører for NS, or worse, the partisans of the Milorg, military organization, could make a play of their own to kick down the feet under the collaboration government. A remnant of Old Norway and at the sime had to catch as an adult, the lion prepares\n\nThe model colony is very much a house of cards, one watched with increasing worry by the many German settlers in regions like the Trondheim area as the winds of change pick up in Germania.\n\nAll three factions must be kept an eye on in the event of disaster.

The same could not be said of Milorg.\n\nMilorg. The name that has sparked fear, confusion and fury among the German occupiers of Reichskommissariat Norwegen for the last two decades. Like a cluster of wasps, they have danced around us and evaded our swipes, swooping in to sting us over and over when we least expected. Once an unorganised cluster of individuals, Milorg now boasts a large network of dedicated soldiers, each and every one fuelled with a burning hatred for the German and a determination to drag their nation back into democratic degeneracy. Since 1941, this organization has disrupted our supply lines, sabotaged our intelligence and raided our stockpiles. Enemies of the state have been set free from prison and given either a free pass into Sweden or a weapon to continue the fight. Good men, both German and Norwegian, have been murdered in cold blood – with no regard spared for any innocents killed along the way.\n\nMilorg is a monstrous organization that cares little for the consequences of collateral damage. Many civilian Norwegians have been gunned down and blown up by these creatures, and yet Milorg continues to inspire the support of the masses due to their immense propaganda efforts. From pamphlets and posters to pirate radio broadcasts and secret rallies, these rebels will stop at nothing to manipulate the people to their pathetic cause.

In opposition to our governing methods the Norwegian resistance, the Milorg, have been terrorizing the citizens and garrison alike. Criminal and militant elements are nothing new in the Reichskommissariat, but our methods of dealing with them have become more tenuous as of late. The reasoning for this is complex, but one of the most significant contributing factors is the status of our border with Sweden. Intelligence and Police forces have confirmed that the Milorg are receiving aid, financial and material, from across the border and show no signs of stopping. Inquiries to the Swedes return only denials of any malfeasance occurring; their feigned ignorance only solidifies our suspicions that the Swedish government itself could be assisting terrorist elements within the Reichskommissariat.\n\nIt is clear action must be taken, but we are presented with few options. We can increase police presence at border checkpoints and double inspections to attempt to catch contraband, but this will likely only have returns on the checkpoints and border stations themselves. We could crack down even harder and deploy garrison elements at key positions along the entire border to ensure the Milorg has no avenue of entry or exit; such a move may make the Swedes anxious, however, and impact our relationship."

When pressed these individuals apologize, claiming that they have no time to study or that it was merely a force of habit, but go right back to substituting their foreign tongue the very next day. Evidently, according to the missive distributed by the Department of Cultural Affairs to the wider administration, enough is enough.

Conversations in German are tinged with anxiety as native Norwegians who struggle to remember words for certain concepts or situations fear to get caught asking for clarification in Norwegian by an overzealous neighbor or police officer.\n\nAdditionally, several members of the Reichskommissariat's administration have expressed sympathy for those who are genuinely unable to speak German, and believe that the Department of Cultural Affairs has taken an inefficient method of hastening Germanization. A proposal has been brought forth to the Reichskommissar in hopes of coaxing a solution forth.\n\nThe orders can remain in law yet unenforced so as to please most parties, but will slow this area of Germanization.

Still, while Scandinavia will never rival the fertile plains of Reichskommissariat Ukraine for sheer output, it is sufficient to feed our population and keep the majority of Norwegians employed.\n\nOur economy has not been stagnant however, and as of late has in fact shown the first transformations into a diversifying market. Due to the needs of the Reichskommissariat as well as the evolution of Norway into a more modern nation has resulted in increased demand for industrial potential and goods. Our cities have continued to grow in part to the increasing rise in industrial jobs and careers available, and a respectable shipbuilding industry has now solidified.\n\nRegardless, the fact remains that Norway exports its value to the Reich and Europe, and efforts should be taken to increase the production and growth of the Scandinavian Peninsula where possible."

The reply came out much colder than the Reichskommissar intended. Looking from his backseat window he smiled out towards the pedestrians, but his mind was occupied with a much more serious issue. The Milorg, the Norwegian resistance against the Reich's rule, had long been on the fringes of his worries but as of late have grown bolder. Their ties strengthened, there've been reports that they are operating in the cities again in greater force; if they are not rooted out it will be only a matter of time before they try something truly brazen. Eyes passing over the citizens once more, he mused and wondered how many listen to the resistance with open ears, how many lend them shelter, who among them are in fact members themselves.\n\nShifting, the Reichskommissar turned back towards the chauffeur. Surveillance efforts have been lax of late, they'd need to be rectified to ensure the security of the nation. The degree of investigation, however, bears consideration.

Worst of all, public opposition and vocal protests have been developing in earnest for the first time since the worst years of the Reichskommissariat.\n\nNaturally investigations - and a few interrogations - quickly made clear the source of this growing discontent for all to see; the Milorg infiltrated urban areas and communities and disseminated their viral propaganda in the form of conversation, physical flyers, and even song. Further afield in the more rural areas, garrisons only have limited control of their regions and a concerning number of physical confrontations are being reported.\n\nThe average citizen is starting to reconsider who they think their true savior is."

In response, the Reichskommissar has authorised all available state capacity to investigate, locate, and neutralize unsanctioned civilian propaganda. To this end, the Reichskommissariat garrison, state security agencies, and local and federal police forces have been organized and dispatched to secure the cultural safety of the citizens of Reichskommissariat Norwegen. Domestic subversive group designated 'Milorg' is identified as the propagator of the aforementioned cultural sabotage, and has been further labelled as our highest priority for apprehension and neutralization.\n\nAdditionally, urban centers will receive higher concentrations of public monitoring and citizen investigation. A curfew is being considered, but in the interim citizens will be required to record their activities for presentation to a security investigator upon request. Further, movement across the Reichskommissariat will only be authorized for vehicles including, but not limited to, registered state vehicles, garrison vehicles, military vehicles, supply and transportation vehicles, vehicles containing a certified state agent of Reichskommissariat Norwegen, vehicles containing a certified state agent of the Großgermanisches Reich, and 'undercover' collection vehicles (see attached file 1A for details)."

The unending tide of years has changed the face of Norway, however, and many of our needs and desires have long since evolved from those of our farm-steading ancestors.\n\nOur cities are growing at a pace not seen before in our history, and with them come the fuel they need to continue; planes, trains, radio sets, and even televisions all have become expected sights of the urban citizenry as opposed to curious luxuries. Unfortunately the nation as yet lacks the industries required to build our own, and as such we end up paying large sums of money for imports from across the Einheitspakt.\n\nPerhaps a tipping point has been reached, however, regarding the Norwegian economy. We possess a large and dedicated workforce throughout the nation, but they are currently relegated to the fields and livestock in agriculture. Norwegian farming, while competitive with the continent, cannot match it in output, and has in a sense given us the opportunity to respecialize our economy. We could shift our focus on growing a functional and healthy section of light and heavy industry to compete with Germany and drive down costs of consumer goods, or we can deepen our agricultural supremacy and focus on exporting the natural goods we already produce to Pakt nations for profit. Both will continue to grow as our economy grows regardless, but embracing one will give it the foundation it needs for Norway to become a cornerstone of the European market."

However, as both Europe stabilizes under the Reich and the Einheitspakt generates increased economic cooperation, it would seem that our northern Reichskommissariat is beginning to make the full transition to an industrial member of our Hegemony. Applications for permits to develop heavy industries like aircraft engines, large-scale ship construction, chemical plants, and even a television factory have been issued to the industrial offices of Norway.\n\nWhile the smaller banks and investment groups eye the growing market with interest, the heads of Germany's largest corporations such as Siemens and IG Farben are already making large financial moves to capitalize on the decision. Only time will tell how this development shall shape the Reich itself in the coming future, but it would seem that the younger Norwegian population is quite keen on the news as they hope to escape into a much more lucrative job market than would have existed otherwise."

While such output mostly serves to meet the population's needs and pales in comparison to other heavy farming regions such as the Ukranian breadbasket, Norway's continual investment has managed to curb incidences of famine as well as bolster a respectable export market.\n\nCalling this development 'news' is perhaps a step too far, as for the vast majority of Norway's citizens - as well as the people of the Einheitspakt itself - there will not be a noticeable difference in their lives. Work will continue apace and there will be further gradual advancements in yield and fertility, and all the while the people of Scandinavia will not have to fear going to sleep on an empty stomach. Outside the benefits of food, this will solidify our trade network with them and further make Norway dependent on German exports and capital; a fine foundation for the Reich's future growth."

We lie adrift in the storm with nought but our efforts to show for it; we must hope that our work in recent months will keep us afloat.\n\nOur actions in codifying our national language, tackling extant propaganda, and monitoring the border should work to reduce any subversive acts in this turbulent era; the last thing we desire are those who seek more upheaval in this time. Further, our implementation of recent investments into our transportation network and wider economy will hopefully manage to keep us in one piece during this period, though for how long none can say. We must hope the bloodbath on the continent resolves itself quickly, for without Germany there stands no power we can safely and readily anchor ourselves to.\n\nUltimately, the results of our reforms may be critical to Norway's future, even if we cannot see what that may be.

Now, for the first time in years, the people of Norway, prideful of their past, their present, and now, their future, have the opportunity to decide how they shall govern themselves in the midst of their newly established democracy. Nationalism has surged in the north as finally, the people have gotten their wishes: a Norway for the Norwegians.\n\nHowever, all is not calm and peaceful for the Norwegian people. Rather, the Milorg-led government has had to exhaust all resources on organizing the preparedness for a transparent election. The Norwegians are, in fact, lucky, as they've managed to garner several broad choices for who ought to lead their new democracy: Firstly, Alv Kjøs leading the Høyre, who's been supported by most of the conservative elements of the Milorg for his plan to "return to tradition" and favor a strengthening of the Norwegian people in their newfound independence. Next, Gunnar Garbo has led the Venstre into great pockets of both middle-class and upper-class support for his desire to hold economic programs as being the primary focus for getting Norway back on track on the international level. Einar Gerhardsen has led the mainstream leftist elements in forming the Arbeiterpartiet, leading a movement to centralize government efforts and aim low, towards upholding the people's needs as the primary issue for Norway going forward.\n\nHowever, past the mainstream tickets vying for leadership within the crags and mountaintops of Norway, the Milorg has found surprising openness for the parties, in the allowance of the Socialists within the Sosialistisk Folkeparti, or the SFP, led by Knut Løfsnes, a direct target for some extremists within the Milorg. There, Løfsnes has thumped the reports and argued, with fire and scorn, over the need for a decentralization of the Norwegian government, with its primary focus only for the direct aid of the citizens within, rather than focusing on other matters such as military or trade.\n\nAfter months of preparation, the candidates have prepared their claims.

To fill the spots of those potentially left behind from Nazi persecution as well as exclusion on behalf of the Milorg, several other candidates have seized the opportunity to lead. Firstly, Alv Kjøs has grown to lead the conservative elements within Norway, to form the Høyre, with a desire to stay true to Norwegian culture's roots while maintaining a strong element on the world stage to bolster the new government, seeking to maintain Norwegian autonomy while emboldening the government to step forward in progress. Next, Gunnar Garbo leads a more central faction within the Norwegian political sphere, as those Norwegians who stand inspired by the greater democracies of the world stand with Garbo and the Venstre. The Venstre seek to expand both upwards and outwards in their attempts to generate growth within the newfound government, and aid Norwegians in being able to claim their power on the world stage via strategic economics and trade. Finally, Einar Gerhardsen has been treading the line against the right-leaning factions of the Milorg to carefully answer the call of the liberal populaces within Norway by creating the Arbeiterpartiet. Within the party, Norwegians call for the centralization of the federal power within the government in order to provide for each and every citizen who may call for needs and wants, to serve the Norwegians which have made the country so great.\n\nTo say that the stability of the recent government has been completely cemented would be an overestimate.

There, a variety of representatives have come together to stand as defiers to the conservative wall.

The Second World War proved this, as the question of "who was a true soldier of their country" blurred the lines as men and women took up arms against those dreaded invaders, as the male dominance of the military dominated the past, while women continuously proved competent in battle. Now, the question is raised once more in Oslo.\n\nAs the battle lines continue to be drawn, some Norwegians have continuously argued that while the military must be opened further, women "deserve the pride to serve alongside their fellow countrymen; but, not on the battlefield, the country needs them too much for that," as one key representative of the coalition argues. To this end, however, the coalition remains unstable, as despite the great levels of support from some older, more conservative blocs of representation, infighting over the possibility of combat roles or not have torn the group apart from one another. This level of infighting and controversy has ignited rounds of dissatisfaction from within the Storting.\n\nHowever, the opposition has stood resolute against the difficulties of the fundamentalist forces within the legislation. In this, the small coalition representing a variety of womens' groups have argued for the full allowance of women into all recognized military positions, including combat positions. Despite the small group of support, the fiery rhetoric and calling upon the female members of the fiery Norwegian resistance leading to the Milorg have allowed for the group within the legislature to continuously grow with a powerful cause backing them.\n\nThus, as Norway once was, the government within the country has become a battle waging over control of the country's direction. Traditionalists and progressives battle in the halls of the government, reminding Norwegians across the country of the battles they had fought to get here, and who to honor for such valiance."

Sure, although those memories may have earned Akselsen the medals on his coat, they also earned him the scars on his face and the blood on his hands. Yet, at the same time, he knew such memories protected the two countries from the dangers of tyranny so long as the two had citizens left to fight for it; however, the memories did not protect Akselsen from the bootsteps of a superior coming next to him.\n\nAn impressive array of military ribbons donned upon a tall, intimidating figure first caught Akselson's attention, before he realized just who was approaching: a legend, no, the legend, Generalmajor Stig Synnergren. The man who had protected Swedish independence past the exploitation of Scandinavia at the hands of the Wehrmacht, he provoked Akselson to muster the greatest salute he could for the Generalmajor. "At ease, Major Akselson." the General said, before offering Akselson a handshake. Akselson clamored for a response, saying "Well, you ought to be proud, Major, with the high command has been talking about you, you helped pave the path for all of this, after all." Synnergren interrupted. Akselson didn't know how to respond, the high command talking about him? What in the name of God for? "With all due respect, sir, I'm sure there isn't much need for all of tha-" "Major." Synnergren interrupted, sternly this time. Akselson felt as if he had made a mistake, as if he had made a grave mistake in front of one of the highest ranked men in Scandinavia. "Akselson, whether you like it or not, you're a hero to Norway and beyond. You may not have gone out in the forests with a handful of men and a submachine gun in your hands to become known as a hero, but that is what you've done. You're a soldier, Akselson, a soldier, an officer, and a symbol for people across the world, all of those who remain in chains because of those bastards in the Reich. Be proud."\n\nThe Generalmajor turned with the Major to look onwards as various infantry regiments and tank divisions marched off to the forest for training."

 norway.39.desc:0 "The constant talk of management and organization of Operation Fortwall had bored the Swedish Generalmajor as he walked forwards, with the sight of veteran Norwegian and Swedish infantry units marching out into the forests, and the babbling of subordinates giving organizational reports behind him. It may have been his assignment to carry out for the next few weeks of joint military exercises, but a man could not deny the clawings of boredom as they grew, could he? That was, until Generalmajor Synnergren was stopped in his tracks at the appearance of an unsuspecting officer: a shining youth of the Norwegian Army, bearing as many medals above his breast pocket as there were scars upon his face, with a name that ran true legend through the words of the General Staff of both nations: Major Tor Akselson, a hero of the Norwegian resistance. The Generalmajor had to regain his composure as he approached the quickly rising young soldier.\n\nHis quiet bootsteps forward had not delayed the Major's quick, even rushed salute. Though honored, Synnergren felt more honor in being able to meet the rising pupil within the Norwegian ranks, and now, a comrade in arms. "At ease, Major Akselson." The Generalmajor said sternly, despite offering a handshake for the Major. With Synnergren noticing the Major seemed nervous, like a child getting caught by a parent, the Generalmajor said "Well, you ought to be proud, Major, with the high command has been talking about you, you helped pave the path for all of this, after all." "With all due respect, sir, I'm sure there isn't much need for all of tha-"\n\nGoddamnit. This kid's a hero, not some washed up recruit hotshot, the Generalmajor thought. "Major." Synnergren finally said, stopping the man in his tracks. "Akselson, whether you like it or not, you're a hero to Norway and beyond. You may not have gone out in the forests with a handful of men and a submachine gun in your hands to become known as a hero, but that is what you've done. You're a soldier, Akselson, a soldier, an officer, and a symbol for people across the world, all of those who remain in chains because of those bastards in the Reich. Be proud."\n\nSynnergren had only hoped that he had prepared a good enough speech for the man to gain some confidence in himself, as he saw that the bright man, rising swiftly through the ranks as he had been, stared forward, contemplatively. "Thank you, sir. I, well, very much appreciate it, sir." Major Akselson said."

 norway.40.desc:0 "For the first time since 1954, Olav was truly scared. He placed a firm hand on his trembling right leg and took a deep breath, turning his gaze to the window. Glimpses of daily life flashed past like images on a film reel. He saw a mother with her child. A woman walking her dog. A citizen marching down the street with a stiff gait and a high chin. A military man.\n\nOlav smiled. He himself had served as a general in the Second World War. So desperately had he wanted to remain with his fellow Norwegians as the Nazis pushed onwards, but his father would not have it. He would be more useful in exile, he was told, but what use was a fleeing man? What use was he when the Germans stormed England? As snowy Canada drew nearer, so did the fire within him rage harder.\n\nThe horror of the 1940s felt like another lifetime. As much as he had loathed his exile, nothing in the world would make him regret the safety and comfort it brought his family. Olav's father had lost the spark in his eyes, but his children had gained theirs. Through it all was Märtha. Beloved Märtha. A soft touch in days of weakness, a soothing voice in nights of anger and tears. Not once did she lose her smile, even as the cancer slowly stole her away. His father had died just three years later. Never again were they to feel Norwegian snow upon their faces.\n\nThe People's King, they called him. Apparently. What did Olav's speeches and meetings really mean, in the safety of his Canadian residence? The common people sacrificed their lives, their families, their spirits for Norway... and yet he was the symbol of resistance? The images outside the window had changed. Crowds of people were screaming in the streets, holding signs and chanting. The car came to a stop. The door opened. Olav took a deep breath and exited.\n\nCheering. It hit him like a crushing wave, nearly knocking the strength from his legs. He floated towards Nidaros Cathedral, and the cameras watched eagerly as he seated himself on the throne. The coronation felt like a dream. A heavy crown was placed upon his head, and with it came the weight of the whole nation. He knew his words were to be broadcast in every household throughout the country.\n\n"I am home," King Olav said with a steely gaze, even as his eyes watered. "I am home, and the people of Norway will never suffer again. I promise.""

Jakob glanced down at the small badge resting on his open palm, his thumb tracing the circular symbol. It was everything, and nothing. A symbol of hope, and an old metal pin.\n\nHe looked back to his two compatriots. They pushed and pulled their oars silently, the dark of night enveloping their Waffen-SS uniforms. He owed Arne and Thor his life, and they trusted him with theirs. The operation was likely a trap, but it hadn't stopped the trio from setting out to sea in the dead of night. The anonymous tip had been suspiciously specific, detailing the exact hour of the exact night that the men guarding the southern sector of Gimle would be mysteriously absent from their posts.

Norwegian voices drifted towards them from the west, and even distantly from the east. The Førergarde. For the first, and probably only time in his life, Jakob thanked God that he was wearing an SS uniform. Even if they were spotted in the shadows, they could simply claim to be new Waffen recruits.\n\nThe Villa Grande, the corpse-white building at the centre of the property, lit the night between the trees with its glowing windows. He led Thor and Arne around the Stone Garden and towards its secret passageway, exactly as the map had detailed. Slicing through the ground was a narrow concrete entrance ending at a small door. It was unprotected. Jakob instinctively looked around him. No approaching footsteps. No chatter. No rustling. Just silence. The trio crept forwards. Jakob pushed the door carefully, the deafening thud of his heart reverberating in his ears. It swung open without resistance. He turned to his two friends with a crooked smile.\n\nThey were in."

They continued on past the pantry, turning left to sneak through the storage room and the servant cellar, before arriving at the servant stairway leading directly to the top. Up and up they went, their boots gently pressing against every step. At last they reached the top floor, where a long stretch of corridor awaited them. If his memory served correctly these were the servants' bedrooms. He inched forwards, barely breathing. The trio were uniformed, yes, but would that be enough? Time seemed to slow down as he reached the end of the corridor and pushed open the door, releasing a shaky breath.\n\nJakob surveyed the kitchen – and instantly locked eyes with a small blond man. His breathing stopped. The man froze, eyes wide in surprise, hands motionless inside his large ball of dough. Thor and Arne suddenly pushed past Jakob and strode towards the exit on the far side of the kitchen, their chests puffed up in feigned arrogance. Jakob followed their lead, glaring at the cook with intensity. A look of dread spread across the man's deathly pale face and he averted his gaze, continuing to knead. Jakob felt a pang of sickness in the pit of his stomach as he left the kitchen and made his way past the central spiral staircase leading to the floor below."

Works of fiction had caught his attention lately, and he had found himself drifting away from journals of great Norwegian polar adventurers and delving into tales of fancy. Even as he scanned the sentences before him, he felt his mind wandering to the past.\n\nThe winds of fate had swept up many men throughout the twentieth century, lifting them to greatness unforetold. Not Vidkun Quisling. He had been tossed aside like a puppet without strings, destined to lay motionless in his mansion for the rest of days. Oh, how certain he had been of his future. He remembered the chilly winds whipping at his face as he distributed food aid for the famished peasants of Russia; with the evils of Bolshevism bared before him, he swore to protect his nation from the same fate... only to open the gates to the German thugs, who taunted him with promises of power while stomping on the face of Norway.\n\nParanoia had gripped him for many years. Resistance movements, schemers within Nasjonal Samling, the Germans themselves – every day he feared the cold embrace of death would seize him or his wife, Maria. Over time, the grizzled old loyalists in the Førergarde were being replaced by those dead-eyed Waffen-SS youngsters 'gifted' by the administration. The Førergarde were stationed to keep dangers out of the Villa Grande; the Waffen-SS, he suspected, were there to keep Quisling in."

Jakob's throat was so dry he could barely swallow.\n\nThe trio moved onwards at a quicker pace, striding past the white walls of the Great Dining Hall. The Villa Grande was just as grandiose on the inside as it had been on the outside. Jakob remembered a phrase his mother had once told him and smiled. 'It is the most beautiful places that house the ugliest beasts'. At the end of the Hall, the library door awaited them, bright light streaming out from underneath. Just a wooden door stood between them and their target.\n\nHe gave a reassuring nod to his friends.

Quisling snapped, slamming his book down. He stormed towards the three men. "No one is to enter my private library!" He could feel the sudden hot tears welling up in his eyes. "Do I not even have this?!""\n\nThe guard in front silently pulled out a badge and handed it to Quisling. He glanced at it in bleary-eyed confusion. It displayed a large 'O' containing a smaller 'V', adorned with a crown... His blood turned to ice. He looked up in shock to see a silenced pistol aimed straight at him.\n\n"Oh," Quisling muttered.

Pinned to his bathrobe was a badge of royal authority, a symbol and calling card of the brutal Milorg terrorists. How the murderers were able to infiltrate his high security residence is, as of yet, unknown.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the grieving parliamentarians, Per Borten praised Quisling's strong presence in Norwegian politics: "The brutal murder of Vidkun Quisling, a figure of stability throughout the last two decades, provides a chilling reminder that the nation must embrace unity over division. Only by rejecting such senseless violence can we work on healing our scars, and creating a better Norway."\n\nEarlier today the general-secretary of Nasjonal Samling, Gulbrand Lunde, reminisced about the past in a radio address: "I recall the early days of our Party, and the powerful national spirit that emanated from its Fører. His love of the Norwegian people and bravery in the face of the growing threat of Bolshevism in the east was an inspiration to us all."\n\nChief of Police and Minister of Security, Jonas Lie, delivered a brief statement in which he swore to bring these butchers to justice: "All of our resources will be put into investigating Quisling's death. I promise to the Norwegian people that the murderers will be caught, prosecuted, and hanged for their crimes."\n\nThe 76 year old Vidkun Quisling leaves behind a widow, Maria Quisling.

 #Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_JOSEF_TERBOVEN_DESC:0 "The Reichskommissar of Norway, Josef Terboven, has lived a charmed life for the past 20 years out of Germania's sight. Norway has acted as a vital part of the Reich's strategic defense network, but the autonomy afforded to the natives to ensure that peace is maintained has always grated somewhat on Terboven, who views the Norwegians, Aryans though they may be, as lazy and incompetent due to the many issues with industry, lack of progress in Germanization, and the consistent inability to squash the traitorous Milorg organisation.\n\nNorway has found a renewed prosperity under the Reich, but the prosperity hides a distinct conflict between the native Fascists of the National Union party and the German military forces, reluctantly ceded by von Falkenhorst in the aftermath of the 50s economic collapse. The National Union party aims to keep a form of Norwegian culture alive within the Reich, something that Terboven views as unacceptable, and further disagreements over the ideal German agricultural lifestyle and the desire of some politicians for a more urban Norway have led to heated, albeit not yet irreversible, clashes.\n\nA more insidious issue for Terboven is the presence of one of Europe's last remnant states, the Kingdom of Sweden, a parliamentary democracy that many think ought to have gotten the hint decades ago and surrendered itself to the dustbin of history. The Swedes are alleged to hide Norwegian dissidents, spread propaganda and insidious lies about the Reich's intentions to loyal Norwegian citizens, and worst of all fund the insidious Milorg terrorists, who have thus far eluded destruction.\n\nYet these are all issues that Terboven views as solvable, provided the Reich remain stable enough to act as a bigger stick when negotiating with the National Union for more concessions to limited Germanization. Norway under Terboven is loyal province of the Third Reich. For now."
 POLITICS_KNUT_MOYEN_DESC:0 "Knut Møyen has held a dream for many years now- the liberation of his home nation, Norway. His dream has been achieved. He never really held the aspiration of leading this new Norway- in his own words, he's only a businessman- but it seems that the situation has called for him to take the mantle as well. Now, Knut Møyen has the unenviable task of preparing Norway for its transition to a true democracy, and in the eyes of his many supporters, there's nobody better for the job.\n\nBorn in 1907, Knut was only an athlete and a businessman before the Germans came and tore down everything he loved. In such a terrible situation, Knut did what every brave son of Norway did and joined the resistance, choosing the Milorg in particular. Within a year, Møyen rose through the ranks of the resistance, becoming the head of Milorg. Under his rule, Milorg's activities crippled and hindered German movements across all of Norway, turning much of the nation into a no-go zone for the Heer and swelling Milorg's numbers to 20,000 strong in his tenure as its head.\n\nUnfortunately, Møyen would be forced to escape to Sweden by a Gestapo raid, leaving for London soon afterwards. When England fell to the German invaders, he fled to Scotland. Finally, he made his perilous return to his home, retaking the reigns of command from his subordinates. It is of the opinion of most Norwegians that Møyen's leadership is the main reason as to how the Milorg remained active in the decades since the war ended. However, even with his leadership, it was the opinion of many that Milorg, and the resistance in general, was reaching its last legs by the early 60's, with slowly shrinking numbers and an increasingly apathetic population.\n\nThat is, until Germany collapsed in on itself in a spectacular implosion, and Terboven and his men left for home. In the chaos that followed, Møyen and Milorg swept into Oslo, throwing out the weak collaborators that remained and proclaiming a new Norway, free of German influence. Now, Møyen's focus switches to reversing the laws and regulations the Germans dared to impose on Norway, reinstituting the Kingdom, and returning the nation to what it was before the war. Once this is finished, Møyen will take his leave, having left his mark as a hero to all Norway."
 POLITICS_PER_BORTEN_DESC:0 "In the chaos of Terboven's departure from Norwegen, the NS tore itself to shreds fighting over who would gain power. Radicals, moderates, and reformists turned the streets of Oslo into a chaotic battleground as the resistance massed in the mountains. For a time, there was no faction in the NS who seemed posed to win, and a resistance takeover seemed inevitable. Finally, a miracle- the reformists, led by Per Borten, seized the reigns of the government just in time to repulse the resistance, saving the collaborationist regime.\n\nBorten was born in 1913 as the son of a farming family. His rise through the political establishment was considered unexpected, due to his moderate views on many issues that the German government pushed heavily on. However, his relative popularity took him from simply a mayor to the leader of the reformist wing of the NS, where he unsuccessfully advocated for numerous governmental and social reforms. Finally, Borten's 20 year political journey has reached its end, with him seizing power over all of Norway.\n\nThough Borten could be considered a liberal in comparison to his counterparts, he is not a full-blown reformist. Many of his proposed changes to Norway only go so far, stopping whenever they reach the prickly issue of the NS's constitutionally-mandated stranglehold on the Storting. In effect, Borten still runs a dictatorship- a more accepting, less autocratic dictatorship, but a dictatorship. Another major change is his usage of Norwegian nationalism in his doctrine, advocating for independence from Germany- however, some question whether Borten will hold that policy when push comes to shove.\n\nIn the end, Borten certainly has a lot of bark. What remains to be seen is how much of that bark is backed by his bite."
 POLITICS_GULBRAND_LUNDE_DESC:0 "When Terboven and his men abandoned Norway, heading back to their rapidly disintegrating homeland, the civilian government quickly disintegrated with them. Cliques of reformists, hardliners, and moderates splintered from the corpse of the National Assembly and spread over Oslo, sewing chaos and confusion across Norway. In the end, order prevailed, and the mainstream finally steadied the ship of state. At their head? One of the longest-lasting, most tenured members of the NS- Gulbrand Lunde.\n\nLunde was once simply a chemist, specializing in biochemistry. However, his scientific pursuits would be placed on hold in favor of Vidkun Quisling and his party, the National Assembly. One of its earliest members, Lunde proved himself a capable, loyal, hardworking administrator. This loyalty would boost Lunde to the ministries of Norwegian politics when the NS finally took power. Throughout this time, Lunde frequently attracted the ire of the German garrison for his nationalist views, as he tried to distance what he called the Norse people from the rest of the Germans. Indeed, it is widely theorized that the Germans kept Lunde from the highest posts of the civilian government because of his views on race. However, with no Germans around to stop him, Lunde finally has the control he's worked so hard for.\n\nLunde's policy does not emphasize much in the way of change for Norway. While he has a few policies planned, such as the end of Germanization, it's no secret that Lunde would not mind re-entering the Pakt as a collaborator state. For much of Norway, it almost seems like Terboven never even left."
 POLITICS_JONAS_LIE_DESC:0 "Ask any man, woman, or child in Norway about their thoughts on Jonas Lie, and one will receive a ridiculously varied number of responses. To the radical collaborators, Lie is a hero, the only man in Norway who works for their interests. To the moderates, Lie is dangerous, a friend of Himmler who wishes to replace the idea of Norway with a bastardized, German version. To the resistance, Lie is a disgusting pig, a cowardly traitor who bends over backwards to lick the soles of the German boot stomping on Norway. However, there's one fact about Lie that is undeniably true- he holds the reigns of Norway with a firm grip.\n\nBorn to the famed author, Jonas Lie Sr., Lie was one of the top police authorities in Norway, as well as a popular author himself. His writing experience would serve him well, allowing him to write numerous political papers. However, once captured by the Germans, Lie's views significantly shifted into a pro-German stance, correctly betting that Germany would eventually win the war. From there, he would serve in the German Army, founding the Norwegian SS and serving as a high member of the NS. When the war eventually concluded, Lie returned to Norway as a rabid pro-German politician, assuming the role of Police Minister. From there, he bided his time, waiting for his moment to shape Norway as he sees fit. With Terboven gone, Lie seized the opportunity and overpowered his opponents, taking full command of Norway.\n\nNow, Lie has control over all of Norway, and the nation trembles at the thought. Indeed, it seems that Lie believes that Germany is not gone for good, but only temporarily indisposed, and he is hell-bent on keeping everything, including Germanization, in order for their inevitable return. Though he may be unpopular, it seems to most that Lie is too powerful to overcome.\n\nFor Lie, Norway's future is bright, tinged with the crimson of Nazism. For most everyone else, the future seems bleaker than it's ever been."
 POLITICS_EINAR_GERHARDSEN_DESC:0 "After decades of oppression under the Nazi boot, democracy has finally returned to Norway. Møyen has departed from the top office gracefully and smoothly, and it's said by many that the man replacing him could not be a better fit for the new Norway. If Møyen was the father of the post-German Norway, than Einar Gerhardsen is certainly the ideal son.\n\nEinar Gerhardsen was born in 1897, spending his early years bouncing from profession to profession before finally joining the Labor Party, becoming a top party official all the way up to the German invasion. The war years would not be kind to Gerhardsen, as he lost his positions, was captured after he joined the resistance, and remained in prison for the next 9 years. When he was released, he would soon rejoin the resistance, working with Møyen to rally the general population through propaganda and resistance newspapers. This work would lead to great reward, with Gerhardsen riding next to Møyen in the victory parade after the Milorg takeover. With his Labor Party relegalized, Gerhardsen would quickly retake the mantle of the Party, leading it to a great electoral victory and becoming Norway's new Prime Minister.\n\nGerhardsen's policies in office are ambitious, western, and not too dissimilar from neighboring Sweden. Progressive taxes, social security, industrialization- all are major domestic goals for the new Labor platform. Unsurprisingly, Gerhardsen's foreign policy is heavily pro-OFN, as he seeks to expand ties with the west to protect the Kingdom from the German eagle.\n\nWith Gerhardsen in charge, Norway takes its first full steps forward into a new era- one not of fear and subservience, but one of progress and freedom."
 POLITICS_GUNNAR_GARBO_DESC:0 "Gunnar Garbo is a walking puzzle. His policies and positions have stumped many analysts. He claims to be a centrist, moderate choice for Norway, yet holds more socially progressive positions than his other moderate contenders. He represents the Left, a liberal party, but decries what he calls an \"excess of economic liberalism\". It's a common joke that he looks more to the left than he does to the Left, his own party. However, these questions have captured the interest of the public, as now Garbo takes the reigns of a new Norway.\n\nBorn in 1924, Garbo was only a teen when the Nazi's landed on Norway's shores. He joined his father as an active resistance journalist. His father would lose his head for his work, and Garbo was forced to flee to Sweden for a period of time before returning to Milorg during the 50's. From there, he made his way up through the Left's apparatus, finally taking the chairman's position as Milorg marched on Oslo. After a fierce electoral competition, Garbo reached the top of the mountain, becoming Prime Minister.\n\nGarbo's policies are an eclectic mix of social progressivism and restrained economic liberalism. His policies also have taken a surprisingly environmental turn, with multiple movements to protect Norway's natural beauty. Many of his economic policies are mixes of the regulations of the Social Democrats and the free market economics of the Conservatives. Overall, Garbo's policies are confusing, exciting, and highly experimental.\n\nGarbo is many things, but as long as he stays around in Norway's politics, there will always be one thing that all can be sure of- he's a very interesting man."
 POLITICS_ALV_KJOS_DESC:0 "The first election in the new Norway's history was expected to mainly be a contest between the center-left factions in Norwegian politics, with the Conservative party only expected to play as spoiler. However, the polls clearly underestimated the charisma of Alv Kjøs, the man who took the Conservatives from disaster to victory, the man who now takes over from Møyen as leader of Norway.\n\nKjøs was born into a farming family, but quickly set his sights on a military career. His decision seemed destined to bear fruit, as he was promoted to major by 1940, but all plans would be thrown aside when the Germans landed on Norwegian shores. Kjøs was captured early on, and could only watch helplessly from behind the barbed wire as his beloved nation was crushed beneath the Nazi boot. When the war came to an end, and POWs were finally released, Kjøs quickly joined the resistance, fighting tirelessly for Norway's freedom. As with his military career, so did his tenure with the resistance bear fruit, as he rode triumphantly into Oslo alongside his counterparts. Finally, as he entered politics on the side of the Right, his message of economic liberalism, state protestantism, and industrialization caught fire with the Norwegian people, who elected him to their highest office.\n\nKjøs now gets to work on fulfilling his promises. Already, curious businesses sniff the air in Norway for new opportunities, and factories already lay their foundations from Oslo to Narvik. The religious right celebrates the return of Protestantism as a state religion. Questions still surround Kos on whether he can keep the momentum of the Right going, or how well his new Norway will actually do, but for now, all of Norway can sleep soundly knowing that a steady hand controls the ship of state."
 POLITICS_KNUT_LOFSNES_DESC:0 "Knut Løfsnes should not be where he is today. He was not a member of Milorg, or any of its affiliates. His political positions, in the eyes of almost all analysts, were well to the left of what even a nation like Norway would accept. His base consisted solely of students and communists. To any reasonable person, Løfsnes stood no chance against the other titans he was running against.\n\nAnd yet, Løfsnes has won.\n\nA teacher before the war, Løfsnes joined the resistance quickly. He was captured, released, and fled to Sweden before anything else could happen to him. Once in Stockholm, Løfsnes would work with the XU unit, feeding information to the Allies, even when all hope of victory was lost. Finally, with the war over, Løfsnes returned to Norway to continue the fight. He would participate in the march on Oslo, though nowhere near the front of the parade, and set up his own Socialist People's Party to run in the upcoming election. Despite the odds being stacked so heavily against him, the Socialists would pull out a victory in the final election, stunning Norway.\n\nLøfsnes's policies have brought much speculation onto the future of Norway. Unlike any other candidate, Løfsnes has demonstrated a reluctance to join with the OFN, instead preferring a neutral approach that some may fear is impossible.\n\nHowever, the most worrying- or, in his supporter's eyes, appealing- aspect of Løfsnes's positions is his total refusal to even consider a deal with the Germans. For some, this shows Løfsnes's dedication to keeping Norway free. For others, it spells the certain doom of the restored Kingdom. Norway's future, as much as it is speculated about, rests on shaky ground. Can it survive the German century?"
 POLITICS_HENRIK_ROGSTAD_DESC:0 "Unlike his many Nasjonal Samling comrades harbouring secret resentment towards the Reich, Henrik Rogstad is a proud Pan-Germanist through and through. Determination and loyalty saw this former leader of the NS youth movement rise through the Norwegian political scene until he settled into a modest administrative position under Josef Terboven, a platform he used to openly endorse the radical wing of his Party. With the bureaucratic skills accumulated throughout his political life and the strict discipline drilled into him by his service in the Hirden, Rogstad harshly reigns as the new Fører of Norway.\n\nSince the dismantlement of Terboven's administration, Rogstad's fervent dedication to the German Reich has only strengthened, leading to an infamous reputation among Norwegians all across the political spectrum – and even within his own Party. The Fører's cohorts praise him as the only man strong enough to haul Norway back into greatness, while his opponents decry him as little more than a tinpot dictator dancing on German strings to the tune of the Führer's demands."

Once the Allies were defeated, we claimed, the nation would be left in the capable hands of a Nasjonal Samling regime. Over twenty years later, Norway continues to be occupied by German troops and governed by German officials. Quisling, once destined to be the great Fører of Norway, was shamefully forced out of power by a populace whose fury is fueled by the continued Occupation and stoked by active resistance movements. Just how long this Occupation will last has been a question on the lips of every Norwegian for the last two decades."

For two decades the Reichskommissariat's administration has continued to enforce a strict policy of forced agrarianism, leading to what many have mockingly labelled as an "agricultural devolution". This program has only continued to attract greater controversy with each passing year, largely due to the lack of arable land and the alleged ties between rural farmers and resistance cells. As long as this chaotic policy continues to cause a significant downturn of the economy, it will be loathed by the Norwegian people."

The German Occupation forced him to flee into exile, but his presence among many Norwegian circles remained as strong as ever. As the Occupation extended, so too did the exiled royal continue to preach his nation's freedom from afar, growing as a powerful symbol of Norwegian independence and national unity. At long last, Olav has now returned to claim his throne as the rightful King of Norway. Long live King Olav V!"

We are enacting a widespread Legal Purge against the collaborationist leaders within Norway to rid this country of their treacherous filth; whether they answered to the Horst Wessel Lied or the clinking of coins, we shall place them on trial for all the world to see. Those Norwegians who stood by the German brutes while their fellow people were murdered and deported will meet their fate at the hands of our new justice system. The Legal Purge has begun."
