 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_LAZAR_KAGANOVICH_DESC:0 "Many thought that, when Bukharin's Soviet Union collapsed, it would be almost impossible for one of his arch enemies to gain so much power as to become one of the most powerful leaders in Russia. However, Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich would prove them wrong. An ardent supporter of Joseph Stalin, he opposed Bukharin's policies and was sent to West Siberia, in what would normally be an irrelevant position. When he found himself far from the frontlines of the war, though, he would accumulate power, enough to form one of the largest nations in Russia before the West Russian War.\n\nWith the loyalty of Field Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Dmitry Karbyshev, as well as the support of the 3rd and 10th Armies, Lazar Kaganovich would declare the formation of the Western Siberian People's Republic, which would stretch from the Urals to the city of Omsk. Unfortunately for him, the Republic was not meant to last long. A combination of the intense Luftwaffe bombings and his two former allies distancing themselves from him would eventually lead to its collapse. In the place of the short-lived nation born from the ashes of the USSR, Rokossovsky's army would gather in the west, and Karbyshev's Black League would gather in the east, and Kaganovich had no choice but to retreat to the city of Tyumen and exercise his control over the remnants of Western Siberia.\n\nNow, Kaganovich has to lead a rump state, a relic of the times of Russia in the Interbellum, through these turbulent times. He may be surrounded by enemies from both within and without his fiefdom, but his revolutionary will remains unbreakable. A hardline Old Bolshevik, Kaganovich will not stray from any means to eliminate the enemies of the state and embody the all-embracing proletarian state as the Great Teacher Lenin and his greatest disciple, Comrade Stalin, envisioned it since the glorious days of the Red October."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHCHERBINA_DESC:0 "It is no wonder Boris Yevdokimovich Shcherbina was selected as the administrator of Tyumen when one looks at his record. After arriving in West Siberia as a young yet ambitious party official, he soon found himself stranded as the government in Moscow fell. He was shielded from the chaos by Lazar Kaganovich, who saw his skills, and by the time of the Zlatoust invasion had long made him his chief economic advisor.\n\nHowever, his lack of loyalty to the authoritarian system Kaganovich admired so much was made clear as soon as the well-armed forces of Dragunov marched eastwards. Abandoning his former beliefs and lusting for power, Shcherbina came to a secret agreement with the merchants of death. The Ural Republic could use like him in governing the lawless lands, and for that he would be appointed governor of Tyumen. His talent soon became clear as day, and now Shcherbina wishes to make his territory a model province, even under the watchful eye of Zlatoust."

 ISH_holding_out_desc:0 "The territories of the former Soviet Union have never seen darker days than the ones they currently experience. Petty warlords wage war amongst themselves, and all the while the hated Fascists who started this misery in the first place send their dreaded Luftwaffe to rain death and destruction right on top of our heads.\n\nIndeed, the cruel fascists of the Reich are simply not content with our previous defeats, and would prefer to go a step further by kicking the Russian people while they are down. This unacceptable state of affairs cannot continue! Chairman Kaganovich hears the plight of those who suffer, and with his aid new strategies are to be undertaken to mitigate the worst of the damage."
 ISH_bunker_building_desc:0 "When the bombs inevitably begin to fall every day, the people of the republic have nowhere to hide and are forced to flee for their lives from a dangerous force they cannot hope to escape in time. The death tolls are rising by the day, and something must be done to give the people a place to seek shelter when the Luftwaffe arrives once more to reap their bloody harvest.\n\nThe answer? More bunkers! Every city, every town shall soon have a formidable system of bunkers that shall serve as unbreakable bomb shelters in times of peace, and an effective form of defense in times of war. Our republic shall become a great fortress, completely unable to be breached by air or by land!"
 ISH_military_holdouts_desc:0 "Now that plenty of bomb shelters have been made available for our people, they can now sit in relative comfort and safety as the Luftwaffe attempts in vain to break their body and spirit, but what of the military? How can they hope to keep watch against our many enemies with explosives being rained down on their heads on a regular basis?\n\nSimple: we shall build even more fortifications! This time, the locations of our fortified positions shall be chosen with the military in mind. The most likely lines of defense shall be turned into impenetrable redoubts that are mostly safe from any kind of aerial attack, as well as being well-prepared for potential ground assaults."
 ISH_scavengers_paradise_desc:0 "Comrades, let us face the facts: the West Siberian People's Republic has seen better days. Most of its infrastructure lies in ruin, and countless scores of both civilian and military equipment have been lost within the chaos of the collapse. Now that we are making a serious attempt to get back on our feet, we desperately need that equipment back.\n\nAlthough we currently lack the industry to produce goods by ourselves, there are millions of valuable artifacts from better days that are simply lying out in the open, waiting to be claimed. The green light has been given to undertake a large-scale expedition into no-man's-land with the goal of rescuing as much lost materiel as we can. With luck, our scavengers will come home with plenty of abandoned equipment just waiting to be put back to good use." 
 ISH_hidden_communes_desc:0 "Bomb shelters have proven to be an effective enough layer of protection for our people, but their very nature means that those who still go about their business on the surface will have to maintain a keenly-developed sense of danger to make it to the shelters in time. To make matters worse, there is no telling what would happen should the Luftwaffe decide to harass us at night, when everyone is asleep!\n\nPerhaps it would be wise to expand these shelters to serve another purpose: underground bomb-proof homes for the people! If the people are living and working safely underground, then they would not even have to concern themselves with the arrival of the bombing raids. Better yet, they'd finally be able to sleep at night knowing they wouldn't be awoken by a siren!"
 ISH_behind_the_times_desc:0 "Modern technology is all well and good, but what use is it if our factories are too damaged to produce them? The fact is, all of the luxuries of the modern world will have to wait until the People's Republic isn't getting pelted with bombs nearly every day and we can actually get our industry back up and running again.\n\nThe solution lies in providing the people with older, more antiquated goods. Although they are less convenient to use, they are much more convenient to produce, especially in stressful times like this. After all, when it rains death on a regular basis, our people would hardly be picky with what goods and services they have access to. In fact, they should consider themselves lucky they're getting anything at all!"
 ISH_survival_society_desc:0 "In these times, our focus should be less on comfort and more on pragmatic survival. Our government's decisions could be the deciding factor between life or death for hundreds of thousands, and sadly there comes a time when difficult choices will have to be made.\n\nThis is one of those times. The bombings impact our noble republic on every level, from the innocent women and children who are helpless against the might of the Luftwaffe, to our military which suffers insurmountable casualties every week from the sheer volume of aerial strikes. It is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot save everyone, and a choice is presenting itself. Should we focus our efforts on protecting the innocent, or preserving our military strength?"
 ISH_the_underground_world_desc:0 "The surface has been a land of death and misery for many years now, and our people are finding it much safer to seek brighter opportunities underground. Who are we to stop them? As a matter of fact, there is great wisdom in this trend, and we would do well to embrace it with open arms.\n\nThe Chairman himself has given the go-ahead to begin the construction of vast underground complexes which will serve a large variety of roles, from industry to dwellings. Ideas have even been proposed for entire military bases to be built underground! Such is the canny ingenuity of a truly socialist society, to find hope in the most unlikely of places while in the darkest of times!"
 ISH_rapid_caravaneering_desc:0 "Yet another necessity caused by the bombing raids are the system of caravans that have formed the lifeline in the devastated regions of Russia. Unfortunately, the fascists have already caught on to the most common routes used by the caravans and have begun launching strikes with the specific goal of cutting off our supplies in transit.\n\nIn the interest of avoiding such disasters in the future, we shall begin to devise new routes for our caravans intended to expose them to as little risk of being intercepted by the many dangers of the Russian no-man's-land as possible. Although these unfamiliar new routes will take some getting used to for our caravaneers, the continued influx of supplies would surely be worth any potential inconvenience that may arise."
 ISH_living_in_the_shadow_desc:0 "The bombings are only getting worse as time goes on, and our already weak industry is being stretched to its absolute limits. As a result, production is more sluggish than we'd like, and the slow pace has come at the cost of less supplies and equipment reaching the frontlines. To ensure that our military stands ready to face any kind of foe even under these circumstances, perhaps it may be necessary to make even more sacrifices.\n\nA considerable portion of our production capabilities are devoted towards producing goods for the civilians. Theoretically, diverting production of civilian goods would provide a substantial boost to the production of arms and equipment for our troops, but is it really worth taking away what little luxuries our people still have access to? The final decision will rest with Chairman Kaganovich..."
 ISH_study_the_bombings_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe darken the skies with their sinister presence, unleashing death upon the innocent people of our republic on a near-daily basis. Perhaps, though, the frequency of the bombings could yet prove to be the fascists' undoing? Some our more astute comrades in the remnants of our air forces have noticed that certain patterns are beginning to emerge in the bombings, but they cannot know for sure unless an effort is taken to study them in detail.\n\nTo that end, we shall begin taking notes of the fascist bombings from here on out. The timetable of the attacks will be carefully analyzed to see if obvious patterns in the raids truly do exist. With any luck, our comrades will be able to predict exactly where and when the bombs will fall, and true efforts to mitigate the majority of their damage can begin in earnest."
 ISH_on_the_clock_desc:0 "Our efforts to study the fascist bombing raids have borne fruit! Thanks to our intensive analysis of the times, dates, and locations of the bombings, a highly conspicuous pattern did, in fact, emerge. The Luftwaffe's power in the air may be fearsome indeed, but it is clear to us now that these fascists are nothing if not predictable.\n\nNow that we can accurately and reliably predict where the bombing raids will happen, the next step will be to prepare potential targets for the raids in advance. Although we cannot stop the bombs from dropping for now, we can, at the very least, ensure that they land in areas where virtually no critical damage can be inflicted. There is indeed a light at the end of the tunnel!"
 ISH_the_mikhail_system_desc:0 "Comrade Mikhail, brother to the Chairman, has come forward with a wise proposal for further minimizing the impact of the bombings. He believes that it would be necessary to devote a significant portion of our efforts to mitigate the damage towards ensuring the safety of all personnel considered essential to our cause.\n\nIndeed, losing these highly important men and women in a near-instant to one of the raids would spell disaster for the republic, and it is when this fact is considered that Mikhail's idea begins to carry weight. Under his proposed system, we can both substantially increase the protection afforded to our essential personnel while, at the same time, not being forced to abandon our people to their fate."
 ISH_off_the_clock_desc:0 "The systems put in place to prevent any significant damage from the bombings took some time to reliably put in place, but it seems like they are finally working their magic. The ordinance rained upon us from the Luftwaffe now detonates in unimportant locations while our more important infrastructure has survived raid after raid mostly unscathed.\n\nMeanwhile, deaths caused by the bombings have undergone a noticeable decrease over the last few months. Once again our people feel safe going about their business on the surface so long as the proper precautions are followed, and for the most part we no longer have to fear the coming of the Luftwaffe. Now that we have room to breathe, perhaps the time has come to start figuring out ways to clip the fascists' wings..."
 ISH_preventative_measures_desc:0 "For too long have we cowered at the mercy of the Germans and their Luftwaffe! No longer are we forced to scurry to our bomb shelters like rats while the fascists terrorize and destroy our lands as they please, with our weakened military completely and utterly powerless to stop them. Now their bombs have been rendered worse than useless, and we have gained the opportunity to take action and inflict some terror of our own.\n\nWith the aid of the advanced anti-aircraft weapon systems we have acquired from various sources over the years, we can finally put them to use by establishing various weapon sites near locations where the German bombers are known to frequent. Once our weapons are in place, the cocky bomber pilots of the Luftwaffe will be in for a nasty surprise when their seemingly helpless targets start firing back!"
 ISH_necessary_losses_desc:0 "Despite all our efforts to prevent the worst of the bombings from affecting our people, it sadly remains true that we cannot ever hope to spare every last person from their effects. Chairman Kaganovich understands this cruel fact better than anyone, and knows that if he tries to prioritize both the urban and rural populations neither will see any noticeable improvement over their current conditions.\n\nTherefore, he has decided to prioritize the protection of the urban populations of the republic. Being more tightly packed population centers, the cities are obviously more vulnerable to the bombs than the spread-out farmlands. While the cities will benefit from new bunkers to fall back on in case of emergencies, those who live in the rural communities will just have to make do with what they have."
 ISH_do_and_die_convoys_desc:0 "As a consequence of increasing our anti-air efforts in the republic, refugees have flocked to our borders like never before. While we welcome the influx of newcomers to our depleted lands, this newly-emerging rush to get to the safety our republic now provides has not gone unnoticed by our German nemesis...\n\nWe can attempt to help the refugees, but to try and save all of them would invite disaster where it could have easily been avoided. The needs of the many outweigh the few, and sadly it may be necessary to sacrifice the smaller refugee convoys in favor of larger concentrations. While many innocents will doubtlessly meet a cruel death as a result of this, many more lives would be saved than if we tried to stretch ourselves thin trying to protect every last soul that walks into our borders."
 ISH_black_zones_desc:0 "Our production capabilities are still much slower than they could be, and while the bombings are much less damaging than the were a few months ago, it would still be far too risky to attempt repairing the bombed out factories that were abandoned long ago. The lightening of the bombings does, however, provide us with new opportunities.\n\nChairman Kaganovich has authorized a brilliant new approach to getting our armaments production back in working order. Weapons factories and arsenals are to begin construction in spread-out, highly confidential locations to help bolster our ailing industry. These locations are to be highly secretive and will be selected based on their likelihood of being discovered by the Luftwaffe. With the Germans beginning to show reluctance to fly brazenly over our skies like they once did, there do exist certain unassuming areas under our control that have not seen much attention from the raids."
 ISH_unpopular_decisions_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to protect the people of the WSPR's remnants, the endless bickering of the communes and their officials have never ceased. In fact, their dissent has only increased over the months! Certain powerful officials claim that we are abandoning the communes and the people of the republic in favor of more useful sectors of the nation and causing the misery of thousands.\n\nWhile these accusations are not entirely unfounded, this is just not the time to be arguing morality. Even if we were so foolish as to abandon highly important aspects of our nation's infrastructure and industry in favor of making sure a few people can plow their fields, they would doubtless manage to find things to complain about. We shall continue our policy of pragmatism that has shown so much success in the past, and ensure that these useless complaints fall on deaf ears."
 ISH_for_our_survival_desc:0 "For our survival, our republic has had to make many uncomfortable sacrifices in the name of ensuring the safety of the revolution and the prosperity of the nation. Many have given their blood and even their lives in the process, and the difficult choices that were made will forever enshrine the last few months as the one of the darkest periods in the nation's history. We aren't exactly proud of the cruel decisions that resulted in the loss of lives, but none can say that it wasn't worth it in the end.\n\nThe bombings have ceased for the most part, and the skies have been more clear than they've been in decades. People are once again coming out of their shelters and living lives that they hadn't been able to for so long.\n\nWith our safety from the German scourge secured, the time has come to honor those who gave their lives to ensure that this reality could become possible in the first place. May we never forget their sacrifice."

 ISH_the_clock_breaks_desc:0 "An uncharacteristic silence has overtaken the lands of the former People's Republic. Distant thumps and booms are no longer commonplace, the air raid sirens have not screamed their eerie warning calls for weeks, and nary a plane has been spotted in the sky for some time. The terror bombing campaign that has terrorized Russia for so long has finally come to an end.\n\nNow that the bombs have stopped, we must make up for lost time. There are many problems that will need to be addressed, the most pressing of which being the rebuilding of the nation. After all, the revolution cannot even hope to continue until we are well and truly back on our feet!"
 ISH_rebuilding_a_nation_desc:0 "Our long period under siege has severely damaged our economic and political institutions. We were brought to the brink of extinction, but, now that we are safe at last from the bombings, the time has come to begin putting the state back together.\n\nChairman Kaganovich has wisely put together a plan to repair our damaged factories, take the government out of the state of emergency, and reestablish our bureaucracy, reaching out to the people of Tyumen to bring them back into the fold after their struggle for survival. Soon, the Communist Party will have firmly pulled our state back from the brink, and the hard work of expansion can finally begin."
 ISH_rebuilding_the_factories_desc:0 "As we initiate the process of putting Tyumen back together, we must confront the fact that not everything can be done at once. Our limited resources require careful prioritization of the most necessary sectors of society, and sacrifices must be made eventually.\n\nTo rapidly restore the economy to its former state, we must establish a firm baseline, and prioritizing repairs to our shattered industry is the best way forward. The time for focusing on civilian infrastructure is after we have established a platform to work off of, and the best way to do that is to restore the state's industrial capacity and slowly bring vitality back to our economy."
 ISH_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Having been on defense against the Germans for so long, we have had precious little opportunity to focus on military development. As Marx taught us, it is vital for the workers to have arms, and nowhere is being defenseless more dangerous than in Russia, where slavering bandits surround us on all sides. While we are in less danger than when the bombings were ongoing, building up our military is vital.\n\nWith our factories coming back online, there is no better time to fully dedicate our resources to military development. A steady outflow of guns and bombs will ensure the workers' state its safety for a little while longer."
 ISH_armored_production_desc:0 "Military production continues to increase as more and more of our factories reopen. While this is good news, we cannot settle to merely match our enemies in production. We must surpass them, building newer and better weapons to utterly crush them in the battlefield. This is what Chairman Kaganovich has decreed.\n\nTyumen will accept only the finest weapons of war, and what finer example of modern military might than armored vehicles? Cheap, effective, and well-protected, Tyumen's new fleet of armor will be the vanguard we need to spread communism across Russia."
 ISH_civil_infastructure_desc:0 "Our long struggle against the Luftwaffe's merciless bombings has wreaked havoc on Tyumen's civil society. Normal life was severely disrupted by the conditions; homes, schools, and medical facilities have suffered serious damage. There is no resource more important for a nation than its people, and little can be done when society is in such a dismal state.\n\nWhile Chairman Kaganovich would prefer to focus on military endeavors, he has begrudgingly agreed to turn Tyumen's attention towards reestablishing agriculture and civilian living conditions. Once things have returned to the status quo, a real reconstruction can begin in earnest."
 ISH_swords_to_plowshares_desc:0 "A significant portion of Tyumen's military equipment is made up of surplus from the Great Patriotic War. After many years of bombing and turmoil, it is sadly obsolete and oftentimes only semi-functional due to lack of maintenance. The need to replace all of this weaponry makes our military buildup that much more difficult.\n\nJust because this gear is no longer fit for combat does not mean it is totally worthless. In a feat of ingenuity, the Communist Party has decided to repurpose old military equipment for agriculture, another pressing need for the state. Each truck that serves this purpose saves the government the resources it would have used for specialized agricultural tools. This is but another reminder that our leadership has the creativity and drive to cleverly overcome any challenge!"
 ISH_all_roads_lead_to_siberia_desc:0 "The revisionist administration of Nikolai Bukharin pursued the large-scale industrialization of the Soviet Union's Siberian territories except, inconveniently, for the ones we currently hold. West Siberia is comparatively underdeveloped, with infrastructure that pales in comparison to the regions farther east. If nothing changes, we are doomed to fall behind, and the workers' state will be a historical footnote.\n\nThe Communist Party is incapable of knowing defeat, and we will struggle to right Bukharin's mistakes until our last breaths. West Siberia may be a backwater today, but if the triumph of the October Revolution has taught us anything, it is that the fortunes of a people can change meteorically in a short span of time. With the right vanguard, even a desolate wasteland could become a center of peace and prosperity given time; West Siberia's comeback will be far quicker."
 ISH_seamless_industrialization_desc:0 "Industrialization is the first and most necessary step towards any nation's greatness. In order to ensure our hegemony over Russia, a rapid buildup of industrial capacity is ideal, but there is always a cost: overcrowded cities, food shortages, damage to the environment, and a decline in standards of living have historically plagued industrializing economies.\n\nThe WSPR is not like other economies, however, in that it is led by a workers' vanguard that looks after the broader population. It is possible for us, without the exploitation of capitalists, to create a fairer industrialization that does not sacrifice the people's well-being on the altar of growth. Full speed ahead! Under the Chairman's leadership, there is but a slim chance of backfire."
 ISH_red_storm_desc:0 "Since reclaiming West Siberia, the WSPR has been able to take a breather. Compared to our wars against the traitorous junta of Sverdlovsk and the fascistic lunatics of Omsk, this period of relative peace seems almost too good to be true. But let us not be mistaken; this is but a brief respite from the wars that we have fought in the past and those we will face in the future. We are not out of the storm but in its eye.\n\nThe storm of war will advance no matter what we do, and we must be prepared for the worst. Our industrial sector will need to be durable and highly productive in the coming days, and there is still a great amount of work left to do, but when the time comes for war, the reactionaries who menace Russia will learn that is the workers who are the storm, and they who will be obliterated by its rage."
 ISH_the_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Nikolai Bukharin's insistence on maintaining the New Economic Policy, while successful in pockets of the Soviet Union, failed to build up large pockets of the country and caused its total collapse to the Germans. Our need for development is high and the timeframe must be very soon. Following the old Soviet guidelines for industrial development in the future when the WSPR is still as vulnerable as it is would be suicidal.\n\nThe never-enacted Five Year Plan, part of the policy plank of the Bolshevik opposition, is the only solution to our industrial woes. An enormous state mobilization of all our productive forces for development as suggested by Joseph Stalin would have saved the Soviet Union in 1941, but we must settle for bringing its newest incarnation back to power over all of Russia."
 ISH_rebuilding_the_communes_desc:0 "The restructuring of the WSPR's infrastructure for war will require the tireless effort of the entire population. Rapid industrialization in the style of Joseph Stalin's plans would certainly improve the situation on that front, but our small slice of the USSR may not be ready for such sweeping changes. Agricultural reform and support for civilians are necessary to ensure that further development does not backfire and immiserate the population.\n\nNew, bigger collective farms! Widespread distribution of agricultural machinery! Massive housing construction drives! The Communist Party will meet all the people's demands and more, and the benefits to industry down the line will be fruitful indeed."
 ISH_repopulation_programs_desc:0 "History has not been kind to the Russians. War and want have left a great hole in the demographic structure where millions and millions of people should be. When prospects were so dire, who could blame the suffering women of the nation for not wanting to bring children into such a world? Now that things are better, we have run into a different problem: there are simply not enough people for our future economic goals.\n\nWe are first and foremost a party of labor, and there is no nobler labor than motherhood. Subsidies for families and single mothers, awards to those "Mother Heroines" who bravely raise 10 or more children, and controls on abortion will bring us back to where we need to be in terms of population."
 ISH_family_building_desc:0 "Abandoned by Bukharin in their time of need, the Russian people are in a sense a nation of orphans. There are however also very many literal orphans, those who lost their parents from war's ravages, hunger, or simply abandonment. The orphanages of Tyumen and many other of our cities are sadly filled to well over capacity with such children. Now that we have the time and resources to deal with this abominable situation, we must, or else we are not socialists and hardly even men.\n\nThe WSPR will set up an adoption system that is the pride of the world, linking families without children and children without families. Soon, our orphanages will be empty, and we will have taken the first step to overcoming the trauma of our most vulnerable from this long war."
 ISH_wives_for_soldiers_desc:0 "While our policies to encourage population growth have been moderately successful so far, we can always go further. Why limit ourselves to subsidizing parenthood and hoping for success when we could give more direct state backing? At the moment, we simply don't have the time to wait for love to run its course unaided.\n\nA new program will seek to automatically assign potential partners to one another, with voluntary membership in exchange for increased rations for female civilians. The other side of these new relationships will come from men automatically registered once they join the army. By demolishing the barriers separating potential partners from one another, the Communist Party hopes to build thousands of fruitful families in the near future."
 ISH_enforced_farming_desc:0 "Burgeoning industrial development causes a corresponding increase in the population, which in turn requires significantly more food. This is straightforward, but there is one problem: West Siberia is far from being Russia's breadbasket. Agricultural production has never been this region's specialty, but it is hard to imagine a future path for the WSPR if it does not increase significantly.\n\nWe need to make use of every inch of land we possess. Grain quotas will go up. Leaving one's fields idle will be prohibited. The peasantry may protest, but it has never been a class known for foresightedness and concern for the national interest. The matter of agriculture is too important to leave to the selfish whims of the rural population."
 ISH_land_redistribution_desc:0 "There are a number of peasants willing to contribute to our nascent agricultural development, but they are unable to without any land to work. The uneven distribution of rural land hampers our goals and leads to great suffering among the landless peasantry. As with many social problems, the responsibility falls to the Communist Party to rectify the situation.\n\nCollective farming, a policy of Stalin and segments of the Bolshevik opposition shot down by Bukharin's government, is the key to overcoming our ills. The state will manage farms worked on by all the peasants in an area, allowing for modernization and efficient administration on a vast scale. The landless peasants will know justice, and more food will flow to the cities than ever before."
 ISH_communal_loyalty_desc:0 "The state can direct the creative powers of its citizens to stunning feats. However, it cannot do everything. While the government's attention is focused on heavy industry and collective agriculture, it will be unable to meet every concern of the communes. In such times, the people must take matters into their own hands.\n\nPropaganda encouraging self-sufficiency and cooperation between citizens is the first step towards molding a spirit of revolutionary sacrifice. People should be taught that every contribution towards the collective well-being, whether it be building wells, teaching their compatriots literacy, organizing work, or any number of other tasks. A socialist state cannot work until the people learn to work together in all ways."
 ISH_breakup_the_unit_desc:0 "Marxist theory tells us that the nuclear family will wither away with the abolition of private property, as communal institutions rise to take its place. While we have placed effort into reforming family relations in the past, there is always room to revolutionize things further. The family unit itself must be the Communist Party's next target.\n\nDelegating the responsibility of child rearing to the whole community will give parents the freedom for work or leisure. Values of collective solidarity are easier to instill when family barriers that separate children are broken down. With the size and resources of our military, it may be a good idea to give it some role in these new creches."
 ISH_rebuilding_an_army_desc:0 "Regrettably, the military history of the West Siberian People's Republic has yielded little success. The Republic, faced by betrayal from within, fell apart before even being able to begin the reclamation of the rest of Russia. Now that we have been reduced to Tyumen and its environs, it is clear that we will have to reevaluate our tactics.\n\nThe military is maybe the most important component to the revolution, and the solution to our military predicament likewise mirrors that needed to ensure the rebirth of the Soviet state: industrialization and centralization. The Red Army will be rebuilt into a force that can challenge the strongest, so that it can soon restore proletarian rule to the whole country."
 ISH_the_red_armor_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union, weakened by revisionist incompetence, was woefully unprepared for the onslaught of the fascists' modern army. Some of the most humiliating defeats came from the Reich's tank brigades, which swept over much of the country with devastating power.\n\nAs we prepare to reclaim the West Siberian People's Republic, we can take one lesson from our enemy: modern armor is an enormously powerful weapon in the right hands. Mechanizing the Red Army will hone it into a force capable of rapidly expanding our territory. Decisive action will make the difference in this war, and focusing on tanks allows us to focus on just that."
 ISH_revisit_the_doctrines_desc:0 "Our critics often accuse us of being overly wedded to doctrine. While adherence to Marx's theories is necessary to the utmost degree, the military is a different matter. Our reconstruction of the army to incorporate armored warfare is well underway, and our tactics have not kept up to the changing situation.\n\nThe tank is a powerful tool, but we will need a strategy to avoid wastefully losing them against enemy fire. As we witnessed too well during the Great Patriotic War, the Germans made a highly effective use of rapid tank deployment to overwhelm and disable us before we could even respond. Perhaps we need a "Blitzkrieg" of our own..."
 ISH_study_modern_designs_desc:0 "Russia's long isolation has cut it off from recent military developments, understandably considering the general state of chaos. We have had neither the opportunity nor the capital to begin improving our tank technology. The rest of the world has made considerable improvements in this regard, however.\n\nLuckily for us, we do not need to start our research program totally from scratch. Captured German and covertly donated American and Japanese tanks have sat abandoned in our armories since the 1950's. It is only a matter of reverse engineering them before we have designs of our own to show for our efforts."
 ISH_homebrew_armored_power_desc:0 "We have drawn plans, laid the theoretical groundwork, and closely studied the results of cutting edge foreign engineering. We have acquired the industrial capacity necessary for a modern army after years of ceaseless toil. Our workers have the necessary equipment and are full of zeal to serve the proletarian state.\n\nWe have everything we need to begin our tank program. Our factories stand ready to produce as many as we need to fully liberate west Siberia from the traitors that have plagued it for so long. All that there is left to do is begin."
 ISH_our_own_designs_desc:0 "Though we have made admirable progress in our armor development programs, the reality is that Tyumen is still an underdeveloped statelet, and our designers are only human. There have been a number of pressing issues with the new tank designs that must be resolved if they are to be effective.\n\nThese vehicles have been made with heavy influence from foreign models that are not necessarily suited for the environmental and industrial conditions of Russia. We need to modify them to suit our needs and establish a systematic framework of examination and data collection to do so."
 ISH_study_the_performance_desc:0 "Until this point, we have made great strides in tank designs and theoretical applications. Now that we have entered the construction stage, it is imperative that we move to practical fields. Accurate measures of their abilities in the field are consequently vital.\n\nWhat better way to investigate the performance of our tanks than to perform combat trials? Seeing how they move and fight in a controlled environment will give our scientists badly needed data about their abilities and allow us to make whatever modifications we need based on hard numbers."
 ISH_our_own_stratagem_desc:0 "One of the greatest tragedies of the downfall of the Soviet Union was the scattering of some of Russia's greatest talents to the wind. General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, known as the "Red Napoleon" for his contributions in the 1920's and 30's, is but one of these. Before his presumed death during the collapse of the WRRF, he innovated greatly in the field of military doctrine, with his "deep battle" theory, which emphasizes the movement of many formations in order to achieve victory through the entire battlefield, being of particular note.\n\nIn a fight such as this, where resources are limited and the outcome of a battle rests on a knife's edge, superior tactics are vital. Repurposing the work of the Soviet greats will only help us achieve victory."
 ISH_study_the_results_desc:0 "Now that we have performed closed trials, the next step for our burgeoning tank program is live-fire incidents. In battle, events proceed that cannot be predicted simply by using observations produced in the safe environment of testing grounds, and tank crews act far differently when in real combat.\n\nFor better or worse, there are many opportunities to enter a fight in warlord Russia. Bandits and raiders have plagued the countryside for years, preying on the peasants and making administration difficult. Sending our tanks after them will provide a relatively low-risk way to gather results, as well as freeing the people from their longtime oppressors."
 ISH_the_red_army_desc:0 "The core of any army, rather than sophisticated weapons or lofty strategies, is its men. Since the Great Patriotic War, Russian forces have held their own against the far more modern Wehrmacht simply by being well-trained and disciplined, even with the gap in resources.\n\nArmor has its place, but focusing too heavily on new technology over the cohesion and effectiveness of our soldiers expends resources that we cannot afford to waste. An infantry-centered army, with professional, well-equipped soldiers and vehicles in a support role, is the way forward to a new Soviet Union."
 ISH_be_brave_desc:0 "The barebones conditions we have been forced to work with mean that soldiers are often insufficiently trained, with poor morale. Soldiers often fight solely for the potential paycheck, abandoning their posts at the first sign of danger. As we professionalize our army, reforming its culture is key.\n\nThe worthy successors of the Red Army need to match it in cohesion. We will create a sense of brotherhood and patriotism in our soldiers as a collective. Marx taught us that the anarchy of hyper-individualism is no way to run a society. It is likewise the path to disaster for any reasonable military."
 ISH_reform_the_NKVD_desc:0 "The Bukharin regime, compromised as it was by revisionism and opportunism, was unwilling and unable to properly crack down on counter-revolutionary sentiments among the populace. The military was particularly poorly monitored in this regard, and the ultimate consequences were the deposition of Bukharin himself and the complete dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe new Red Army will not repeat such mistakes. The recreated NKVD will focus especially on the military, ensuring political loyalty and education and prosecuting crimes committed by soldiers as they reclaim the country. We must never forget that the army has some of the greatest potential for counter-revolution and therefore take steps to keep it under as much Party control as possible."
 ISH_not_once_step_back_desc:0 "During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet Union collapsed the day that its soldiers first chose to run rather than defend to the last man! They spoke of the Motherland and its infinite land... enough population and bread as far as the Urals to feed them all, they said. How foolish such talk was! Retreat after retreat, the cowardly men of the Red Army failed to see what they were fighting for before they stood a thousand kilometers from Moscow. We now see all too well the finity of Russia from Tyumen.\n\nThis defeatist and cowardly attitude was without a doubt what doomed the Union! The men lacked resolve, the officers lacked tenacity, and the whole army lacked courage! Under the right leadership, we would've seen an iron Russia, with an industrial backbone and as foundation of loyal, unfaltering men.\n\nIt is with the goal of this in mind that we demand this of the Red Army: under no circumstances shall unauthorized retreats take place! Under Kaganovich, we will build a new Russia!"
 ISH_the_red_tide_desc:0 "The soldiers of the Red Army cannot simply be the most plentiful, as the Nazi dogs would like to portray the "asiatic hordes;" they must also be the strongest, the most zealous, and the best drilled in the whole of Eurasia! It is the Red Army's soldier whose duty it was and continues to be to defend his Motherland from the terrors of fascism and dangers of reactionary thought and division!\n\nIt is also the duty of every able-bodied Russian man to take the place of the Red Army soldier during wartime, as he must provide for the Motherland in exchange for what it has given him. In doing this, he too must become the hardest willed, the sturdiest under pressure, the embodiment of the Soviet Man.\n\nIf we are to bring back the glory of the Soviet Union and return the sanctity of the Motherland, we must start with our warriors. Under the new discipline we shall forge a new USSR!"
 ISH_be_strong_desc:0 "We, the Russian people, have been ridiculed and accused of being weak individuals, acting in hordes to move against our many enemies. We must show the world what the power of the Russian man is when utilized to his full capacity. With this we will unleash our new campaign, one of a simple motto, but one that will fill our soldiers with a patriotic urge unlike any other; Be Strong!\n\nFor too long the Slavic man has been trampled, his lands ravaged, and his people massacred. But that shall no longer be true. The soldiers of our armies will be the paragon of strength, the paragon of virtue, and as such must be equipped in turn.\n\nThe best equipment at the disposal of our armories, or that can be bought from around the fractured Russia we seek to piece back together, will be given to our soldiers. While the best Russian equipment is not the best in the world, our soldiers will, with no doubt be the definition of the New Soviet Man."
 ISH_reform_the_guard_desc:0 "The Guard forms one of the many political excesses of the system, a remnant of an older age that has rotted in incapability rather than adapted to the changing times. If they cannot evolve, we must force them to. The Red Guard, forming a system of paramilitary organizations more political than functional, is barely a combat-capable force, and in a situation where they were thrust into battle they would struggle at best.\n\nWe must change this through a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Red Guard. While the political aspect is important and their contribution to stability is notable we have been given reason to believe that many of the lower-level leaders of the Guard have no business being leaders at all, especially not of such an esteemed political organization.\n\nThe rotting externalities of the Guard will be cut off and ruthlessly examined, while capable men will be put into these positions. The Guard will also have more frequent training in more relevant tactics, with better equipment and routine pay to expand loyalty."
 ISH_russias_finest_desc:0 "Naturally, if our army is to be the one to bring back Russia from the brink, it must also be her finest. Every soldier must be the paragon of the Soviet Man, with extensive drilling in physical and mental exercises. The physical requirements will go up, and the room for error down. From now on, every soldier that serves for the future of the Union shall be the perfect soldier; strong, smart, and zealous.\n\nAround us sit peasant armies, mercenary armies, and the armies of false prophets. None of these would be a match for a truly battle-hardened, disciplined, and drilled army, functioning as cogs in a giant machine that will roll through all of Russia, from Vladivostok to the Baltics.\n\nIn the coming trials, each soldier will be faced with difficulty, forced to confront sacrifice, and even experience it themselves. It is our job to ensure that when this time comes, our soldiers will have no trouble dispersing the enemy, and bringing glory to our Union!"
 ISH_power_to_the_mighty_desc:0 "It has always been our goal to introduce to Russia a truly meritocratic society, where nothing but desert gives power. We figure the best place to introduce this ideal is to our army, where corrupt generals still sit in positions of power we value so highly. We must push forward a new model, based on the ideals of equality, fraternity, and only the best soldiers going up the ranks. We will never be in the position to be the true heirs to the Soviet Union unless this Union not only continues but expands on the legacy of the former one.\n\nEvery soldier will be evaluated, his determination measured, and his capabilities tracked. By tracking the abilities of our men, we can then make sure that only the creme of the crop are selected for additional officer training. The training and conditioning of our soldiers, matched with the leadership of a true meritocracy, will be the driving force that shall bring our men to Moscow!"

 ISH_fixing_the_republic_desc:0 "In years past, the West Siberian People's Republic has shrunk to a mere husk of its former glory. This dreadful state of affairs can be fully blamed on those who stabbed Chairman Kaganovich in the back when he needed them most, greedily splitting off to form their own personal fiefdoms. Previously, our forces were helpless to stop them due to the constant rain of explosives they were subjected to on a regular basis.\n\nNow, with the skies clear, we can finally begin plans to unleash the full might of the Red Army upon those who have foolishly betrayed the revolution and split from our glorious republic. One by one the rebellious statelets who insult the workers and people of the republic with their very existence will be brought back into the fold, and the nation will finally be whole again."
 ISH_pertinent_matters_desc:0 "Of those who split from the WSPR in its darkest moments, none are so foolish and so misguided as our immediate rivals based in the cities of Sverdlovsk and Omsk respectively. If we are to unite the republic once again, these treacherous rats must be dealt with one way or the other.\n\nOne of the most devastating betrayals was that of Marshal Rokossovsky and his Third Army. When the going got rough for our republic, the Marshal stupidly decided to abandon our righteous socialist cause by inciting the entire Third Army to desert and form a separate military government to the north. Although their forces have been weakened by desertion and infiltration, they are still a formidable force led by a highly capable commander.\n\nTo the south lies the Black League, who are based in their stronghold in Omsk. Although the traitor general Dmitry Karbyshev is dead, his successor Dmitry Yazov has reportedly galvanized the League and is actively preparing them for conflict against us. While his base of power may not be as secure as it seems, it may be best to snuff these monsters out before they become too powerful.\n\nOne of these traitors shall become our first target, and the final decision will have to be carefully considered."
 ISH_the_black_state_in_the_cradel_desc:0 "Dmitry Karbyshev, the hated general who betrayed our republic when it needed him most, may be dead, but his dark legacy lives on in the form of his successor: Dmitry Yazov. Yazov has already proven to be a potentially fearsome adversary indeed, and under his watch the Black League has become more powerful than ever before. If not dealt with soon, they could become a serious threat.\n\nThe Red Army's planned campaign against the Black League will indeed be bloody, for these zealots are famed for their inhuman discipline and ferocity in battle. Despite these advantages, however, they are lacking in mechanized units, and rumors persist that Yazov's regime is not nearly as stable as it would seem. Whatever strategic course of action we decide upon, it would be best to proceed with caution when dealing with these madmen."
 ISH_southern_buildup_desc:0 "The war against the fearsome Black League will be brutal, and the borders must be prepared for any possibility. In the unlikely scenario that our offensive becomes a disaster and our comrades are forced to retreat, they will need a line of defense to fall back to. Already the Red Army is deploying to the fringes of Black League territory, and once they are there, a hasty line of defense will be constructed while plans of attack are still being devised.\n\nThere will be no second thoughts from this point onward. The scouts of the League will doubtless spot our troops' presence building up on the border, and these aggressive maneuvers will surely send our republic down a one-way road towards conflict. "
 ISH_united_against_evil_desc:0 "The Black League, above all, seeks revenge against the Germans. While this quest is not entirely unwarranted, their methods of reaching this goal have simply gone too far. From top to bottom, the Black State is geared towards only one thing: war. As a result, the innocents who are misfortunate enough to find themselves living under the Black League suffer needless cruelties in the name of misguided vengeance.\n\nOur war against the Black League will be more than just another step on the road towards rebuilding the republic, it will be a struggle against evil itself. When the oppressed peoples of Omsk know that our intention is to liberate them from their unfortunate situation, they would surely welcome our forces with open arms and help our comrades to root out the League's dark presence for good."
 ISH_strangle_the_creature_desc:0 "The day has finally arrived, and our plans to destroy the Black League of Omsk will be put into motion. The Red Army is to launch a daring and aggressive assault into the heart of their territory with the aim of overwhelming the zealous troops of the League before they can muster serious resistance. Most of our military experts agree, however, that the casualties sustained by both sides will be significant.\n\nThese Black League dogs do not deserve your fear, comrades! They may hold a great deal of bitter rage within their hearts, but they will soon learn that anger does not count for everything in war. The evil legions of the Black League shall be crushed into dust by our resurgent Red Army, and Yazov's reign of terror over Omsk shall finally come to a close at our hand. Onwards!"
 ISH_the_traitors_to_the_north_desc:0 "In the north, the traitorous Third Army have established a formidable presence centered on the strategically important city of Sverdlovsk. At their head is Marshal Rokossovsky, formerly one of the Soviet Union's finest generals, who has foolishly decided to throw away his legacy of serving the people in favor of establishing a military government of his own in the region.\n\nThe sooner we put this mad dog down, the sooner we can achieve our dreams of reuniting the West Siberian People's Republic. While the Third Army commands a highly defensible position across the Iset river, their combat effectiveness has been heavily marred by mass desertions. With their morale in such a dire state, they cannot hope to stand a chance against the might of our Red Army."
 ISH_rally_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Although the Third Army claims to carry on the legacy of the Red Army, they are, in practice, hardly a "red" army at all. Rokossovsky clearly cares little about furthering the socialist cause, and runs his state like a reactionary fiefdom where the military, rather than the workers, have the most say in the day-to-day affairs of the nation.\n\nThis clear betrayal of socialist ideals has caused a great deal of dissent within their ranks, and our republic has already received thousands of deserters wishing to rejoin our ranks to fight for the revolution once more. With the aid of a propaganda campaign aimed at encouraging further dissent amongst Sverdlovsk's socialists, we can widen the divides present in Rokossovsky's hypocritical administration and weaken his army's ability to resist our attack."
 ISH_all_eyes_on_rokossovsky_desc:0 "To the people of Sverdlovsk: how can you bear to live under a cruel military regime that only has their own selfish interests in mind? Surely you see the hypocrisy in Rokossovsky's past allegiance towards socialism being thrown away in favor of delusional Bonapartist ambitions? The West Siberian People's Republic and its chairman Lazar Kaganovich sees and hears your plight, and only holds your best interest at heart.\n\nWhen the Red Army crosses into the territories currently oppressed by Rokossovsky and his military goons, know that our first and foremost objective is the liberation of the people and workers of Sverdlovsk and beyond. Rest assured, the old Marshal will pay a heavy price for his crimes against the people, and order shall be restored in favor of a civilian administration. No longer will the "Red" Army of Rokossovsky claim to protect you on one hand and rob you blind on the other. Our republic will fight for your liberation!"
 ISH_strike_at_sverdlovsk_desc:0 "The propaganda campaigns have come to an end and the Red Army has been prepared. All that remains now is to begin the campaign to undo the treachery inflicted upon us by Marshal Rokossovsky and reclaim his territory in the name of the people!\n\nThe Third Army, despite being much weakened from their former glory, is still a formidable foe. They are well trained, well equipped, and the terrain is heavily to their advantage. Despite these advantages, however, the complacent drones under Rokossovsky's command simply lack the socialist zeal of our own troops, who have once never wavered from their duties to the revolution. Advance, brave comrades, and put these reactionary traitors in their place once and for all!"
 ISH_the_traitors_lie_dead_desc:0 "Comrades, we have achieved victory over those who have betrayed the republic! Sverdlovsk has been wrested from the control of the traitorous Marshal, while the malevolent Black League in Omsk was crushed without difficulty under the overwhelming advance of the Red Army. For the first time in years, a real semblance of unity has been restored to the republic's core regions.\n\nWith our immediate foes dealt with, it is time to move on to the next phase of unification. The territories that were reclaimed still require a certain degree of persuasion to accept the benevolent rule of Chairman Kaganovich, and vast swathes of abandoned industrial sectors now await new life."
 ISH_restore_our_administration_desc:0 "The traitorous junta of Sverdlovsk and the madmen of Omsk have been defeated once and for all, and the difficult task of returning both regions to our control begins. The higher administrations of both must be completely restaffed. The higher officers of the Rokossovsky clique cannot be trusted for obvious reasons; the Black League's officials barely deserve the bullets we're shooting them with, much less a position in government. Finding good Communists with local knowledge to staff our new bureaucracy is a must.\n\nRestoring the core territory of the West Siberian People's Republic is our patriotic duty. Onwards, for the Revolution!"
 ISH_purge_the_black_league_desc:0 "We knew vague details of the Black League's brutality. Combing through their records in the aftermath of our victory, it is clear that they were more malevolent than we could imagine. The first time the League materialized within our ranks, it broke large amounts of territory off of the WSPR and severely weakened our war effort. We cannot allow this to happen again.\n\nEvery last one of these despicable fascists will receive his comeuppance. The conscripts will be put to work rebuilding the areas they devastated. The higher-ups, to the man, will be sent to the grave. The suffering they have caused cannot be repaid, but we can punish the people responsible as harshly as possible."
 ISH_recentralize_the_industry_desc:0 "Omsk and Sverdlovsk were vital components of our industrial heartland. After the split and reconquest, they lie in flames. Thankfully, restoring their factories to their former glory may not be as difficult as it seems. Both of their former statelets split off from the WSPR, after all, and they inherited our industrial scheme: a large focus on heavy industry controlled by the state.\n\nIncorporating their factories into our own planning administration will require the creation of several new bureaus and workers' collectives. After a brief survey of their capabilities, they will be more than ready to contribute to the war effort."
 ISH_expanding_the_republic_desc:0 "We have successfully reclaimed our most populous regions and neutralized our most pressing adversaries, but there is much work to be done to rise to even our former power, much less ruling over all of Russia. Nevertheless, we are finally in a position to begin looking outwards.\n\nTo our west lies Zlatoust, a nest of one of the sickest forms of bourgeois degeneracy: war profiteering. To the north lie the vicious bandits of Yugra and the heroic Free Aviators. Establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat across all of West Siberia will require incorporating or subjugating all of these factions."
 ISH_against_capitalist_perversion_desc:0 "Communists abhor war but fight when necessary to protect the working classes. The bourgeois have no such qualms. Even in the chaos of warlord Russia, it is possible for a sufficiently amoral person to turn a profit. In Zlatoust, a clique of weapons manufacturers sell the weapons of war to all sides, sparing no concern for their clients' motives. The prosperity of all capitalists is sown on blood and exploitation, but Dragunov and his cronies have been especially direct in the bloodshed they have caused.\n\nThe workers' army stands ready to topple these vile criminals and seize their ill-gotten gains. Their massive stockpile of modern weaponry is only a bonus."
 ISH_buy_the_rope_desc:0 "The arms dealers of Zlatoust are devoid of integrity in their choice of customers. Sometimes, this means selling to those who would stand to dramatically decrease their lifespans. Zlatoust has so far displayed no opposition to commerce with the workers' state, allowing us to amass a sizable quantity of their weapons and ammunition.\n\nThe greatest advantage we have in our struggle is the short-sighted greed of our opponents. They have sold us the rope. Now let us hang them with it."
 ISH_march_on_the_mountains_desc:0 "We are ready. Tyumen has obtained all the weapons it needs to attack Zlatoust, and the merchants of death remain blissfully unaware that one of their best clients is preparing to destroy them. The Urals have remained out of our reach for years, but the resurgent West Siberian People's Republic cannot be halted. Our armies have been hardened fighting the likes of the Black League while theirs have grown fat and rich off plunder.\n\nThese bloodsucking capitalists have remained safe and sound while they plunge West Siberia into chaos and instability. We now have the chance to liberate the region from their influence once and for all."
 ISH_arrest_the_caravans_desc:0 "The rats' nest may be unassailed, but the profiteer vermin have more vulerable assets throughout the region. Caravans filled with money and weapons are trying to extract as much wealth as possible while they still can. We cannot allow the bourgeoisie to stash their stolen wealth away from the hands of the workers who need them.\n\nCatching these scum will require casting a wide net. Motorized patrols will be sent throughout the region, searching every road and passage for black-market trade. Centralization is key to our victory, and all commerce must flow through the state."
 ISH_against_deranged_banditry_desc:0 "As greedy and vicious as the bourgeoisie are, they at least attempt to govern. There are few things more evil than the common criminal who cares about the people only as far as he can loot them of their belongings. Yugra, overrun by such elements, is a sickening sight to behold. Looters have long since filled the void left by retreating government, and the lives of the people are hell.\n\nThey are nothing more than self-interested scavengers, while the Red Army is an organized force motivated by ideological zeal. We will punish them mercilessly for their savagery."
 ISH_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "The poor people of Yugra, crushed by the bandits' barbaric brutality, have forgotten how to dream of something better. They meekly cower in their homes, all thought of class consciousness or loyalty to the Union forgotten.\n\nOne of the advantages of preparing to attack an anarchic hive of criminality is that we can easily expand our influence over the border with Yugra. We will let the peasants know that they are not alone. The innocents will be freed from their oppressors, and the guilty will be hounded to the grave. Yugra does not know liberation, but we can remind it."
 ISH_man_the_front_desc:0 "Yugra is a massive territory with a border that is at first glance impossible to control. Fortunately, this means that the already disorganized bandits will have trouble guarding their whole frontier. Unfortunately, it means that our security is similarly difficult to ensure.\n\nThe Red Army is not known to back down from a challenge, but it will need some direction to adequately close this gap. Intelligent planning is needed to block the entirety of the border from a bandit assault with our available resources."

This will be a challenging trek against a numerous and ruthless foe, but when have our enemies not been willing to engage in sickening atrocities? Ultimately, the bandits are cowards, unwilling to seriously risk their safety. They will fall in droves when faced with the Red Army.\n\nAs we set foot in this hostile northern territory, let us not forget why we are doing this: the Red Army is the last, best hope of working people against all forms of tyranny, and the slavering raiders of Yugra are among the worst tyrants of all."

We will give them as many rations as we can spare, and Chairman Kaganovich will erect a monument in Tyumen in their honor. Anything less would be an insult to those who stalwartly battled the Wehrmacht when so many others abandoned the front."

Now that the West Siberian People's Republic has advanced to their doorstep, they need be isolated no longer.\n\nThe Communist Party is hard at work drafting a suitable proposal for the annexation of the Aviators' territory into ours, permanently relieving their difficulties with resources and reuniting them with the Union's rightful successors. Every pilot will receive military honors, and the civilian population will be awarded for its dedication to the cause. Rest assured, their contributions to the Russian people will never be forgotten."

His dedication, bravery, and wisdom deserve honors even greater than those we have already bestowed upon him.\n\nAnd honor him we shall.

Overhauling our network will make the WSPR more than capable of fueling its expansion across West Siberia and supplying its continually expanding factories."
 ISH_aid_the_peasants_desc:0 "As the situation within our territory continues to stabilize, the Communist Party has been met with new responsibilities in the civilian sector. Now that wartime measures are becoming less severe, peasant associations have become bolder in their requests from the government, arguing for more tractors, tools, and state support.\n\nIn better times, we would ignore or suppress them, but our desperate need for provisions gives the peasants significant leverage. Special priority will be placed on agricultural equipment and government relief. They will get their demands, at least while they can pressure us into meeting them."
 ISH_encourage_workers_culture_desc:0 "During Tyumen's most dire days, civilian conditions were put on the backburner in favor of feverish military production. Those times have passed, and all statistics show that our workers are being rewarded for their efforts with deplorable standards of living, at least compared to those before the war.\n\nIn its magnanimity, the Communist Party has decided to devote some resources to improving our ordinary people's lot in life. The ordinary people of Tyumen will soon enjoy greater amenities, a more abundant housing supply, improved education, and all the food they could ask for."
 ISH_finish_the_job_desc:0 "After we have eliminated Zlatoust, there is only one adversary left in West Siberia, and it pales in comparison to those we have already faced. The inmates of the Vorkuta gulag were largely left to their own devices after the Soviet Union's collapse and took the opportunity to found their own statelet. They prefer to be left to their own devices, but, now that we have consolidated our power, there is no reason to delay defeating and incorporating them.\n\nLogistically speaking, this is a demanding task due to the necessity of crossing the Urals, but the inmates themselves are hardly a threat. They are merely criminals, and we are the people's judges punishing them for their transgressions."
 ISH_the_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Victory at last! Through the wise and cautious leadership of Chairman Kaganovich and firm adherence to Marxist principles, we have conquered the entirety of our former territory and are now stronger than ever. The West Siberian People's Republic is now the sole sovereign government in the region and a worthy contender for the reunification of the Soviet Union.\n\nAll this success deserves some celebration. Chairman Kaganovich has already declared a holiday, and military parades will soon fill the streets of Tyumen. Of course, the real thanks go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, for their tireless efforts and fierce loyalty to the Republic. Glory to the Communist Party! And may it be the Communist Party of the Soviet Union very soon."

Far from being an ally of the workers, it is one of the most ingenious tools of the bourgeoisie, just another side of the same coin as fascism. \nWe must condemn "social fascism" wherever it rises, hopefully leading the workers of the western world out of this trap.

However, now that a secure power base has been established in Central Russia, the process of warring must take a temporary reprieve. Comrade Kaganovich understands that, if the state is to expand into the rest of Russia, it will need a strong industrial sector, a well-organized military, and a political system free of internal threats.\n\nThus, all three must be accomplished. Engineers and industrialists will begin the rapid construction of a new heavy industry sector that will provide tanks, rifles, and artillery pieces that will be needed for further expansion. The military will be expanded, and allowed to retrain and reorganize following the grueling campaigns to unite Western Siberia. Finally, certain political elements will be... removed, in order to prevent the rise of internal threats or opposition to Kaganovich's guiding hand. While these goals may seem difficult to achieve, they are necessary if the Soviet Union is ever to be restored."

 ISH_inaugurate_the_third_five_year_plan_desc:0 "The newly reclaimed territories in Siberia are, to say the least, poor. Very few roads are paved or maintained, there is little access to electricity and running water, and most of the people live off subsistence farming in small villages. Thus, the time has come to introduce the party and the people to the third five year plan so far. After it is approved, a vast modernization effort will begin all across Siberia to industrialize and build up the region. Factories to produce tanks, weapons, and munitions will become the norm, giving the Red Army the ability to fight wars against far larger and better-armed foes.\n\nThe old Union fell because of the failure of Premiere Bukharin to build up a modern military industry. He failed to recognize the need for Russia to industrialize as quickly and as heavily as possible, and both he and the Russian people paid for it in blood. Comrade Kaganovich understands his enemies, his people, and the lessons he can learn from the past. He will not make the same mistake as his predecessor."

 ISH_in_stalins_way_desc:0 "The late Comrade Stalin was a great friend and mentor to our very own Comrade Kaganovich. His political and social philosophy has guided and protected both Kaganovich and the state many times. In fact, Comrade Kaganovich openly admits to asking himself what Comrade Stalin would do, when presented with a complex situation. We should honor Stalin for giving us such a bright future, and fully embrace "Stalinist" ideals as the official position of the state. Doing so would not only honor the man's memory, but likely guide us into a brighter future."

 ISH_commissariat_of_civil_defence_desc:0 "An army by itself is not enough. While it is indeed helpful to have a million men on standby in the event of war, those men are of no use if given no weapons to fight, or if they are simply a massed horde. All armies require organization and logistics-- something in very short supply in the Siberian wastes. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich, in light of this issue and the ever-growing power of the state, has decided to organize a new governmental organization: the Commissariat of Civil Defense.\n\nThis new organization will oversee all the functions regarding the preparation of war. It will organize and equip units of men, ensure factory production is adequate to meet demand, and prepare propaganda for any eventual war that may or may not erupt. The world is a changing place, and the safety of the state and its people must be considered of the utmost priority."

 ISH_factory_institutes_desc:0 "The invasion of the Hitlerites and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union were great tragedies, not only for their cost in lives, but the damage done to the future of the Russian people. Many across the shattered remains of the Motherland cannot read or write, and know only how to till soil and plant crops. Such was the way for many centuries, but it is not the way of modernity. Today is the age of machines and factories and steel, and so Russia must be dragged, kicking and screaming, into being an industrial society. Many of the newly conscripted factory workers must be trained by another person, rather than being able to read and understand simple directions.\n\nTo solve these issues pressing down on the industrial sector, Comrade Kaganovich has devised a plan: factory schooling. In most major factories and industrial plants across the country, there will be classrooms in which the largely illiterate workforce may learn to read and write. While it certainly will not provide them with a true education as they would have received elsewhere in the world, it will be more than sufficient."

 ISH_breaking_some_eggs_desc:0 "As Comrade Kaganovich says, one must break some eggs to make an omelet, just as one must occasionally break down the political opposition to get something done. The internal political situation is simply too delicate at the moment for Comrade Kaganovich's liking. There are too many threats to his power, and too many traitors against the revolution. These men not only are a danger to the people and the state, they also could be implicated in certain... failings of the state in the past.\n\nThese agitators and problematic individuals must be dealt with, swiftly and with as little resistance as possible. They will be rounded up, just as their kin in the military were short months ago, and either carted off to labor camps in Siberia or executed. While some commissariats may lose some valuable assets, what has been lost pales in comparison to what might be gained from their removal."

 ISH_long_arm_of_the_nkvd_desc:0 "The NKVD is the most useful tool in state security that Comrade Kaganovich and the revolution could hope for. While it is certainly no small organization at the moment, it must be expanded the larger the state grows. The more citizens under our purview, the more surveillance and accountability must be placed on them. In short: the NKVD must be grown. It must have eyes and ears in every corner, every alley, every meeting room, and every production line. No one will be able to keep a secret with anyone but themselves, and thus, no conspiracies could be possible.\n\nThis new NKVD will strike fear into the hearts of men-- a fear that is quite literally unspeakable. All know that they are watching, but know not from where. All know that they are listening, and so dare not speak their name. They shall hold every transgression against the revolution accountable, and leave no stone unturned, and no man unquestioned."

 ISH_a_hammer_in_every_hand_desc:0 "Every man, young, old, sick, must serve society in some way. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production. If Russia is ever to be reunited under the banner of the restored Union, she will need every able-bodied worker and soldier that she can. While the new industrialization plans kick off, the newly-constructed factories will need workers-- a resource upon which all socialism is built. These workers will be, for lack of a better word, conscripted, mostly from small agricultural villages. Every hand not holding a rifle or a child will be given a hammer to further the goals of Soviet socialism. After all, idle hands are the Hitlerites' playthings."

 ISH_metro_2_desc:0 "Mankind is facing an existential threat unlike any it has encountered in its brief existence on this planet: total nuclear annihilation. Dread it, run from it, it may very well still arrive, and if it does, mankind is likely to face total extinction. Be it from the flames of Himmler's ambition, a rapidly escalating conflict between the world's great powers, or just a simple mistake, the chance of nuclear war is too high to ignore. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich has laid out a plan for the preservation of the Russian people and of Soviet socialism such that it may survive whatever cataclysm the man brings down upon himself.\n\nThis plan, dubbed Metro-2, consists of a large network of tunnels and housing built beneath Tyumen. It would function as basically an underground city, capable of housing around 10,000 individuals. The network would be built on top of the water table, and thus have access to clean fresh water, in addition to geothermal and hydroelectric generators, food stores, and even growing rooms for small-scale agriculture. It would also have a large research section, from which the state can perform its largest and most secret science experiments. If the world is truly set on fire, Metro-2 might just be the safest place to wait for the ashes to cool."

 ISH_project_cain_desc:0 "The "Closed Availability Information Network" is a project envisioned by Comrade Kaganovich and heavily inspired by the success of the Metro-2 project. In it, many major cities across Western Siberia would be provided with large underground bunker networks, ostensibly to provide shelter to loyal citizens in the event of a nuclear war. In reality, these bunkers would be largely composed of labs, filled to the brim with enterprising scientists. They would provide an ideal place to conduct our most secret and/or dangerous experiments, far away from the prying eyes of the people or foreign spies. While some may call the trials done here "unethical", there is little ethical about not exploiting any advantage available for the benefit of socialism and the Russian people."

 ISH_no_such_thing_as_propaganda_desc:0 "What liberal dissidents would call "propaganda" or "deception", Comrade Kaganovich calls "necessary". Siberia can be compared to a stained glass window. In the old days, before the Soviet Union dissolved, the Communist Party and the state served as the pewter metalwork that held the window together. Now, the window is broken into a thousand different pieces of a thousand colors and a thousand ideologies. The only way to put the pieces of the window back together is through the media and political indoctrination of the public. \n\nTo successfully achieve mass propaganda and indoctrination, a much tighter grip will have to be placed over Siberia as a whole. The mass media will have to be greatly expanded and new, standardized school curricula will have to be enforced. In addition, the NKVD will likely have to be deployed to many towns and villages across the region, if only to scare the locals into submission."

 ISH_only_truth_desc:0 "Comrade Kaganovich is a stern man, but a liar he is not. While he certainly has twisted the truth a little in the past, or presented alternative facts to a situation, he would never lie to the people of Russia! Some things simply don't need to be known by the public at large. State secrets or deceptive foreign lies that might paint Kaganovich in a bad light simply should not be shown or discussed to the people. While, behind closed doors, many whisper that they fear Kaganovich and his NKVD, most of those unexposed to foreign lies have a good opinion of our beloved leader."

 ISH_and_only_what_they_need_to_know_desc:0 "No one can be trusted. The most harmless in society can develop into vicious political manipulators, agitators, dissidents, and other enemies of the state. Every worker, every soldier, every mother, every NKVD agent; every single individual is a pair of eyes and ears that could be used against the state. If Comrade Kaganovich's vision for a restored Soviet Union are to be accomplished, the eyes of the people must be closed and their ears be covered to all information except what they need to know. \n\nThe bureaucracy shall be greatly expanded, to the point that access to information is virtually impossible. Army officers and party officials shall only be given the minimum amount of information to achieve their tasks. The only person who knows the true extent and goings-on of the new Soviet Union shall be Comrade Kaganovich and a very few select individuals. Information shall be the enemy of the people, and the ally of the state."

 ISH_a_job_left_unfinished_desc:0 "Despite all the work that Comrade Kaganovich has put into the internal security of the state, some individuals simply cannot be convinced to abandon their wretched ideologies. The people have already been exposed to dangerous, subversive beliefs, and must be silenced. They number in the thousands and make up a significant portion of the political bureaucracy, the military, and even the secret police. Now, all these disparate enemies of the revolution shall be purged-- something that should have been done a long time ago. \n\nNKVD agents who are known to be loyal will seek out and question individuals who have shown unpatriotic or subversive activities in the past. The men will be interrogated, put on show trial, and either executed or sent to toil away in a Siberian labor camp. For too long have they gone unchecked in Soviet society, but with Comrade Kaganovich as our leader, their allotted time has expired."

 ISH_new_talented_officers_desc:0 "The Great Purge, as it is now being called, is finally over. The last known enemies of the state have been carted off to Siberia, or put into the ground. However, the purge destroyed a significant portion of the officer corps. Thousands of military units, mostly at the platoon level, lack leadership. Without officers to lead them, our once-strong military will dissolve into madness and stupidity at the first sight of combat. To alleviate this issue, a new corps of officers will be trained from existing veterans. These men are experienced and battle-hardened, but simply lack the education in modern tactics and combined-arms operations that are necessary for the making of an effective officer. It will take some time, but these men can be trained and educated into extremely effective combat leaders."

 ISH_man_of_steel_desc:0 "Kaganovich has finally become the man he has always looked up to and emulated: Joseph Stalin, the man of steel. This is not only a want of Comrade Kaganovich; it is a need. Russia, and the restored Soviet Union, will need a stern, unfeeling leader if it is ever to reclaim her lost glory. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich shall preside over the revolution with a heart of steel. He shall not love his possessions, he shall not love his children, he shall not even love his people, but he shall love Russia."

Death to the madman Karbyshev who leads them and wishes to plunge our once glorious nation into darkness! Death to the traitors of the Red Army in Sverdlovsk, who have threatened to destroy our glorious military and threaten to destroy our glorious nation! And death to the treacherous 'Field Marshal' Rokossovsky who leads this revolt against the glory of Comrade Kaganovich!\n\nWhen the traitor Bukharin assigned Comrade Kaganovich to Western Siberia, he did not realize that he would be setting the path for his own demise. When he showed his true colors and failed to stop the hated German scum from destroying our beautiful nation, Comrade Kaganovich led a glorious civil war against Bukharin in the name of his former comrade, Josef Stalin. While the Union fell, Kaganovich never ended his cause, and formed the great People's Republic of Western Siberia.\n\nTime did not prove our ally however, as the traitors in Omsk and Sverdlovsk betrayed the revolution and launched a surprise attack on the capital of Tyumen. While we bravely held out and stopped these attacks, the People's Republic now lies dead. With the German bombings still pummeling what little we have to dust, this situation has now lasted for over a year. Soon, however, we will find a way to bring justice to these traitors, and restore the Union for the glory of Comrade Kaganovich! And Comrade Stalin! And Comrade Lenin! For the people! Urah!"

Commissioned by Kaganovich, based off his personal writings, and sent abroad with hopes that its observation into an alternate history where Kaganovich's idol, Joseph Stalin, won his power struggles against Nikolai Bukharin would gain it legitimacy. The book was even touted pre-release as as the 'first piece of Russian literature in half a century' by the New York Times.\n\nSadly, however, for the Kaganovich regime, the book has been critically panned everywhere but the Soviet Union itself where reading of it has become mandatory in several state schools. Critics and historians both point out the unrealism of its plot and the ridiculous stretches of historical plausibility. The tale involves things such as Stalin not only managing to destroy Nazi Germany but reach as far as Berlin, forming a 'Budapest Pact' to counter a western led 'North Atlantic Treaty Coalition', an Israeli home state formed by the British (who manage to retain most of their Empire but slowly withdraw along with most other European powers due to rising tides of African nationalism) and a Soviet Union that lasts, 'until at least the 80s, during which Stalinism and the free market will begin their final confrontation, and if Stalinism loses, Russia will still follow its legacy and regain its strength in the new millennium with an invasion of Ukraine.'\n\nHow such rubbish even got published is anyone's guess."

They cannot murder the righteous spirit of the working class.\n\nComrade! Be reassured by the fact that the Communist Party has made many sacrifices in your name. Chairman Kaganovich works day and night striving to protect you from Naziism and warlordism. The Red Army, stalwart as ever, stands vigilant against the bandits who would harm you. The finest government in Russia makes the hardest decisions so that you can live without fear.\n\nComrade!

The Red Army tolerated few things less than insubordination. At least he could smoke.\n\nHe took an appreciative drag on his cigarette and let his eyes to pull him to something interesting. His vision settled on the bomb shelters placidly sitting in the distance, awaiting their purpose. It might have been the hour of day, but he was feeling contemplative. He had never quite appreciated how much of an achievement they were. After all they had faced, the collapse of the Union, the treason from within the general corps, the collapse, the West Siberian People's Republic endured, at least in Tyumen. No amount of bombs or bullets could keep the soldiers of the proletariat from taking back what was rightfully theirs.\n\nSure, the army was strict.

We have located several salvageable sites in the vicinity of Tyumen. The first is a large store of fuel left behind from an armor division that never deployed. The second is a stash of military equipment abandoned after mass desertions. Least important for the war effort but potentially valuable for morale is a warehouse of food, clothes, and other civilian amenities.\n\nAt the moment, we only have the resources for one.

Each soldier that survives is one that can contribute to the war effort. Many of our brass convincingly argue that we must prioritize the men who can drag us out of this miserable state.\n\nAnd yet, Chairman Kaganovich hesitates. What good are soldiers if they cower while the people they should be protecting are defenseless? The present crisis will pass, but the next generation will remember our sins. Civilian morale, already tenuous, may not survive the abandonment of women and children to the Luftwaffe's predations.

Rebuilding a nation was hard work! And yet there was plenty left to do before he could retire for the night. Just then, an aide, evidently also quite tired, entered the room. Kaganovich's aides were expected to keep the same schedule he did, and few had "Iron Lazar's" endurance. \n"I have another report for you, sir, concerning the state of our industrial development." \nThe Chairman made a brief grunt of acknowledgement before dismissing him and shifted in his seat to read the document. It had something to do with increasing production, like so many of the other communiques he had read that day. His eyelids sunk before he caught himself in the act. He really was exhausted, he thought to himself. He continued reading. The document, in very dry, bureaucratic language, enumerated the possibility of reducing the production of consumer goods to hasten that of heavy machinery. It reflected briefly on the effects on civilians before dismissing the concern. They had already put up with so much for the sake of the nation, why not just a bit more? \nThe idea of retiring to his quarters now and leaving the matter until morning floated into his mind before he pushed it aside. The Soviet Union had no use for a leader who couldn't discipline himself. He pondered for a few more minutes before, as he had done many times before, taking out a pen and writing his decision on the document."

The people, well alerted of potential attacks, have never been safer, and supply lines are moving better than ever. We cannot allow ourselves to be complacent; the Communist Party does not settle for adequacy, but strives to achieve perfection! We may have figured out their schedule for now, but the Germans can always change it once they realize our ingenuity. It is for this reason that a more permanent solution to the bombings needs to be put in place. \nOne potential option is to use our knowledge of their movements to go on the attack, delivering the people a badly needed blow against the fascists, so that they think twice before menacing them again. This solution would involve building fighter planes to intercept the bombers mid-air, using the element of surprise to overcome the technology gap. Fascists are inherently cowardly, and the Luftwaffe is not accustomed to resistance; a decisive strike could scare them away from our airspace in favor of weaker targets. \nThe next solution is more cautious, but with the potential of dealing with the problem for longer. Radar towers proved quite effective in prior wars, and their ability to remotely monitor aircraft would negate the need for detailed bombing schedules in the future, since we could react to bombers as we detect them. This type of response, while not directly challenging the bombers, could severely curtail their efforts in the future.\n\nThe Germans, brutish though they are, are not stupid. Whichever operation we choose will need to be flexible and highly responsive in order to ensure it is not bypassed completely by a change in the Luftwaffe's tactics."

It was in this state that Mikhail, his brother and economic minister, found him as he prepared to deliver a stack of papers. \nMikhail stood in the doorway, coughing as the smoke invaded his lungs. Although Lazar was actually the younger sibling, he couldn't help but feel intimidated, but Mikhail buried his feelings. They were brothers, after all, and this was important. He waited for Lazar to acknowledge his presence, but the Chairman's work continued unabated, either because he didn't hear Mikhail or because he didn't care. Mikhail cleared his throat. \n"I have some proposals I'd like you to read when you have the time." \n"Hm? Oh, yes, of course," Lazar replied unconvincingly, his attention clearly drawn to the already impressive pile on his desk. Seeing that his brother was still standing there, he spoke again, clearly irritated. "Do you have any other concerns?

However, on his desk sat a proposal, a proposal put forward by Mikhail to adjust the urban defenses in order to make up for the change.\n\n On the one hand, simply continuing construction of bunkers would make any changes in the schedule moot. On the other, adapting to the new schedule for the defense of the above ground infrastructure would be better in the short term for the people and morale in general. \n\n No matter what option was chosen, it would be a huge investment. The bunkers would provide a complete defense against the bombs, and if the bombing ever ended they would be useful for defending infrastructure against the other warlords of Russia. But, at the same time, keeping the defenses flexible would allow for a quicker response to changes in the bombing. \n\n Indeed, both ideas had their promise but only one could be followed in the end, the question was, which one?"

It was back breaking work, and it never seemed to be enough, but it was work and that is more than he had had in years.\n\n Vlad found that, despite the danger, he found a degree of fulfillment in his work. The threat of tunnel collapse was a near constant in the new excavations, before the supports were put in. He had lost a lot of friends to collapses, most recently Lev, but even then the work was worth it. It was drilled into their heads often enough how important this line was, the safety of their families relied on the tunnels. This tunnel in particular was integral to ensuring that the factories were unaffected by the bombs, and safe factories meant better lives for their families.\n\n Vlad could hear the machinery running on the other side of the rock now. He knew it would only be a matter of hours before the tunnel was ready for further construction. As he swung his pick, Vlad heard the characteristic rumbling that came before a cave-in.

While it has undoubtedly caused a large degree of suffering throughout our lands, most terribly what this anarchy has done is cut down on our already-small population numbers through bombing attrition, bandit raids, and acts of god.\n\nA number of different solutions have been drafted to the so-called "repopulation problem", though one, above all, stands out. Women have, for some time, worked alongside men in certain roles that are fitting to them. This was done initially out of necessity, but as things are on their way to normalization, the added productivity that women bring to the workplace in terms of an extra set of hands is worth mentioning. On the other hand, however, it is the nature of women to bear children. If they're working, they can't bear children and vice-versa.\n\nIf we were to limit once more women's opportunity for work and work advancement until they have sired a requisite number of children, it would simultaneously encourage women to have children while not outright banning them from the workplace like some reactionary stooges may encourage. Certainly, we may see a drop in productivity as some women leave to bear children if we do opt to escalate this program, but we will see a noticeable increase in our birth rates.\n\nUltimately, the decision rests with the chairman."
 ISH.15.a:0 "No. We must make a stand for our sisters."
 ISH.15.b:0 "Do it. The future of Russia depends on us."

 ISH.16.t:0 "Revolutionary Crèches"
 ISH.16.d:0 "One of the more significant aspects of our repopulation program was the establishment of the so-called revolutionary creches, a network of civil organizations dedicated to the rearing and caring of children. These creches, under the watchful eye of the party, have also integrated a number of different education programs for both the children and the women who tend to them, creating a nest of future ideologues and Soviet zealots.\n\nHowever, a question has been raised regarding the specific administration of the creches. Their rapid success has caused a number of interest groups to lobby for control over them, with many seeing the creches as a path to success and importance in the future. Ultimately, Kaganovich and his closest advisors have convened to decide a way forward and announce who will have the ultimate control over these child rearing organizations. After what has seemed to be hours of deliberation, the group has narrowed the candidacy for control over the creches down to two potential prospects: the local communes and the military.\n\nThe local communes, if they had control over the creches, would ensure that children will be raised within their own communities, and be instilled with not only a sense of community importance and familial unity, but also receive the fair and necessary civilian education that should be available to every young man. On the other hand, if the military was to control the creches, they would end up much more centralized, growing up with a greater sense of identity than to their own community. On top of this, of course, the military would be interested, just as we would be, in raising a future generation of soldiers, raised literally from birth to fight and die for the Union.\n\nAs the night grew late, Kaganovich's advisory council waited with bated breath on his final decision..."

 ISH.17.t:0 "Rebuilding the Red Army"
 ISH.17.d:0 "Valeriy Konstaninovich Zima breathed the chilly, Siberian air. The officer in Kaganovich's army had known little more than bunkers and bombing drills for the past few years, and despite the fact that the wintery bite of the cold morning seemed to pierce him to the bone, he could barely feel it - the fresh air felt too good on his face and in his lungs. The long-time Soviet soldier looked over what he jokingly referred to his peers as his "flock", a rag-tag group of conscripts that were drawn from all sectors of society. There was Shvets, who came from a poor migrant family - his nose had been broken too many times and his slender frame and short stature betrayed his family's poverty and his malnourishment. Filippov, the son of a disgraced intellectual, who carried with him an air of undeserved snobbishness, and Vinogradov, whose plumpish frame told volumes about his background as the fourth son of a party official.\n\nThese three were but a few familiar faces in a crowd well over a dozen. Despite Zima's long service, he remained on a maddeningly low rung of the Republic's command structure. Zima watched over his troops attempting to form up and sighed, noticing the glaring flaws that his soldiers likely didn't even know were issues. There was a lot of work to do, Zima thought to himself. But as one soldier nearly bumped into another, Zima pushed his stress out of his mind and took another deep breath of fresh air - bunker air was the worst, he reminded himself.\n\nAs he exhaled, a sense of pride - something he had not felt in a long, long time - welled up within his chest. "Comrades!" he barked, pride overflowing from his body towards his charges. "It's time we learned the basics!""

 ISH.18.d:0 ""Comrade Krevchenko, let's get this old girl running again shall we?"\n\nCaptain Yevgenovich opened the commander's hatch to peek out while Krevchenko, his driver, got to work. With a loud grunt from the engine, the old T-54 roared to life for the first time in several years. The memories of past battles and adventures came flooding back almost instantly to the Captain, who had always felt right at home sitting in a tank with his comrades. Now that the skies were clear, the Red Army could put their armor to work again. Leaning back down into the tank's interior, Captain Yevgenovich gave his driver a light shove with his foot to grab his attention.\n\n"Alright comrade, let's shake off the rust. Take us out of the warehouse, nice and easy." Krevchenko gave a nod in response, and Yevgenovich went back to his previous position. With yet another loud rev of the engine and a sharp movement that caused the Captain to jolt, the T-54 began to creep forward. Rolling out of the warehouse and into the sunlight of the outside, Captain Yevgenovich felt more powerful than ever before.\n\nThe tank may have been rather antiquated, but it worked like it was brand new. Several other soldiers had been standing around outside the warehouse, and they could not help but stare as the armored beast and its triumphant commander emerged. Younger recruits like them would likely have never seen a fully operational tank in action before, and the Captain knew that the sight must have been something to behold. The emboldened Yevgenovich now had a cheery look about him, giving an occasional wave to those who had come to observe. Finally, the old tanker was back where he belonged."

 ISH.19.d:0 ""Hey, Yuri, keep our speed up when we come up on that ramp, don't even think about slowing down. I want to see if we can make this thing fly!" Yuri heard his commander, who was shouting to get his voice across the incredibly loud interior of the tank, but did not turn to face him. To take his eyes off the course would be to invite disaster.\n\n"Are you sure that's wise, comrade?! The shock could kill all of us!"\n\n"We're in a tank, you fool! We'll be fine! Maintain our speed, Yuri!" As Yuri made a turn, the incline finally came into view. Against his better judgement, he decided to oblige with his commander's order. From the sidelines, the observing officers grew slightly concerned when the T-54 approaching the natural ramp did not slow down like usual.\n\nThe tank came to the slope, and as Yuri had feared the speed at which he was going caused the tank to soar through the air, if only for a second. The observers, meanwhile, watched in excitement and a little horror as the tank violently tumbled over the ramp. The impact could be heard over the engines of the other tanks navigating the obstacle course. After the tank had reacquainted itself with the ground, it remained completely still.\n\nFollowing a few tense moments, the tank resumed its relentless journey around the course, with sporadic cheers and claps erupting across the sidelines. Some of the older officers scoffed at the reckless nature of the stunt, but even they couldn't help but admire the spirit of the new recruits."

I want you to start today's lesson by throwing out anything you currently know about waging war with armor. I'm going to be frank: times have changed since the wars against the fascists, and to rely on old tactics would be nigh-on suicidal!"\n\nThe armored officers that had made up the class meticulously took notes as the general spoke. The room was overwhelmed by the sound of pencils at work.\n\n"Going into today's battlefields without being aware of what dangers are in store would be a total disaster. Man-portable rocket systems and specialized munitions give the enemy tank-killing power like you wouldn't believe. You must learn how to adapt in order to survive, comrades.\n\nTaking my words to heart during our little class today will be the deciding factor between rolling on to glorious victory, or perishing in fiery doom. Make no mistake comrades, you will be worse than useless to the Red Army if you die and take your expensive tanks with you, so be sure to pay attention!"\n\nThe officers were still scratching away at their notebooks, glancing up every so often to give their teacher the indication that they were, indeed, listening."

Eventually, he discovered his target. He put the binoculars away and signaled the rest of his squad. It was time to move out. A group of tanks hummed across the flat earth.\n\nThe bandit camp fell with little resistance. The shoddy, temporary tents were easily crushed by 25 tons of Soviet engineering. The bandits themselves put up a weak defense with small arms before scrambling off in all directions. A few were captured. Not as many as Captain Makarov would've liked, but the mission was still an overall success. The bandits wouldn't be able to terrorize the local villages without their supplies.\n\nAs the sun set in front of them and the bandit camp smouldered behind them, Captain Makarov and his tank squadron made the journey back to home base, eager to begin their next mission.

He blew his whistle to assemble the troops.\n\nHis men were scattered under various tents, talking, playing cards, or doing nothing at all. Exhausted from the day long military exercise, the warm afternoon sun lulled their sore muscles and heavy eyes into an innocent half-slumber in which the grass was soft and the day's work was nearly over. The whistle cracked their naive reality and they soon assembled in several rigid rows, ready to receive the words of their commander.\n\n"You call this your best!?" Kuznetsov spat.\n\nSeveral of the soldiers twitched, but none of them averted their forward gaze.\n\n"Will you be this lazy the next time bandits attack a village!? Will you sit back, light a cigarette, and watch them butcher women and children?!" he screamed at the men. "Well? Answer me!"\n\n"No, sir!" came the unified response.\n\n"Then get back to your positions! We're doing the exercise all over again, and this time do it correctly!""

He held out his right hand to shake, his left arm holding his bag of clothes and personal effects by his side.\n\nThe captain he had been assigned to looked at Aleksey's hand as though there was a knife in it. He cautiously reached out to meet it and gave an uncomfortably short handshake.\n\n"Your bunk is right here." he said with a small cough. He gestured to the bottom bed of a bunk in the corner, far from any windows or other soldiers.\n\nAleksey nodded and walked calmly to his bed. He felt the eyes of his new comrades bore holes in his body as he passed by. He flashed each of them a smile and even waved to a couple. He arrived at his bunk and withdrew his various possessions including a small journal. As the men whispered and gossiped about him, Aleksey composed his first report on the morale of his company."

Osipova smiled at her and returned her gaze forward, stoic and brave, like any hero should be.\n\nShe was in a city square on a platform with several high ranking party members and, most importantly, Chairman Kaganovich. The flags of the West Russian People's Republic and Soviet Union were hung behind them.\n\n"We are here today to honor Comrade Valeriya Osipova for her bravery in saving an entire family from a German attack." the Chairman began, speaking into a microphone that projected his voice across the square. "Comrade Osipova risked her own life to rescue a family of five after their farm was bombed. She crawled through the ruins, freed them from the burning wreckage, and was even able to resuscitate one of the children, who would have died had she not been present. For her valiant actions, I hereby award Comrade Osipova Hero of the People's Republic."\n\nKaganovich pinned a simple, yet striking medal to her chest before he began to clap.

Waiting until the last of them left, Andrei Lebedev took out a bottle of vodka from his friend and took a swig. Day in, day out. Telling the new meat about the horrors of the Black League. About Omsk. About him. Andrei held back memories as Karbyshev's aide, hear the tips about leadership and tactics. The unlight in his eyes the day he returned, still scarred and bloodied. He took another drink, trying to forget Karbyshev's long, rambling diatribes about the "Great Trial" and the "inherent strengths of the Russian people" and the day he denounced socialism, the revolution and the Communist party, declaring his Black League will stand for only vengeance and war.\n\nAndrei finished the bottle, his throat burning like his mind."

Now that we border their state, they see no reason for us to remain isolated and alone. If we accept, every pilot will receive military honors, and our civilian population will be awarded for their dedication as well.\n\nThis is quite the proposal, complete integration. It would be the end of our independence, but it would permanently resolve our resource shortages, and the civilian population would not need to sacrifice as much in order to maintain our planes. However, Kaganovich has not changed since his last offer, and our previous objections are still all too relevant. Is it better to live under a tyrant, or to die with our freedom intact?

Their ingratitude is shocking as it is unexplained, as we have done nothing but tried to work out an agreement that would benefit everyone in the long run.\n\nWhatever the reason they decided to antagonize us for, it is clear that their command of the air, as well as their newfound hostility towards us mark the Free Aviators as a menace to the safety of the revolution.

What is to be done if the answers to the two previous questions are not the same?\n\nThe cause of our infantry's new found philosophical inclinations is none other than the socialist rabble rousers in Tyumen. Kaganovich wants to take our land and will face much less opposition from an army that thinks more than it shoots. His infiltrators and propagandists have worked their magic and we are left with a force in conflict with itself.\n\nAs much as can be done to limit the damage, has been. Traitors have been shot.

It is clear that Kaganovich and his minions have set their sights on our piece of the Russian anarchy to sate their expansionist hunger.

Wildcat strikes cripple factories as workers, drunk on fantasies of equality, blindly lash out at the hand that feeds.\n\nThis is not a natural phenomenon.

For now, however, we suggest a simple treaty of nonaggression in order to announce to the world our mutual willingness to advance international socialism.\n\nMuch of Russia is still consumed by chaos and ruled by reactionaries.

The world is still a dangerous, dark place divided between three empires. At the fault lines where these spheres meet, conflict is sure to erupt.\n\nIn the coming years, as Russia rises under Chairman Kaganovich's guiding hand, your region will be sure to grow increasingly geo-politically prominent as well. The Revolution must be protected from both external and internal threats. We hope that this military aid serves your state well in the defense of socialism."

 ISH.46.t:0 "A Denunciation from the Urals"
 ISH.46.d:0 "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received notice of a public diplomatic condemnation from an entity calling itself the West Siberian People's Republic. This government, ruling from its seat in the eastern city of Tyumen, claims successorship to the fallen Soviet Union, and is led by Chairman of the Communist Party Lazar Kaganovich, who claims an \"anti-revisionist\" orientation. The message, undoubtedly authored with heavy influence from the Chairman, reads as follows:\n\n\"The Empire of Japan, one of the foremost imperialist powers on Earth, is one of the foulest enemies of the global proletariat. Under the guise of opposition to European imperialism, it has militarily occupied and incorporated into its \"Co-Prosperity Sphere\" a number of the countries of Asia, only to further their enslavement under its own rule. Its crimes include the invasion, occupation, and subjugation of China and the massacre of its inhabitants, the systematic extraction of the resources of Manchuria and Southeast Asia for its own ends, the widespread use of slavery in the form of the \"romusha\" and similar systems, the sponsorship of murderous fascists in the former Soviet Union, the suppression of people's movements in Japan and abroad, and too many other crimes to count. The Japanese bourgeoisie have effectively fused with the state and military apparatus to further the oppression and exploitation of the people of Asia, and in terms of the number of people under its rule alone Japan is the largest fascist regime in human history. It is the task of the world's workers to smash this horrid empire, and give the nations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere true self-determination.\" \nThe WSPR's stance, perhaps to be expected for a communist state, is extremely anti-Japanese. If Kaganovich is allowed to revive the Soviet Union, our control over the states of East Asia would become significantly harder to maintain."

 ISH.47.d:0 "The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs has received notice that a Russian warlord state referring to itself as the \"West Siberian People's Republic\" has issued a diplomatic condemnation of the Greater German Reich. The Republic, reportedly steered by Chairman Lazar Kaganovich, a Jew, is headquartered in Tyumen and reportedly pushes a more aggressive economic policy than its Soviet predecessors. The message, a caustic screed expectedly filled with Bolshevik cliches, reads as follows: \nThe Greater German Reich is among the greatest imperialist powers in human history and perhaps the bloodiest. Its fascistic, hyper-reactionary, ideology has led it to commit the greatest genocide in human history: the extermination of Jews, Poles, Russians, Balts, and other peoples of Eastern Europe in the name of colonialism and imperial expansion. Through the widespread use of slavery, predicated on race lines, it has overseen the hideous exploitation of the labor of over forty million people in Europe alone, with its conquest of the old colonial territories in Africa expanding that number by millions more. The Soviet Union, a worldwide beacon of the workers' struggle, also fell prey to Germany's depredations, with incalculable costs to its people and the continued occupation of its core territories. The poisonous ideology of racism, which divides the working class only to imiserate them all, has seen no greater success in the world than here, and it ought to be the goal of the international workers' movement to tear down this fascist monstrosity and free the peoples of Germany and Eastern Europe alike.\" \nThe WSPR may rise to be a threat in the future, but as of now it is still weak and surrounded by enemies, its threats mere saber-rattling. Let it try to challenge the Reich's hegemony; no matter how many times the Bolsheviks rise against us, they will always fail."

 ISH.48.d:0 "After over a decade of isolation from any of their comrades in the other SSR's, Central Asian communists have received a very pleasant surprise: correspondence from the Russians! Diplomats and emissaries from the West Siberian People's Republic to the north have journeyed into the region, telling of sympathetic leadership to the north and a revitalized, state-driven communist system, with a leader keenly aware of the mistakes of the old Soviet Union. They promise that aid, trade, and better relations are just around the corner, as soon as the WSPR figures out the logistics of sending supplies through the still-turbulent countryside. In the meantime, they plead only for recognition, and an assurance that the Central Asians will work alongside them for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union when the time comes. \nFor the Central Asians, this offer certainly seems tempting. Aid to reconstruct their shattered, underdeveloped economies and arms to fight their petty border wars would certainly be welcomed. A connection to the outside world for the first time in years seems too good to be true. But there are always doubts; what happens if Tyumen makes demands that infringe upon their sovereignty? The rumors that trickle out of Tyumen paint \"Iron Lazar\" as far more controlling than the rosy picture his diplomats have painted of him might imply. Assuming the Central Asians decide to embark down the path of friendship with the Siberian strongman, they have much to look forward to, and much to be wary of."

The amount of information being shared is incalculable, but they were invited here for more than a polite discussion over tea and biscuits.\n\nAs the greetings turn to discussion, the delegates are steered towards the correct topic. With the end of the International a new organisation must rise to take its place. Comrade Kaganovich gave an impassioned speech on the importance of socialist brotherhood, receiving uproarious applause from the assembled delegates.\n\nWith that, Comrade Kaganovich proposed the establishment of an organisation that would coordinate socialist movements across the world under the benevolent guiding hand of the USSR. The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties will be an organisation that coordinates socialist movements across the world under the benevolent guiding hand of the USSR. Each government delegate is offered the chance to join, either as a full or an associate member."

We are always happy to meet with our socialist brothers however, and with a delegation quickly assembled a plane was chartered for the Soviet Union.\n\nThe conference was impressive, despite the diminished state of the Union. Comrade Kaganovich clearly did his best to ensure that the loss of Moscow was not felt too keenly, and the gathering was as heavily attended as the Socialist International in the heyday of the revolution. Spanish anarchists and British Trotskyites, Cuban Leninists and Russian Stalinists, every denomination of leftist imaginable in attendance. Such a gathering of minds had not yet taken place this generation.\n\nThroughout it all was the constant presence of Lazar Kaganovich, shaking hands and making himself known.

The day is ruined, he thought as the craft landed in Tyumen, Khrushchev had better have a good reason for summoning me halfway across the country. The morning was fairly normal - Lazar adhered to his regular routine of a quick shower and breakfast before inspecting the new factories in the North. Everything was shattered when he received a report of unscheduled army movements, followed by an unplanned trip to the Party.\n\nThe airplane door opened, Lazar rushed into the field where five black cars awaited. Khrushchev exited, flanked by armed NKVD officers. Before the Chairman could react, his plane roared back to life and fled.\n\n'Comrade Koganovich,' began Khrushchev as a soldier handcuffed Lazar, 'you are charged with incompetence and treason against the Party. You have been found guilty by a general assembly this morning.'\n\nThe Chairman was stuffed into the car's backseat, struggling to describe his confusion and rage.

The tyrant Kaganovich has been ousted from power, no longer shall you be forced to work in these camps!' Nikita Khrushchev summoned the attention of everybody now, his voice boomed through the falling snow: 'Our new Union is built upon justice, equality, freedom, not slavery and these gulags.

Khrushchev raised his fists, 'From now on, we will do everything in our power to reinforce the socialist dream! As we speak, prisoners are being freed from the icy gulags, the bureaucracy is undergoing cleansing, even the powers of the far West look more favorably towards us!'\n\nThe Party had indeed changed since the coup - some Tatars managed to obtain seats, there was more representation for women, and less NKVD officers listening to every conversation.

The NKVD officer, a significantly younger fellow ordered to oversee his first execution, asked, 'Any last words, Comrade?' a phrase he often heard in the movies. Malinin sighed, straightened his cap, and, in a sudden change of character, shouted: 'Long live Comrade Kaganovich!'\n\n'Ready!' shouted the officer, 'Aim!' and the soldiers aimed.
