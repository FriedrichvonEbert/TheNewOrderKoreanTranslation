 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_LAZAR_KAGANOVICH_DESC:0 "많은 사람들은 부하린의 소비에트 연방이 붕괴했을 때, 부하린의 정적 중 한 명이 러시아의 가장 강력한 지도자가 될 만큼 권력을 쟁취하리라 생각하지 않았습니다. 하지만, 라자르 모이세예비치 카가노비치는 그들이 틀렸다는 것을 보여주었습니다. 이오시프 스탈린의 열렬한 추종자인 그는 부하린의 정책에 반대했고 그 결과 평소에는 명예직에 불과할 서시베리아로 보내졌습니다. 하지만 그는 전쟁이 일어났을 때 최전선에서 멀리 있었고, 결국에는 서러시아 전쟁 전 시점에서 러시아에서 가장 큰 국가의 지도자가 되었습니다.\n\n콘스탄틴 로코솝스키 원수, 드미트리 카르비셰프 중장, 그리고 제3군과 제10군의 도움으로 라자르 카가노비치는 우랄 산맥에서 옴스크까지를 아우르는 서시베리아 인민공화국의 설립을 선포하였습니다. 그에게는 불행하게도 신생 공화국은 장수할 운명이 아니었습니다. 독일 루프트바페의 폭격과 그의 예전 동료의 배신으로 공화국은 붕괴했습니다. 소비에트 연방의 잔해에서 태어난 공화국이 단명한 곳에서 로코솝스키의 군대는 서부, 카르비셰프의 흑색연맹은 동부를 차지했고 그 결과 카가노비치는 튜멘으로 후퇴한 뒤 서시베리아에서 남은 땅에 대한 지배를 확고히 할 수 밖에 없었습니다.\n\n이제 카가노비치는 러시아의 난세를 해치며 그의 약해진 국가를 지도해야 합니다. 그는 안과 밖에서 수많은 적들에게 포위되었을지 모르지만, 그의 혁명적인 정신은 아직 확고하고 불변히 남아있습니다. 늙은 볼셰비키 강경파인 카가노비치는 무슨 수를 써서라도 확고하게 국가의 적을 섬멸하고 전인민의 프롤레타리아 국가를 찬란한 붉은 10월의 날들부터 위대한 선구자 레닌, 그리고 그의 가장 위대한 제자인 스탈린 동지가 구상해왔던 그대로 구체화할 것입니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHCHERBINA_DESC:0 "It is no wonder Boris Yevdokimovich Shcherbina was selected as the administrator of Tyumen when one looks at his record. After arriving in West Siberia as a young yet ambitious party official, he soon found himself stranded as the government in Moscow fell. He was shielded from the chaos by Lazar Kaganovich, who saw his skills, and by the time of the Zlatoust invasion had long made him his chief economic advisor.\n\nHowever, his lack of loyalty to the authoritarian system Kaganovich admired so much was made clear as soon as the well-armed forces of Dragunov marched eastwards. Abandoning his former beliefs and lusting for power, Shcherbina came to a secret agreement with the merchants of death. The Ural Republic could use like him in governing the lawless lands, and for that he would be appointed governor of Tyumen. His talent soon became clear as day, and now Shcherbina wishes to make his territory a model province, even under the watchful eye of Zlatoust."

 ISH_revisionist_remnant:0 "마지막 수정주의자"
 ISH_revisionist_remnant_desc:0 "우리가 서시베리아의 조그마한 잔존 국가로 몰락했을지는 몰라도, 이것이 레닌의 대의의 최후가 되도록 놔두지는 않을 것입니다. 이를 위해, 정통 레닌주의를 포기해야만 할지도 모르지만, 카가노비치 서기장께서는 무엇으로 나아가야 하는지 알고 있습니다. 그의 새로운 교리가 우리를 황폐한 국가에서 혁명의 성공적인 결과로 이끌 것입니다."

 ISH_holding_out_desc:0 "구소련의 영토들에 현재 경험하는 것보다 더욱 어두운 시절은 없었습니다. 조그마한 군벌들끼리 전쟁을 벌입니다. 그리고 그 동안 이 고통을 처음 안겨준 파시스트 놈들은 그들의 무서운 루프트바페를 날려보내 우리 머리 바로 위에 죽음과 파괴를 뿌립니다.\n\n사실, 라이히의 잔인한 파시스트들은 우리의 옛 패배에 만족하지 않으며, 러시아 사람들을 발로차서 쓰러질때까지 한 걸음 더 나아가고 싶어합니다. 이런 상태는 계속될 수 없습니다! 카가노비치 서기장은 고통받는 사람들의 고충을 듣고 있으며, 그의 도움으로 최악의 피해를 완화시키기 위한 새로운 전략이 착수될 것입니다."
 ISH_bunker_building_desc:0 "매일 폭탄은 떨어지지만, 우리 공화국의 사람들은 어디에도 숨을 곳이 없고, 그들의 꿈에 나올 정도로 뚜렷한 공포를 느끼며 목숨을 걸고 도망칠 수밖에 없습니다. 사망자 수는 날이 갈수록 증가하고 있고, 루프트바페가 피의 수확을 거두려 다시 도착했을 때 사람들이 찾을 수 있는 피난처를 제공하는 조치가 취해져야 합니다.\n\n정답이요? 정답은 바로 더 많은 벙커입니다! 모든 도시에는 평시에는 깨지지 않는 방공호 역할을 할 강력한 벙커 시스템을 갖춰지게 될 것입니다. 그리고 전시에는 효과적인 방어 수단이 될 것입니다. 우리 공화국은 거대한 요새가 될 것이고, 공중으로도, 육상으로도 뚫을 수 없을 것입니다!"
 ISH_military_holdouts_desc:0 "Now that plenty of bomb shelters have been made available for our people, they can now sit in relative comfort and safety as the Luftwaffe attempts in vain to break their body and spirit, but what of the military? How can they hope to keep watch against our many enemies with explosives being rained down on their heads on a regular basis?\n\nSimple: we shall build even more fortifications! This time, the locations of our fortified positions shall be chosen with the military in mind. The most likely lines of defense shall be turned into impenetrable redoubts that are mostly safe from any kind of aerial attack, as well as being well-prepared for potential ground assaults."
 ISH_scavengers_paradise_desc:0 "Comrades, let us face the facts: the West Siberian People's Republic has seen better days. Most of its infrastructure lies in ruin, and countless scores of both civilian and military equipment have been lost to the chaos of the collapse. Now that we are making a serious attempt to get back on our feet, we desperately need that equipment back.\n\nAlthough we currently lack the industry to produce goods ourselves, there are millions of valuable artifacts from better days that are simply lying out in the open, waiting to be claimed. The green light has been given to execute a large-scale expedition into no-man's-land with the goal of rescuing as much lost materiel as we can. With luck, our scavengers will come home with plenty of abandoned equipment just waiting to be put back to good use." 
 ISH_hidden_communes_desc:0 "Bomb shelters have proven to be an effective layer of protection for our people, but their very nature means that those who still go about their business on the surface will have to maintain a keenly-developed sense of danger in order to make it to the shelters in time. To make matters worse, there is no telling what would happen should the Luftwaffe decide to harass us at night.\n\nPerhaps it would be wise to expand these shelters to serve another purpose: underground bomb-proof homes for the people! If the people are living and working safely underground, then they would not even have to concern themselves with the arrival of the bombing raids. Better yet, they'd finally be able to sleep at night knowing they wouldn't be awoken by a siren!"
 ISH_behind_the_times_desc:0 "Modern technology is all well and good, but what use is it if our factories are too damaged to produce them? The fact is, all of the luxuries of the modern world will have to wait until the People's Republic isn't getting pelted with bombs nearly every day and we can actually get our industry back up and running again.\n\nThe solution lies in providing the people with older, more antiquated goods. Although they are less convenient to use, they are much easier to produce, especially in stressful times like ours. After all, when it rains death on a regular basis, our people would hardly be picky with what goods and services they have access to. In fact, they should consider themselves lucky they're getting anything at all!"
 ISH_survival_society_desc:0 "In these times, our focus should be less on comfort and more on survival. Our government's decisions could be the deciding factor between life or death for hundreds of thousands, and sadly there comes a time when difficult choices will have to be made.\n\nThis is one of those times. The bombings impact our noble republic on every level, from the innocent people who are helpless against the might of the Luftwaffe, to our military which suffers insurmountable casualties every week from the sheer volume of aerial strikes. It is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot save everyone, and a choice is presenting itself. Should we focus our efforts on protecting the innocent, or preserving our military strength?"
 ISH_the_underground_world_desc:0 "The surface has been a land of death and misery for many years now, and our people are finding it much safer to seek brighter opportunities underground. Who are we to stop them? As a matter of fact, there is great wisdom in this trend, and we would do well to embrace it with open arms.\n\nThe Chairman himself has given the go-ahead to begin the construction of vast underground complexes which will serve a large variety of roles, from industry to dwellings. Ideas have even been proposed for entire military bases to be built underground! Such is the canny ingenuity of a truly socialist society, to find hope in the most unlikely of places while in the darkest of times!"
 ISH_rapid_caravaneering_desc:0 "Yet another necessity caused by the bombing raids are the system of caravans that have formed the lifeline in the devastated regions of Russia. Unfortunately, the fascists have already caught on to the most common routes used by the caravans and have begun launching strikes with the specific goal of cutting off our supplies in transit.\n\nIn the interest of avoiding such disasters in the future, we shall begin to devise new routes for our caravans intended to expose them to as little risk of being intercepted by the many dangers of the Russian no-man's-land as possible. Although these unfamiliar new routes will take some getting used to for our caravaneers, the continued influx of supplies would surely be worth any potential inconvenience that may arise."
 ISH_living_in_the_shadow_desc:0 "The bombings are only getting worse as time goes on, and our already weak industry is being stretched to its absolute limits. As a result, production is more sluggish than we'd like, and the slow pace has come at the cost of less supplies and equipment reaching the frontlines. To ensure that our military stands ready to face any kind of foe even under these circumstances, perhaps it may be necessary to make even more sacrifices.\n\nA considerable portion of our production capabilities are devoted towards producing goods for the civilians. Theoretically, diverting production of civilian goods would provide a substantial boost to the production of arms and equipment for our troops, but is it really worth taking away what little luxuries our people still have access to? The final decision will rest with Chairman Kaganovich..."
 ISH_study_the_bombings_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe darken the skies with their sinister presence, unleashing death upon the innocent people of our republic on a near-daily basis. Perhaps, though, the frequency of the bombings could yet prove to be the fascists' undoing? Some our more astute comrades in the remnants of our air forces have noticed that certain patterns are beginning to emerge in the bombings, but they cannot know for sure unless an effort is taken to study them in detail.\n\nTo that end, we shall begin taking notes of the fascist bombings from here on out. The timetable of the attacks will be carefully analyzed to see if obvious patterns in the raids truly do exist. With any luck, our comrades will be able to predict exactly where and when the bombs will fall, and true efforts to mitigate the majority of their damage can begin in earnest."
 ISH_on_the_clock_desc:0 "Our efforts to study the fascist bombing raids have borne fruit! Thanks to our intensive analysis of the times, dates, and locations of the bombings, a highly conspicuous pattern did, in fact, emerge. The Luftwaffe's power in the air may be fearsome indeed, but it is clear to us now that these fascists are nothing if not predictable.\n\nNow that we can accurately and reliably predict where the bombing raids will happen, the next step will be to prepare potential targets for the raids in advance. Although we cannot stop the bombs from dropping for now, we can, at the very least, ensure that they land in areas where virtually no critical damage can be inflicted. There is indeed a light at the end of the tunnel!"
 ISH_the_mikhail_system_desc:0 "Comrade Mikhail, brother to the Chairman, has come forward with a wise proposal for further minimizing the impact of the bombings. He believes that it would be necessary to devote a significant portion of our efforts to mitigate the damage towards ensuring the safety of all personnel considered essential to our cause.\n\nIndeed, losing these highly important men and women in a near-instant to one of the raids would spell disaster for the republic, and it is when this fact is considered that Mikhail's idea begins to carry weight. Under his proposed system, we can both substantially increase the protection afforded to our essential personnel while, at the same time, not being forced to abandon our people to their fate."
 ISH_off_the_clock_desc:0 "The systems put in place to prevent any significant damage from the bombings took some time to bare results, but it appears that they are finally working their magic. The ordnance rained upon us from the Luftwaffe now detonates in unimportant locations while our more critical infrastructure has survived raid after raid.\n\nMeanwhile, deaths caused by the bombings have witnessed a noticeable decrease over the last few months. Once again our people feel safe going about their business on the surface so long as the proper precautions are followed, and for the most part we no longer have to fear the coming of the Luftwaffe. Now that we have room to breathe, perhaps the time has come to start figuring out ways to clip the fascists' wings..."
 ISH_preventative_measures_desc:0 "For too long have we cowered at the mercy of the Germans and their Luftwaffe! No longer are we forced to scurry to our bomb shelters like rats while the fascists terrorize and destroy our lands as they please, with our weakened military completely and utterly powerless to stop them. Now their bombs have been rendered worse than useless, and we have gained the opportunity to take action and inflict some terror of our own.\n\nWith the aid of the advanced anti-aircraft weapon systems we have acquired from various sources over the years, we can finally put them to use by establishing various weapon sites near locations where the German bombers are known to frequent. Once our weapons are in place, the cocky bomber pilots of the Luftwaffe will be in for a nasty surprise when their seemingly helpless targets start firing back!"
 ISH_necessary_losses_desc:0 "Despite all our efforts to prevent the worst of the bombings from affecting our people, it sadly remains true that we cannot ever hope to spare every last person from their effects. Chairman Kaganovich understands this cruel fact better than anyone, and knows that if he tries to prioritize both the urban and rural populations neither will see any noticeable improvement over their current conditions.\n\nTherefore, he has decided to prioritize the protection of the urban populations of the republic. Being more tightly packed population centers, the cities are obviously more vulnerable to the bombs than the spread-out farmlands. While the cities will benefit from new bunkers to fall back on in case of emergencies, those who live in the rural communities will just have to make do with what they have."
 ISH_do_and_die_convoys_desc:0 "As a consequence of increasing our anti-air efforts in the republic, refugees have flocked to our borders like never before. While we welcome the influx of newcomers to our depleted lands, this newly-emerging rush to get to the safety our republic now provides has not gone unnoticed by our German nemesis...\n\nWe can attempt to help the refugees, but to try and save all of them would invite disaster where it could have easily been avoided. The needs of the many outweigh the few, and sadly it may be necessary to sacrifice the smaller refugee convoys in favor of larger concentrations. While many innocents will doubtlessly meet a cruel death as a result of this, many more lives would be saved than if we tried to stretch ourselves thin trying to protect every last soul that walks into our borders."
 ISH_black_zones_desc:0 "Our production capabilities are still much slower than they could be, and while the bombings are much less damaging than the were a few months ago, it would still be far too risky to attempt repairing the bombed out factories that were abandoned long ago. The lightening of the bombings does, however, provide us with new opportunities.\n\nChairman Kaganovich has authorized a brilliant new approach to getting our armaments production back in working order. Weapons factories and arsenals are to begin construction in spread-out, highly confidential locations to help bolster our ailing industry. These locations are to be highly secretive and will be selected based on their likelihood of being discovered by the Luftwaffe. With the Germans beginning to show reluctance to fly brazenly over our skies like they once did, there do exist certain unassuming areas under our control that have not seen much attention from the raids."
 ISH_unpopular_decisions_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to protect the people of the WSPR's remnants, the endless bickering of the communes and their officials have never ceased. In fact, their dissent has only increased over the months! Certain powerful officials claim that we are abandoning the communes and the people of the republic in favor of more useful sectors of the nation and causing the misery of thousands.\n\nWhile these accusations are not entirely unfounded, this is just not the time to be arguing morality. Even if we were so foolish as to abandon highly important aspects of our nation's infrastructure and industry in favor of making sure a few people can plow their fields, they would doubtless manage to find things to complain about. We shall continue our policy of pragmatism that has shown so much success in the past, and ensure that these useless complaints fall on deaf ears."
 ISH_for_our_survival_desc:0 "For our survival, our republic has had to make many uncomfortable sacrifices in the name of ensuring the safety of the revolution and the prosperity of the nation. Many have given their blood and even their lives in the process, and the difficult choices that were made will forever enshrine the last few months as the one of the darkest periods in the nation's history. We aren't exactly proud of the cruel decisions that resulted in the loss of lives, but none can say that it wasn't worth it in the end.\n\nThe bombings have ceased for the most part, and the skies have been more clear than they've been in decades. People are once again coming out of their shelters and living lives that they hadn't been able to for so long.\n\nWith our safety from the German scourge secured, the time has come to honor those who gave their lives to ensure that this reality could become possible in the first place. May we never forget their sacrifice."

 ISH_the_clock_breaks_desc:0 "An uncharacteristic silence has overtaken the lands of the former People's Republic. Distant thumps and booms are no longer commonplace, the air raid sirens have not screamed their eerie warning calls for weeks, and nary a plane has been spotted in the sky for some time. The terror bombing campaign that has terrorized Russia for so long has finally come to an end.\n\nNow that the bombs have stopped, we must make up for lost time. There are many problems that will need to be addressed, the most pressing of which being the rebuilding of the nation. After all, the revolution cannot even hope to continue until we are well and truly back on our feet!"
 ISH_rebuilding_a_nation_desc:0 "Our long period under siege has severely damaged our economic and political institutions. We were brought to the brink of extinction, but, now that we are safe at last from the bombings, the time has come to begin putting the state back together.\n\nChairman Kaganovich has wisely put together a plan to repair our damaged factories, take the government out of the state of emergency, and reestablish our bureaucracy, reaching out to the people of Tyumen to bring them back into the fold after their struggle for survival. Soon, the Communist Party will have firmly pulled our state back from the brink, and the hard work of expansion can finally begin."
 ISH_rebuilding_the_factories_desc:0 "As we initiate the process of putting Tyumen back together, we must confront the fact that not everything can be done at once. Our limited resources require careful prioritization of the most necessary sectors of society, and sacrifices must be made eventually.\n\nTo rapidly restore the economy to its former state, we must establish a firm baseline, and prioritizing repairs to our shattered industry is the best way forward. The time for focusing on civilian infrastructure is after we have established a platform to work off of, and the best way to do that is to restore the state's industrial capacity and slowly bring vitality back to our economy."
 ISH_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Having been on defense against the Germans for so long, we have had precious little opportunity to focus on military development. As Marx taught us, it is vital for the workers to have arms, and nowhere is being defenseless more dangerous than in Russia, where slavering bandits surround us on all sides. While we are in less danger than when the bombings were ongoing, building up our military is vital.\n\nWith our factories resuming development, there is no better time to fully dedicate our resources to military development. A steady outflow of guns and bombs will ensure the workers' state its safety for a little while longer."
 ISH_armored_production_desc:0 "Military production continues to increase as more and more of our factories reopen. While this is good news, we cannot settle to merely match our enemies in production. We must surpass them, building newer and better weapons to utterly crush them in the battlefield. This is what Chairman Kaganovich has decreed.\n\nTyumen will accept only the finest weapons of war, and what finer example of modern military might than armored vehicles? Cheap, effective, and well-protected, Tyumen's new fleet of armor will be the vanguard we need to spread communism across Russia."
 ISH_civil_infrastructure_desc:0 "The effects of years of German bombings on the domestic infrastructure of the state is evident in all aspects of daily life. Major routes are impassable, detours are overloaded, and important features such as bridges and tunnels are almost all destroyed. This not only affects nearly every aspect of state operations, but also acts to isolate many communities, both major and minor, from the central government.\n\nAs such, Chairman Kaganovich will announce a program of intensive and targeted construction, focused both on replacing destroyed and also in establishing critical new sections of national infrastructure. All the people in the People's Republic must be connected to each other, for it is only through collective effort that we can, and will, prevail."
 ISH_swords_to_plowshares_desc:0 "A significant portion of Tyumen's military equipment is made up of surplus from the Great Patriotic War. After many years of bombing and turmoil, it is sadly obsolete and oftentimes only semi-functional due to lack of maintenance. The need to replace all of this weaponry makes our military buildup that much more difficult.\n\nJust because this gear is no longer fit for combat does not mean it is totally worthless. In a feat of ingenuity, the Communist Party has decided to repurpose old military equipment for agriculture, another pressing need for the state. Each truck that serves this purpose saves the government the resources it would have used for specialized agricultural tools. This is but another reminder that our leadership has the creativity and drive to cleverly overcome any challenge!"
 ISH_all_roads_lead_to_siberia_desc:0 "The revisionist administration of Nikolai Bukharin pursued the large-scale industrialization of the Soviet Union's Siberian territories. Inconveniently however, the lands we hold missed out on this. West Siberia is comparatively underdeveloped, with infrastructure that pales in comparison to the regions farther east. If nothing changes, we are doomed to fall behind, and the workers' state will be a historical footnote.\n\nThe Communist Party is incapable of knowing defeat, and we will struggle to right Bukharin's wrongs until our final breaths. West Siberia may be a backwater today, but if the triumph of the October Revolution has taught us anything, it is that the fortunes of a people can change meteorically in a short span of time. With the right vanguard, even a desolate wasteland could become a center of peace and prosperity, given enough time. West Siberia's comeback will be far quicker."
 ISH_seamless_industrialization_desc:0 "Industrialization is the first and most necessary step towards any nation's greatness. In order to ensure our hegemony over Russia, a rapid buildup of industrial capacity is ideal, but there is always a cost: overcrowded cities, food shortages, damage to the environment, and a decline in standards of living have historically plagued industrializing economies.\n\nThe WSPR is not like other economies, however, in that it is led by a workers' vanguard that looks after the broader population. It is possible for us, without the exploitation of capitalists, to create a fairer industrialization that does not sacrifice the people's well-being on the altar of growth. Full speed ahead! Under the Chairman's leadership, there is but a slim chance of backfire."
 ISH_red_storm_desc:0 "Since reclaiming West Siberia, the WSPR has been able to take a breather. Compared to our wars against the traitorous junta of Sverdlovsk and the fascistic lunatics of Omsk, this period of relative peace seems almost too good to be true. But let us not be mistaken; this is but a brief respite from the wars that we have fought in the past and those we will face in the future. We are not out of the storm but in its eye.\n\nThe storm of war will advance no matter what we do, and we must be prepared for the worst. Our industrial sector will need to be durable and highly productive in the coming days, and there is still a great amount of work left to do, but when the time comes for war, the reactionaries who menace Russia will learn that is the workers who are the storm, and they who will be obliterated by its rage."
 ISH_the_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Nikolai Bukharin's insistence on maintaining the New Economic Policy, while successful in pockets of the Soviet Union, failed to build up large pockets of the country and caused its total collapse to the Germans. Our need for development is high and the timeframe must be very soon. Following the old Soviet guidelines for industrial development in the future when the WSPR is still as vulnerable as it is would be suicidal.\n\nThe never-enacted Five Year Plan, part of the policy plank of the Bolshevik opposition, is the only solution to our industrial woes. An enormous state mobilization of all our productive forces for development as suggested by Joseph Stalin would have saved the Soviet Union in 1941, but we must settle for bringing its newest incarnation back to power over all of Russia."
 ISH_rebuilding_the_communes_desc:0 "The restructuring of the WSPR's infrastructure for war will require the tireless effort of the entire population. Rapid industrialization in the style of Joseph Stalin's plans would certainly improve the situation on that front, but our small slice of the USSR may not be ready for such sweeping changes. Agricultural reform and support for civilians are necessary to ensure that further development does not backfire and immiserate the population.\n\nNew, bigger collective farms! Widespread distribution of agricultural machinery! Massive housing construction drives! The Communist Party will meet all the people's demands and more, and the benefits to industry down the line will be fruitful indeed."
 ISH_repopulation_programs_desc:0 "History has not been kind to the Russians. War and want have left a great hole in the demographic structure where millions and millions of people should be. When prospects were so dire, who could blame the suffering women of the nation for not wanting to bring children into such a world? Now that things are better, we have run into a different problem: there are simply not enough people for our future economic goals.\n\nWe are first and foremost a party of labor, and there is no nobler labor than motherhood. Subsidies for families and single mothers, awards to those "Mother Heroines" who bravely raise 10 or more children, and controls on abortion will bring us back to where we need to be in terms of population."
 ISH_family_building_desc:0 "Abandoned by Bukharin in their time of need, the Russian people are in a sense a nation of orphans. There are however also very many literal orphans, those who lost their parents from war's ravages, hunger, or simply abandonment. The orphanages of Tyumen and many other of our cities are sadly filled to well over capacity with such children. Now that we have the time and resources to deal with this abominable situation, we must, or else we are not socialists and hardly even men.\n\nThe WSPR will set up an adoption system that is the pride of the world, linking families without children and children without families. Soon, our orphanages will be empty, and we will have taken the first step to overcoming the trauma of our most vulnerable from this long war."
 ISH_wives_for_soldiers_desc:0 "While our policies to encourage population growth have been moderately successful so far, we can always go further. Why limit ourselves to subsidizing parenthood and hoping for success when we could give more direct state backing? At the moment, we simply don't have the time to wait for love to run its course unaided.\n\nA new program will seek to automatically assign potential partners to one another, with voluntary membership in exchange for increased rations for female civilians. The other side of these new relationships will come from men automatically registered once they join the army. By demolishing the barriers separating potential partners from one another, the Communist Party hopes to build thousands of fruitful families in the near future."
 ISH_enforced_farming_desc:0 "Burgeoning industrial development causes a corresponding increase in the population, which in turn requires significantly more food. This is straightforward, but there is one problem: West Siberia is far from being Russia's breadbasket. Agricultural production has never been this region's specialty, but it is hard to imagine a future path for the WSPR if it does not increase significantly.\n\nWe need to make use of every inch of land we possess. Grain quotas will go up. Leaving one's fields idle will be prohibited. The peasantry may protest, but they will be compensated appropriately in the end. The task of feeding the country is one of the most noble ones out there."
 ISH_land_redistribution_desc:0 "There are a number of peasants willing to contribute to our nascent agricultural development, but they are unable to without any land to work. The uneven distribution of rural land hampers our goals and leads to great suffering among the landless peasantry. As with many social problems, the responsibility falls to the Communist Party to rectify the situation.\n\nCollective farming, a policy of Stalin and segments of the Bolshevik opposition shot down by Bukharin's government, is the key to overcoming our ills. The state will manage farms worked on by all the peasants in an area, allowing for modernization and efficient administration on a vast scale. The landless peasants will know justice, and more food will flow to the cities than ever before."
 ISH_communal_loyalty_desc:0 "The state can direct the creative powers of its citizens to stunning feats. However, it cannot do everything. While the government's attention is focused on heavy industry and collective agriculture, it will be unable to meet every concern of the communes. In such times, the people must take matters into their own hands.\n\nPropaganda encouraging self-sufficiency and cooperation between citizens is the first step towards molding a spirit of revolutionary sacrifice. People should be taught that every contribution towards the collective well-being, whether it be building wells, teaching their compatriots literacy, organizing work, or any number of other tasks. A socialist state cannot work until the people learn to work together in all ways."
 ISH_breakup_the_unit_desc:0 "Marxist theory tells us that the nuclear family will wither away with the abolition of private property, as communal institutions rise to take its place. While we have placed effort into reforming family relations in the past, there is always room to revolutionize things further. The family unit itself must be the Communist Party's next target.\n\nDelegating the responsibility of child rearing to the whole community will give parents the freedom for work or leisure. Values of collective solidarity are easier to instill when family barriers that separate children are broken down. With the size and resources of our military, it may be a good idea to give it some role in these new creches."
 ISH_rebuilding_an_army_desc:0 "Regrettably, the military history of the West Siberian People's Republic has yielded little success. The Republic, faced by betrayal from within, fell apart before even being able to begin the reclamation of the rest of Russia. Now that we have been reduced to Tyumen and its environs, it is clear that we will have to reevaluate our tactics.\n\nThe military is maybe the most important component to the revolution, and the solution to our military predicament likewise mirrors that needed to ensure the rebirth of the Soviet state: industrialization and centralization. The Red Army will be rebuilt into a force that can challenge the strongest, so that it can soon restore proletarian rule to the whole country."
 ISH_the_red_armor_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union, weakened by revisionist incompetence, was woefully unprepared for the onslaught of the fascists' modern army. Some of the most humiliating defeats came from the Reich's tank brigades, which swept over much of the country with devastating power.\n\nAs we prepare to reclaim the West Siberian People's Republic, we can take one lesson from our enemy: modern armor is an enormously powerful weapon in the right hands. Mechanizing the Red Army will hone it into a force capable of rapidly expanding our territory. Decisive action will make the difference in this war, and focusing on tanks allows us to focus on just that."
 ISH_revisit_the_doctrines_desc:0 "Our critics often accuse us of being overly wedded to doctrine. While adherence to Marx's theories is necessary to the utmost degree, the military is a different matter. Our reconstruction of the army to incorporate armored warfare is well underway, and our tactics have not kept up to the changing situation.\n\nThe tank is a powerful tool, but we will need a strategy to avoid wastefully losing them against enemy fire. As we witnessed too well during the Great Patriotic War, the Germans made a highly effective use of rapid tank deployment to overwhelm and disable us before we could even respond. Perhaps we need a "Blitzkrieg" of our own..."
 ISH_study_modern_designs_desc:0 "Russia's long isolation has cut it off from recent military developments, understandably considering the general state of chaos. We have had neither the opportunity nor the capital to begin improving our tank technology. The rest of the world has made considerable improvements in this regard, however.\n\nLuckily for us, we do not need to start our research program totally from scratch. Captured German and covertly donated American and Japanese tanks have sat abandoned in our armories since the 1950's. It is only a matter of reverse engineering them before we have designs of our own to show for our efforts."
 ISH_homebrew_armored_power_desc:0 "We have drawn plans, laid the theoretical groundwork, and closely studied the results of cutting edge foreign engineering. We have acquired the industrial capacity necessary for a modern army after years of ceaseless toil. Our workers have the necessary equipment and are full of zeal to serve the proletarian state.\n\nWe have everything we need to begin our tank program. Our factories stand ready to produce as many as we need to fully liberate west Siberia from the traitors that have plagued it for so long. All that there is left to do is begin."
 ISH_our_own_designs_desc:0 "Though we have made admirable progress in our armor development programs, the reality is that Tyumen is still an underdeveloped statelet, and our designers are only human. There have been a number of pressing issues with the new tank designs that must be resolved if they are to be effective.\n\nThese vehicles have been made with heavy influence from foreign models that are not necessarily suited for the environmental and industrial conditions of Russia. We need to modify them to suit our needs and establish a systematic framework of examination and data collection to do so."
 ISH_study_the_performance_desc:0 "Until this point, we have made great strides in tank designs and theoretical applications. Now that we have entered the construction stage, it is imperative that we move to practical fields. Accurate measures of their abilities in the field are consequently vital.\n\nWhat better way to investigate the performance of our tanks than to perform combat trials? Seeing how they move and fight in a controlled environment will give our scientists badly needed data about their abilities and allow us to make whatever modifications we need based on hard numbers."
 ISH_our_own_stratagem_desc:0 "One of the greatest tragedies of the downfall of the Soviet Union was the scattering of some of Russia's greatest talents to the wind. General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, known as the "Red Napoleon" for his contributions in the 1920's and 30's, is but one of these. Before his presumed death during the collapse of the WRRF, he innovated greatly in the field of military doctrine, with his "deep battle" theory, which emphasizes the movement of many formations in order to achieve victory through the entire battlefield, being of particular note.\n\nIn a fight such as this, where resources are limited and the outcome of a battle rests on a knife's edge, superior tactics are vital. Repurposing the work of the Soviet greats will only help us achieve victory."
 ISH_study_the_results_desc:0 "Now that we have performed closed trials, the next step for our burgeoning tank program is live-fire incidents. In battle, events proceed that cannot be predicted simply by using observations produced in the safe environment of testing grounds, and tank crews act far differently when in real combat.\n\nFor better or worse, there are many opportunities to enter a fight in warlord Russia. Bandits and raiders have plagued the countryside for years, preying on the peasants and making administration difficult. Sending our tanks after them will provide a relatively low-risk way to gather results, as well as freeing the people from their longtime oppressors."
 ISH_the_red_army_desc:0 "The core of any army, rather than sophisticated weapons or lofty strategies, is its men. Since the Great Patriotic War, Russian forces have held their own against the far more modern Wehrmacht simply by being well-trained and disciplined, even with the gap in resources.\n\nArmor has its place, but focusing too heavily on new technology over the cohesion and effectiveness of our soldiers expends resources that we cannot afford to waste. An infantry-centered army, with professional, well-equipped soldiers and vehicles in a support role, is the way forward to a new Soviet Union."
 ISH_be_brave_desc:0 "The barebones conditions we have been forced to work with mean that soldiers are often insufficiently trained, with poor morale. Soldiers often fight solely for the potential paycheck, abandoning their posts at the first sign of danger. As we professionalize our army, reforming its culture is key.\n\nThe worthy successors of the Red Army need to match it in cohesion. We will create a sense of brotherhood and patriotism in our soldiers as a collective. Marx taught us that the anarchy of hyper-individualism is no way to run a society. It is likewise the path to disaster for any reasonable military."
 ISH_reform_the_NKVD_desc:0 "The Bukharin regime, compromised as it was by revisionism and opportunism, was unwilling and unable to properly crack down on counter-revolutionary sentiments among the populace. The military was particularly poorly monitored in this regard, and the ultimate consequences were the deposition of Bukharin himself and the complete dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe new Red Army will not repeat such mistakes. The recreated NKVD will focus especially on the military, ensuring political loyalty and education and prosecuting crimes committed by soldiers as they reclaim the country. We must never forget that the army has some of the greatest potential for counter-revolution and therefore take steps to keep it under as much Party control as possible."
 ISH_not_once_step_back_desc:0 "During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet Union collapsed the day that its soldiers first chose to run rather than defend to the last man! They spoke of the Motherland and its infinite land... enough population and bread as far as the Urals to feed them all, they said. How foolish such talk was! Retreat after retreat, the cowardly men of the Red Army failed to see what they were fighting for before they stood a thousand kilometers from Moscow. We now see all too well the finity of Russia from Tyumen.\n\nThis defeatist and cowardly attitude was without a doubt what doomed the Union! The men lacked resolve, the officers lacked tenacity, and the whole army lacked courage! Under the right leadership, we would've seen an iron Russia, with an industrial backbone and as foundation of loyal, unfaltering men.\n\nIt is with the goal of this in mind that we demand this of the Red Army: under no circumstances shall unauthorized retreats take place! Under Kaganovich, we will build a new Russia!"
 ISH_the_red_tide_desc:0 "The soldiers of the Red Army cannot simply be the most plentiful, as the Nazi dogs would like to portray the "asiatic hordes;" they must also be the strongest, the most zealous, and the best drilled in the whole of Eurasia! It is the Red Army's soldier whose duty it was and continues to be to defend his Motherland from the terrors of fascism and dangers of reactionary thought and division!\n\nIt is also the duty of every able-bodied Russian man to take the place of the Red Army soldier during wartime, as he must provide for the Motherland in exchange for what it has given him. In doing this, he too must become the hardest willed, the sturdiest under pressure, the embodiment of the Soviet Man.\n\nIf we are to bring back the glory of the Soviet Union and return the sanctity of the Motherland, we must start with our warriors. Under the new discipline we shall forge a new USSR!"
 ISH_be_strong_desc:0 "We, the Russian people, have been ridiculed and accused of being weak individuals, acting in hordes to move against our many enemies. We must show the world what the power of the Russian man is when utilized to his full capacity. With this we will unleash our new campaign, one of a simple motto, but one that will fill our soldiers with a patriotic urge unlike any other; Be Strong!\n\nFor too long the Slavic man has been trampled, his lands ravaged, and his people massacred. But that shall no longer be true. The soldiers of our armies will be the paragon of strength, the paragon of virtue, and as such must be equipped in turn.\n\nThe best equipment at the disposal of our armories, or that can be bought from around the fractured Russia we seek to piece back together, will be given to our soldiers. While the best Russian equipment is not the best in the world, our soldiers will, with no doubt be the definition of the New Soviet Man."
 ISH_reform_the_guard_desc:0 "The Guard forms one of the many political excesses of the system, a remnant of an older age that has rotted in incapability rather than adapted to the changing times. If they cannot evolve, we must force them to. The Red Guard, forming a system of paramilitary organizations more political than functional, is barely a combat-capable force, and in a situation where they were thrust into battle they would struggle at best.\n\nWe must change this through a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Red Guard. While the political aspect is important and their contribution to stability is notable we have been given reason to believe that many of the lower-level leaders of the Guard have no business being leaders at all, especially not of such an esteemed political organization.\n\nThe rotting externalities of the Guard will be cut off and ruthlessly examined, while capable men will be put into these positions. The Guard will also have more frequent training in more relevant tactics, with better equipment and routine pay to expand loyalty."
 ISH_russias_finest_desc:0 "Naturally, if our army is to be the one to bring back Russia from the brink, it must also be her finest. Every soldier must be the paragon of the Soviet Man, with extensive drilling in physical and mental exercises. The physical requirements will go up, and the room for error down. From now on, every soldier that serves for the future of the Union shall be the perfect soldier; strong, smart, and zealous.\n\nAround us sit peasant armies, mercenary armies, and the armies of false prophets. None of these would be a match for a truly battle-hardened, disciplined, and drilled army, functioning as cogs in a giant machine that will roll through all of Russia, from Vladivostok to the Baltics.\n\nIn the coming trials, each soldier will be faced with difficulty, forced to confront sacrifice, and even experience it themselves. It is our job to ensure that when this time comes, our soldiers will have no trouble dispersing the enemy, and bringing glory to our Union!"
 ISH_power_to_the_mighty_desc:0 "It has always been our goal to introduce to Russia a truly meritocratic society, where nothing but desert gives power. We figure the best place to introduce this ideal is to our army, where corrupt generals still sit in positions of power we value so highly. We must push forward a new model, based on the ideals of equality, fraternity, and only the best soldiers going up the ranks. We will never be in the position to be the true heirs to the Soviet Union unless this Union not only continues but expands on the legacy of the former one.\n\nEvery soldier will be evaluated, his determination measured, and his capabilities tracked. By tracking the abilities of our men, we can then make sure that only the creme of the crop are selected for additional officer training. The training and conditioning of our soldiers, matched with the leadership of a true meritocracy, will be the driving force that shall bring our men to Moscow!"

 ISH_pertinent_matters_desc:0 "Of those who split from the WSPR in its darkest moments, none are so foolish and so misguided as our immediate rivals based in the cities of Sverdlovsk and Omsk respectively. If we are to unite the republic once again, these treacherous rats must be dealt with one way or the other.\n\nOne of the most devastating betrayals was that of Marshal Rokossovsky and his Third Army. When the going got rough for our republic, the Marshal stupidly decided to abandon our righteous socialist cause by inciting the entire Third Army to desert and form a separate military government to the north. Although their forces have been weakened by desertion and infiltration, they are still a formidable force led by a highly capable commander.\n\nTo the south lies the Black League, who are based in their stronghold in Omsk. Although the traitor general Dmitry Karbyshev is dead, his successor Dmitry Yazov has reportedly galvanized the League and is actively preparing them for conflict against us. While his base of power may not be as secure as it seems, it may be best to snuff these monsters out before they become too powerful.\n\nOne of these traitors shall become our first target, and the final decision will have to be carefully considered."

Anything less would be an insult to those who stalwartly battled the Wehrmacht when so many others abandoned the front."

 ISH_aid_the_peasants_desc:0 "As the situation within our territory continues to stabilize, the Communist Party has been met with new responsibilities in the civilian sector. Now that wartime measures are becoming less severe, peasant associations have become bolder in their requests from the government, arguing for more tractors, tools, and state support.\n\nIn better times, we would ignore or suppress them, but our desperate need for provisions gives the peasants significant leverage. Special priority will be placed on agricultural equipment and government relief. They will get their demands, at least while they can pressure us into meeting them."
 ISH_encourage_workers_culture_desc:0 "During Tyumen's most dire days, civilian conditions were put on the backburner in favor of feverish military production. Those times have passed, and all statistics show that our workers are being rewarded for their efforts with deplorable standards of living, at least compared to those before the war.\n\nIn its magnanimity, the Communist Party has decided to devote some resources to improving our ordinary people's lot in life. The ordinary people of Tyumen will soon enjoy greater amenities, a more abundant housing supply, improved education, and all the food they could ask for."
 ISH_finish_the_job_desc:0 "After we have eliminated Zlatoust, there is only one adversary left in West Siberia, and it pales in comparison to those we have already faced. The inmates of the Vorkuta gulag were largely left to their own devices after the Soviet Union's collapse and took the opportunity to found their own statelet. They prefer to be left alone, but now that we have consolidated our power, there is no reason to delay their incorporation into our republic.\n\nLogistically speaking, this is a demanding task due to the necessity of crossing the Urals, but the inmates themselves are hardly a threat. They are merely criminals, and we are the people's judges punishing them for their transgressions."
 ISH_the_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Victory at last! Through the wise and cautious leadership of Chairman Kaganovich and firm adherence to Marxist principles, we have conquered the entirety of our former territory and are now stronger than ever. The West Siberian People's Republic is now the sole sovereign government in the region and a worthy contender for the reunification of the Soviet Union.\n\nAll this success deserves some celebration. Chairman Kaganovich has already declared a holiday, and military parades will soon fill the streets of Tyumen. Of course, the real thanks go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, for their tireless efforts and fierce loyalty to the Republic. Glory to the Communist Party! And may it be the Communist Party of the Soviet Union very soon."

 ISH_denounce_social_fascism_desc:0 "One of the most insidious political ideologies in the world is social democracy. Purportedly a friend of the labor movement, it in fact disarms and defangs the proletariat, funneling its energies into pointless reform movements rather than firmly opposing capital and siding with warmongers and reactionaries time and time again, as was seen in the Great War, the failed German Revolution, the Russian Civil War, and countless other conflicts. Far from being an ally of the workers, it is one of the most ingenious tools of the bourgeoisie, just another side of the same coin as fascism.\nWe must condemn "social fascism" wherever it rises, hopefully leading the workers of the western world out of this trap. Those who are salvageable will listen; those who are not will reveal themselves as such, when they refuse to abandon the path of electoral "reform"."

 ISH_the_call_of_the_comintern_desc:0 "After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918, the infant Soviet state formed a Communist International in the name of advancing socialist revolution. As a result of the revolutionary ebb of the interbellum and the rise of fascism, the Comintern failed to advance revolution outside of the Soviet Union itself, and it did not survive the dissolution of Bukharin's government. As the revolutionary movement slowly but surely rebuilds itself, the need for a Socialist International presents itself once again.\nThe WSPR, the rightful successor of the fallen Soviet state, is the obvious choice to head a successor to the Comintern. Founding a Socialist International will signal the rebirth of international socialism. If such an organization already exists, we will join it, quickly taking up a leadership role, and assist the furthering of the world revolution however we can."

 ISH_on_the_right_track_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is well on track to its restoration. Almost half of the motherland has been taken back, be it from the fascists, the pretenders, or the warlords. However, now that a secure power base has been established in Central Russia, the process of warring must take a temporary reprieve. Comrade Kaganovich understands that, if the state is to expand into the rest of Russia, it will need a strong industrial sector, a well-organized military, and a political system free of internal threats.\n\nThus, all three must be accomplished. Engineers and industrialists will begin the rapid construction of a new heavy industry sector that will provide tanks, rifles, and artillery pieces that will be needed for further expansion. The military will be expanded, and allowed to retrain and reorganize following the grueling campaigns to unite Western Siberia. Finally, certain political elements will be... removed, in order to prevent the rise of internal threats or opposition to Kaganovich's guiding hand. While these goals may seem difficult to achieve, they are necessary if the Soviet Union is ever to be restored."

 ISH_inaugurate_the_third_five_year_plan_desc:0 "The newly reclaimed territories in Siberia are, to say the least, poor. Very few roads are paved or maintained, there is little access to electricity and running water, and most of the people live off subsistence farming in small villages. Thus, the time has come to introduce the party and the people to the second five year plan so far. After it is approved, a vast modernization effort will begin all across Siberia to industrialize and build up the region. Factories to produce tanks, weapons, and munitions will become the norm, giving the Red Army the ability to fight wars against far larger and better-armed foes.\n\nThe old Union fell because of the failure of Premiere Bukharin to build up a modern military industry. He failed to recognize the need for Russia to industrialize as quickly and as heavily as possible, and both he and the Russian people paid for it in blood. Comrade Kaganovich understands his enemies, his people, and the lessons he can learn from the past. He will not make the same mistake as his predecessor."

 ISH_in_stalins_way_desc:0 "The late Comrade Stalin was a great friend and mentor to our very own Comrade Kaganovich. His political and social philosophy has guided and protected both Kaganovich and the state many times. In fact, Comrade Kaganovich openly admits to asking himself what Comrade Stalin would do, when presented with a complex situation. We should honor Stalin for giving us such a bright future, and fully embrace "Stalinist" ideals as the official position of the state. Doing so would not only honor the man's memory, but likely guide us into a brighter future."

 ISH_commissariat_of_civil_defence_desc:0 "An army by itself is not enough. While it is indeed helpful to have a million men on standby in the event of war, those men are of no use if given no weapons to fight, or if they are simply a massed horde. All armies require organization and logistics-- something in very short supply in the Siberian wastes. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich, in light of this issue and the ever-growing power of the state, has decided to organize a new governmental organization: the Commissariat of Civil Defense.\n\nThis new organization will oversee all the functions regarding the preparation of war. It will organize and equip units of men, ensure factory production is adequate to meet demand, and prepare propaganda for any eventual war that may or may not erupt. The world is a changing place, and the safety of the state and its people must be considered of the utmost priority."

 ISH_factory_institutes_desc:0 "The invasion of the Hitlerites and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union were great tragedies, not only for their cost in lives, but the damage done to the future of the Russian people. Many across the shattered remains of the Motherland cannot read or write, and know only how to till soil and plant crops. Such was the way for many centuries, but it is not the way of modernity. Today is the age of machines and factories and steel, and so Russia must be dragged, kicking and screaming, into being an industrial society. Many of the newly conscripted factory workers must be trained by another person, rather than being able to read and understand simple directions.\n\nTo solve these issues pressing down on the industrial sector, Comrade Kaganovich has devised a plan: factory schooling. In most major factories and industrial plants across the country, there will be classrooms in which the largely illiterate workforce may learn to read and write. While it certainly will not provide them with a true education as they would have received elsewhere in the world, it will be more than sufficient."

 ISH_breaking_some_eggs_desc:0 "As Comrade Kaganovich says, one must break some eggs to make an omelet, just as one must occasionally break down the political opposition to get something done. The internal political situation is simply too delicate at the moment for Comrade Kaganovich's liking. There are too many threats to his power, and too many traitors against the revolution. These men not only are a danger to the people and the state, they also could be implicated in certain... failings of the state in the past.\n\nThese agitators and problematic individuals must be dealt with, swiftly and with as little resistance as possible. They will be rounded up, just as their kin in the military were short months ago, and either carted off to labor camps in Siberia or executed. While some commissariats may lose some valuable assets, what has been lost pales in comparison to what might be gained from their removal."

 ISH_long_arm_of_the_nkvd_desc:0 "The NKVD is the most useful tool in state security that Comrade Kaganovich and the revolution could hope for. While it is certainly no small organization at the moment, it must be expanded the larger the state grows. The more citizens under our purview, the more surveillance and accountability must be placed on them. In short: the NKVD must be grown. It must have eyes and ears in every corner, every alley, every meeting room, and every production line. No one will be able to keep a secret with anyone but themselves, and thus, no conspiracies could be possible.\n\nThis new NKVD will strike fear into the hearts of men-- a fear that is quite literally unspeakable. All know that they are watching, but know not from where. All know that they are listening, and so dare not speak their name. They shall hold every transgression against the revolution accountable, and leave no stone unturned, and no man unquestioned."

 ISH_a_hammer_in_every_hand_desc:0 "Every man, young, old, sick, must serve society in some way. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production. If Russia is ever to be reunited under the banner of the restored Union, she will need every able-bodied worker and soldier that she can. While the new industrialization plans kick off, the newly-constructed factories will need workers-- a resource upon which all socialism is built. These workers will be, for lack of a better word, conscripted, mostly from small agricultural villages. Every hand not holding a rifle or a child will be given a hammer to further the goals of Soviet socialism. After all, idle hands are the Hitlerites' playthings."

 ISH_metro_2_desc:0 "Mankind is facing an existential threat unlike any it has encountered in its brief existence on this planet: total nuclear annihilation. Dread it, run from it, it may very well still arrive, and if it does, mankind is likely to face total extinction. Be it from the flames of Himmler's ambition, a rapidly escalating conflict between the world's great powers, or just a simple mistake, the chance of nuclear war is too high to ignore. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich has laid out a plan for the preservation of the Russian people and of Soviet socialism such that it may survive whatever cataclysm the man brings down upon himself.\n\nThis plan, dubbed Metro-2, consists of a large network of tunnels and housing built beneath Tyumen. It would function as basically an underground city, capable of housing around 10,000 individuals. The network would be built on top of the water table, and thus have access to clean fresh water, in addition to geothermal and hydroelectric generators, food stores, and even growing rooms for small-scale agriculture. It would also have a large research section, from which the state can perform its largest and most secret science experiments. If the world is truly set on fire, Metro-2 might just be the safest place to wait for the ashes to cool."

 ISH_project_cain_desc:0 "The "Closed Availability Information Network" is a project envisioned by Comrade Kaganovich and heavily inspired by the success of the Metro-2 project. In it, many major cities across Western Siberia would be provided with large underground bunker networks, ostensibly to provide shelter to loyal citizens in the event of a nuclear war. In reality, these bunkers would be largely composed of labs, filled to the brim with enterprising scientists. They would provide an ideal place to conduct our most secret and/or dangerous experiments, far away from the prying eyes of the people or foreign spies. While some may call the trials done here "unethical", there is little ethical about not exploiting any advantage available for the benefit of socialism and the Russian people."

 ISH_no_such_thing_as_propaganda_desc:0 "What liberal dissidents would call "propaganda" or "deception", Comrade Kaganovich calls "necessary". Siberia can be compared to a stained glass window. In the old days, before the Soviet Union dissolved, the Communist Party and the state served as the pewter metalwork that held the window together. Now, the window is broken into a thousand different pieces of a thousand colors and a thousand ideologies. The only way to put the pieces of the window back together is through the media and political indoctrination of the public.\n\nTo successfully achieve mass propaganda and indoctrination, a much tighter grip will have to be placed over Siberia as a whole. The mass media will have to be greatly expanded and new, standardized school curricula will have to be enforced. In addition, the NKVD will likely have to be deployed to many towns and villages across the region, if only to scare the locals into submission."

 ISH_only_truth_desc:0 "Comrade Kaganovich is a stern man, but a liar he is not. While he certainly has twisted the truth a little in the past, or presented alternative facts to a situation, he would never lie to the people of Russia! Some things simply don't need to be known by the public at large. State secrets or deceptive foreign lies that might paint Kaganovich in a bad light simply should not be shown or discussed to the people. While, behind closed doors, many whisper that they fear Kaganovich and his NKVD, most of those unexposed to foreign lies have a good opinion of our beloved leader."

 ISH_and_only_what_they_need_to_know_desc:0 "No one can be trusted. The most harmless in society can develop into vicious political manipulators, agitators, dissidents, and other enemies of the state. Every worker, every soldier, every mother, every NKVD agent; every single individual is a pair of eyes and ears that could be used against the state. If Comrade Kaganovich's vision for a restored Soviet Union are to be accomplished, the eyes of the people must be closed and their ears be covered to all information except what they need to know.\n\nThe bureaucracy shall be greatly expanded, to the point that access to information is virtually impossible. Army officers and party officials shall only be given the minimum amount of information to achieve their tasks. The only person who knows the true extent and goings-on of the new Soviet Union shall be Comrade Kaganovich and a very few select individuals. Information shall be the enemy of the people, and the ally of the state."

 ISH_a_job_left_unfinished_desc:0 "Despite all the work that Comrade Kaganovich has put into the internal security of the state, some individuals simply cannot be convinced to abandon their wretched ideologies. The people have already been exposed to dangerous, subversive beliefs, and must be silenced. They number in the thousands and make up a significant portion of the political bureaucracy, the military, and even the secret police. Now, all these disparate enemies of the revolution shall be purged-- something that should have been done a long time ago.\n\nNKVD agents who are known to be loyal will seek out and question individuals who have shown unpatriotic or subversive activities in the past. The men will be interrogated, put on show trial, and either executed or sent to toil away in a Siberian labor camp. For too long have they gone unchecked in Soviet society, but with Comrade Kaganovich as our leader, their allotted time has expired."

 ISH_new_talented_officers_desc:0 "The Great Purge, as it is now being called, is finally over. The last known enemies of the state have been carted off to Siberia, or put into the ground. However, the purge destroyed a significant portion of the officer corps. Thousands of military units, mostly at the platoon level, lack leadership. Without officers to lead them, our once-strong military will dissolve into madness and stupidity at the first sight of combat. To alleviate this issue, a new corps of officers will be trained from existing veterans. These men are experienced and battle-hardened, but simply lack the education in modern tactics and combined-arms operations that are necessary for the making of an effective officer. It will take some time, but these men can be trained and educated into extremely effective combat leaders."

New offices and administrations will spring up like flowers under his watchful care. Their administrators and directors will be hand picked to ensure his vision is realized. Though no large scale reforms will be enacted yet, these new institutions will lay the groundwork for lasting political change.\n\nWe shall not hold society back, for if the nation and the revolution to progress we must have our society progress as one, no more shall minorities fear, for we are all one."

 ISH_uphold_progressive_values_desc:0 "As stated by Marx and reiterated by innumerable socialist thinkers around the world, neither race, nor gender, nor national boundaries divide us. Rather, it is class that divides all humans. In accordance to this fact, we will promote cooperation between all peoples in order to bring about the end of capitalism.\n\nRacism, sexism, all forms of discrimination are reactionary -- we must eliminate them if we wish to bring about a communist society!"

 ISH_establish_the_assrs_desc:0 "The new Soviet Union we are building must not be mired down by ineffective, bloated bureaucracy. In order to govern the nation effectively, we will establish the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics along ethnic lines which will practice a form of self-government within the larger Soviet Union. The leaders of these new republics will, of course, be handpicked by Chairman Khrushchev.\n\nWe shall build the state as one to make even Stalin himself proud, for he is the one who guides us."

 ISH_a_state_to_make_stalin_proud_desc:0 "Comrade Stalin was an unappreciated visionary of his time. He would have wept if he knew that history had proved him right. Chairman Krushchev has taken Stalin's theory to heart and has applied them to great success. Even in death, his words still shine as the light that will lead the Russian people towards a more perfect socialism!"

 ISH_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "The world has changed. We must change with it. Comrade Kaganovich's policies, while indisputably effective, are no longer suited for this day and age. As such, Chairman Krushchev will begin a campaign to root out Kaganovich's influence from within the government. Officials will be purged, laws rewritten and repealed, and the damage from Kaganovich's premiership will be mended.\n\nWhile some may protest these measures, they are ultimately necessary if socialism is to survive in these trying times."

 ISH_the_secret_speech_desc:0 "There is no doubt that former Chairman Kaganovich's policies and beliefs were in betrayal of Stalinism, socialism, and the Soviet Union. Even so, dissidents and sympathizers still remain in the party. They say that we are the true revisionists, and that by purging Kaganovich, we have betrayed the cause.\n\nWe will prove them wrong.\n\nDuring the next party meeting, Chairman Krushchev will speak to a closed audience and reveal to all the true extent of Kaganovich's crimes against the people. There, we will also reveal our agenda to help mend the damage caused by him and his ilk."

 ISH_lock_down_the_party_desc:0 "The Communist Party, especially in its current state, simply cannot be trusted to properly safeguard socialism and the proletariat. Recognizing this fact, Chairman Krushchev will put a moratorium on elections to the Party. By doing so, he will be able to take total control of the government. This is necessary, as he is the only man capable of defending the people against the dangers of reactionarism. With the power that comes with total control, Krushchev will be able to better execute Stalin's vision for a great Russia."

 ISH_another_five_year_plan_desc:0 "The original five year plan has reached its completion. Given its resounding success, Chairman Khrushchev has seen fit to announce a new, second five year plan. The people of Russia will work and toil in a glorious effort to continue industrialization on a greater scale than ever before and bring the country one step closer to true industrial socialism.\n\nIts time that we reintigrate our Western lands, we are all Russians."

 ISH_reintegrate_the_west_desc:0 "The German fascists might have destroyed Russia, but they could never destroy the Soviet spirit. Together, we will rebuild the nation under the red banner of the Soviet Union. Nothing will stop the people in their drive to reunite the homeland!"

 ISH_continue_agricultural_mechanization_desc:0 "For thousands of years, agriculture has sustained humanity and strengthened all nations of the world. In order to ensure we reap all possible benefits from agriculture, we shall fully mechanize it and educate the farmers on how to keep the soil fertile. In time, the literal fruits of our labor will show, in the bounty of food that our people can then harvest and enjoy."

 ISH_repudiate_literary_policy_desc:0 "The old literary policy is contradictory to the ideals of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. The purpose of books is to uplift the proletariat, rather than keep them down. As such, Chairman Krushchev will lift Kaganovich's repression on books and other such artistic expressions. The proletarians of Russia shall become the most cultured in the world!"

 ISH_an_end_to_extraneous_repression_desc:0 "The Red Army is our sword and shield, and the defender of the proletariat. It would not only be unwise, but it would be an injustice to punish them for such bravery in battle. The Army and its personnel should serve the Union out of respect and love for the Chairman, not out of fear for him. To this end, we will put an end to any and all repression within the army." 

 ISH_commence_the_khrushchevshchina_desc:0 "Russia has progressed far beyond its image of poverty and backwardness. Factories hum with the sound of machinery, as men and women work together as one to better Russia. Tractors make their rounds around the fields of wheat, to be sent to the cities to make bread for the workers. Yet Russia's culture remains firmly entrenched in feudalist reactionarism. As such, a wave of cultural reforms will be enacted by Chairman Krushchev in order to rectify this issue. The vestiges of the old world must be eliminated for a truly socialist society to take hold."

 ISH_shining_in_glory_desc:0 "Russia has risen from the ashes, as a beacon of socialism amongst a world of exploitation and tyranny. Our resurgence will not end here, for we march to liberate the workers of the world. We have defeated the fascist Germans with even less than what we have now; with the resources of today, we are a world power. And unlike the others, we will use our status to advance the global proletarian cause."

The people, well alerted of potential attacks, have never been safer, and supply lines are moving better than ever. We cannot allow ourselves to be complacent; the Communist Party does not settle for adequacy, but strives to achieve perfection! We may have figured out their schedule for now, but the Germans can always change it once they realize our ingenuity. It is for this reason that a more permanent solution to the bombings needs to be put in place.\n\nOne potential option is to use our knowledge of their movements to go on the attack, delivering the people a badly needed blow against the fascists, so that they think twice before menacing them again. This solution would involve building fighter planes to intercept the bombers mid-air, using the element of surprise to overcome the technology gap. Fascists are inherently cowardly, and the Luftwaffe is not accustomed to resistance; a decisive strike could scare them away from our airspace in favor of weaker targets.\n\nThe next solution is more cautious, but with the potential of dealing with the problem for longer. Radar towers proved quite effective in prior wars, and their ability to remotely monitor aircraft would negate the need for detailed bombing schedules in the future, since we could react to bombers as we detect them. This type of response, while not directly challenging the bombers, could severely curtail their efforts in the future.\n\nThe Germans, brutish though they are, are not stupid. Whichever operation we choose will need to be flexible and highly responsive in order to ensure it is not bypassed completely by a change in the Luftwaffe's tactics."

On the other, adapting to the new schedule for the defense of the above ground infrastructure would be better in the short term for the people and morale in general. \n\n No matter what option was chosen, it would be a huge investment. The bunkers would provide a complete defense against the bombs, and if the bombing ever ended they would be useful for defending infrastructure against the other warlords of Russia. But, at the same time, keeping the defenses flexible would allow for a quicker response to changes in the bombing. \n\n Indeed, both ideas had their promise but only one could be followed in the end, the question was, which one?"

While it has undoubtedly caused a large degree of suffering throughout our lands, most terribly what this anarchy has done is cut down on our already-small population numbers through bombing attrition, bandit raids, and acts of god.\n\nA number of different solutions have been drafted to the so-called "repopulation problem", though one, above all, stands out. Women have, for some time, worked alongside men in certain roles that are fitting to them. This was done initially out of necessity, but as things are on their way to normalization, the added productivity that women bring to the workplace in terms of an extra set of hands is worth mentioning. On the other hand, however, it is the nature of women to bear children. If they're working, they can't bear children and vice-versa.\n\nIf we were to limit once more women's opportunity for work and work advancement until they have sired a requisite number of children, it would simultaneously encourage women to have children while not outright banning them from the workplace like some reactionary stooges may encourage. Certainly, we may see a drop in productivity as some women leave to bear children if we do opt to escalate this program, but we will see a noticeable increase in our birth rates.\n\nUltimately, the decision rests with the chairman."

These creches, under the watchful eye of the party, have also integrated a number of different education programs for both the children and the women who tend to them, creating a nest of future ideologues and Soviet zealots.\n\nHowever, a question has been raised regarding the specific administration of the creches. Their rapid success has caused a number of interest groups to lobby for control over them, with many seeing the creches as a path to success and importance in the future. Ultimately, Kaganovich and his closest advisors have convened to decide a way forward and announce who will have the ultimate control over these child rearing organizations. After what has seemed to be hours of deliberation, the group has narrowed the candidacy for control over the creches down to two potential prospects: the local communes and the military.\n\nThe local communes, if they had control over the creches, would ensure that children will be raised within their own communities, and be instilled with not only a sense of community importance and familial unity, but also receive the fair and necessary civilian education that should be available to every young man. On the other hand, if the military was to control the creches, they would end up much more centralized, growing up with a greater sense of identity than to their own community. On top of this, of course, the military would be interested, just as we would be, in raising a future generation of soldiers, raised literally from birth to fight and die for the Union.\n\nAs the night grew late, Kaganovich's advisory council waited with bated breath on his final decision..."

The long-time Soviet soldier looked over what he jokingly referred to his peers as his "flock", a rag-tag group of conscripts that were drawn from all sectors of society. There was Shvets, who came from a poor migrant family - his nose had been broken too many times and his slender frame and short stature betrayed his family's poverty and his malnourishment.

Now that we border their state, they see no reason for us to remain isolated and alone. If we accept, every pilot will receive military honors, and our civilian population will be awarded for their dedication as well.\n\nThis is quite the proposal, complete integration. It would be the end of our independence, but it would permanently resolve our resource shortages, and the civilian population would not need to sacrifice as much in order to maintain our planes. However, Kaganovich has not changed since his last offer, and our previous objections are still all too relevant. Is it better to live under a tyrant, or to die with our freedom intact?

This is the work of agitators, traitors, and spies. They all come from the same place which investigations confirmed to be what everyone already knew: Tyumen.\n\nKaganovich, it seems, is not content to tyrannize his own portion of Russia and has decided to bring his red oppression down on our own citizens.

The message, undoubtedly authored with heavy influence from the Chairman, reads as follows:\n\n\"The Empire of Japan, one of the foremost imperialist powers on Earth, is one of the foulest enemies of the global proletariat. Under the guise of opposition to European imperialism, it has militarily occupied and incorporated into its \"Co-Prosperity Sphere\" a number of the countries of Asia, only to further their enslavement under its own rule. Its crimes include the invasion, occupation, and subjugation of China and the massacre of its inhabitants, the systematic extraction of the resources of Manchuria and Southeast Asia for its own ends, the widespread use of slavery in the form of the \"romusha\" and similar systems, the sponsorship of murderous fascists in the former Soviet Union, the suppression of people's movements in Japan and abroad, and too many other crimes to count. The Japanese bourgeoisie have effectively fused with the state and military apparatus to further the oppression and exploitation of the people of Asia, and in terms of the number of people under its rule alone Japan is the largest fascist regime in human history. It is the task of the world's workers to smash this horrid empire, and give the nations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere true self-determination.\"\nThe WSPR's stance, perhaps to be expected for a communist state, is extremely anti-Japanese.

The message, a caustic screed expectedly filled with Bolshevik cliches, reads as follows:\nThe Greater German Reich is among the greatest imperialist powers in human history and perhaps the bloodiest. Its fascistic, hyper-reactionary, ideology has led it to commit the greatest genocide in human history: the extermination of Jews, Poles, Russians, Balts, and other peoples of Eastern Europe in the name of colonialism and imperial expansion. Through the widespread use of slavery, predicated on race lines, it has overseen the hideous exploitation of the labor of over forty million people in Europe alone, with its conquest of the old colonial territories in Africa expanding that number by millions more. The Soviet Union, a worldwide beacon of the workers' struggle, also fell prey to Germany's depredations, with incalculable costs to its people and the continued occupation of its core territories. The poisonous ideology of racism, which divides the working class only to imiserate them all, has seen no greater success in the world than here, and it ought to be the goal of the international workers' movement to tear down this fascist monstrosity and free the peoples of Germany and Eastern Europe alike.\"\nThe WSPR may rise to be a threat in the future, but as of now it is still weak and surrounded by enemies, its threats mere saber-rattling.

They promise that aid, trade, and better relations are just around the corner, as soon as the WSPR figures out the logistics of sending supplies through the still-turbulent countryside. In the meantime, they plead only for recognition, and an assurance that the Central Asians will work alongside them for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union when the time comes.\nFor the Central Asians, this offer certainly seems tempting. Aid to reconstruct their shattered, underdeveloped economies and arms to fight their petty border wars would certainly be welcomed. A connection to the outside world for the first time in years seems too good to be true. But there are always doubts; what happens if Tyumen makes demands that infringe upon their sovereignty? The rumors that trickle out of Tyumen paint \"Iron Lazar\" as far more controlling than the rosy picture his diplomats have painted of him might imply.

Specifically, the questions relates to whether we should begin the process of redistributing the surplus value of our new citizens just as aggressively as we did to our original core, in order to safeguard the revolution (specifically as it relates to clothing, food, housing, etc) and to save them from their own material decadence, or, do we relax such regulations for the time being, in order to make transition smoother for our liberated peoples.\n\n"The decision rests at the behest of the Secretary, and his decision shall be the will of the people and the party.""

While his friends would not go as far to say that he was stupid, it was agreed by man in the small village he lived in that, by and large, he was very, very forgetful, sometimes to a comedic degree. That is why, when he began to arrive on time for weekly Party meetings, cultural events, and even the smallest get together in the town, it made many curious.\n\nOne day, Oleg Markov asked Matvey what inspired his change. "I began writing these little notes to myself to remember," he said, blushing slightly, "and they've been really helpful." When Oleg asked to see them, Matvey handed a sheet of paper. On it was a detailed list of every event going on in town for the next week, the date and time listed beside them. There were even little descriptions for it, which, to the surprise of Oleg, were surprisingly well written.\n\n"Say, Matvey," said Oleg, "why don't you begin writing this for others too? I am sure people would find it useful." And with that, Matvey, seeing the opportunity to apply himself to something, said he would do it.\n\nThe next day, half the town received slips of paper near or on their property. On these papers were hastily scribbled, but detailed, lists of each event that was going on that week. At the bottom of the sheet was written "Matvey Nosov, Reporter."\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, the newsletter grew from a simple piece of paper written the night before by one man, expanded to having multiple writers, at least 5 pages long, and printed with a jury rigged machine. Every event had at least one reporter now, either being Matvey himself or volunteers. By the end of the first month, the newsletter had received the official blessing of the local Party organ, applauding it as "proof that the workers can self organize without the need of capital tyranny.""

But why is my art being taken out?"\n\n"Because, comrade, it depicts an unproductive lifestyle of the proletariat. In your paintings, I see they are lazing about: watching movies, walking their dogs, shopping, playing sports, etc. While it is fine and good to paint this sometimes, it is a danger to the workers of this nation to believe that should expect all play and no work, all while we have enemies at our door."\n\nIgnatyev's jaw was dropping as the official continued to speak, his mind seemingly incapable of understanding the magnitude of what in the world was happening. When it was silent, he asked "So, what am I supposed to draw?"\n\n"It is not our job to tell you what to draw, comrade, only merely what is allowed to be drawn, for the safety of the workers.

By the end of the day, they would be delivered all over Siberia and beyond, to comrades and to the workers all over Russia.\n\n"This is the printing room.

In order to combat the increasing slander and accusations of the state's enemies, communicated rhetoric would be shifted from that of ideological positions to the support of the state itself. Towards nationalistic purposes.\n\nTo this Trofim had felt alarm. He knew that the People's Republic must, had, to endure, and that required compromise that might not otherwise have been entertained. But there was a limit, and the preliminary descriptions of new campaigns that had begun to cross his desk had worried him.\n\nA much greater proportion of the content was focused solely on nationalism, as opposed to socialism, with the potential for the message of the former to increasingly subsume that of the latter. And that was something he did not want to see, so close was it to the principles of the now thankfully vanquished Black League.\n\nWorse, Trofim knew absolutely that he could not speak a word of his thoughts to anyone. The Chairman had made a decision, and that was that. To act or speak otherwise would be tantamount to questioning the state. Which was something that, if the new campaigns were anything to go by, would be regarded even more harshly than before.\n\nNo, he would perform his function, as he always had, and hope that, in time, correct policies and socialist sentiment would prevail."

The problem seemed so daunting, so large, and yet, at its core, when reduced to its simplest components, it was actually quite simple. The Free Aviators, a nominally socialist but practical apolitical body that did it's best, over the course of twenty years, to protect the people of Russia from the German bombers who plagued their broken, battered country, had been swallowed by the military peacefully enough. They had accepted their rule as a better alternative to the anarchy that harmed Russia. But the problem wasn't their competence, which no self respecting man or woman could deny. Rather, it was a question of politics.\n\nRoman received word from up high that [ISH.GetLeader] and his lackeys didn't like a lot of the aviators. Not enough to purge them, no, they were too popular for that, but just to prevent them from gaining any real power or influence in the nascent Air Force. And so created the conundrum: should he promote the names on the left list, a less competent, but more politically safe option of figures, or the right list, the Aviators, consequences be damned.

And also that, regardless of whatever damage was inflicted upon it, Chairman Kaganovich would demand that production levels remain constant. With woe to those who could not deliver.\n\nPerforming his actions with well-practiced proficiency, the foreman stopped the line and directed the workers into the underground shelter that had been recently constructed. One benefit, he supposed, of the drive to move so many things underground. If only the whole factory could follow.\n\nAs the bombs grew closer the foreman fought to keep himself calm in front of his workers. Despite the number of bombings he had been through, he had never managed to entirely suppress the panic felt when the bombs fell immediately close, and as the noises grew, he knew that moment was fast approaching. And then it didn't, and the noises started to come from strange direction.\n\nOne man volunteered to look outside, and when he returned his eyes, and grin, were wild. The Aviators had arrived, ambushing the bombers and forcing them to scatter. In an instant, the foreman's panic was replaced with savage glee, the same emotion appearing on the faces of the other workers as well. Today, the Germans were learning that Russians could, and would, fight back. He didn't know how many would die, shot to pieces or incinerated in their burning aircraft, but he, and they, hoped it was a lot.\n\nThe fact that production would not suffer was an added bonus."

Back when they were the representatives of the workers and peasants of Russia, laboring under the oppressive gaze of the Tsar. Then, just as now, victory was not certain. But the struggle wasn't tainted with false victories, missed opportunities, and betrayal. They were the spear racing towards the heart of reaction, their minds ever turned towards the glorious future that awaited them.\n\nKaganovich raised the glass to his lips and drank the vodka within, toasting to the many comrades he would never see again. How youthful the revolution appeared in those days! How vibrant the red banners and stars! How tragic the decline that followed. With Stalin's death, Russia was upon the path to destruction. There was nothing he could do though, his removal to that godforsaken post in Siberia ended any chance of engineering Bukharin's fall from power. He was stuck there, forced to watch as Barbarossa proved his every prediction true, the Germans smashing through an unprepared military and grinding the Russian people into the dirt.\n\nHe slammed the cup back into the table a harder than he meant to, his own aggression surprising him. Even then, that wasn't the end. Karbyshev and Rokossovsky, those traitorous bastards, just had to twist the knife.\n\nYet, It was never over. Russia lay shattered, its people divided amongst various ideologies and systems all aiming for the same goal. It was an opportunity. The people would come to see the future which Bukharin had robbed them, and it would be from Kaganovich's hand that they found the prosperity and freedom they deserved.\n\nBut it would be by that same hand reaction would be crushed. There would be no place for fascists and their servants in the fifth column here. Kaganovich was resolute, nothing would be permitted to endanger socialism and the proletarian state.

If there was ever a moment where Khrushchev wanted to have a drink in his hand, it was at that very moment.\n\nHe had just come back from a meeting with Kaganovich. It was about the proper way to deal with the political prisoners - the 'undesirables' and 'reactionary peasantry' Kaganovich loathed so much. His orders were explicit: only under the watchful eye of the revolutionary could they be led down the right path, and that terror could cure them of their false consciousness.\n\nKhrushchev, as he had many times before, attempted to guide Kaganovich to a more humane, less wasteful policy. Perhaps, Khrushchev said, they could be offered the choice between conscription and hard labor, which would solve the problem of a lack of available manpower.\n\nKaganovich, of course, dismissed it as unorthodox and not in line with Marxist-Leninist thought. Dismissed, Khrushchev returned to his office, depressed. Needing a moment's rest, he closed his eyes, and allowed himself a slight reprieve from the daily horror he was a participant in.\n\nPerhaps one day, he allowed himself to imagine, things would be more humane. Perhaps Marxist-Leninism could be used to enhance human life, rather than cutting it short in cruel industrial planning. Perhaps, he thought with a tiny bit of childish glee, it could be used to destroy the enemy of all things moral, the Germans.

No number of platitudes could have protected the village from the Luftwaffe when it finally came for them. Exactly as he had predicted, laughed aside as paranoid by the others, they had come in the middle of the day. First, a bomb had flattened the Bobrov house, killing the entire family as they ate lunch. Another levelled his barn, and several more obliterated buildings or blasted great craters into empty sections of field. He had spent sixty years helping build this community, only for it all to disappear in a single night.\n\nOf all the survivors, most couldn't believe what had happened.

Perhaps they had found Tyumen too daunting and taken out their anger on softer targets. He wasn't angry at them; cursing the Germans' cruelty was like cursing a fox for stealing chickens.

Khrushchev was once like a son to him, so why did he seem so determined to redirect the revolution Kaganovich had tried so hard to save? The foolish ideals he spouted at every meeting, such as democratic centralism and allowing for non-proletarian cultural expression, bordered dangerously on Bukharinism: the cancerous ideological strain that brought the Soviet Union to ruin in the first place. Surely, Comrade Khrushchev was aware of this?\n\nThe chairman groaned as he shifted onto his back again, and started to nervously scratch his chin as darker thoughts began to invade his mind. Perhaps, Khrushchev was indeed aware of the damage he was causing. Perhaps, just maybe, this was his plan along? \n\nNo, it couldn't be! Khrushchev was with him since the birth of the Republic, and stood by his side even as traitors began to circle. Why was it, then, that Chairman Kaganovich couldn't help but think that Khrushchev's faith in the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist revolution was beginning to waver?\n\nPerhaps it was time he kept a closer eye on Khrushchev, just to be safe..."

 ISH.125.t:0 "A Conversation Among Friends"
 ISH.125.d:0 "...and that's when he said, 'Third from left: Comrade Khrushchev'!" Nikita Khrushchev erupted into wheezing laughter, slamming his hand on the table as he lost composure. His companion, Chairman Lazar Kaganovich, did not seem to share Khrushchev's enthusiasm, and was instead staring intensely at his friend across the table. "Lazar Moiseyevich, is there something wrong?"\n\n"I'm perfectly fine, comrade, I am just rather tired this morning. Rough night." Kaganovich moved his breakfast around with a fork as he spoke. He had not eaten a single bite. "Would you mind if I asked a question, Comrade Khrushchev?" Khrushchev, his mouth full of food, gave a quick nod.\n\nKaganovich set his fork down, and focused his gaze entirely on Khrushchev. "You do understand what we're trying to accomplish here, right? What must be done to preserve the revolution?"\n\nKhrushchev cocked an eyebrow. "What kind of question is that? Of course I do. You wouldn't have trusted me with this position if I didn't."\n\n"Perhaps. You also know that one of our main tasks towards achieving this goal is to root out the traitor Bukharin's influence once and for all, yes?"\n\nA brief silence from Khrushchev. His gradual change of posture betrayed his increasing nervousness. "I don't understand, what's with all these strange questions all of the sudden? Do... do you doubt my loyalty to the cause, comrade?"\n\nA smile that was perhaps too warm to be genuine spread across the chairman's face. "Ah, forget it, Comrade Khrushchev. My mind has been wandering into all sorts of strange places today. Let us change subjects, yes?"
 ISH.125.a:0 "Yes, please."

 ISH.126.t:0 "Eyes Peeled"
 ISH.126.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich cursed under his breath as he listened to the dial tone drone on. All he had to do was send the right people to keep watch over Khrushchev and his allies, and Lazar could finally have the closure he seeked. "Ministry of the Interior, Marshal Konev speaking."\n\n"Comrade Marshal! It's Kaganovich. I'll be brief because I don't have all day to stand around and chat. I'll need SMERSH to keep a close eye on some... suspicious people for me."\n\n"Ah, it's good to hear from you, Comrade Chairman. Uh, isn't this sort of thing what the NKVD is for? Perhaps you should give them a call instead.\n\nKaganovich gritted his teeth. "No, no! This is a sensitive matter, comrade, and I believe you may be the only one I can trust. Khrushchev and his friends need to be monitored, and I don't want to take any chances if he has friends in the NKVD, understand?"\n\n"Comrade Khrushchev...? I see. I don't believe you have anything to fear-"\n\nThe chairman slammed his fist against the wall. "I don't believe I ever asked for your opinion! Can you do it or not?!"\n\nThere was a pause, and the muffled shuffling of papers. "Yes, sir. I'll put my best men on it. I would strongly advise, however-"\n\n"Good! See it done, Marshal! I expect results!" Kaganovich hung up the phone, giving the marshal a clear answer to his plea for caution."

 ISH.127.t:0 "The Streets Have Eyes"
 ISH.127.d:0 "Another long day of work, accompanied by a long walk home, to be followed by a long night attempting to figure out exactly how to convince Kaganovich to adopt some of his policies. Khrushchev's thoughts were mainly on the length of his struggles as he left the building, beginning the journey back to his flat. Occupied as he was, he almost didn't notice the men following behind him.\n\nAlmost.\n\nHis mind started racing as he took an intentional wrong turn. There were two of them; they seemed young, but it was hard to discern features underneath their clothing and glasses. Could they be assassins? No, they were hanging too far back. Reactionaries or foreign agents would certainly kill him to destabilize the regime, so who could they be working for? Khrushchev worked through the various possible groups that would want to spy on him, each less likely than the last, finally forced to confront the only credible option left.\n\nIt was Kaganovich.\n\nThese men must be working for the state. There was no other reason for them to be content with monitoring his comings and goings. They were probably sent to ensure he wasn't meeting with possible conspirators against the General Secretary and the People's Republic. He immediately began taking the shortest path home, attempting to appear unaware of their surveillance. This was bad. Very bad. He would have time to consider this further when he was inside, but even now, one thought consumed him:"
 ISH.127.a:0 "This is only the beginning."

 ISH.128.t:0 "The Walls Have Ears"
 ISH.128.d:0 "Fyodor Kulakov was retiring for the night when he noticed that the lamp on his bedside table was not working properly. The bulb within it had, apparently, worn out.\n\nRetrieving a replacement from his cabinet, he was in truth only partially paying attention to the simple task of replacing the old bulb with the new. His mind was far more occupied with the day's events. As a key member of Khrushchev's faction within the state, there were always endless discussions about how to best approach whatever Kaganovich's latest initiative was. Discussions that were usually accompanied by prodigious cursing.\n\nIt was just as the old bulb left the socket when Fyodor saw it, and his attention was abruptly returned to the present. Running along the inside of the lampshade was a thin wire, exposed only because the cheap stitching had broken as he moved the item, and at the end of that wire was a small microphone.\n\nHe knew immediately that it had to have been placed by supporters of Kaganovich. Who else could it be? Who else did he oppose? Who else had the men, the resources, and the desire to surveil himself, than those supporters? He simply counted his blessings that he had found it, even as he wracked his brain to think about what had been said in the room over the last short while.\n\nCarefully - in the extreme - Fyodor moved his hand away from the microphone, and finished screwing the new bulb in before replacing the lamp on the table. It would not do for whomever was on the other side to know that their bug had been found. If they knew it had been, they would install more, and who was to know if he would be lucky enough to find them?\n\nNo, he would leave it be. He would be very careful only to say things that he wanted to be overheard. And he would, carefully and in a public place, make sure the others in the faction knew what he did.\n\nThat they were being watched. Closely."
 ISH.128.a:0 "Do they know that I know?"

 ISH.129.t:0 "A False Alarm?"
 ISH.129.d:0 "So, you haven't found anything, then?"\n\n"I'm afraid so, Comrade Chairman. SMERSH has been keeping a sharp eye on Khrushchev and his friends for some time now, we know everything he does- his routines, who he talks to and what he prefers for breakfast. As far as we can tell, he's not up to anything sinister."\n\nLazar Kaganovich couldn't find words in the moment. After so many paranoid nights spent thinking about what exactly Khrushchev was up to behind closed doors, Marshal Konev had just called to inform him that it was naught but wasted energy. He felt a curious mix of relief and embarrassment wash over him. "I see. I appreciate your help, Comrade Marshal. I will inform you if I have need of you again."\n\n"Indeed, but please, next time take a moment to consider your options more carefully. The Red Army's resources aren't boundless, after all. Good night."\n\nSetting the phone back on his desk, Kaganovich leaned back and let out a long sigh. Could it really be that his paranoia was misplaced, and that Khrushchev really was as loyal as he claimed? The chairman did not usually like being wrong, but for this, he could certainly make an exception."
 ISH.129.a:0 "All is well!"

 ISH.130.t:0 "All Is Not Well"
 ISH.130.d:0 "Why have you dragged us all the way out here, Nikita Sergeyevich? I'm freezing to death over here." Andrei Gromyko shivered as he spoke, desperately rubbing his hands together for warmth. Khrushchev couldn't blame his companion for complaining. He knew, however, that the Chairman would have eyes on every corner of every city. An abandoned cabin in the frigid Siberian wilderness was not exactly the most conventional place to discuss dissent, but it would have to do.\n\n"Comrades, I know this place is not the most welcoming venue for a meeting, but understand that what I wish to discuss here is not something that should be spoken in a public place. Over the past few months, I have come to the realization that I am being spied on, and I have no doubt that Chairman Kaganovich is behind this."\n\nFyodor Kulakov shot up from his seat. "You weren't the only one! I discovered a wiretap in my bedside lamp not too long ago, and Comrade Polyansky told me someone broke into his apartment without stealing anything. What the hell is going on?!"\n\nKhrushchev sighed, and crossed his arms. "I believe Lazar has had enough of us disagreeing with his vision, and is preparing for a purge."\n\n"No, Comrade Kaganovich surely wouldn't consider such drastic action? Perhaps this is all just a big misunderstanding?" Gromyko's words came with a stutter, and this time it wasn't because of the cold.\n\n"Why else would he be sending people to follow us and break into our homes? He's gathering evidence, Andrei! Comrades, I know you all have a great deal of respect for the man, but I'm not going to sit around and wait for him to have us killed on false charges. Will you?" Khrushchev could only hear the wind outside as he awaited a response."
 ISH.130.a:0 "A resounding "no" was their answer."

 ISH.131.t:0 "A Brotherly Loyalty"
 ISH.131.d:0 "Damn you, Mikhail, how can you not see this? Comrade Lazar has lost his grip on reality, and it won't be long before you're in his crosshairs as well!" Nikita Khrushchev thumped the desk with his fist to accentuate his point. He and Fyodor Kulakov had figured, perhaps too optimistically, that the neglected brother of the chairman would see the world from their point of view.\n\nMikhail Kaganovich shook his head. "Then you're as insane as he is if you think my brother would ever dare to harm me. Do not misunderstand me, Nikita, it is not that I do not believe you. The situation in the politburo worries me greatly and it would not surprise me to see Lazar turning to such... paranoid measures."\n\n"Comrade, your brother has snubbed you at every possible turn. It is because of him that you find yourself unable to make your ideals a reality. Like it or not, working with us may be your only opportunity to get out from under him." Kulakov hoped that his words would strike home in a way that Khrushchev's bluster did not.\n\n"I apologize, comrades, but I cannot turn against my own family. Lazar may be a thickheaded old mule who refuses to see reason, but I could never forgive myself if I condemned him when I know he would never do the same to me." Mikhail rose from his seat with a huff. "I won't speak of our conversation, but it would be for the best if you left me now. Good day to you."\n\nKhrushchev and Kulakov promptly stormed out of the office without another word, and hoped that Mikhail would stay true to his word..."

But Kaganovich clearly had no intention, at all, of following said plan.\n\nAt every opportunity, he interrupted the state's prosecutor. He ignored his own state-appointed representative. He railed against the judges and functionaries, and made sure that those present were well-aware that he would not, could not, go quietly. His vitriolic condemnations of the trial as a whole, however, paled in comparison to those against the architect of his downfall.\n\nNikita Khrushchev and his policies, he shouted loudly, would bring about the collapse of the state. Would lead to the utter loss of coherent socialist direction. Would centralize power only in the service of himself at the expense of the people, as he had long claimed and as had been proven by his arrest and presence here today.\n\nSuch continued for countless hours, but in the end, however and as all knew, the theatrics mattered little. A trial had to be held, and so it was. The verdict had to have already been decided, and so it was. Lifetime imprisonment at a hard labor camp.\n\nThose watching closely would recall, years later, the look on Kaganovich's face as the judge spoke. He had clearly expected death. Political martyrdom. He would certainly have demanded such a fate inflicted on Khrushchev, had their positions been reversed. Instead, he was to be subjected to years of exhaustion as he was increasingly forgotten. Much worse, as far as he was concerned.\n\nHis shouts continued as he was forcibly led out."

The days of political repression of innocents are over. The day of extreme political despotism, and the rule of one man are over. Socialism shall no longer be what the dictates of one man states, but on a newfound consensus of our party's membership, just as Lenin thought it be.\n\nThis is not to denigrate the actions of our prior Chairman. He had many policies of which I find, and the majority will find themselves, agreeing with. Rather, our chairman was not removed for practical differences, but for his own mental instability, and lack of respect for his position. He was right to look up to comrade Stalin, but his fondness blinded him to the reality of his actions - believing himself justified in doing whatever he so desired.\n\nWe, as comrades and friends of socialism, shall never allow the actions of one man undermine our responsibilities towards our people and our movement."

"Scientifically, it's the only way to bring the region back from the brink."\n\nMikhail, in his typical fashion, attempted to gently push against his brother's opinions. "This is true, chairman. The Siberian plan had many faults, the biggest being a lack of more central planning. But some aspects, I feel, must be incorporated to make this situation more efficient."\n\nFor a moment, Mikhail expected his brother to respond angrily, to begin insulting Bukharin and to berate him for his unwillingness to challenge the economic catastrophe. Instead, he nodded his head. "Some decentralized localized projects would be useful - it depends on the situation, I feel."\n\nHis brother was a little shocked.

This was, of course, completely necessary - one could not know which new applicants could be considered politically reliable - given that political reliability, after such a violent transition of power, was absolutely essential.\n\nIt also meant, in a quality that went unspoken, that Khrushchev would control the future of the Party cadres as a whole. Would have time and space to determine the qualities he wanted reinforced. The outlooks he wanted supported. The loyalties he demanded as a matter of natural order. None of those listening could honestly say they would have behaved otherwise.\n\nIn time, such restrictions would of course be lessened, before being abandoned altogether.

As televisions and radio broadcasts crackled to life, as crowds cheered and celebrations began across the union, Nikita Krushchev briefly took a single deep breath in.\n\nHe'd done it. Somehow, he had been the one to do it. In all honesty, he was probably the most surprised person in Russia at how successful he had been. Within a short span of time, he had ascended through the ranks to General Secretary- then ruler of all of a reborn Russia; a redefined union. And for the first time in a long time, he felt tired. After all that strife, all that plotting, all of the wars and hardships that he had endured, today was finally a day where he had a clear schedule- and nothing to excuse him from a nap.\n\nHe could answer the phone calls and the letters of congratulations later- for once, he felt like his age. Thoughts of successors, and of the future briefly flooded his mind as he made his way up the stairs and paused. Later. Tomorrow at the latest, he'd start thinking about that.

A stronger Soviet Union, one that will not buckle under the threat of fascist and reactionary forces. One that will endure, through iron will and determination!

Soon, the removal of certain counter-revolutionary forces will be set in place, for a stronger and more secure union.

When they did he, acting with efficiency, informed them that he had completed the stipulations and guidelines for the second Five-Year-Plan, indicating the thick portfolio sitting in front of them.\n\nThe two men, both as senior Party members and direct advisors to the Chairman exchanged a quick look, communicating their confusion to each other with the practiced speed of those who existed within the halls of power of such an authoritarian state.

But they could not simply say such.\n\nIt was Mikhail, as the Chairman's brother and thus somewhat privileged, who finally spoke the question.

How could the targets of the second plan be therefore properly established?\n\nIrrelevant, was the answer.

One of these new creations, bombastically unveiled by the local Party branch, was now surrounded by a small crowd of curious onlookers.\n\n"Do you see that, Dad?"

Others thought it was an affront to taste, and let their disapproval show as much as was politically safe. One woman expressed with confusion that, while she had fond memories about socialism, she wasn't sure why they hadn't just put up a Lenin. The coming of several impatient-looking police officers scattered the crowd wordlessly to the wind, and the objects of their interest stood alone. One was a towering statue of Joseph Stalin, staring mustached with avuncular eyes down at the people.

But the work order given was properly stamped, properly authorized, and laid out the duties required very clearly. So they had gotten to work.

He had overheard from the foreman that this was happening at other bunkers all over the city.\n\nThe workman wondered aloud to his closest coworker why such a massive undertaking, with the truly immense amount of work it did and would require, was even necessary. After all, it had been many years since the state had needed such extensive underground complexes, and the threatening borders which had once been just over the horizon were now thousands of kilometres away.\n\nThat drew a harsh look from the other worker, and an even harsher one from the State Security man.

He thought it was perfectly natural to be annoyed by a balding despot who had to tell everybody about how great he was. His daily walk to the construction site where he worked was harried by an exponentially increasing number of Lazar Kaganovich. There was a new one today, plastered over what had been a nice mural. It featured the Chairman fiercely gripping a captain's wheel, with words above reading "Russia without the Communist Party is like a ship without a navigator!" Fedir had a few choice words about where the Party was steering Russia, but he suppressed them, giving a withering look to the poster's unfeeling eyes instead.\n\nWhat felt like hundreds of pairs of the Chairman's eyes bored into his soul as he went, but he finally made it to the site.

 ISH.149.d:0 ""Save us some time, will you? You're not achieving anything by not confessing, you know."\n\nThe NKVD officer spoke in a soft voice that nevertheless seemed to reverberate off the walls of the cramped interrogation room. A single bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling provided the only light, and the fumes of the officer's cigarette filled up the entire space. The target of his remark, still clad in his Red Army uniform, sat blindfolded on a chair in the middle of the room, sputtering as he coughed from the smoke. "But I haven't fucking done anything! When Chairman Kaganovich hears about this, he'll have your head, I'll make sure of it!"\n\nThe interrogator burst into laughter at the suggestion and had to lean against the wall for support. "Who do you think gave the order?" he said, wiping a tear away. Then, as quickly as it came, the humor left him. "People tend to remember their encounters with me, Comrade General, and not in a good way. If you don't want me to carve a souvenir into your flesh you'll tell me how you betrayed the Soviet people this instant!"\n\nWitnessing the spectacle were a pair of officers standing guard at the door. Though they made an effort to be dispassionate onlookers, both were clearly disturbed. "Yakov," whispered one to the other, "isn't this a little excessive? The man is a general!"\n\n"The Chairman must have reasons we can only guess at." The tone of Yakov's voice betrayed his lack of confidence. "It's safer not to question these things." The interrogation continued for hours, and even amidst his screams the general never admitted a single misdeed. With each denial the guards became less sure of the justice of their task, but trepidation kept them from stepping even a centimeter out of line."

Some would raise their eyebrows at such a rapid progression, but what did they know? The young officer had been exemplary in his conduct, showing himself to be a capable soldier over the last few years. Surely they were jealous, they had to be!\n\nYet in spite of his own reassurances, thoughts were creeping at the back of his mind, whispers from the common foot soldiers having reached Geliy"s ears: some other high-ranked officers - even generals that the colonel had served under - had vanished, as if they never existed. Some suggested that they were taken in the dead of night by dark shadowy figures in leather uniforms, never to be seen again.\n\nPerhaps had he not been promoted based on merit, but on how docile he was seen to be by a higher authority? Come to think of it, other young officers such as him had been recently promoted...\n\n\nIt was but a thought, yet it was enough for him to turn blemish, his smile gone. He quietly came to a conclusion: that some questions were best left unanswered."

"All of you are acquainted with the word, yet cannot read nor write it. This changes today, thanks to a reading method using syllables.

All of you are too chickenshit to express your opinion on Kaganovich"s batshit crazy policies!""\n\nHe looked at his Politburo colleagues, yet no gaze met his. The elder statesman left the room, grumbling.\n\nStatesman Glukhov had been one of the most outspoken members of the Politburo, unafraid to express his discontent with the General-Secretary"s policies, and known for his distaste with the Politburo"s passiveness in opposing them. As he stepped on the streets of Tyumen, his anger dwindled yet remained. "Why are they letting this totalitarian madman do as he pleases?" he thought to himself, "Comrade Lenin would turn in his grave if he saw Kaganovich"s madness."\n\nHis teeth gritted as he looked at the sun setting over the city, nightfall drawing ever so closer. The Soviet politician sighed as there was no point getting worked up over acts of cowardice now. Soon he"d be home, eating a plate of borscht made by his loving wife, Sofia. His face slightly lit up at the prospect "At least today will not end on a bad note --"\n\n"He"s here, get him!"\n\nBefore Glukhov could even react, several men in dark brown uniforms encircled the old man, blinding his vision by forcing a bag on his head, his arms restrained together by several burly hands.\n\n"Who the fuck are you?! I"m a member of the Politburo, unhand me!" Glukhov barked.\n\n"Comrade Glukhov, you"re accused of treason and conspiracy against General-Secretary Kaganovich." one of the shady figures replied. Only then did the old Soviet politician realise what his colleagues feared.\n\nThat night, Sofia would dutifully wait for him, a plate of borsch placed on the dinner table for him to eat.

Each week, it seemed, there was another regulation. Another stipulation that had to be followed. Another particular characteristic that their solutions absolutely had to possess.\n\nBoth quickly agreed that the changes they both saw were the result of Kaganovich's policies. The man was growing increasingly totalitarian, even by the standards of the authoritarianism that the state had always possessed. Neither was brave enough to suggest any possibility of 'correction,' but they agreed on the recognition.\n\nThe conversation was interrupted when two others, dressed in nondescript yet sturdy clothing, approached those speaking, and began to ask questions as to the content of their dialog. They were most curious, in particular, as to the direction of their conversation as it concerned Kaganovich, the name having been overheard.\n\nHaving lived in Russia their entire lives, the men knew immediately that the new arrivals were officers of State Security. They knew to subsequently keep quiet. They knew to profess loyalty to the regime in general and to Chairman Kaganovich in particular. They knew that, eventually, they would be allowed to leave. But they also knew that they were being watched. And that their names had been recorded.\n\nThere would be no further conversations."

West Russia might be clear of the reactionaries, but the east was still a festering pit of traitors to Stalin's vision. They seek to crush the spirit of the Russian people once more, and delay the inevitable revolution of the proletariat for another few years.\n\nHis comrades to the east lie suffering, but not for much longer. The Red Army is prepared to liberate the country once and for all. No more shall the laborer suffer under the boot of the capitalist, the reactionary, the fifth columnist swine. No, Kaganovich held the key to Russia's future, one free from the pains of its past.\n\nTomorrow might be bright, but only through the darkness of today. Blood would be spilt, more than Russia has seen since the West Russian War. It was tragic, it was a waste, and it was necessary. Kaganovich could not surrender the Russian people to the hands of counterrevolutionaries, and they would fight against true socialism to their dying breath. It saddened him to know that even further blood must be shed, but the Man of Steel did not shy from hardship.\n\nWhatever the price, the future would be secured. Nothing must stand in the way of socialism and the revolution. Kaganovich's soldiers prepared themselves for death as he prepared his orders, allowing himself a single tear for those who must perish in the name of liberty."

Did you check on them?" asked Kalashnikov.\nMikhail took a seat: "My resources are very limited. My brother doesn't trust me with political prisoners, but I have friends in the dungeons. Victor is safe and well-fed."\nKalashnikov breathed a sigh of relief. "And Dragunov?"\nMikhail's eyes fell to the floor, "He was shot yesterday."\n"The bastards!" Kalashnikov let out a painful cry. He had known Dragunov for so many years... they made marvelous inventions together... and now, his friend's corpse was probably lying in some ditch.\n"Calm yourself, friend." said Mikhail, reaching into his bag "He wasn't given the same offer as you." The chairman"s brother produced a loaf of fresh bread - a rarity in this dank place.\nKalashnikov took it, feeling the food's warmth. "I don"t know how I"ll be able to keep this up.

Mikhail stomped his foot, "It's Sunday, factory quotas should be at a minimum!"\nKaganovich sighed, "Tyumen Ironworks fell short yesterday. They"re on double time now." He turned to his brother: "Don't you have Kalashnikov"s cremation to attend?"\n\n"Yes." Mikhail spit the word out, "Goodbye brother." He left via the courtyard, passing underneath the plaque. He stopped to observe it - the artwork was beautiful: pictures of Marx, Lenin, Stalin... Lazar. "We are a noble cause." He tried to reassure himself. "This...it will all be worth it."

After the conquest of Sverdlovsk, a group of generals, officers, and Red Guards burst into the Chairman"s office unannounced, dragging the greatest prize: Marshal Rokossovsky.

The cell was divided into two parts: Yazov sat on the dirty floor in one half, chained to the bricks. A glass wall divided the room, allowing the guard to inspect Yazov without conversing. The man pulled up a chair, sat down, and stared at Yazov, blankly and silently.\n\nMinutes passed, and yet nothing happened. Dmitry's eyes were fixed on the door - any minute, the vile Lazar Kaganovich would step through, gloating about his victory no doubt. Dmitry hastily assembled a speech in the back of his mind. He would remain defiant, cold. The Black League may have lost the war, but wouldn't let Kaganovich defeat his pride.\n\nAn hour passed, and yet no one came. Dmitry's attention drifted off to the recesses of his mind, accusing his officers of losing the Trial before it even began. Suddenly, the glass wall separated and the guard stepped forward, armed with a pistol and... a telephone? Dmitry looked at him with all the hate he could muster.\n\n"Yes comrade."" the guard said into the phone.

While our young reborn country lacks sufficient engineers and professors, we can rely on American texts to teach the next generation. Naturally, all books will be edited in accordance of Marxist-Leninist theory, but we will also need to set up our own printing facilities."

 ISH_khrushchev.8.d:0 "(excerpt from Order 568):\n\n...If you are receiving this letter, you are still operating a GULAG facility populated by unchecked prisoners. Chairman Khrushchev himself has given the order (Order 239, on XX/XX/XXXX) to re-inspect all political prisoners and free the ones not meeting the new criteria. If your GULAG does not follow through in the next month, expect a visit from NKVD units, and a permanent loss of your current rank. Attached is a sheet with detailed instructions concerning inspection and proper release."

 ISH_khrushchev.9.d:0 "The New Soviet Union is a stark contrast to the one under Bukharin. While anti-revolutionary elements continue to complain about the 'lack of liberties' and 'socialism', we look to the bright future. The dictator Kaganovich is long gone, our version of Stalinism is untainted by the perversions of the old guard. Equality is improving considerably, as is the effectiveness of the 5-Year Plans. Gulag facilities have closed down or greatly limited their inhabitants, a spirit of free will and hope now flies throughout Siberia. We have rekindled a flame that has not burned for decades."
