 AZH_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "자유 인도는 불행한 상황에서 건국된 국가입니다. 원래 일본의 도움으로 인도를 해방시킬 목적으로 설립된 자유 인도 정부는 종주국이었던 영국이 몰락하며 아대륙에 대한 지배력을 잃자 상황은 빠르게 악화되었습니다. 독립을 쟁취한 서쪽의 인도 국민들은 하나의 정부를 원하지 않았으며 독자적으로 그들만의 정부 만드는 것을 택했습니다. 그 결과로 두 인도인들은 서로 싸우기 시작하였고, 인도에 대한 투쟁은 희망찬 혁명에서 내전으로 치달았습니다. 결국 휴전이 체결되었고, 두 인도는 서로 물러나 독자적으로 국가를 세웠습니다. 그러나 보스는 통일 인도의 꿈을 잊지 않았고, 다시금 어둠이 닥치면 기회를 노릴 것입니다."

 POLITICS_BOSE_DESC:0 "It seemed that societal fate would have had Subhas Chandra Bose, born into the family of a loyal servant of the Raj, work as one of those innumerable 'natives' without whom the British could not control the subcontinent. Instead, on the cusp of a successful entry into the prestigious Indian Civil Service, he threw it all away for the sake of serving a greater goal - his motherland, the much beleaguered Indian nation.\n\nAs one of several young, dynamic, and left-leaning voices within Congress that urged faster and more radical action, and despite being elected both to govern Calcutta and to Congress' highest offices, Bose soon found himself at odds with the party's slow and legalistic leadership. When the War broke out, concerned about his potential to disrupt the Raj, the British imprisoned him at home - only for him to escape in a scene straight out of a movie, hiding and disguising himself until he reached Afghanistan, where, with German aid, he reached the Soviet Union. Finding the European powers unwilling to help, he finally turned to Japan for aid, organizing an army of Indian prisoners-of-war and proclaiming that he would march to Delhi. Almost concurrently, the Raj itself collapsed.\n\nInvited to form a united government, Bose happily accepted - only to be blamed for the failings of the war against Afghanistan and nearly imprisoned again. But Bengal and the East were now loyal to the Forward Bloc, not Congress, and he escaped once more. Now he waits, determined to march to Delhi once more whether in peace, or by war. The hour that will decide the fate of all India is soon at hand - and he will be the one to guide it there."
 POLITICS_MOHAN_SINGH_DESC:0 "Mohan Singh was born in humble circumstances. A Sikh whose father died before he was even born, he struggled but succeeded in earning a place in the army and worked his way through the ranks of the military of an empire he despised. One of the very first to abandon the Raj and join the Japanese, he believed that Tokyo was the glowing light of anti-imperialism in Asia. He was second only to the Netaji himself in his absolute dedication to Indian liberation, and first in loyalty to the Empire of the Rising Sun. Even as his benefactors were forced to sign a ceasefire and leave India divided, his faith in Japan remained strong.\n\nSingh is a traditionalist, and to him the status quo is the only path forwards. He will hold the course set by Bose, even if Bose himself desires a new way. However, Singh has grown tired of this isolation in Bengal. Each day, his dream of a free and united India seems further away. The Bengali nationalists within his own country threaten to undo the pan-Indian dream that the Azad Hind government was built upon, and he will not tolerate it. He will no longer sit idle, letting the country rot like his once-beloved Netaji did. Singh, uniting party and army, will put down those who threaten his nation, his dream. When he is done, India will be united and powerful, and any who challenge it will face the consequences."
 POLITICS_LAKSHMI_SAHGAL_DESC:0 "Lakshmi Sahgal first became famous across India during the Second War of Independence. Joining the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, Sahgal quickly rose through the ranks, becoming their commander. As the war continued, Sahgal commanded her unit with pride. After the war ended, many assumed that Sahgal's career would end. However, it was only beginning.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Sahgal and her husband, Prem, saw the Azad Hind's economic slump as detrimental to their military careers, and pursued the best alternative: to fight as mercenaries. Over time, many generals in the Azad Hind, also running short on pay, followed Sahgal's example. By the time the economy recovered, Free India found the majority of its military as mercenaries. Providing an opportunity to cut corners and save money on the budget, Bose was more than happy to accept these private military contractors.\n\nAs the 1960s opened with a diagnosis of Bose's tumour, Sahgal found an opportunity in politics as the Netaji deposed his former vice, General Singh. Commander Sahgal, a household name and already a high-ranking minister, was appointed as Bose's deputy after little wait. With such a prestigious position, Sahgal saw that the time was right to get into politics. Espousing a rather jingoistic form of democratic socialism, she quickly began to appeal to both the moderate crowds of the country and pro-military sects of society.\n\nBut now, Sahgal is in control. Denouncing the Sphere, the Pakt, and the OFN all the same, and promoting the belief of India as a superpower, she has earned support from the more nationalist groups. And, willing to negotiate with Rahman, she has earned the trust of the minorities, too. But, with Singh and the INA scheming, can she succeed in her reforms?"
 POLITICS_MAHENDRA_PRATAP_DESC:0 "Mahendra Pratap, born into a princely family, was not expected to become the man he did. He would travel, going as far as South Africa to work alongside the Mahatma, in the hopes of raising awareness of British brutality in India. In 1914, a chance to gather genuine outside support for Indian independence presented itself in the form of a war so great and terrible that it would be termed the war to end all wars - the First World War. Pratap then traveled to meet with the Kaiser himself (along with a certain Vladimir Lenin), who awarded him with a medal. Having then traveled to Kabul, Pratap established the provisional government-in-exile of a free India with himself as President.\n\nDespite early successes and both domestic and international support, the government fell in 1919, after the British demanded that the Afghan Emir force them out of the country. But Pratap was not yet done. He had by this time acquired a bounty on his head, due to the serious threat he posed to the British, causing him to flee to Japan. He would work closely with Subhas Chandra Bose during his time in Tokyo, seeing his Azad Hind as the natural successor to his own government established in 1915. It was only after the War of Independence ended in 1953, however, that Pratap could return home. He had been gone for 33 years.\n\nHis expertise and impressive record as a freedom fighter naturally put him in good stead in the Azad Hind and he quickly found himself at the side of Bose. To many, the now aged ex-prince is his natural successor. Indeed, even the Japanese would be content with him take over. Pratap's time in Japan introduced him to the ideas of Pan-Asianism, something of which he now firmly adheres to. It is this blend of external and internal support, along with his populist views that earned him popularity, and now, his victory. A man of the people, Pratap can hope for their support as he begins his rule as Netaji. Sadly for him, nothing can be so certain - least of all in the Azad Hind."
 POLITICS_CHANDI_PRASAD_BHATT_DESC:0 "Born in a Uttarakhandi village, Chandi Prasad Bhatt quickly picked up on the problems of mountainous rural communities, the lack of farmland and work. Like with many Gandhians, Bhatt would defect to the Azad Hind, where he would again settle along the Himalayas. Years would pass as Free India developed its lands for the coming battle with the Republic. Many forests would be cut down, roads would be built over once fertile fields and even some ancient villages would be demolished for the sake of the war effort. Bhatt, growing more and more concerned with the destruction of nature and rural life, decided to take matters into his own hands. He would form cooperatives to help local workers compete with skilled workers from the cities, in order to gain valuable work contracts. Later efforts to save nature itself would involve collective purchases of the trees that were so desperately needed for firewood and building materials. Bhatt showed great determination all throughout his many campaigns against urbanisation, but never would be resort to violence.\n\nWhen free and fair elections finally came to the Azad Hind, Bhatt formed the Free Indian Green Party, dedicated to protecting both rural communities but also nature itself. Most radically of all, was the parties pacifist approach to politics. It therefore came as a surprise to many observers when such a young man became leader of the Azad Hind. It also shocked them when they heard his main policies, centred around ecology and pacifism. Yet Chandi Prasad Bhatt is indeed the new Netaji, and certainly one with many new ideas for India."
 POLITICS_PV_NARASIMHA_RAO_DESC:0 "Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao was not born into a high caste, nor class. He was not born into a family of freedom fighters and politicians. Rather, he was the son of a poor, Telugu-speaking family in a Hyderabad village. However, Rao overcame his poverty, and completed not just his primary education, but went on to earn a Bachelor's Degree in the Arts at Osmania University. From there, he joined the Indian independence movement, participating in the Swadeshi movement and joining the Indian National Congress. However, this was all interrupted when the Second War of Independence went from the Indians against the colonialists to the Indians against each other.\n\nIn the chaos of war, Rao was torn between whether to support the popular, yet Japanese-backed Azad Hind Government, or the independent, but supposedly pro-British Republic of India. Eventually, after much deliberation, he reluctantly joined hands with the Azad Hind, joining the All-India Forward Bloc to cement his place in the system. After the war, Rao slowly made his way up the ladder, becoming Chairman of the exiled congress of the Madras Province. When the Sahgals entered the scene, he offered to serve as Interior Minister, and his offer was happily accepted.\n\nRao later threw his own hat into the ring, and has emerged as the next Netaji and President of the Azad Hind Government. Promising economic liberalization and a repeal of the State Atheism Laws, the people proved their wisdom and let him in. However, not all echelons of the government or the military are too happy to accept him, and he will have to tread very wisely, lest the people that put him in power turn against him..."
 POLITICS_BAL_THACKERAY_DESC:0 "Born in 1926 to an upper-class Marathi family, Bal Keshav Thackeray always had big dreams since he was a young boy. Dreams of grandeur, leadership, and a state of Hindus and Hindus alone. Those dreams, however, were uprooted during the Second Indian War of Independence where food shortages and restrictions by the provisional government forced the young Thackeray to make the arduous trek across India, abandoning Maharashtra and the land of Shivaji. Despite these radical shifts, Thackeray never abandoned the hallmarks of his ideology - Hindutva, Akhand Bharat and the pure, unadulterated rejection of anything foreign. Most exceptionally, Thackeray views Islam in extreme contempt - a corrupting, foreign stream of thought which has perversed Bharat through its invasions and conquests.\n\nThackeray initially found his allies within the small community of Marathi émigrés, many of which who shared his ideals. Around this time, the Shiv Fauj was formed - a paramilitary loyal entirely to Thackeray and his close loyalists. But by the 1950s, he came to the realization that in a land as foreign as the Azad Hind, his Marathi chauvinism would alienate him from the vast majority of the population. The Shiv Fauj then moved away from such supremacy, to a broader Hindutva-based ideology, eventually netting them a tense but necessary alliance with the Sangh Parivar - built by the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh out of a hatred of the other major political factions within the nation. Being the eminence grise within the Parivar, no faction expected Thackeray to even challenge the status quo in the organization, and much less to take power. But, against all odds, he has done exactly that.\n\nNow, Bal Thackeray stands supreme in Kolkata, his Shiv Fauj devoted and loyal, and little is stopping him from embarking on a righteous, holy crusade to reunite the great empire that India that once was. In the process, the Shiv Fauj will strive towards Swachh Bharat - one holy, pure India, free from the corrupting influences of the West. As the armies of Shiva march forwards for a new dawn, the world is petrified - awaiting Bal Thackeray's next move."
 POLITICS_JB_KRIPALANI_DESC:0 "Jivatram Bhagwandas Kripalani has seen much in his great, long life. For five decades, he has been deeply involved with Indian politics, from colonial rule to independence and the years after. In his early years, Kripalani joined up with the growing independence movement following the return of the Mahatma from South Africa. During the early 1920s, Kriplani worked as a lecturer of history and English while serving as part of the non-cooperation movement. He would become a close adherent of the Mahatma, and was given the task of spreading his teachings to other parts of India. Later on, he would be on several occasions arrested for more direct actions against colonial rule, including organising protests and for distributing anti-British material. Kripalani would be invloved in the top affairs of Congress througout the late 1920s and into the next decade. By this point, Kripalani had also turned to be a firm adherent of Gandhian ideals, particularly those relating to socialism.\n\nWhile independence did finally come to India, the nation was quickly split in two by war between the Nehru's Republic and Bose's Free India.\n\nKriplani, saw the way to victory in the elections through cooperation with other prominent socialists, which would indeed prove to be successful in the elections. Kripalani is now leader of the Republic of India, committed to the principles of Gandhian Socialism, light agrarianism and resistance against Japan. Yet there is much work for him to do to secure his position - winning an election means when there is always someone to take your place by any means necessary."

 AZH_Hindustan_Land_Development_Authority_desc:0 "With the stated goal of resettling landless peasants and improving agricultural productivity, HILDA's operations in the Northeast of the country have brought mixed results. While the redistribution of land has significantly alleviated tenancy concerns in overpopulated Bengal and created a new source of government revenue, it has also caused an increase in secessionist and local nationalist sentiment in the areas with the most planned settlements."
 AZH_The_Language_Problem:0 "The Language Problem"
 AZH_The_Language_Problem_desc:0 "The government and Party are led overwhelmingly by either ethnic Bengalis, or expatriate Tamils from the communities in Malaya and Burma that formed the core of the movement. This, along with Bose's desire to Romanize and standardize Hindustani as the official government language, causes tension in both Bengal and the Hindi-speaking parts of the country."
 AZH_What_Is_Subhasism:0 "What is Subhasism?"
 AZH_What_Is_Subhasism_desc:0 "Socialism, nationalism, bolshevism, fascism - the officially espoused ideology of the Azad Hind has been called many things, but even the most ardent Party member would be hard pressed to pin down the precise position of the government and people. This ideological flexibility is useful perhaps only in negotiations with other countries (and certain insurgent groups), but sooner or later a decision must be reached and Bose's vision must be laid down in concrete terms. As to the form this will take, it's anyone's guess."
 
 AZH_Persistent_Communal_Violence:0 "Persecution of Abrahamic Faiths"
 AZH_Persistent_Communal_Violence_desc:0 "Even before the Muslim Revolt, the Azad Hind has fanatically pursued a policy of persecution against certain religions, especially Christianity and Islam, in order to purge supposed pro-Western and terrorist elements from India. This policy has manifested itself in multiple examples of government-sanctioned violence and persecution of Indian Christians and Muslims, who are often taken away from their homes and sent to concentration camps, forced to work in the government's heavy industry until they die. However, while many both at home and abroad know of the persecution of Muslims, the persecution of Christians is far more secretive, with most Naga and Mizo Christians being sent to secluded valley camps, where they work for the extraction of iron and coal. Living conditions are poor, and deaths from malnutrition, disease, and general lack of proper working conditions are all too common."
 AZH_Private_Military_Contractors:0 "Private Military Contractors"
 AZH_Private_Military_Contractors_desc:0 "While the Indian National Army is the largest in the world in terms of manpower, it isn't the only part of Free India's military; private military contractors, known more popularly by the more archaic name of mercenaries, make up a substantial portion of the military. While other parts of the world (and, closer to Calcutta, the INA) have criticised our large amount of PMCs as "a violation of the Geneva Conventions" and "illegal", we have evidence to prove that these matters are perfectly legal. If they weren't, why would the Deputy Netaji be a PMC?"
 AZH_Martial_Law:0 "The Military Administration of East Bengal"
 AZH_Martial_Law_desc:0 "The Military Administration of East Bengal was established in the aftermath of the Muslim Revolt in order to prevent the growth of Islamism, as well as, to a lesser extent, Islam as a whole. Established at the request of military maverick Mohan Singh in 1955, it quickly went from a temporary military authority until stability could be reestablished to an indefinite occupation - and a hell on Earth for the Muslims. Bengalis, Assamese, Naga, and Bodo are routinely shot on sight for suspicion of terrorism or, even worse, kidnapped by security officers and sent to slave labour camps where they go with little food and work until they die. Public outcry has emerged against the MAEC both domestically and internationally, with calls for an end to the military occupation and arrest of Singh, not to mention the likelihood of another revolt if we maintain the MAEC. We must find a solution to benefit both sides, and quickly!"
