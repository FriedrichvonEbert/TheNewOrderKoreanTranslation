 DER_Nikolay_Zabelkin: "니콜라이 자벨킨"
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ZABELKIN_DESC: "니콜라이 이바노비치 자벨킨은 한때 길을 잃었지만, 지금은 찾았습니다. 붉은 군대에서 영웅주의로 유명한 장교였던 자벨킨은 소련의 정치 상황이 점점 불안정해지면서 손쉽게 충성스런 군인들을 측근에 두었습니다. 나치의 승리로 나라가 분열되자, 자벨킨은 그의 방랑자 군대를 이끌고 고향 카자흐스탄으로 돌아갔고, 혼란스러운 시기에 일어난 수십의 도적떼 중 하나가 되었습니다. 그리고 수많은 경쟁자들처럼 그의 군대도 곧 불명예스러운 최후를 맞이했습니다. 병사들은 사막에 묻혔고, 장교들은 배신했고, 사람들은 학살당했고, 그는 사막에 목까지 묻혔습니다. 어떻게 구조된건진 아무도 모릅니다.\n\n자벨킨은 알라 자신이 하신거라고 주장합니다.\n\n햇볕에 정신이 혼미해진 채 비틀거리며 근처 마을에 도달했을때, 그는 의사가 아니라 이맘을 데려오라고 요청했습니다. 사원에서 요양하면서 자벨킨은 이맘에게 알라가 무한한 자비심으로 그를 모래에서 건져내어 마을로 인도했다고 말했습니다. 자벨킨은 이 새로운 삶이라는 선물은 결코 알라께 갚을 수 없는 빚이라고 맹세했지만, 그가 할 수 있는 최선은 그 뜻을 바치는 삶을 서약하는 것이었습니다.\n\n이맘은 그를 믿었고, 마을의 많은 이들도 그를 믿었습니다. 자벨킨은 요양하던중 그의 가장 열렬한 추종자 수십명을 체포하고 마을을 자신의 영토라고 주장하는 군벌 소령을 죽이기 위해 나섰습니다. 온갖 역경에도 불구하고 자벨킨은 승리를 쟁취했습니다. 그리고 코스타나이 전체가 해방될 때까지 이 승리를 반복했습니다. 이 지역은 다시 알라의 뜻에 따라 살아가고 있지만, 신자들의 땅에는 여전히 수없이 번성하는 악행과 배교가 존재하며, 그는 이를 용납하지 않을 것입니다."

 ### Events ###
 DER.1.t: "Kostanay - Intro Event"
 DER.1.d: "Nikolai Zabelkin was hardly well known during the Great Patriotic War, just another Red Army officer in the Soviet horde sent to face the Reich war machine. Yet as he watched his fellow Kazakh's be used as fodder by the Soviet regime, it was on the battlefield that his awakening to the folly of Communism took place. With the USSR taking its dying breaths, the Kazakh SSR declared her independence and Zabelkin led his men home, vowing never again to shed the blood of his kinsmen for the Russian menace.\n\nBut as Zabelkin returned to his homeland, it was clear Kazakhstan would be no more resilient against collapse into warlordism than Russian had proved to be. Years later, based in the city of Kostanay, Zabelkin had risen to be a mighty warlord within his own right. But great power comes with great enemies, and after a ruthless ambush by a rival warlord Zabelkin was sent into the desert, never to return.\n\nPerhaps this was the case, for the man who returned weeks later to Kostanay was not the man his men remembered. Standing before his stunned followers, Zabelkin declared that Allah had directly spoken to him as he had wandered the desert and awoken him again to the error of his ways. Allah had spared his life and sent him back to Kostanay to spread a simple message to his people: Madness has had its day.\n\nThe godless warlords dominating the landscape of Kazakhstan had to be eliminated, the people liberated from their terror, and the nation unified at last under Islamic rule. As his men stood in shocked silence, many called him mad and spat upon his feet, taking their arms and leaving. Yet in the weeks and months since those losses have been dwarfed by those pious men rallying to our holy banner each day and we now stand ready. That which Allah has commanded we shall follow."
 DER.1.a: "Allahu Akbar!"
 DER.2.t: "German Reich lands on the Moon!"
 DER.2.d: "German speakers are few and far between in our lands, most being former communications officers from the Red Army. Usually we care little for the broadcasts of the Reich, but there was something about the excitement within the recent cracking words from chipped radios that led to us bringing in one of these language experts to finally tell us what was going on.\n\nAs the man listened closely to the garbled broadcast, he told us as if his words were not filled with madness that the Reich had landed a man upon the moon. Whilst we know the news will hardly be widespread in this part of the world, the news has deeply troubled Zabelkin, knowing all too well the godless ways of the Germans who have somehow managed to reach the heavens."
 DER.2.a: "Allah works in mysterious ways."
 DER.3.t: "The False Judgement Upon Us"
 DER.3.d: "The desert, even during the darkest nights, is not always impossible to see. This, however, is no merciful gift of God. The light blasts from German bombs, pounding the desert into dust. This light, however, does have its uses. It certainly has made the desert a lot easier to get around, and it has made bandits seriously consider the risks of braving the desert to escape the brigades. Unfortunately, the bombings do not deter all those who disobey the Grand Mufti's plans for Kazakhstan, and many still flee into the desert to escape holy authority.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThe sound of the bombings rung around them, as they slowly marched across the dunes. They carried no light, for risk that the bombers, the same ones that zoomed above their heads, would notice them. On they marched, for kilometer after kilometer, as morning drew nearer and nearer, without seeing so much as a single bandit. The noise never stopped. The light never stopped. The jets never stopped. Even as Kazakhs returned to the city, it all never stopped. The brigadesmen, in the end, had nothing to show for their night. Or the night after that. Or the night after that."

 DER.5.t: "The Status Of The Caches"
 DER.5.d: "The series of night patrol set out to verify cache after cache. The process was slow going; the brigadiers verifying the caches did not want to look like they were up to anything out of the ordinary, lest enterprising locals unearth the caches. The men sent on the job were the most reliable veteran that Zabelkin could find, to prevent the word from leaking out.\n\nIn the remote areas where the caches had been buried the squads got to work. Men dug frantically, for their work had to be completed before the sun was up. A kilometer away from each site, a perimeter of brigadier made sure that no one would be coming the way of the digging team. The moon sailed in the night sky as men worked their shovels.\n\nSoon the results became evident. The seal of sand and mud placed on top of every cache was almost always unbroken. Only a single dig site showed the telltale mix of soil and sand left by rapidly filling back a dug up pit. The guns were all gone from the scavenged location.\n\nStill, a ninety eight percent success rate after 10 years was very good. The men went back to work and hid away the caches. One day the German flights would end..."

 DER.7.t: "On The Front With The Bandit King"
 DER.7.d: "Much merriment was had amongst the brigades, tonight. Banditry, after the construction of new watchtowers, has dropped massively within the borders of the Brigade. Several of the infamous bandit groups have found the new watchtowers incredibly difficult to bypass, and many villages previously very difficult to protect have seen massive increases in personal security and quality of life. Bandit groups have been spotted and fired upon whenever attempting to enter patrolled, and have been unable to retaliate due to the protection provided our brigadesmen by the soldiers. Recent bandit defectors, who have since found the faith, tell us joyous news of bandits taught to fear God, terrified of the anti-bandit brigades. Many bandits, in fact, have desired to resign entirely from their careers of banditry due to fear of our brigades, and the new difficulties in raiding our territory. The name of the "Anti-Bandit Brigades" have become a name famous amongst them. A name terrifying and awe-inspiring.\n\nWhile Kazakh banditry has not been ended, and indeed we are far off from it, another valuable stride has been made towards our noble goal."
 DER.7.a: "We take another step to a steppe made civilised."

 DER.8.t: "The Court Of The Khan"
 DER.8.d: ""What a haul these brave warriors! Drink men, drink!" The two brigadier infiltrator did as instructed, chugging down their mug of Kumis. The warlord seemed ever so relieved at the sight of his new temporary best friends getting hammered. Surely no Islamic spy would dare get drunk?\n\nThe brigadier infiltrators spent much of the evening drinking. Lightweights as they were, they still struggled to observe their environment as best they could. The feasts seemed to be an important tool for the Khan to maintain his sway over the court; well performing leaders were seated closer to the Khan while courtiers out of favor were seated farther. A few men in particular seemed to have the warlord's ears as the feast unfolded. Throughout the evening pretty girls refilled mugs of Kumis and brought roasted meat to whoever had an empty plate. The women's eyes gleamed with the kind of focus rarely seen in ordinary slaves, and the spies suspected that perhaps the pretty women were a discreet surveillance tool for the warlord. The khan himself seemed far more cunning than his brutish appearance and behavior would let one imagine. Not a scholar by any stretch, but a man it would be difficult to fool completely.\n\nThe following day the two infiltrated brigadier were nursing a hangover when orders from the khan came through: they were to recon the watchtower line the same day. The infiltrators didn't know if the Khan suspected they were infiltrators, but they rode with all haste back home. In a way, the Khan might have suspected that they did not have much to report home, and that he had made a good impression. The brigadiers would certainly be watchful in the future about him."
 DER.8.a: "Riding while hung over is no fun."

 DER.9.t: "Nobody Left Behind"
 DER.9.d: "Difficult at times to tell which group among men and beasts was most tired. The long distance anti-bandit patrol rode into the village in late afternoon after a long day of travels. The back country had been quiet these past few weeks, but the steppes still needed defending. The men dropped off their horses and led them to water stall while the team's leader let himself be dragged into the village elder's house.\n\nOne by one the brigadiers trickled into the house, where comfortable cushions, piping hot tea and a selection of jams awaited them. The men drifted into a tired torpor as their leader chatted in a low voice with the village chief. There hadn't been much bandit activity in the area recently, but a village further in the back country had seen strange disappearances. Rumor spoke of young men leaving to join up Abu Khan, or some other Kazakh Warlords. The area's poverty didn't help much its youth's prospects, even as the anti-bandit brigade dried up the local careers in banditry.\n\nStill the villagers were happy to see peace and order restored. They were good, god fearing people, and they praised the brigadier's struggle. A few comfortable beds had been prepared for the brigadiers. The patrol's leader didn't have the heart to deny his men a night of sleep. After leading them in the sunset prayer he let them grab the rest they so desired. The chief himself stayed up a few hours longer, sharing a map with the village chief and asking for routes that needed patrols and villages that needed to be checked."
 DER.9.a: "No village left behind."

 DER.10.t: "A Most Unpleasant Package"
 DER.10.d: "The Khan was used to receiving tribute. Boxes of stuff kept arriving to his roaming court; guns, booze, food, gold, valuables of all sort. Sometimes the people carrying the boxes were pretty women for him and his men. This tribute system kept the good stuff rolling in, and served as an informal tax system for villages and communes that feared the Khan's wrath. A mindful leader, Abu Khan spread the love around, plying his men with easy access to guns, booze, women and the finer stuff in life.\n\nToday's package would be difficult to share around. In an unmarked, unassuming wooden chest was the head of one of the war chief's missing lieutenant. The officer had last been seen leading a raiding party in the west to sack a border town of Kostanay. A few survivors from the broken up raiding party had told of their commander leading the surviving riders north west to escape brigade pursuit. As it turned out, the brigadiers had caught up to him.\n\n"This box has not been opened up to now?" The Khan asked with his most even tone. "No, my lord." said an advisor. The Khan leaned toward him." Yet every other envoy from Kostanay has been sealed with a wax seal, has it not?" " Yes, my lord!" "So you fuckers knew this would be what was in the box, yet you sniveling lot brought me this without comment?" "Yes, my lord." one of the other advisers said. The Khan leaned back into his chair." Draw up lots, all of you. I want five people to lead an assault on their Goddamned watchtower network. Once those towers are smashed, I want the expedition to continue inland. Any village found is to be sacked. Any brigadier, killed. I expect at least 10 communes destroyed." " Yes, my lord." Came the whimpering chorus. "And in the future, I don't want any fucking surprise!" The Khan thundered as his men left the room. They knew better than to hang around their boss when he was in such a temper."

 DER.15.t: "Charity Of A Different Kind"
 DER.15.d: "Zakat is an ancient Islamic tradition. It is one of the "five pillars" of the Faith, and is the sacrifice of one's wealth to charities. It has recently seen a large boost in popularity as an act of patriotism, but this Zakat is charity of a much different kind to normal.\n\nThe household gathered all that could be sold, and soon carried it to the market, selling it off. Pots, pans, knives, forks, jewelry, even old heirlooms long belonging to the family. Their pay was collected, and soon they stood in front of a town merchant of a very different kind.\n\nThe transaction was hasty, but soon afterwards the family found themselves in possession of five machineguns, ones that would be deemed ancient relics in much of the world, but which were still valuable tools in the Steppe.\n\nThe family then found itself outside the office of the local branch of the anti-bandit brigade. They knocked, and a nervous brigadesman opened the door, flinching when he saw their guns. "We come to give Zakat. Thank you for your service" uttered the father, handing a gun to the soldier. The family and the outpost's guards smiled and embraced, and the guns were added to a growing pile of donations, all thanking the brigade for their charity to the people of the Steppe."

 DER.19.t: "Beneath The Sands"
 DER.19.d: "The deserts, once cacophonous, have been made mute. As soon as the sun set upon the steppe, many brigadesmen set out from Kostanay city, entering the desert under cloak of night. They walked far, then stopped. The sands were parted by them as Moses once parted the seas, and just as the seas did reveal safe passage for God's chosen then, the now-quiet sands have revealed the path to the future for God's chosen now.\n\nThe brigades dug up guns, artillery, canned foods, material treasures, and even copies of the Holy Quran from the desert. Our once-buried treasures were counted, sorted, and stacked, their lists were checked thrice, and not after long were they returned to Kostanay city. Their delivers were lauded, and much celebration was had.\n\nOur warehouses are once again full. We shall not lack for supplies soon, and already we have felt strain lift from our shoulders. We finally have the resources to bring new blood into the clergy. Perhaps most important of all, the anti-bandit brigades can be armed and expanded far more than previously possible. Soon, the steppe shall be made clean, and never again will we have to bury our belongings to keep them safe."
 DER.19.a: "The past has been dug up, and it has made us rich."

 DER.20.t: "The Pilgrim's Roads"
 DER.20.d: "Ramil looked at the new roads incredulously. The anti-bandit brigade had came and went, repairing the crater ridden mud track that had been the village's only link with the outside world. They had packed the earth solidly before pouring in gravel. Little by little they had progressed, like molasses slowly moving along the plain. In a few days they were gone over the closest ridge, and in a few more days they were beyond the horizon. Now, traders coming in from the neighboring village had brought the news that the gravel road reached their community. The anti-bandit brigades had not commented on the reason why this particular stretch in the middle of nowhere was renovated. For all their charitable work and defense of the innocents, they remained a secretive lot.\n\nBut Ramil was inspired by this bizarre development. In the basement of his house was another relic of a past era, where roads had not been such unholy muddy holey messes. The middle-aged man retrieved his bicycle from the basement. He had pointlessly maintained it all these years, despite the ire of his wife. In his youth he had enjoyed cycling to nearby communities in the summer heat. The war had taken the roads away, but now the brigade had brought them back. Why not go on a ride?\n\nRamil threw some snacks in a duffel bag and lifted his bicycle out of the basement stair. A few kids and teenagers looked with curiosity and the middle aged man cycling in unsteady circles as he got used to his bike after 20 years. The youth's curiosity had nothing compared to the bemused anti-bandit brigadiers he met while riding on the new road. A few of the younger soldiers had never seen a grown man riding a bike. But the men saw that Ramil was unarmed, and let him be on his way. He reached the neighboring village the following hours, and was back home in the evening. A few in the village were intrigued at the prospect of being able to do round-trip to other communities, but others dismissed the endeavor as pointless.\n\nRamil's wife did not seem to share her husband's enthusiasm for the restored cycling lane."
 DER.20.a: "Allah encourages all pilgrims."

 DER.21.t: "Readying The Liberation"
 DER.21.d: "The attack began with smoke rounds exploding across the steppe. The defenders' sight lines were obscured by a well calibrated artillery barrage that spun up a web of smoke and deceit around the fortified position. Thus blinded, the men defending the position would be unable to see fast dragoons riding or driving around to their back and unloading waves of infantry. Soon several field squads of light machine guns and marksmen were in position. Light field artillery ripped apart weaker fortifications as automatic fire raked the whole perimeter. As the smoke drifted away, the marksmen added their fire to the effort of pinning down defenders. Exposed soldiers were targets of opportunities; the main purpose of this barrage was letting infantrymen creep up to the fortifications and destroy them with target explosives. Soon, the enemy perimeter's machine gun positions were out of service. Horns signaled the end of the artillery barrage. A cavalry brigade dashed toward the north east section of the trench work and unloaded more men and equipment as the brigadiers began their assault.\n\nEven with the outer layers smashed apart, taking the fort would be a difficult operations. The trenches were filled with booby traps and pockets of defender that had survived the initial shelling. The going was slow, and hand to hand combat occasionally broke out as the defenders were pushed back to their last positions.\n\nAt least, so went the exercise. The enemy was a set of training dummies that the soldiers were instructed to surprise. Traps were real enough, however. A recruit stumbled through a tripwire and found himself covered in white paint. He sheepishly left the trench work and walked toward those supervising the exercise. After being chewed up for falling for such an obvious trap, the man slunk off to his company's tent to begin cleaning the gunk out of his clothes."

 DER.24.t: "Brick Upon Brick"
 DER.24.d: "The town's mosque had always been treasured by its inhabitants. One of the oldest mosques in the lands of the Kazakh, popular belief held that it had been raised up in the 8th century by the first few generations of warriors and missionaries of the Kazakh ummah. The mosque had lived on to the time of the Golden Horde, and been adorned with elaborate tiling inspired by pilgrims that had seen the Islamic world's beautiful mosque.\n\nThe annihilation of the holy site had been a source of great despair in the beginning of the Kazakh Anarchy; the mosque's great dome crushed by the Luftwaffe's cruel bombings. Fragments of the tiling were saved by citizens and hid away in cellars. Some had slowly, painfully copied the fragment's design onto paper to keep the memory of the mosque alive. Other hoarded pictures of the mosque and showed them to the few pilgrims that had risked the wastes to glimpse at the holy site. The town had limped on, its mosque seemingly lost to the past.\n\nNow that the bombings had ended and that the brigadiers had restored order, it seemed almost too ridiculous to hope that the mosque could be restored. Little by little the villagers had begun clearing rubble from the site. Then, new walls were slowly raised up. A nearby anti-bandit brigade garrison helped the effort, sending strong men to raise up stones for a new dome. And the villagers worked on restoring the tile mosaic. Ineptly at first; few in living memory had mastered the delicate art. Restoring such an elaborate work of art fully seemed a fool's errand. But the villagers kept at it. These days, the art on the wall and floor resembled the art that had been lost. It was not a perfect replica, for the true mosaic had become something of a dream, an elusive symbol living in fading memories. But it didn't matter to the villagers. Their mosque was back, and in time new memories would be built about the new mosaic."
 DER.24.a: "Allah is merciful."

 DER.25.t: "The Heart Of Civilization"
 DER.25.d: "'No, not like that! You've got to focus, it's not difficult!'\n The students laughed and chattered among themselves before trying once again to pronounce the word properly. Classical Arabic was a strange creature to these young students, a sacred language in which the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, had declared Allah's instructions. A sacred language, but a weird one all the same. Its sounds were quite far from the Kazakh they spoke among themselves.\n\nThe kids did love their professor, however. Not too long ago, he had been a shell of a man, a refugee haunted by lost friends and family. Living on the edge of town, the man never left the bombed out house where he had begun awaiting death. Concerned villagers brought him a little food, and perhaps the man decided he had to live on for he began to nourish himself again. When the bombing had ended, the hermit had left his house and helped to rebuild the local mosque. The village elder learned by talking to him that the newcomer had been a holy man once, and that the destruction of his community had brought him to almost total despair. But little by little, his faith had nursed him back to health. Now the man found purpose again teaching children about Islam.\n\nPrayers did not come as easily as before to the teacher. He had wondered for a long time how Allah could take so much from His faithful. But seeing his new community's hope for the future had helped the teacher grieve his past. He would teach the children how to read the sacred Quran, and in doing so he would give back to the village that had helped him in his darkest hour."

 DER.26.t: "The Most Virtuous Task"
 DER.26.d: "The feud between the two families had started years ago. One family's son had decided to elope with the other family's daughter. The love story had ended in disaster, for the village the teenagers had escaped to had burned down by bandits. Neither side had ever ceased to grieve the loss of one of their children, and bitter accusation that the teenage girl had seduced the boy, or that the boy had kidnapped the girl persisted. Such a blood feud might have once ended with open violence, but the harshness of the Kazakh Anarchy had given both families other problems to tend to. And so the hatred had persisted at a low simmer instead of boiling fully to the surface.\n\nWhen the Aronov family saw its fields razed by bandits and its herds culled, the Omarov family could not help but feel some joy that the horrors of the Kazakh anarchy had been visited on the terrible humans whose son had stolen their daughter. But the sight of their rivals reduced to begging to stave off starvation had been surprisingly hard on Erzhan, the Omarov patriarch. expected. On a whim the bandit had reduced the others to destitution. It could have been him. Had his daughter lived, she might have been the one forced to beg for parents too frail to leave a ruined house.\n\nThe patriarch knew the other family was too proud to admit needing help. So he made his way alone to their house, and sought the head of the family. When the famished older man appeared, Erzhan went to his knees and begged forgiveness for his conduct. He implored the Aronov family to accept his offer of shelter and food. All he hoped for, Erzhan said, was to give them a moment's rest so they could rebuild their fortunes.\n\nIt was as difficult for the Aronov patriarch to accept the help as it was for the Omarov family chief to offer it. But in making both vulnerable for an instant to one another, the seeds of healing were sown. The two families would not be close for generations. But they would both live to see a new future, if Allah willed it. "

 DER.29.d: "To the riders of Kokshetau that had become used to seeing Kostanay's eastern watchtowers light bonfires to request reinforcement, the sight of every watchtower simultaneously lighting up was unnerving. Even the densest among the Khan's soldiers knew it meant that war was coming.\n\nThe Khan's horde evacuated any civilian from the border region that would not be of use to the war effort. The eternally freewheeling riders were soon settling into a rigid military life without complaint. The hated anti-bandit brigade that had killed so many comrades would soon be snuffed out like the bugs they were. And then an entire region untouched by raids for years would be ripe for the picking.\n\nA similar grim excitement reigned in Kostanay. Brigadiers dug ditches against cavalry and filled them with whatever wooden spikes and iron traps could be found. Well prepared machine gun nests sighted their guns, ready to scythe down any cavalry charge. And beyond the watchtowers, a vast host gathered. The anti-bandit brigade would wipe out the bandits and exterminate any unbelievers that threatened the community of the faithful."

Materials furnished by herdsman. Many soldiers also carry scarves given by the Kostanay's women's association to shield themselves from cold winds or dust storms in dry areas. \n -Food is an assortment of grain from our fertile areas and dried meats and milk. Thanks to farmer and herdsman contribution the average soldiers has high calorie food for consumption in long campaigns. Each soldier carries two water skins, refillable from cistern carried by supply units. \n -Average weapon in the sector is either a PPSh-41 or a Mosin. As a result men either carry 7,62 × 25 мм ТТ pistol ammo or 7,62 × 54 мм R rifle rounds. The units with Degtyaryov machine guns are usually supplied with crates of the rifle rounds, augmenting the individual soldiers ammo supplies. A steady ammo supply from our first few operational military factories had greatly increased the firepower of our teams by letting our machine gun support assaults. \n -Soldiers often carry an assortment of Tumar amulets, leather triangles containing an extract from the Quran for good fortune. Imams sometimes frown upon the custom, but receiving amulets from gaggle of school children is good for morale, so it has been judged halal by our Islamic jurisprudence judges."

 DER.32.d: "The men worked tirelessly to build houses. Every few hour when break came, gourds of water were passed around. The former bandits drank, then cleaned their hands and feet before gathering in prayer. In this they were joined by their jailers, brigadiers supervising their work. The village's reconstruction was going well; by the brigadier's reckoning it would only be a few months before their charges could be left free.\n\nThe mood among the former Kokshetau bandits was good. The men seemed to have snapped out of their collective trance where they had ridden and killed for the demonic Abu Khan. The men worked hard every day, rebuilding the land they had once destroyed. Little by little the villagers began to see them not as oppressors, but as victims of a madman that would slowly expiate their crimes through work and prayer.\n\nOf course, a few of the more cynical brigadiers observed that the chain ganged workers were only sixty percent or so of the bandits they had started with. The most brutal had been judged and then condemned to death by decapitation. A few others had tried to escape and had been gunned down. Two men had fallen ill and died during the holy month of Ramadan, unable to work without food and water throughout the day. So the bandits' transition to civilian life had not been an entirely easy process. But even the cynical brigadiers knew that all this was part of Allah's plan. Those that had died during the holy month would no doubt be exalted in heaven, and their pious deaths had been a great example for their surviving comrades. In time the shadow cast by the unbeliever Abu Khan would be banished from Kokshetau."

 DER.33.t: "A Noose Around The Reds"
 DER.33.d: "The colonel of the red army looked at the horizon through binoculars. And what he saw did not amuse him. A series of strong points and watchtowers connected by trenches had begun appearing on the Kyzil Orda-Kostanay frontier. The colonel had seen this handiwork before in Kostanay, when his recon team had brought him pictures of the fortifications built by the anti-bandit brigade against Kokshetau's mad khan. Now the neatly arrayed chain of camps and fortified positions had begun spreading all across the border with the northern Islamists.\n\nAbu Khan's roaming pack of thugs had been a security concern too, of course. But the Islamists were a different beast all together. Well organized, well motivated, well disciplined, and with a mind to take over all of Kazakhstan. In that regard they were closer to Aktobe's national renewal junta, or Aktau's insane fascism. Zabelkin would never quit until all of Kazakhstan was gripped by his Islamist goons. And he just might succeed in the end. But, the colonel suspected, the grand mufti would not target Kyzil Orda until all weaker rivals were defeated. Plenty of time to prepare for the bearded invasion.\n\nAcross the frontier, a colonel of the brigadier was just finished inspecting the new fortification lay-out. The soldiers had done good work building field works to repel the decaying red army. In the distance something reflected the afternoon sun. The brigade's colonel imagined a distant red army observer with binoculars. A sniper's scope glint would not scare him much more, that said. Like all brigadiers, the colonel knew the communist infidels were a cowardly lot, content to sit in their decaying land until the end. So what if the brigade's preparations were observed? The red's day of reckoning would come in the end. And there was nothing the communists and their ilk could do about it."

 DER.35.d: "Candidates throng the brigade's recruitment centers. Former riders of Kokshetau that have seen Allah's light yet retain their lust for battle have offered their service to Zabelkin. The grand mufti's fatwa has also seen a steady inflow of refugees from Aktobe, Muslims fleeing the heathen national renewal junta to serve Allah and liberate Kazakhstan. The new recruits perform strenuous physical testing before being sent to the Kostanay interior, freeing up reserve units to go to the front line.\n\nThe Aktobe devils have tried to prevent their Muslim population from leaving by easing up on secularization. Their efforts at pragmatism have however failed to yield clear results as the appeal of a simple religious life and civil freedoms have lured dozens of refugees to the border. Infiltration specialists from the brigades have helped run the refugees through weak points in the border. This exodus may have been made easier by some elements of the Junta in Aktobe; why keep potentially disloyal citizen onboard, they have argued in speeches, when all this dead weight could be given to Kostanay?\n\nThe Grand Mufti and his commanders remain happy about the constant flow of believers from Kazakhstan and beyond. Replenishing communities ravaged by war gives all of Kostanay's citizens hope that Zabelkin's plan is the right one. Even Christian infidels have been welcomed; they provide an increase to the region's tax base by paying jizya dutifully. The appeal of safe land under strict laws is universal throughout these troubled times. Thus, the Islamist of the steppes have strangely become a beacon of hope across Kazakhstan."

 DER.36.d: "The string of saboteurs was brought out to a single square. They were Aktobe's mothers and fathers, they were cousins and nieces of the city, they were the old and the young; all united by a common faith, and all forced to toil in the factories of National Renewal. Their faces were darkened by soot, and their bodies twisted by days spent hunched over conveyor belt and machinery of all kind. All were thin, for their caloric intake had been narrowed down to a science by the capital's technocrats. The sustenance given to them had only been enough to maintain their bodies as important industrial tools. No sustenance had been given to their hearts, for national renewal thought is enough by itself to nourish sane individuals.\n\nTheir crimes were read out to the assembled crowd. Sabotage! The destruction of critical war industries under the cover of night. And for what purpose? To aid the fanatics of Kostanay? The brutes that worked captured prisoners to death or to conversion? The workers had been given a chance to renounce Islam and repent for their crimes. None had taken it. And so the guards that had escorted the saboteurs became their executioners. All twenty condemned prisoners were brought up to a wall and executed by firing squad.\n\nThe assembled crowd remained silent throughout the whole ordeal. Some might have had pity for the fools that had betrayed the glorious National Renewal Junta. Others might have been angry at the execution of these Muslim martyrs. But the majority was most likely apathetic, irritated at being delayed from starting their work shifts for the day. They needed the money to keep their family alive and well."

His father sat in a corner of their small apartment, reading a newspaper. He made a valiant effort to smile at his son. His new beard was still a little itchy. \n 'Say, dad, why have you never talked to me about Islam before?' \n 'Well, Serioga, your old man isn't very good with words. I thought the teacher would do a better job explaining things to you.'\n 'That's not true dad, you explain things super well!' \n 'I see. Well, in that case, I'll try to talk to you more about religion. Want to come to the Mosque with me tomorrow for the friday prayer?'\n\nThe lad nodded with enthusiasm.

 DER.39.d: "Among the many rivals of Kazakhstan, few are so close yet so far as Kostanay's Islamists and Pavlodar's democrats. Both aspire in principle to free citizens, defended from tyrants and bandits. Yet Kostanay's hands off approach to governance does not extend to the religious sphere where the choices are Islam, jizya taxes for Christians, and death for everyone else. The state's religious fervor has been both one of its greatest assets in keeping its people razor focused, and one of its greatest flaws in making life harder for Muslims everywhere in Kazakhstan.\n\nNow that the flame of war between Pavlodar and Kostanay are being fanned, the question of political Islam has reached the young republic. Secularism has long been one of the pillars of Pavlodar, and has always been a divisive issue in the region's Muslim community. Moderate Islamic parties have run for office before, and contributed to the young nation. But now the swelling tide of hysteria has seen all Muslims tarred as a treasonous fifth column that plot Pavlodar's downfall. This has in turn soured the Muslim community, with many men of faith claiming that if the republic would sell them out to maintain internal peace then perhaps Grand Mufti Zabelkin's program was much better for Pavlodar.\n\nOne thing remains certain: the rise of street militias duking it out in the capital is an unneeded distraction in this time of crisis."

 DER.40.t: "Activity On The Border!"
 DER.40.d: "As the preparations to liberate Pavlodar ramp up, the usual work of building fortifications on our border with the infidels has begun. To our usual network of watchtowers and trenches new ideas from across the Russian and Kazakh anarchy have been included. Our swelling stockpile of light and heavy artillery has made it easier to extend a net of artillery kill zones across the plains. Out of reach of any attackers, the long range guns are able to rout any direct assaults. Our garrison troop have also experimented with the use of plunging fire from their machine gun, allowing them to use their weapons to deny far off areas to advancing enemy troops. By placing our machine guns further back from the line and using this new tactic, the machine gun teams can be used both to support our forward position and to repel any encirclement attempt by cavalry.\n\nAll this relies on learning how to zero guns and automatic weapons properly, and on good communication between artillery teams and observer teams. Burying phone wires between the front and rear as well as using what scant few radios we can find has helped our observers a lot. They are now able to inform our troops of unfolding events much faster, making it more difficult for the enemy to convert local breaches of our line into operational level breakthrough."
 DER.40.a: "Grim as it is, the art of war always need studying."

 DER.41.t: "A Purer Pavlodar"
 DER.41.d: "The usual great prayer preceding every great victory celebration of the Anti-Bandit Brigade was held today under Grand Mufti Zabelkin's guidance. The leader and holy man has as usual praised the faithful for their successful Jihad against infidels and tyrants. Yet an attentive ear would have noticed slight changes to his usual speech. Instead of promising immediate execution to the defeated leaders and grueling purification to their minions, the Grand Mufti has been surprisingly silent on the fate of Pavlodar's elite.\n\nThe republic's secularism had obviously been a great crime to Allah, denying as it was the hope of salvation to all its citizens. Yet the republicans had not persecuted the Muslims. They had erected laws to defend them from other ideologues and radical atheists. Muslims had reached the highest echelons of Pavlodar's society, and there was no evidence that this policy would have been reversed any time soon. The republicans had been misguided, but they had not been monsters.\n\nThe leader's advisors were as divided on the matter as Zabelkin was internally. Some encouraged him to drop any leniency. The republicans would have arrested the Brigade's higher ups and judged them for war crimes. Life in prison, death or exile would have been the outcome. These democrats were secularist fools, but they were not naive enough to give mercy to their opponents in the Kazakh struggle. Against this hard edge came those that wished mercy. The anti-bandit brigade had risen up to exterminate bandits and tyrants, and had always held no ill will toward those that were defeated and showed contrition. The democrats of Pavlodar should be offered trials, and be given a chance to start anew.\n\nAfter a final day of prayer, the Grand Mufti finally made his decision..."

 DER.42.t: "Jihad Against The Reds"
 DER.42.d: "More well ordered trenches were seen through the binoculars. The brigadiers had progressed, and now most sectors of the Kyzil Orda military frontier were used to the tidy camps and fortification networks across the no-man's land. Now, war with the bearded Islamists was all but inevitable. The red army soldiers had heard rumors about the Brigade's war of liberations. The Islamists had used simple tactics and well disciplined men to outlast their foes. Now, the brigadiers had declared their intent to crush Kyzil Orda. The veterans of the red army faced a tougher fight than they'd have liked. But they had fought the Germans twice. What challenge could another army of hyper arrogant men bring to Momyshuly's soldiers?\n\nIn the Islamist lines, the final preparations were being made. An officer gave a final set of technical presentations about the armored vehicle facing them. The world war 2 era vehicles of the Kazakh red army might have been ancient, but their armors still merited consideration. The officer led a discussion on how best to immobilize or destroy tanks. Veterans of previous conflicts brought up their own limited experiences with tanks or infantry fighting vehicles. One man discussed how his squads had taken out a reinforced position with explosives. Absent from the conservation was fear, or anxiety. The men were determined, they were ready. What was a communist tank army, if not another challenging opponent in a long list? The men had Allah's backing, and this was all that matters."

 DER.43.t: "Organizing The Industry"
 DER.43.d: "'You there! Don't slack on the job!'\n\nThe employees straightened up and resumed working on the engine piece. The foreman wiped sweat off his brow and popped outside the building to catch some fresh air. The desert wind helped wash away from him the chaos and bustle of the plant.\n\nThe factory's output had slowed after the initial fall of the communist government, and it had been a difficult task to get everything back online. The foreman had been selected by the brigadier's temporary government to get back online this particular factory. The old man had not worked in an industrial setting since before the German invasion, and the crew had been suspicious of this foreigner imposed on them by the brigadiers. But as with many things, time had helped. The new society brought on by Grand Mufti Zabelkin was much freer than the Soviet society it had destroyed, and as long as the employees worked hard, there was good money in it for them and their family.\n\nThe foreman went back in. The employees were churning out engines for cars, tractors and military vehicles. The company's rising output had increased the need for workers, and thus local kids had been hired. They still required some level of supervision, but the lads had gotten much better. Soon, the team might need a new building to host a secondary workshop. Approaching one of the conveyor belt, the foreman slapped the two youth that had been slacking earlier on the back and praised their renewed work. The kids retorted that if the old man didn't work too they'd have to replace him. The foreman grinned and went back to work. They had a new society to build."

 DER.44.d: "This particular mosque had been turned into 'food storage warehouse number 32'. Not a particularly well maintained warehouse either, for a German bomber had brought down the northern wall near the minaret and little had been done to fix it. The so-called communist government of men had little patience for relic of a more pious era.\n\nNow the sacred house of the worshippers had been restored, as had every other mosque of Kyzil Orda. Dozens of former soldier, bureaucrats and party drones are crawling to the restored mosque to pray for forgiveness. Their penitence is carefully monitored by the brigadiers.\n\nThe removal of communism is a slow process, and everyday more collaborators were condemned by the people's tribunals for justice. While the top ring of leaders was universally slated for Allah's justice, clemency for small time employees of the regime could be found relatively easily. And the first step on the path to redemption is a proper demonstration of repentance to Allah the ever forgiving.\n\nThe assembled men mumbled prayers with conviction. Many had never learned how to pray, or forgotten the sacred words in years of communist servitude. But the only thing that mattered was their attendance. In time the most inspired words in creation, found in the holy Quran would bring salvation to these poor unfortunate. The brigadiers were not the jailers to the Kyzil Ordan people, but liberators. In time all would be brothers and sisters in faith in a restored Kazakhstan."

 DER.45.t: "Trials For Their Leaders"
 DER.45.d: "Silence in the court!' The judge ordered. Hecklers and fanatics had been increasingly difficult to control as the trial of the communist party higher ups had proceeded. Any spectator had to be frisked for hidden firearms by brigadiers standing watch outside. Grand Mufti Zabelkin had been explicit in a recent fatwa that interfering with the trial would be a grave sin.\n\nThe accused were often the well read type, and many of the defendants served as their own lawyers. The proceedings had been surprisingly civil, with plenty of time given for counter examination of defense and prosecution witnesses. Perhaps these communist party leaders and generals appreciated the chance of a fair trial where they were free to defend themselves. But the burden of proof against the accused was overwhelming. The communist state's tendency to document everything made it easy for prosecution lawyers to retrieve written evidence. Orders closing down mosques, cracking down on the faithful. Military strategies planning the invasion and destruction of Kostanay held land. The tribunal's case rested on the communist state's goal of military occupation of all of Kazakhstan as well as its goal of eradicating Islam throughout Kazakhstan. The defendants had successfully extirpated themselves from the first accusation by swaying the jury. They had only been trying to defend their government in a fragmented Kazakhstan, after all. However the evidence for crimes against the Muslim community was impossible to refute.\n\nMost of the higher ups had refused to recant their communism, swearing that they had worked for the good of Kazakhstan and mankind. In their final statement, they reminded the jury about their efforts in the West Russian War to remove the evil of Germany from Russian and Kazakh land. Observing the trial and its verdict, Zabelkin could not help but admire theses infidels' courage. The fading reds only asked for the honor of execution by firing squad."

Mosques desecrated as 'shamans' and mystics burn Islamic holy texts in great bonfires to the demon Tengrii. Russian Christians and Kazakh Muslims being forced to convert at gunpoint.\n\nEven more tragic than the reappearance of long dead idolatry is the rumor of how the Russian population of Aktau has been disappearing into work camps. The industrial works of Aktau have been woken up, and are allegedly staffed by desperate Russian kept barely alive as they extract the wealth of the earth to fuel Aktau's war machine.\n\nAll this, driven by one man's insanity. The tyrant Gaziz has gone off the deep end, somehow accusing the Russians of perpetuating the bombing campaign on Kazakhstan. It is difficult to tell how many of his subjects believe this, for the Blueshirts 'disappear' anyone that criticizes the government openly.\n\nThe anti-bandit brigade's generals have long considered an invasion of the evil germanophilic pagan kingdom, but other threats and easy pickings have lowered Gaziz's monstrosity on the priority list. Now that Kazakhstan is almost unified, the brigadiers surround the black monstrosity of Kazakhstan and prepare to drive a stake through its heart.

But Azat and his brothers had lived for some time up in Russia where trees were more common, and they had picked up the craft to make a living. None of the brothers had expected they'd make use of those old skills again so far south.\n\nSmashing, breaking, splitting, repurposing, reorienting, the brothers disassembled the shrines of Aktau.\n\nThe furious brigadiers had at first torched any shrine and grove they found. But out here on the steppe, why waste good building material? The team of brothers worked hard, and in a day or two the sacrilegious devil worship locations were turned into neatly arranged piles of construction material. Thankful brigadiers paid the brothers, and got to work building mosques to replace them. It was good money, and it felt good to help dismantle the Aktau regime one tree at a time. In time, the little family had grown to include local refugees, happy to help the brother restore islam to the land for a little money.\n\nAt the end of another long work days, the employees began storing tools, stashing away gear and cooking dinner. Azat didn't know how many more days of work they'd find repurposing the shrines, but in these troubled times he was glad his family was eating well."

A bearded man was crouching next to one of the men, gently whispering something in Kazakh. Yuri closed his eyes again.\n\nHe had hated becoming a skeleton, a shell of a man. Hated becoming a compliant slave. What else could he have done? Those with stronger wills had died long before him. The only way out was to comply with order and hope for salvation.\n\nWhen he came to again, the man was crouching next to him. The bearded stranger whispered words of encouragement as he dripped water onto Yuri's lip from a pitcher. Once Yuri was done drinking, the man patiently fed him spoonful of food. The former slave would have wept if he still had energy.\n\nAs time went on, Yuri could drag himself away from his dreamless sleep longer and longer. When awake, he started chatting with the other recovering men. One, that spoke better Kazakh, explained that they had been liberated by the anti-bandit brigade, an Islamic organization based in Kostanay. Yuri did not know much about Islam, or Kostanay, but he knew the men that had saved him and nursed him back to health were good folks.

And throughout the hell of the Kazakh anarchy and the terror of Gazizov's regime, Yuri had never seen it fit to prostate himself to any supernatural authority. But a new Kazakhstan was rising, one that saw not a man's race, but his devotion to God and to fellow citizens.\n\nMany questions remained in Yuri's heart. Why would an ever merciful Allah allow the devastation Yuri had seen all his life? And why would Allah's servant kill or exile all those that refused conversion or taxation? The former slave did not know what to make of this new land where mercy and charity cohabited with ostracism and fanaticism. All he knew was that the divine had inspired the brigadiers throughout all this.\n\nYuri had a personal debt to his saviors, and he would endeavor all his life to help others and to bring together all those he met in one single community of faith. Perhaps Allah had tested him throughout so many years of horror; if so, Yuri would test the all of the Mighty's followers for the rest of his life. If God and men willed it, a new Kazakhstan of love and prosperity could be built. Yuri would do his best to play his part in all this."

 DER.55.d: "Finally, we are one. The bandit prince, the Kazakh nationalists, the red army, the decadent liberals, and even the Catholic exiles, they are all but memories of the past, and across Kazakhstan, the anti-bandit brigades stand alone and victorious. The Grand Mufti held a mass prayer in Kostanay city, and thousands across Kazakhstan joined him in celebration of our great victory against the heathen, traitor, and bandit. Following another prayer, Zabelkin declared a public holiday and a national day of celebration for all. Festivities quickly sprang up across the city, and his message quickly spread across all of Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan, however, is still damaged. It is still scarred by the decades of conflict, banditry, and decadence. Its people have not forgotten all of their sufferings, its infrastructure is still damaged, and ruins have done to its beautiful landscape what a plague does to a face. The steppe is no less harsh a home than before, and if Kazakhstan wishes to survive in this new world, then it must recover from the pain of the divine test that has been our history.\n\nBut that is not the only shadow that haunts the mind of Zabelkin. The future is quite unclear for Kazakhstan. While our enemies are defeated, banditry is no more, and all of Kazakhstan has been brought the fruits of Islam, the role of Kazakhstan on the international stage, the future of the brigades, and the role of the government in the lives of the Kazakh people all remain all too unclear.\n\nHowever, these questions are for another time. Until then, we celebrate!"

 ### Focus Descriptions ###
 DER_the_rains_of_fire_desc: "Every day the servants of Iblis descend from heavens on the peaceful earth of Kazakhstan to bring with themselves flame and havoc to all the faithful Kazakh kin, forcing them to hide in caves and remote buildings and abandon their duties. All across Kostanay workshops are shattered to pieces, farmlands are fading from dormancy and houses are lying in ruins. As long as the German beast continues to torture our lands with fire, we can't fulfill our governmental duties without putting the lives of many servants of God at risk and thus our only remaining duty is to save the people from suffering and prepare ourselves for future challenges, when the beast finally falls asleep."
 DER_the_brigades_reports_desc: "Across Kazakhstan, bandits roam. Every centimetre of this country is infested with banditry, and God has given Grand Mufti Zabelkin the holy duty of guiding Kazakhstan towards cleaning the infestation. A report put together by a division of scouts has detailed various bandit organisations that have carved out empires for themselves across the steppe. Each shall be dealt with in time, God willing. Notable amongst these warlords is a self-proclaimed Khan by the name of Abu. The Khan's men raid indiscriminately across the steppe, pillaging everything that looks even the tiny bit valuable. It is important for Grand Mufti Zabelkin to fully read and understand this report on our enemies, if he is to guide us in God's name against them."
 DER_the_caches_desc: "Under Kostanay's dunes sleeps a stock of weapons and valuables, hiding from the forces of the German Devil, waiting for the day that God's people need them once again. For some of those caches, that day will be soon. Their stock has become necessary. Threats to Islam circle Kostanay like vultures, and the need for arms to fight for the faith becomes greater and greater by the day. As our desperation grows, we must turn back to these caches buried so long ago.\n\nFaithful soldiers cloaked by the night shall venture into most barren wastes where not even the Shaytan dare travel, let alone German jets. Old weapons, supplies, and equipment from the decadent Soviet regime from long ago lie beneath the sands. Our forces shall dig into the dunes, take what is needed, and cast back what is not. We can only pray that God will guide us to the arms we so dearly need in this trying time."
 DER_we_ride_once_more_desc: "The pretender Khan and his horde occupy a large chunk of Kazakhstan, but the exact details of our unofficial border with them are largely unknown. Considering that at some point in the near future our brigades will descend upon the Khanate, this gap in our knowledge must be rectified.\n\nScouting details shall be sent towards the border under cover of night to determine the nature of its terrain and determining the most defensible locations. This information will be key in the creation of a future invasion plan, as well as determining where the Khan's forces are most likely to attack from. If any of the Khan's forces pass within vision of the patrols, determining their structure will be a top priority."
 DER_watchtowers_to_the_east_desc: "If there is one thing that the damned bandits fear more than God's righteous anger, it's running out of easy preys. At the moment, the bandit state to our east looks at our territories and salivate at the prospect of villages unspoiled by rival bandits bands. We must diminish their depraved appetite.\n\nBy building watchtowers on our eastern border we can detect any incursion into our territory, and dispatch our brigades to rout them from our land. By building guard stations along the border we shorten the time needed to react to incursions. Taken together these two methods will reinforce our role as protector of the Kazakh steppes and deserts."
 DER_in_the_court_of_the_bandit_king_desc: "Like the great opponent of all that is good, the khan of bandit to our east makes promises and entices men. Even if his promises are naught but illusions, crowds of men join his court and seek plunder and glory in battle. This assortment of fools and brutes might prove a great opportunity, for the khan pays little attention to coming and goings of his court. By sending one or two of our men we could gain great intelligence on his bandits and on his next moves.\n\nTo establish our man's reputation, we will help him lead a small band to crush a bandit group on our eastern frontier. Flush with martial triumph, and with a little tribute for the Khan, our spy will establish himself in the Khan's court. "
 DER_secure_the_furthest_villages_desc: "All men are equal before the exalted Lord, and it is our sacred duty to safeguard all men from the bandit menace. Small and remote villages by their very definition are the most vulnerable to the scourge of bandits, and thus their continued safety is crucial to our mission.\n\nIt is true that defending everyone risks leaving our brigades spread thin, and unable to effectively deter bandits. But several strategies can help us shoulder this task better. Monitoring crucial routes into our heartland for bandit activity helps to stop any raiding party. Established water and supply points can be guarded to deprive any bandit group of ressources. And a system of travel passes can help monitor who uses our road. All these will make it harder to reach isolated villages. And once a month, remote patrol can circle to the most remote villages and make sure everything is well."
 DER_send_a_message_desc: "This so-called "Khan" and his legions of faithless bandits beat against the dignity of Kostanay, like a boot stomping on a face. The bandits continue to grow in wealth and strength, and we have done little to persuade them to stop their vile, vicious advances. We receive more and more news of faithful Kazakhs terrorised, and yet we have said nothing. What good is an "anti-bandit brigade" if it does not send a clear warning to all bandits around it?\n\nGrand Mufti Zabelkin has decided that a message shall be sent to the Khan and his men, in the only language that these savages would understand. While we have no delusions that it will stop them entirely, the message will surely make them dearly consider their future actions against Muslims across all of Kazakhstan. The message will put fear of God into even the Khan's faith-arid heart. The message is simple. The head of a bandit duke, impaled upon a spike."
 DER_to_the_most_remote_steppe_desc: "It is one thing to make sure that remote villages are not bothered by bandits. It is another to make sure they'll forever remain safe.\n\nWe've begun sending our soldiers to remote village to recuperate when off-duty. This increases the military presence throughout our backcountry, and allows villagers easy acess to military knowledge. In collaboration with local imams, reserve units of the anti-bandit brigades are being trained in every community. The objective is to eventually ensure that the adult population of every village is trained and equipped enough to repel every bandit group. Of course, the moral supervisions of imams and our veterans will ensure that the isolated villagers do not in turn resort to banditry. The endgoal is to prevent the villagers from being victim, instead of turning them into more brigands. Better integrating remote communities into our trade routes will also help return the situation to normalcy."
 DER_we_will_never_bow_desc: "By Allah, the untrammeled evil of man casts its shadow over all Kazakhstan. The horror of the German bombings have only been made worse by the speed at which Kazakhs and Russians have turned upon one another. Instead of working together to create the food and shelter that man depends on, groups of bandits began to fight for the last embers of a once great brotherhood of man.\n\nAs the anti-bandit brigade gathers strength, never shall it be allowed to turn on the people it defends. Our soldiers would rather go hungry than take food from the innocent. All of its supplies will remain paid for, or donated by free citizens.\n\nThe brigade will also never cut deals with bandits, as death is preferrable to dishonorable surrender. The people of Kazakhstan will see us crush the enemies of Allah, or die trying!"
 DER_expanding_the_brigades_desc: "As news about the success of the anti-bandit brigades spread throughout Kostanay and beyond, new men have asked to join our sacred Jihad. The prospect of a well-fed position and of fighting for the greater good against the bandit scum has lured many men to our recruiting offices.\n\nTo ensure integration of these new recruits, a strict training regimen is imposed to weed out anyone looking for an easy life. This is combined with religious and military training. Recruits, especially converts, are not expected to be able to recite the sacred Quran in a month. They are, however, expected to demonstrate good morals and a continued motivation to eliminate bandits and other enemies of the Ummah in Kostanay."
 DER_the_matter_of_the_discipline_desc: "As the anti-bandit brigades grow, we are experiencing some growing pains. It seems some trouble makers are not as dedicated to our cause as would be desirable. Shamefully, rumours of an extortion ring ran by rogue brigadiers have reached the ears of Grand Mufti Zabelkin.\n\nPunishment will, of course, be severe. Not as severe as the eternal damnation that Allah will visit on these black hearted rogues, but man's justice is mere appetizer to Allah's court.\n\nThis initial round of beatings and executions will sober any brigadier tempted by the easy life, as we prepare new measures to improve the men's morals."
 DER_imam_in_their_ranks_desc: "In spite of all their exercise, shooting practice, and training, Kostanay's soldiers are completely defenseless. Not from a physical force, for they shall do quite well in their fight against banditry. Rather, their spirits are defenseless, as is very common in soldiers, and this allowed them to be wrapped up in all manners of adultery and sin. This cannot be allowed to continue if we are to truly represent God's will.\n\nAll of the Brigade's divisions shall have special imams attached to them in order to ensure their spiritual safety and protection. Not only will the imams be able to protect the spirits of the soldiers, they will be able to guide prayer, in order to ensure that the troops of the anti-bandit brigade (and thus, the representatives of God) receive only the best spiritual teachings."
 DER_arm_them_all_desc: "The Russian and Kazakh anarchies have rendered guns as precious as food and shelter. Old surplus from the soviet or imperial days, boomsticks made in sheds, devices of uncertain origins... We must make sure each and every one of our sacred brothers in the struggle are well armed.\n\nGood quality equipment stolen from the German infidels or bought from Zlatoust traders in the far north can be given to our squad leaders, while the unreliable stuff can be cycled to reserve divisions or brigadiers in training. As more and more villages join our effort, our gun production will in time increase enough to outfit everyone with modern arms! "
 DER_popular_weapon_contributions_desc: "Islam encourages all believers to give Zakat, roughly one fortieth of their income to, amongst others, the poor, the needy, the slaves and those that fight in the cause of Allah.\n\nFortunately, our holy anti-bandit brigades fall in this last category. While we would never force our brothers and sisters to give their money, some of the Zakat has been sent our way. These voluntary donations are beginning to prove quite useful to buy arms and supplies for our warriors. In turn, it becomes easier to defend increasingly prosperous communities that funnel more money our way for our holy struggle.\n\nWhile this revenue can never become our main income, the contribution of the community helps us make a stand against the bandits. Allah is merciful! "
 DER_our_soldiers_gods_warriors_desc: "Our soldiers have grown from an ad-hoc militia to a true band of fire forged Ghazis. Unlike so many militias before, our men have not crushed bandit gangs only to take their place. The anti-bandit brigades remain incorruptible protectors of the people and servitors of Allah.\n\nBy letting people from all over Kostanay join the brigades and work together, the cycle of mistrust between communities is coming to an end. Where once many raided neighboring villages, or fought on endless blood feud, a greater sense of purpose unite our people. This sense of purpose runs through the noble anti-bandit brigades."
 DER_a_trial_by_fire_desc: "The bandits are previsible, like any scavenger of the wastes. The beasts of Kokshetau gather on their side of our eastern border in well known staging point, and then proceed to raid onto our land. Once their raids are completed, the intruders return over the border to their staging points. Any attempt to pursue them is broken by the defences of their fortresses. In complete safety, the bandits sell and trade all that they've captured, and then rest until the next wave of raids.\n\nBreaking these staging points to deny them supplies for their men and horses is absolutely crucial. Equally important is the extermination of all that grow fat through trade with the bandits. By penetrating deeply into their border, and attacking their border communities from unexpected angles we put to the sword those who live by tormenting the innocent. Any prisoner that repents will be escorted to Kostanay to live in peace, for Allah is great and merciful."
 DER_no_more_terrorists_desc: "A holy light shall soon fall upon Kostanay. The good Muslims of Kazakhstan will soon no longer risk losing their families and earthly belongings to devilish bandits. The brigades has been trained, armed, fed, grown, disciplined, and made painfully aware of God's will. No expense has been spared, no cost dodged, and no corner cut. With discipline as the hammer, faith as the fire, and Kazakhstan's deadly wilds as the anvil, the anti-bandit brigades have been turned into a sword of unrivaled sharpness, a sword that Grand Mufti Zabelkin shall wield in a glorious charge against banditry. The unholy infestation shall be excised from our land, the first step in a grand campaign for the good of all Kazakhs."
 DER_reason_to_reflect_desc: "Even since his conversion to the true Faith, Zabelkin never stopped to doubt himself. Of course, this is not a sign of his weakness of indecisiveness, but of strength and humility, as it is obvious that no men can claim that they are infallible and free of any sin. While Zabelkin tries to serve His will scrupulously, he has been always questioned his actions he took both as a ruler and as a servant of God. Does he truly follow God, or he covertly tries to serve his own selfish purposes, only hiding it behind the name of God? Is he a God-fearing and benevolent ruler for Muslims, the one that they deserve, or he is actually a cruel and unfeeling tyrant? Are the hardships Kostanay currently faces challenges sent by God to test his followers, or those are punishments brought upon Zabelkin for his unjust rule? To answer his painful questions, Zabelkin decided to turn not to mere mortals for the needed answers, but to God himself. To seek guidance and forgiveness from the Creator, he will go to the most beautiful mosque for his continuous praying."
 DER_our_judgement_ends_desc: "Our prayers have been answered. For decades, the western infidels have bombed Kostanay into dust. Those dark days are no longer. For the first day in the unending years of terror, the sky has been free of German planes, and silence and darkness have fallen where once only noise and fire did. We have passed God's test, and it has made us strong. Finally, God's chosen are free. Free to build what would once have been reduced to rubble, and dig up what we once were forced to hide. Free to save the Kazakh people from banditry and decadence. Free to spread His will. All of that, all of the glory, it shall be soon. But we are not the only ones liberated from the terror of Germans. So were the bandits and the communists, the decadent capitalists, the invasive Polish, and the rest of the warlord ilk. We must act on our new opportunity soon, for the Faith relies on it."
 DER_uncovering_the_caches_desc: "The bombings have finally ended, and that means that we can finally dig up the majority of the desert caches. We must recover their contents as quickly as possible, before bandits and proto-bandits are able to get to them. The contents of the caches are diverse, but all will prove incredibly useful in our fight against banditry. Heaps of guns, piles of jewels, tonnes of canned food, stacks of literature (both traditional and holy) sleep under Kazakhstan's dunes. At last they will be able to serve Kazakhstan, and aid the brigades in the destruction of banditry.\n\nThe locations of the caches shall be mapped out and given to only the most trusted and skilled scouts, in order to avoid potential theft and minimise the risk of the caches falling victim to banditry. The scouts will be sent into the desert at night, shall dig up their targeted cache, and return it and its contents to the brigade for a valuable pay. Finally, our old possessions shall be returned."
 DER_guns_and_books_desc: "Kazakhstan's culture is rich, and like many other valuables, several major Kazakh cultural artifacts were re-discovered when the caches were recently re-opened. Perhaps just as valuable were the countless copies of the Holy Quran and other sacred texts that were unearthed. At last, these important texts and artifacts can be put to use. The average Kazakh's understanding of his or her own culture and faith is worryingly lacking, and finally this can be remedied. Museums and schools shall both be equipped with these new books, and people can finally experience the education on the history and faith that they deserve.\n\nProviding this knowledge will have many benefits to the brigades. The return of the artifacts will be a large propaganda victory, and will massively increase our public approval. The return of the holy texts may increase literacy and education, which will provide significant bonuses to our society. Recruitment may even go up, as many more will understand the historical importance of Islam to Kazakh society, and will be able to more easily understand why the word of Muhammad is worth fighting for."
 DER_the_broken_roads_desc: "The paths which connected villages and cities across our territory were burned by the fire of the German shaytans and were left without needed maintenance, subsequently becoming a little more than a collection of rubble by the time we left our shelters as the German bombings came to an end. At the same time as the lives of God's subjects are becoming more calm and industrious, they need the paved routes repaired and restored for travels between corners of our republic for their working duties and for the enjoyments of life given us by the Lord. For what they ask, they will receive. We will give our engineers everything needed to bring those roads back in order."
 DER_preparing_the_militias_desc: "'And prepare against them whatever you can of power and of war-horses, to frighten thereby the enemy the enemy of Allah'\n\nAs the holy Quran exhorts all believers to prepare themselves for conflict with Allah's enemy, so our brigades have sprung into action! Since the days of the Prophet, praise be upon him, war-horses and sword have been augmented by a range of vehicles and fire arms. Everything must be gathered and prepared for the coming struggle. If we are to win, we must go on the offensive against the enemies of all that is good.\n\nAcross our borders, bandits and tyrants alike seek to extinguish the flame of hope and righteousness that burns in Kostanay. But our leader, grand Mufti Zabelkin is not worried. Allah is al-Muhaymin, the Protector."
 DER_a_surge_of_recruits_desc: "Now that the bombings have ended, more and more travel the roads toward Kostanay. Devoted Muslims and new converts alike, our sacred mission has reached many throughout Kazakhstan and even beyond.\n\nFor some it is the appeal of a safe land where one is left free to tend to their community. For others, the light of Allah draws them to our sacred cause. It does not matter what their origin is, for Allah is the Friend, the All-Compassionate, the Protector. What matters is their devotion! What matters is how much they are willing to sacrifice to defend the innocent! What matters is how hard they'll fight to make Kazakhstan safe from bandits and madmen. These new brothers will help us on our quest, praise be to Allah! "
 DER_our_chance_for_vengeance_desc: "All across the corpse of the Soviet Union, petty tyrants and madmen have carved out empires of misery, where the blood of the innocent has rusted the swords of countless bandits. All this pain under the watchful eye of the German infidels\n\nBut Allah is merciful! Now the german lands are roiled by war and terror, and the faithful of Kazakhstan have an opportunity to be free from the folly of wicked men.\n\nWhat stands in our way? Bandits, grown fat from the innocents they have butchered? Servants of Iblis, men that seduce and deceive the faithful? Truely, the opponents of Allah are feeble! We must fight our sacred jihad to avenge all those who have injured our people. It is time, my brothers! "
 DER_restoring_the_mosques_desc: "Almost always among the most impressive building of any town or village, mosques have not been spared the infidel's bombing. Some minarets have been left standing to aid the accursed flying shayatin find the location of Kazakh settlements. But the remaining mosques have been turned to dust and scattered to the steppe's harsh wind.\n\nMosques are the holy sites where every Muslim brother gathers for the five daily prayer, of course. But they also serve as important meeting places in a community, and as a place to teach new generations the words of the holy Prophet, peace be upon him. By repairing every mosque and holy site we can find we shall help every Kazakh find a place to worship Allah."
 DER_the_communitys_center_desc: "All across our land the faithful have been reunited with their houses of worship!\n\nAs the network of mosques, imams and clerics spread, the faithful have joined their local mosques to organise secular and religious education as well as organise charity drives. By tapping into these wonderful projects, we can help develop our civilian administration. Every child shall learn to read, and every pauper shall have enough to eat! The prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, set out to build a community of the faithful. In his blessed exemple we shall do likewise with all Kazakh!"
 DER_charity_for_the_suffering_desc: "The bombings turned many of us into animals; scared preys in hiding from the outside world and mistrustful of strangers. With the end of the bombing we have been granted a wonderful chance to begin the healing process, for Allah is ever merciful.\n\nAlmost every mosque has begun a regional program to find shelter for those rendered homeless by the bombing campaigns. Food relief is organized for those that have been robbed of everything. Little by little, our subjects begin to see strangers not as potential threats, but as brothers that deserve help and compassion. Lead by our holy men, the long process of healing has begun."
 DER_jihad_desc: "Jihad is a word from arabic, and refers to a struggle. All Muslim faithful must of course struggle to better conform with Allah's guidance. But perhaps most important of all is the armed Jihad against those that threaten the Ummah, the Islamic community. For how can a man be left to try to improve his worship of Allah if brutes and bandits threaten his life?\n\nAll around us are bandits, infidels and dangerous fanatics of devious ideologies. Grand Mufti Zabelkin has forged the sacred anti-bandit brigade for the coming struggle. All bandits must either repent or be put to the sword. And the warlords that have caused the division of Kazakhstan and the oppression of the faithful must be exterminated.\n\nThey might think us stupid zealots, but we are no fool! The brigradiers ready for war. They study strategems and they plan their future offensives. They ready their rifles and horses for the coming war. We are the sword of Allah, and our ennemies shall tremble! "
 DER_light_the_beacons_desc: "Of all the warlords that surround us, the Mad Khan and his bandit horde in Kokshetau are the most despicable. Allah exhorts all faithful to fight for the oppressed among men, women and children.\n\nFor month we have prepared. All across the border, beacons have been lit to signal that the liberation is at an hand. Brigadiers man their position, rifles at hand. Imam lead soldiers in prayers as officers finalize their planning.\n\nAgainst us, a mob of cowards, used to killing innocents and to debauchery. We do not know if these fools fear us yet, but we are certain that they should fear Allah's displeasure. For the Lord is possessor of vast mercy; but His punishment cannot be reppeled from the people who are criminals."
 DER_men_for_the_militia_desc: "Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of false deities. What could be more idolatrous than the worship of gold and easy living, tainted by the blood of innocents?\n\nIn ever greater number, civilians join our anti-bandit brigades to fight back against their bandit opressors. By helping these men join our brigade, we strengthen our ties with the people. The coming showdown against Kokshetau and the other warlords must see our population unite behind Grand Mufti Zabelkin and follow the divine will of Allah."
 DER_civilian_support_desc: "Those who cannot fight support those that do. Civilians organize food supply lines, trade with the outside world for ammunition, repair old factories. Widows mend uniforms for our soldiers, while tribes from the steppe sacrifice part of their herd to supply our warriors with proteins. Children still too young to fight study diligently, in the hope of joining the anti-bandit brigade some day.\n\nFrom the youngest babe to the oldest grand-mother, everyone has lost someone or something to the scourge of brigands. A wave of righteous anger is being canalized into the coming offensive against the bandit state of Kokshetau.\n\nIndeed, the criminals are in error and madness, and Allah's children share his fury at the wicked."
 DER_never_another_bandit_raid_desc: " 'O Prophet! urge the believers to war; if there are twenty patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a hundred of you they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand.'\n\nThe time has come. Our invasion of Kokshetau has begun! The righteous shall triumph over the wicked, and the innocent shall forever be safe from banditry!"
 DER_execute_the_khan_desc: "The Khan and his horde have shattered before the might of the Faith and the brigades. The bandit tyrant's claws have been clipped, and the largest source of banditry across the steppe is without his followers. There are only two things remaining, in order to ensure that the heathen Khan can never menace Islam again. The bandit king shall be captured, and the bandit king shall be put to death. A new era of faith and peace shall soon fall upon Kostanay, and with it, all Kazakhstan."
 DER_convert_the_people_desc: "It is perhaps understandable that those under the reign of the mad Khan often became lapsed muslims. Some could not reconcile their life of debauchery with islamic principles. Others were scattered from their village and found themselves without mosque or spiritual guidance. Many simply grew up without meeting any imam, ignorant of the sacred duties of all Kazakhs.\n\nThe process of conversion has begun in Kokshetau. The highest priority for conversion. are any of the Khan's soldiers that have been captured in battle. Afterwards come men of fighting age, and then the remaining civilians. It is a long process, one that may not be completed for years. But Allah smiles upon our efforts to bring light back to these troubled lands."
 DER_purifying_the_nation_desc: "The disintegration of the Khan's army has seen his grip over often squabbling underling shattered. Many of his former commanders have set out to form great bandit outfits on their own, confident in their ability to resist our rule. Other former commanders have simply retired to a peaceful country life, confident that their hoard of stolen treasure will let them live comfortably in retirement.\n\nIt is crucial that we find all bandit leaders, both underling of the Khan and independent leaders. Making them answer for their crime is both a moral and religious imperative, as well as an important step in asserting our control of Kokshetau. While of course no one can escape Allah's judgement, spreading our own reputation for never letting an enemy escape trial will serve well on our great Jihad.\n\nOur justice shall be absolute! "
 DER_strangling_the_red_giant_desc: "In Kazakhstan's south east the red giant slumbers. But of late, the communist army has opened at least one eye to gauge the progress of its rivals for Kazakhstan.\n\nThe godless, tyrannical Soviet Union was the enemy of believers everywhere. And with its veteran soldiers and control of tank divisions, the Kyzil Orda is an enemy we cannot afford to fight at the moment. Thanks to Allah's eternal mercy, the communists are content to let their rivals exhaust themselves while their own sluggish red government tries to stay afloat. By crushing all other bandits and tyrants in the region, we shall free as many Kazakh as possible. In time, we shall have built a great coalition of the faithful to banish the evil Djinn of Marxism forever from the Kazakh steppe!"
 DER_the_soulless_pragmatists_desc: "Today Grand Mufti Zabelkin has led the commanders of the anti-bandit brigade for friday prayer. In his sermon, the holy man has decried the soulless pragmatist of Aktobe as one of the greatest threat to the Kazakh Ummah. The Aktobe Junta and its 'National Renewal' proposes the kind of ruthless utilitarianism that all good Muslims should oppose. Unshackled by the laws of man or Allah, their technocrats impose a totalitarian order on all its citizens that leave them as nothing more than shambling automatons.\n\nThe rise of these industrious devils threatens the muslim faithfuls, and Chairman Onoprienko's goal of subjugating Kazakhstan leaves explicit its intention of enslaving all of Kostanay. Our leader Zabelkin has thus emitted a fatwa encouraging all muslim warrior to seek Aktobe's liberation."
 DER_the_spanner_in_the_works_desc: "Not all in Aktobe have been deceived by the Junta's materialist Shaytan. Some remain faithful to Allah, and hopeful of liberation from their totalitarian ordeal.\n\nHoly men have been smuggled in the country, and are planning a wave of industrial sabotage and strikes to cripple the regime. These imams cover themselves in glory, for surely the unbelievers' retribution will be savage. But crippling Aktobe's industries is crucial to the success of our coming Jihad against them. We leave our comrades in Allah's mercy!"
 DER_smash_the_machine_desc: "Lord! How great is the folly of man! The fanatics followers of the National Renewal idolatry have diligently turned themselves into automata for the imagined betterment of Kazakhstan. Killing them is unlike a mercy killing; it is more akin to disabling a dangerous machine to protect our brothers in Aktobe. Kazakhstan must be saved from this metal grey terror!\n\nOur veterans on the border have launched their invasion of Aktobe. They fight for Allah, and their victories or defeat thus cover them in eternal glory! Forward, men!"
 DER_end_this_blasphemy_desc: "Little by little, life returns to the former prisoner of National Renewal idolatry. Men and women join Mosques under the watchful eyes of patrolling brigadiers. Children are taught right from wrong, and by the day more and more renounce their indoctrination.\n\nUnlike previously liberated areas, the great evil of our defeated opponents was ideological, and thus many liberated brothers and sister struggle to reintegrate humanity. But Allah gives us tasks not because they are easy, but because they're important to Kazakhstan's salvation. We must keep eradicating the National Renewal cult."
 DER_the_godless_liberals_desc: "In a "democratic" city of Pavlodar, immorality and godlessness reign. A cast of atheist intellectuals believe themselves to be the champions of liberty and welfare for the people, but their liberty merely means liberty from responsibility for blasphemy and lust. They renounce the covenants of God to let the most depraved sinners walk on the earth and allow the moneylenders to flout and impoverish the simple Muslim folk, all in the name of 'liberating' hand of ruinous capitalism. They tell lies to themselves that they are better than other warlords, but like the Communists in Kyzyl Orda and bandits in Kokshetau, they deprive the faithful people of the only path of salvation and lead them to the road of hell.\n\nIn a manner of the atheist kingdom of Bukharin, the sinful republic of Pavlodar will too fall under the burden of its decadence and the warriors of God will prevail over their cowardly and disbelieving clan."
 DER_militarize_the_border_desc: "As much the liberals of Pavlodar became used to laxity and as they vainly hope to avoid fights with other warlords in their desire in finding a common language even with the most unprincipled bandits, it would be prematurely to expect them to not stand in defense of their immoral ways of life. Since their arrival, they have rallied around themselves large numbers of armed men and a few of Red Army veterans who fanatically believe in Pavlodar's flawed ideals.\n\nEven if we can expect them to be no match for our blessed and disciplined force, we will not allow them to take an inch of our land should we falter once. A system of fortifications will be laid in the East to the border with Pavlodar so they will not dare to take aggressive steps against us without fear of stumbling upon the impenetrable fortress of faith."
 DER_destroy_decadence_desc: "The immoral scholars of Pavlodar sit idly on their thrones of corruption and believe that if they believe themselves to be morally above the Lord himself, they remain invulnerable to any enemy intrusion. They could not be more gravely mistaken. In their aspiration to become the spiritual guide for the whole Kazakh people, replacing His word with their own godless cult of perverted liberty, they became too self-confident in their power and allowed themselves to stay careless in the face of incoming threats, hoping that all other combatants in Kazakhstan will cut each other's throats and eventually will come to them and recognize their pharisaical wisdom. The very idea that they will be fighting with the warriors of Allah on their soil seemed to them unlikely and even reprehensible. Yet, our warriors never forgot about their forthcoming duty to bring punishment to the same people who allowed lust and irresponsibility to spread and save the souls of Pavlodar from the rotten fruits of their falsely preached "freedom". The time has come for us to bring the Divine retribution upon the lying prophets and cleanse Pavlodar from sin. To arms, my brothers!"
 DER_back_into_the_light_desc: "The drums of war have gone silent in Pavlodar. The last remnants of liberal forces have either died to no avail against the Brigades or realized the futileness of their struggle. All the leaders of wicked scholars are now sitting in the dungeons, awaiting their final retribution. Those scholars preached the false and godless teachings and encouraged decadence among their subjects, but are their sins truly equal to those of the most brutal bandits and warlords? For all their wrongdoings, they never allowed the Muslim people to be dishonored on a whim of cruel generals and sincerely regarded the well-being of Pavlodar people to be their true responsibility, even if they only could lead their flock to the wrong path in their rejection of the message of the Creator. Their crime in the face of God is undeniable, but the question is whether can we spare the liberals from the most gruesome fate and grant them the last chance for redemption for their past sins and acknowledging the Divine law, allowing them to serve the Islamic Republic with a sense of duty before God and the Muslim community once they truly realize their mistakes."
 DER_against_communism_desc: "No act of God or Man alike could bring more misery onto the Kazakh people than communism has. Since the hour the Tsars were toppled, slaves to Marxist idols had been spreading their plague into Central Asia. Only death, havoc, and fear followed the red stains from Moscow. And still, it was not enough for the Soviets. Not only did they rape our women, steal our land, and kill our children, they tried to deprive us of our faith in God! Branding religion counterrevolutionary, our faith was forced to be banned in our own land!\n\nEven as the Germans destroyed any drove the Reds out of Russia, the Soviets are still not satisfied. Even now, in the former shell of the Kazakh SSR, we are oppressed in our own lands. As we recover from the German bombings and heal our wounds, we hear His call louder than ever. Soon, the Soviets will feel the wrath of the almighty God. Their forces are strong and formidable, but our faith is stronger. Through God, all things possible."
 DER_show_no_mercy_desc: "It is time. We've surrounded the soviet snake, and now our troops stand on the Kyzil Orda border.\n\nThis will be our greatest fight yet, for Momyshuly's soldiers are twice veterans against the German devils, and have maintained order throughout the entire anarchy. The red devils have dreamed for decades of bringing back the sinful soviet subjugation of all of Kazakhstan. They will not stop until every single one of their armored behemoth are destroyed by the faithful. But we do not fear them, for Allah smiles upon us. The devil has engrossed the reds, and so has caused them to forget remembrance of Allah. Kyzil Orda is the devil's party. Lo! is it not the devil's party who will be the losers?"
 DER_secure_their_industry_desc: "The red devils have been stalwart maintainer of soviet infrastructure, if nothing else. Their factories must be secured and given back to the Ummah. Tools can be forged to rebuild our communities, and weapons can be created in great amount to preserve the faithful's kingdom on earth.\n\nThe communist bureaucracy hindering proper use of the factory, however, can be let go. The vast apparatus maintaining the Kyzil Orda's planned economy must be broken. The men formerly employed in the red's security organization must be put on trial. Any possibility of re-establishing the communist system must be ground to dust and scattered to the four winds."
 DER_cast_down_the_hammer_desc: "The communist's main 'thinker' Karl Marx derided religion as the Opium of the people. Yet the same accusation can much more easily be made at his cult of the material world and resulting state atheism. Marxism and communism shackle man to his material condition, and attempts to soothe the pain of amputated spirituality with mere baubles and trinkets. All those who refuse to abandon communism for Islam and the holy prophet's words must be put to the sword, for they threaten the long term safety and stability of the Ummah. The cult of communism must die."
 DER_bleed_the_red_out_desc: "The Red Army's grim defence of the Kyzil Orda saw a great deal of war crimes commited by men desperately trying to stem the tide. This has added to the tally of horrors commited in the name of the Soviet Union. The purges, the massacres during the civil war, the oppression of the faithful during the Bukharin dictatorship...\n\nA great trial has been established in our capital, where the crimes of the communist regimes are put on display for all to see. Of course, we are not animals or brutes. Kazakhstan's graveyards are filled with the victims of communism, and their piles of bureaucracy have left countless proofs of their supression of Islam. All those proved guilty will be executed, for Allah is the great judge!"

And rumors come to us that the mad man blames the Russian for the German infidel's bombing campaign.\n\nOur holy warriors have come a long way. Conflict has sharpened them, and loss has steeled their hearts. We must impose on them a new fight, to secure the Kazakh ummah once and for all. The sky demon worshippers from Aktau must not be allowed to spread their poison to our lands!"

The despot Gazizov is obsessed with Kazakhstan past, and seeks to damn Kazakhstan's future through his emulation of the German infidels. Islam is relentlessly persecuted as his fanatatical blueshirts revive the idols of Kazakhstan's past, evil spirits that were dispelled when the glory of Islam reached Kazakhstan. And in the depth of his nation, from the heart of his abyss come terrible rumors of what has happened to any Russian capture by the mad warlord...\n\nAktau is an abomination, and the horrors that dwell within it must be destroyed, for Allah is al-Qahhar, the Absolute Vanquisher!

These are either evil spirits beholden to Iblis, or false gods meant to lead good Muslim astray. Once an area's shrines are destroyed, a proper mosque can be built to help freed citizen rediscover their Muslim roots.\n\nBeyond the spiritual life, there are also many secular servant of the evil Gazizov that must be accounted for.

As it turns out, many such camp exist throughout Aktau's former dominions. We must hurry to liberate every camp and bring emergency medical aid to all its inmate.

Their brethren have joined our communities as farmers, as engineers, as doctors, as Imams.\n\nIn their hubris the blueshirts devils thought the Kazakh a race above the Russians, and thus treated them as slaves and servants. Glory to Allah for freeing his Russian childs! In the territory we now control the Russians are treated as any other subject. They are given the chance to accept the holy writ, just as every other Kazakh we've met. Charitable organizations across our provinces have poured in love, money and support to help welcome the former slaves in the community of the faithful. From now on, every Russian that has accepted the self-evident truth of Islam is free to become a productive member of society. Those that are at least Christians and pay the Jizya have likewise been freed from their bondages. The others are to be put out of their misery. "

All they want is to preserve their new homeland from intruders and survive in the harsh lands of Kazakhstan. By their peaceful behavior, they demonstrated that they can redeem themselves and be accepted into our community if they acknowledge the sovereignty of one God.\n\nWe can offer them our protection from foreign invaders and marauders, but only if they agree to accept the laws of the Prophet and pay a jizya as long as their communities wish to stick to their erroneous beliefs.

The acceptance of the true faith and the Islamic sovereignty with the Polish people breaks one of the few barriers between our nations. If our purpose is to unite the Muslim community of Kazakhstan under one banner and protect it from the predatory grin of the infidels, it is necessary to translate promises of protection for New Poland into actions and to provide a peaceful unification of Poles and Kazakhs for their common benefit. Of course, this also depends on the wishes of Poland herself..."

They took our benevolence as a sign of cowardice and will only continue to refuse our noble offer unless we show our zealous attitude and our willingness to fight for the cause of our Faith when God demands it. As such, we have only one warning left for Poland. Either they agree to submit to the will of Allah or perish under the onslaught of His troops."

For us, coexistence with ungodly states was never a compromisable issue and Poland is no exception.
