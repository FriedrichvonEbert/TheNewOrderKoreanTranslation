 ALG_Ferhat_Abbas: "Ferhat Abbas"
 POLITICS_FERHAT_ABBAS_DESC: "For 20 years, Ferhat Abbas had fought for the right to be French. Fighting for more equity, the abrogation of the worse abuse from French laws and the ever present racism of the "Européens", yet not for the end of the French presence in Algeria, he seemed like one of those new "assmilated" Algerian, that could work hand in hand with the French to create a new "French Algeria".\n\nYet, history choose another course: the lack of political will for reform, the fall of the French Republic during the second World War and the Nazi gripe created an agitation in Algeria, that led to bigger and bigger revolt, culminating in full scale massacres in the Constantinois in 1947. There, Abbas saw his brothers and sisters slaughtered by unhinged European militias, supported by French State military units.\n\nWith the ever-increasing repression, Abbas realized that his dream of an Algeria with both european and Algerian working together had irremediabely died and that his modest activism would put a target on him for the european fury to take aim, and emigrated to the friendlier Tunisia where he joined the political wing of the FLN, and fight with his own means towards independance.\n\nA figurehead able to mediate beetween the disparate wings and increasingly irreconicliable egos of the FLN/ALN, he will have plenty of work ahead to both win the war.... and save the peace."
