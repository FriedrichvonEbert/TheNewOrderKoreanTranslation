 japdlc.1.d:0 "Sun Dianying was relieved after Jessfield 76 had let him go some days prior. He made a note to himself to stay out of the way of secret police in the future, especially now that he would soon be retiring. Still, he had been released and relieved of the burden of their suspicions, at least in an official capacity. It was not as if further interrogations would yield anything more, they had nothing on him and it would continue that way. As he sat by the window, smoking a cheap cigarette, he wondered if any of his colleagues would also be interrogated. Still, the matter was over for him and thus not worth troubling himself too much with.\n\nIt therefore came as a great surprise to General Sun, after opening the door to his apartment, to be greeted by the sight of three officers of the Kenpeitai and a particularly nervous translator. Without as much as a feigned gesture of respect for military rank, he was grabbed and handcuffed by two of the Kenpeitai agents, while the third read off a number of charges they had brought against him.\n\nOld General Sun Dianying was hurriedly shoved into the back of a featureless truck, while the Chinese translator did his best to relay the news to him. While Sun was sure they had nothing on him, just like with Jessfield 76, he couldn't help but feel like he would be taken in for rather longer this time.\n\nIt didn't take long for the Chinese authorities to notice Sun's arrest and disappearance into the bowels of the Kenpeitai's local department. Most troubling though, was the lack of any explanation for the actions of the Japanese agents, who had simply descended upon the old general's quiet apartment complex, without as much as a phone call to any authority in China. A demand for transparency was in order, and it would be coming straight from the General Staff of the ROC. To see their colleague treated in such a manner was a striking insult and regardless of what overruling authority the Kenpeitai might have within the Sphere, they had a dangerous line which could not go ignored."

 japdlc.2.d:0 "Not wishing to waste any more time, while the Kenpeitai continued to violate not only a significant number of laws and treaties but also the dignity of the Chinese army, the ROC General Staff gathered in the early morning to force the issue to a swift conclusion.\n\nAs they sat around an office made hazy by a mixture of cigarette smoke after some hours of discussion, it was decided that a telegram would be sent straight to the very top, to the Prime Minister of Japan. The general staff would demand an answer to two questions relating to General Sun's capture. Firstly, why had the Kenpeitai decided to overrule the thorough and sound interrogation conducted by Jessfield 76? Secondly, why had they decided to abduct the general without as much as a word to the proper authorities, most importantly the ROC General Staff itself? The telegram concluded with a request that should any wrongdoing be discovered, that the generals be allowed to deal with it.\n\nThe message was then quickly dispatched after being marked as distinctly urgent. Most of the general staff elected to wait for a response, rather than retire to bed and risk finding that the situation had grown ever more appalling. When a reply from the prime minister did not arrive after several hours, the general staff were left with two possibilities as to what was occuring in Tokyo. Either the Japanese were still floundering for an appropriate answer to send back to them, or that the prime minister had simply decided to ignore their demands outright."

After passing through a number of security checks, the telegram itself was delivered alongside the usual selection plates, cups and other crockery. As the prime minister read through the message between sips of green tea, a look of frank confusion, followed by severe concern spread across his face.\n\nHe had of course heard of General Sun's previous arrest and subsqeuent unfruitful interrogation by Jessfield 76, leading him to believe that the man would fade away into retirement. Therefore, this news of his sudden, and most of all mysterious second arrest by the Kenpeitai was nothing short of extremely troubling. The matter was now worsened by the fact that the ROC General Staff were demanding answers and actions on the prime minister's part, and they had seemingly been aware of the issue before even himself.\n\nBreakfast ended rather quicker than usual, as the prime minister rushed off to contact the home minister. As he had no explanation as to the matter either, he demanded that it be investigated immediately. In the meantime, he would send off some vague promise of a forthcoming documentation of Sun's arrest. As the rush-job of a reply was sent back to Nanjing, the prime minister was left with the thought that the answer the Chinese General Staff was seeking would be far more complex than anticipated."

 japdlc.4.d:0 "With the prime minister attempting to keep the ROC General Staff distracted with promises of a soon to be delivered explanation of General Sun's arrest, it was now up to the home minister to formalise a report that would hopefully rectify the increasingly concerning matter.\n\nAfter some dubious reluctance on the part of the Kenpeitai stationed in Nanjing, the home minister was finally able to acquire a copy of their report. The initial sections of the documents explained that Sun had been arrested following the Kenpeitai's dissatisfaction with the previous efforts of Jessfield 76. Following paragraphs detailed the pressing urgency of acquiring proper information from the old general, with fears that the wider issues being examined by the Kenpeitai might grow out of control. The home minister found himself more confused than ever, yet there were still more documents to examine.\n\nSun, as it turned out, was only a small part of something much larger in scale. While the Japanese secret service had naturally dedicated much of their time to eradicating any traces of potential Chinese resistance from the ROC, they had in recent months began to focus on potential infiltration of the Japanese army. Sun's arrest was an attempt to find a link between the resistance and any Japanese officers that might have become compromised in some capacity.\n\nWith this revelation now in the hands of the home minister, he opted to immediately deliver his report to the prime minister in person. As expected, the prime minister was deeply concerned with the developments. There was little solace to be had in knowing that the situation in China might be truly disastrous. The prime minister could only hope that the Kenpeitai prove more forthcoming with their information in the future. As the home minister exited his office, he could only stare at the document presented before him, hoping that the characters on the paper might materialise into a solution."

The shadows got longer and longer, until beams shining through the windows created silhouettes in the ground that were outlandishly high, like beasts in a shadow puppet show. [Root.GetLeader] was tapping his foot on the ground anxiously. He had to get the call. For what must have been the fourth time in that hour, he checked the lines. They were not cut or bugged. The lines were secure, but no amount of reassurance would convince him so. The room was too dark. He did not like to see his own shadow. It loomed over him, followed him. It would never leave. He despised it for that.\n\nPulling the cord on the lamp, he read through the papers again, his hands shaking as he pulled them to the light of the lamp. From Nanjing, the 헌병대. All connected to the end of the war with China. The final moments. He remembered those days, how it all seemed so clear. These papers offered a glimpse at those times, when peace in all the world was certain. And that grim photo, sitting atop the neat stack of papers. The body was unrecognizable, crushed by Chongqing rumble and burned to a cinder.\n\nAll of the evidence was coming together in the most terrifying way. It made [Root.GetLeader] sick to his stomach.\n\nThe telephone rang. [Root.GetLeader] hesitated for a moment. His heart was beating faster than it had ever rung before, faster then when the bombs hit the enterprise or when the Germans blew up Pearl Harbor."

 japdlc.6.d:0 "As Kenpeitai reports made their way to Tokyo, it was becoming clear to the home minister just how truly bad the Chinese infiltration had become. Older reports had little actual basis in their claims of mass infiltration of the Japanese army. They spoke little of Dai Li either, instead presenting a number of theories as to which Chinese rebels were believed to still be alive and capable of directing such a plot against the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Yet as more and more information arrived at the home minister's office, mere rumours and dubious theories began to transform into genuine facts.\n\nThe name Dai Li began to appear in more and more reports, and as it did, so did the names of many Japanese officers. Some were believed to have willingly joined with Dai Li's cause, fully aware of their betrayal. Others were seemingly unaware of their crimes, having been misled by the multitude of agents that the Chinese had spread throughout the Sphere. With each moment, with each paper that was read, with each telegram from the Nanjing Kenpeitai, a conspiracy was being unveiled.\n\nAs the home minister discovered more and more about the seemingly bottomless conspiracy, the circle of those he dared to share his findings with continued to shrink. He had already begun locking away any document pertaining to Dai Li when he left his office for even a moment. He had dismissed his usual assistants too, preferring to copy each file by himself. Another safe, if tedious measure. For now, he would continue to report to the prime minister and only ever in person. If anyone else was to hear of Dai Li, it would be on Kantei's authority."

He could expect anything – outright orders, suggestions of resignation, very forceful demands of explanations or immediate concessions. Instead, the war minister heavily sighed, as he seemed to be struck as heavily by this news as him.\n\n\"I thought I could trust them, you know?\" he said. \"I really thought so.\"\n\nThe prime minister silently nodded. The general stirred up his tea, not looking the prime minister directly into his eyes.\n\n\"I just wonder how we got here. I don't actually think Dai Li is important,\" he said. \"What is important is that the army is no longer the paragon of virtue. The men in high ranks, working with such war criminals and enemies of an empire? Madness, pure madness. But it's all true.\"\n\nThe leader of Japan's civilian government sighed.\n\n\"We shall conduct an investigation immediately to find out the traitors and deliver justice.\" He promised.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" the war minister sighed. \"You know how this works. Those are my conditions.\"\n\nHalf an hour later they were already set in place. The investigation was supposed to be swift, decisive, conclude swiftly and in limited scale. The army demanded \"some sort of ability\" to influence the investigation, although the details would be discussed later. The war minister also asked for the prime minister to inform him regularly of progress. Although the conditions were downright insulting for the elected Prime Minister of Japan, he felt down in his heart that there is not much choice."

Now he entered the prime minister's office, accompanied by half a dozen other army and navy officers, to settle the matter of the investigation.\n\n\"You do understand that we will be more than willing to supervise the investigations.\" said Mutō bluntly, his finger rapping on the hardwood chair he sat in across from the prime minister.\n\n\"I do understand,\" he replied, \"but this is a matter of criminal investigation. Many of my associates are suggesting the Home Ministry lead the case. To have military supervisors in an investigation over the Imperial Army in China would likely leave many stones unturned.\"\n\nGeneral Mutō winced - even in his old age he was prone to bouts of anger, but he could not risk humiliating himself in front of the prime minister. He insisted once again that leaving the Home Ministry in charge would be nothing but a bureaucratic mess, and only hand more power \"to the meddlesome representatives in Tokyo\".\n\n\"Your Excellency, the army can acquire the records and suspects faster than it will take the Home Ministry. This is an incident outside of Japan, and it should fall under our administration, not Tokyo's.\"\n\nIt seems that a choice will need to be made as to who is the full authority on this investigation.

Now that he was in the station, he was in the hands of the military police.\n\n\"Well,\" Masahiro began, \"the villagers have sighted a figure walking through the bamboo forests, wearing a cloak made out of long leaves.\" He rustled his hands against one another. \"They say that it is a spirit of vengeance. You know, like a Chinese version of yōkai. I did not believe them, either. I don't take many walks out there in the woods - but the reports kept coming in. Soon, my office was full of villagers outright gossiping that a spirit of vengeance is coming for us all.\"\n\nThe Kenpeitai officer looked at Masahiro, noting everything that he said. \"Do you believe it, Masahiro-san? Personally?\"\n\n\"No, I don't. As I said, I don't take many walks out there in the woods. However, when I do, there is a certain chill that runs through me.\" He looked down at his fingers. \"Like someone was watching me.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" The Kenpeitai officer coughed. \"That will be all.

Sato blew puffs of his cigarette into the air above him; usually this would bother Takamura, but he was far too fevered to kick up a fuss about it. The lightbulbs illuminating the corridor buzzed into the room, only audible in the moments Takamura took a breath before continuing his fatigued reading.\n\nHis grumbles were cut short with the ring of a telephone; that very second, Takamura's eyes widened and gazed right at Satō, who was taken by surprise. Darting his eyes between his colleague and the door, Takamura reached for the ringing chime as Sato lunged over to slam it shut. He gulped; his muscles tense and skin crawling.\n\nBefore Takamura could speak, a commanding officer asked of his progress in the recent investigations. Carefully announcing the developments, he mentioned that the assisting Chinese officers had been relieved of their duties, and no progress has been made since. The commanding officer was silent, bar a few grunts; Takamura and Sato held bated breath, hearing their heartbeats in the very air that escaped their throats.\n\n\"We don't have much time left,\" the officer grumbled, followed by the hum of an unresponsive line. Takamura threw himself back into his chair and Sato wiped his sweaty brow, his round eyes fixed on the ground before him. Shaken by the threatening call, the men were left in silence, gasping for air. A few moments of prickling anxiety passed, until Sato cleared his throat and began to cough up his dry words:"

Despite massive shortages, Dai Li's leadership and fanaticism inspired his men to ferociously resist the Japanese.\n\nIn the ruins of Chongqing, the supposedly dead body of Dai Li was found, and with LPA units limiting their activity, it was thought that total victory was finally won.

The ensuing firefight was a one-sided slaughter, with only one Japanese operative dead. As Sato approached the corpse of the Order's leader, he stumbled upon several dossiers left in an unlocked safe.\n\n\"OPERATION 'AUSPICIOUS JADE' - CHENGDU INFILTRATION CONTINGENCY\"\n\nAt the foot of the folder lies the personal seal of Dai Li, as well as the Juntong's seal of approval.

It couldn't be, China has everything to lose if they break away from the Sphere now. Gao's reforms are still weak. On the other hand, Takamura has little to lose. There aren't many political consequences for expelling the Chinese - hell, Tokyo may even prefer that to risking any state secrets. On the other hand, playing their game may lead Takamura's investigation to levels previously unheard of. All in all, one question rings in Takamura's head:\n\n\"Is this risk worth it?\""

Most commonly, Juntong detachments that were caught mostly disguised themselves as traders, or Nanjing-aligned militias. In the far reaches of the Chinese countryside, it's hard to tell who's who - who's an enemy, and who's an ally. Sometimes, one can never get a proper answer."

Their journey from the airport at Nanjing to the mountains of Southwestern China had presented them with a multitude of memorable vistas as they traveled by rail, road and finally, footpath to reach their destination. It was nothing short of deeply refreshing to leave their Tokyo office for more than a day or two.\n\nThe sites themselves consisted of wrecks of about four downed American aircraft, lost during their attempted evacuation in 1944. In the ensuing twenty years since the initial investigation had closed with little to report other than the obvious, nature had distinctly managed to reclaim much of the wreckage. Nature had also begun to creep back in to one or two sites, with a wing or two sticking out of a field of crops. The site was steadily becoming steadily more disappointing, as the investigators looked on.\n\nWith the aid of the report from the previous team that had worked on the crashes, the investigators were able to confirm one thing - the previous report was absolutely correct. The planes were some of the last that had attempted to leave China, and had been caught by anti-air guns positioned to stop them. Apart from some battered ration kits, a dog tag and some other personal effigies, the search was fruitless. Worst of all was the lack of anything that led back to Dai Li, or even a hint that perhaps some Americans were still out there.\n\nThey would need to widen their search, perhaps into Tibet. Had anyone managed to escape the crash, or otherwise survive the evacuation, then they would have quickly tried to move on.

There, they had hoped to find some evidence of the route taken by SACO after leaving China. Yet, the trail was quickly found to be colder than the mountains the investigators trekked through. Locals confirmed that American soldiers had indeed traveled through their communities, but they had never stayed for long and never left a trace of their presence.\n\nThe Chinese side of the investigation proved to be equally disappointing. Despite searching the area in what could only be described as a thorough manner, the team found little more than a few scraps of metal from the crashed planes. They had sunk to the bottom of a nearby river and upon their extraction, the scraps unearthed some shards of ancient Chinese pottery. These were jokingly regarded as the real finds of the entire expedition, although the investigators were never allowed in on the joke.\n\nAfter several weeks of searching, only one more object of interest was found. A single plane. It had gone down over the Himalayas, and by examining what little that remained of it, the investigators were able to only achieve one thing.

Yet, this ultimately did little to dampen the impact of their failure. They would be forced to remain in Tokyo for a good while now, whilst the government turned towards its other assets for aid.\n\nIn the United States, the Japanese government employed a number of spies to provide them with insight as to the workings of the United States government.

Photographs were taken of the exterior and surrounding area, at every hour of the day. Eventually, blueprints of the building were discovered, providing the spies with a new level of insight. A plan was beginning to take shape. The next step would involve getting inside the archive for long enough to expand upon their limited insider knowledge. The fastest possible route from one entrance to the SACO files would be plotted and if possible, tested before the actual break-in would take place. These next few steps would be delicately executed, even with pressure from the government back in Japan.\n\nSome back in Tokyo had demanded a quicker operation, yet this course of action was ruled out.

For the brief fifteen minutes, the building was completely dark and security a little laxer as the security guard himself escorted the electrician to the fusebox. Yet that was all it took. At that time, a man in a black coat entered the building and removed exactly one document from the Chinese section of the archives, before leaving and driving off in a rather anonymous van. He would later meet with the janitor and the electrician to celebrate their successful operation.\n\nThe cargo of that van was then handed off to another agent, waiting at a nearby airfield.

A courier sent out of Shanghai was found to be carrying a package discreetly marked with the emblem of the Juntong, the intelligence service belonging to Dai Li. Interrogating the courier relieved that he had been paid a hefty sum to take the package from Shanghai to Hangzhou, where he would be again paid upon delivering the parcel to a location just outside the city. The man in question was certainly not the admiral based upon the courier's description, yet it was a solid lead nonetheless.\n\nBefore proceeding any further with their mission, the agents delivered their report to the home minister, detailing the investigator's new hypothesis regarding the admiral's current actions and whereabouts. While they were yet to confirm his exact location, the most obvious spot was now Shanghai. A large, coastal city, with a great deal of foreigners made for a good hideout for an American not looking for attention.

An invisible siege had just begun.\n\nWhile the investigating agents continued to widen their net over Shanghai, they turned their focus towards what identity Milton E. Miles might have assumed to blend into his new surroundings. As an American, the admiral would already be limited in his options. He would need to remain in districts home to many foreigners, with the financial district coming to the minds of the investigators first. Miles was likely posing as a merchant, someone recognisable to his allies, but subtle enough to avoid suspicion.\n\nThen there was the issue of whether the admiral was still in communication with the United States. There were undoubtedly other Americans working covertly in Shanghai, most of which would be working for the CIA in some direct or indirect capacity. Yet it was still too early to determine whether Miles would be among this group of his countrymen. He was a major threat to Japan first and foremost, regardless of who he counted among his allies.\n\nWith that, another round of theorizing was completed by the investigators as they sat around a dingy bar on the outskirts of Shanghai proper. It was now time to enter the admiral's hiding grounds, and root him out by whatever means necessary."

Yet, here he was in Shanghai, an Australian merchant who had sold rare herbs from the Chinese countryside to rich westerners for over twenty years. Much had been achieved, both above and under the table.\n\nBut, he would never be able to return home at this point, no matter how hard he tried. He was simply too sick, and at this point, unhooking him from the machines in the hospital would be to let the cancer take over.

At least he would have hastened its demise, perhaps more than he had anticipated.\n\nThe former trader turned his weary head towards the window. The sun was beginning to set, casting a bright orange glow over Shanghai. The trader seemed to breathe easier, and eventually the gentle hum of the fan above him lulled him into a sleep from which he did not wake.\n\nAlthough somewhat well known, the trader had remained somewhat of a mystery to his peers. He had not written a will, and had seemingly no friends or family to mourn him. However, there was a small note that he had scribbled one request upon for those who would be tasked with burying him. It was a simple enough thing to ask; to be buried in his old uniform. It had been kept in a box near to his deathbed, folded with great care and respect.

Some weeks later he had been buried up on a hill outside the city.\n\nIt was a simple, almost unmarked grave, hidden among many others of its kind. A simple, if elegantly crafted cross marked the spot. The name upon it was false, that of some persona that Admiral Milton E. Miles had created for himself. He had apparently died in the December of 1961, something that concerned the investigators greatly. The next step was crude enough, but necessary. The dead man was dug up and found to be wearing Admiral Miles' uniform. Hospital records confirmed that he had indeed been dying of cancer, and doctors were just about able to recognise his photograph, even without the beard he had grown during his time in Shanghai.\n\nThey had finally reached the trail's end. The last few interrogations yielded little more than to lead them back to that same grave, where the trail would go icy cold over and over again. The dead man could only be Admiral Miles. There was nothing to suggest he had faked his own death and nothing to suggest that the SACO files had been deliberately made inaccurate. The trail had ended. Fujiwara was left puzzled by the revelation. It provided a sense of finality, yet raised new concerns. Most of all, it cast a shadow of doubt over the entire conspiracy now that one of its key figures had in fact been dead for some time now. Progress had been made, but now was certainly not the time to rest easy."

 japdlc.300.d:0 "For thousands of Japanese troops the name of the mysterious individual responsible for their suffering and death was not known. Many Chinese patriots died to assassins employed by him, not realising the mastermind behind it.\n\nAfter the Northern Expedition, to the Japanese, Dai Li was just one of many almost anonymous officials. The true nature of the monster was revealed only later. Thousands dead, loyal allies gone, and every carefully planned offensive hit by the leaks - all possible thanks to spymaster of the accursed Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Chongqing the infamous 'Himmler of China' was believed to be dead. Now, when he is revealed, many questions of old return with even more tremendous force. Who is this man? What does he believe? What are his goals? Who are people that follow him?"

 japdlc.301.t:0 "How to Cheat Death?"
 japdlc.301.d:0 "The investigators were stupefied at the task ahead of them. Dai Li was alive, and planning resistance in China. And the only reason anyone was aware of this was a policeman noticed that the charred corpse was too short. Who knows what other information must have been passed over? The most powerful men in Japan wanted answers now, and so the vetted agents went to work.\n\nDay and night investigators pored through every footnote they had on his organization. During 1944, there were at least 100,000 other Juntong agents throughout China, and probably twice as many military or political men who could have followed the man out of Chongqing. A network of that many people would need to be whittled down if any evidence was to lead to more than a hunt for a senile ex-spy. Decrypted lists from the war detailed hundreds of NRA cells and caches. Fortunately for the archivists, there was plenty of records from the IJA of which holdouts had been found and eliminated.\n\nAfter days of searching, it became clear that Dai Li had plenty of ways to get out of Chongqing, and with other anti-Japanese leaders declared missing."
 japdlc.301.a:0 "A truly cunning and worthy opponent indeed."
 japdlc.302.t:0 "Dai Li's Hideout?"
 japdlc.302.d:0 "The map of China lain before the investigators was riddled with hastily drawn slashes and circles. More detailed maps of nearby provinces were filled with the same markings, parts of them sticking out from the main map before them. Villages where high-level Juntong agents lived, suspected locations in rural China, even the great cities of the coast were probable areas for Dai Li to remain unseen. But their superior had come in with excellent news.\n\n\"It's impossible that the Americans would still be supplying Dai Li,\" a chief investigator bristled to his staff; \"there is no way that there could be any amount of supplies transferred without our knowledge to fuel any sort of unrest. No, Dai Li is gathering strength without the Americans, but he still has other conspirators in his ranks.\"\n\nThe other investigators listened intently as their lieutenant briefed them on new revelations. A separate task force had found connections to Admiral Miles, a U.S. naval officer and well-known friend of Dai Li in Shanghai. It could be safely assumed, he said, that China's most wanted man could be hiding in or around the port city."
 japdlc.302.a:0 "A Shanghai correlation? It narrows down our investigation."
 japdlc.303.t:0 "Dai Li's Motive?"
 japdlc.303.d:0 "For all the research and investigations the committee had done, there was one question that had been put to the side for more pressing matters of finding Dai Li: what was his plan? Why was he still fighting a war decades gone past?\n\nThe committee vetted much of Japan's top criminal psychologists to help piece together the mind of a terrorist. The investigators were clear though, that even the slightest mention of their existence to the Japanese public would be met with the utmost repercussions on their entire careers at best.\n\nAround a conference table in one of many buildings the investigators occupied, the dozen or so men and women who made up Japan's greatest psychologists could only come to a few conclusions. Some said Dai Li was simply driven insane by the war, others suspected he could be planning an attempt to sabotage the army, or even an overthrow of the Chinese government. Other psychologists suggested countless other motives, though these were reasons for a thug to rob a home, not the driving force for a national conspiracy.\n\nAfter some more hours of debate, the conclusive statement is that of a currently unknown motive. As insane or vengeful as any fanatical holdout may be, China is not susceptible to any sort of uprising to turn them against the Japanese Empire. The investigators sigh in frustration. Dai Li's master plan cannot be predicted."

 japdlc.304.d:0 "The skies were choked up by smoke and rubble no matter how far away they were from the carnage. In a hill close by the city, the three men could do little but observe, in silent horror, as a metropolis of millions was pillaged no differently than the Mongols would have centuries before. The old temples and forts were shattered, and the lush parks and gardens had been burnt to cinders. It did not feel like an act of man, but the wrath of a higher power.\n\nLieutenant-General Dai Li turned to his two comrades before breaking the silence they had kept since they arrived. To his right stood Li Kenong. A longtime opponent since the generalissimo began to purge the communists from his clique, now one of the only men he could trust. Aside from them was American, Admiral Miles, silently mouthing a prayer at the sight of unimaginable devastation.\n\nDai Li thought back to the millennia old tales of the Three Kingdoms, of three noble and cunning leaders meeting to become blood brothers. Yet great princes with honor would have had no answer for a foe which could bring death on land, air, and sea. Their peach garden was reduced to ash.\n\nAnd as Chongqing burned, the three men made an oath that this would not be the end. Japan would answer for what they did in Chongqing and dozens of other cities.\n\n\"We will fight,\" Dai Li said, \"We will never give up this burden, until Japan burns like this garden.\" With that, the three men descended from the hillside, bound together as the leaders of a war that would not end until Japan was brought down and vanquished."

Even when having to cover one of China's most populated regions, it was progress.\n\nRecently a man had been brought into questioning - a former Juntong agent had been identified. For now he continues to have no idea of Dai Li's current plans, but he was able to reveal the complex message system the chief of intelligence used to gather and send information. Dai Li's immense network of message relays and agents was open to the investigators. It would be a mess to go through, but this was a solid lead. More and more Kenpeitai agents and investigators were assigned to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces by the day, given constant updates on breakthroughs in unraveling the Juntong's structure. The mood in offices became one of triumph, not stress or frustration. The 'Himmler of China' and his dangerous associates had nowhere to hide."

The body would have to be checked to fully authenticate their discovery, but it was already agreed upon by everyone present that it was Admiral Miles.\n\n\"The man's been dead for almost ten damn years,\" an investigator snarled over the phone, \"We have investigators and local police closing off the graveyard to do more analysis, but this is a man dead for ten years!\" On the end of the line, his coworker in a Tokyo office attempted to calm him down, but he refused. \"Tell me why the hell one of our three biggest suspects has turned out to be dead. The army finally realized Dai Li isn't dead, and now we find out Miles is. Doesn't this seem a-\"\n\nThe phone hung up. Cursing, the investigator went back down the streets to the graveyard. The Shanghai cops might not have cared when he was alive, but they were doing a better job keeping people away once they had actual superiors.

Yet now that he knew the truth, that he had been leading his entire ministry on a ghost hunt, he felt even more disturbed. There was no time to dwell on the matter, not when the prime minister needed to be informed as well.\n\nThe office of his superior was lit only by the setting sun as the home minister entered, casting beams of pinkish light across the floor and right-hand wall. The home minister gave his best bow and approached the desk. \"Sir, I have finally received the reports from my agents, they bring news of a great... but deeply troubling development that we could not have anticipated.\" [ROOT.GetLeader] pored over the documents, while his minister could not help but watch the look of concern and spread over his face.\n\nFinally, the prime minister raised his head from the mass of papers. \"But this suggests... that Dai Li's return was little more than a byproduct of Kenpeitai mismanagement. You cannot mean to tell me that we have been led astray by panic alone?\" The home minister seemed to struggle with bringing forth the necessary words before finally speaking. \"I-... I am afraid so, sir. Our every investigative path leads us either to a dead end or back to the initial report. The rumour of Dai Li infiltrating the army simply falls apart when one examines the situation more closely. This has been a ploy to keep us distracted.\"\n\nIt was the prime minister's turn to be without the capabilities of speech. He instead turned towards the window with his mouth covered by a hand, watching as the sun disappeared over the horizon. The room fell into darkness. \"I need you to find more proof of this disaster, raid every Kenpeitai office if you must. This matter needs to die.\" As he spoke, the prime minister did not turn from the window.\n\nThe home minister stood up from his seat, bowed and exited the room.

 japdlc.308.d:0 "The prime minister's order to raid the Kenpeitai had been taken to heart by the home minister. Not wanting to waste any more time, lest the Kenpeitai discovered that they were compromised, he had contacted the navy. Nanjing was the heart of the military police's power - except for around the ports, they could be found patrolling the streets in equal frequency to the IJA. To crack open their headquarters, the navy would have to provide the manpower.\n\nBelow decks on an IJN warship, a unit of the Special Naval Landing Force prepared to storm the streets leading up the Kenpeitai compound. Surprise was their biggest advantage, as there was no reason to believe the military police had any idea of their presence or impending strike. Their orders were simple: open a path to the heart of the compound and seize any documents housed within. Resistance was to be met with force.\n\nThree boats departed from a warship under the cover darkness, each one filled to capacity with marines of the SNLF. Upon entering the Nanjing port, the marines climbed up onto the docks and headed deeper into the city. The unit then split in two and readied themselves to pincer the compound.\n\nThe lone guard at the back gate of Kenpeitai HQ was quietly dispatched. A rifle stock which emerged from the shadows connected with his jaw, knocking him to the ground. Meanwhile, a similar scene took place at the side door, where the guard was startled by the marines, before he too was knocked unconscious. With everyone in position, the raid began. Doors at both the back and side of the building were kicked open as dozens of SNLF troops swarmed in. Within thirty seconds, most of the ground floor had been taken without as much as a shot having been fired. Only the military police near the armory and barracks put up much of a fight, although overwhelming gunfire from all sides eventually dislodged them. The building was filled with the sounds of marines rushing towards the upper floors. The race was now on to find the Kenpeitai's archive before any of them had the bright idea to burn it all to the ground."

 japdlc.309.d:0 "From the open windows of the abandoned farmhouse that Dai Li called a field base, came a terrible hacking cough. This was followed by the crashing of glass and the toppling of furniture. To the Juntong soldiers who called Dai Li a commander, this was all part of the nightly routine. At the end of the day, he would seclude himself in his farmhouse, drink until he could no longer stand and then fall into an inebriated stupor. His men cared not, they in fact appreciated the calm after the drunken storm. Silence meant that they could rest and avoid Dai Li's cruel gaze. Even so, the coughing was particularly vile that night. When it was suggested that someone should check on him, the idea was immediately shot down. Disturbing his 'sleep' was deeply unwise and it usually ended in someone being beaten to the ground. The Juntong would simply have to sleep through the tortuous noise.\n\nThe morning usually began with Dai Li viciously waking everyone by whatever means he felt necessary. Yet this morning, Dai Li was nowhere to be found. The decision was made to now finally check on him. Inside the farmhouse, the Juntong found the corpse of their commander. The open eyes and mouth, pallid skin and bloody phlegm on his shirt was enough to confirm it then and there. For about a minute, no one dared to even move. Not one among them had considered what to do once the bastard actually died. Some had even thought he was going to outlive them all. The silence was then broken by a suggestion everyone found agreeable.\n\n\"We take the body to the woods, bury it and leave.\"\n\nThe body was carried to a clearing deep in the woods and buried in an unmarked grave quickly. No one stayed at the spot for long. Once they had all returned to the farmhouse, the former Juntong exchanged looks and departed. Some wished to return home, most simply wanted a home to return to.

While the commander of the SNLF unit trudged through the blood-strewn and bullet-ridden corridor, he quickly noticed that the door to the archive was firmly locked.\n\n\"Someone go get me a key off one the bodies, now.\"\n\nA moment later, a key was placed in the commander's hand. He wasted no time in unlocking the door. Fearing that he might still have arrived too late, the sight of untouched shelves and cabinets was a relief.\n\n\"Search this place now, get going!\"\n\nAs the marines headed into the archive to begin their search, the commander's attention was quickly drawn to a small unmarked box that had been placed on a desk. Inside was a single unmarked file.\n\n\"According to every verifiable source at our disposal, it would appear that Dai Li has been dead since the late 1950s. The exact cause of his death is not entirely understood, but it can be concluded that alcoholism and general poor health were the contributing factors. Despite the descriptions of events given by some of Dai Li's closet followers, a burial location has not been located either. We are also now aware that Dai Li's followers did not attempt to continue operations following his death. We can therefore assume that the Juntong is no longer a threat to the empire in any capacity.\"\n\nAs soon as he was done reading, he turned to his second in command who was waiting by the door.\n\n\"Take this dossier to Tokyo.

For those watching, the imperial seal appeared on the screen, which was quickly followed by a blaring rendition of the national anthem, which also played on the radio transmission. After a few moments, both the seal and the anthem faded away, into a recording from the office of the home minister.\n\n\"Citizens of the Empire of Japan, a great conspiracy has been uncovered on this day. The Kenpeitai, empowered to enforce peace and stability across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, have been uncovered as traitors and turncoats. For several months, they engaged in a scheme to sow chaos and disorder throughout Asia, in hopes of toppling the emperor's government. Rumours of long-dead Chinese rebels and terrorists were spread to deliberately mislead and demoralize the government and armed forces of the empire. However, due to the swift investigation of these falsehoods, they were dispelled and traced to their source. The Kenpeitai have been pacified, their compounds and offices stormed by the loyal troops of the empire. Their plot, and their very organisation is no more. These traitors will be treated as what they are, enemies of state and to kokutai. Let the fates that await be a reminder of the strength and security of the empire.\"\n\nAs the home minister finished his message, the national anthem was played again and the imperial seal was again displayed.

The Japanese investigators were hesitant of their Chinese comrade's findings, but remained eager to see the final results of the audit.\n\nThe head of the joint Sino-Japanese group entered, holding a pile of papers; the summation of their work in tracking down the Juntong. He distributed copies across the table, and the room was silent, but for the flipping of paper and breathing.\n\nAuditing revealed that the Juntong, Dai Li's powerful intelligence agency, is likely not in a direct command structure. Rather, it appears that the Juntong has become decentralized; as small cells dot all of China with little cross communication. A single hunt might bring in just half a dozen agents with no direct superiors.

The committee members looked in fascination at the findings in the report. Dai Li's intelligence network had a hub.\n\nBeyond the authority of Nanjing, in Sichuan Province, the underground remnants of the Chinese Nationalist spy network took their orders from Dai Li himself. If the Juntong were headquartered there, action had to be taken immediately before Dai Li flees further beyond Japan's reach.

After removing the Chinese investigators, they had been able to determine a number of Juntong cells operating in China. And among their leaders was Milton Miles, an American admiral also confirmed to be alive in China, no doubt helping the Juntong however he could.\n\nInvestigator Tadano Nishi, while in discussion with his fellow agents, laid out a brilliant theory as to Admiral Miles' current situation.\n\n\"Since both Dai Li and Admiral Miles are still alive,\" he began, \"there is no doubt these two men are working together. However, we have not received many letters confirming this connection.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't mean they aren't working together. What if the two are purposeful in sending out such outdated and minute information? I've been poring through the letters available and I've noticed a few interesting patterned symbols. I've noticed only twelve of these symbols ever being used.\"\n\n\"It has to be the Chinese calendar!\" Nishi suggested, and the others nodded along in agreement. \"It's a long chance, but I think it might work. And if it does, each and every one of us will be written in the records of history as the codebreakers that saved the empire.\"\n\nFor days the encryption strategy of the Chinese calendar yielded nothing but swathes of hidden information, more than they had acquired in months. Nishi, a young and aspiring officer, may have just opened the door to ending this titanic conspiracy. It was clearer than ever that if Milton Miles was alive, he was operating in a Shanghai cell.

But the letters all were sent to a specific neighborhood, deep in the heart of Shanghai.\n\nAccording to members of the investigation and the Kenpeitai, the underbelly of Shanghai would serve as a likely hideout for Dai Li and other conspirators to vanish in. The sprawling harbor districts were notorious for hosting many illicit figures, and a vagabond rebel like Dai Li could hide among the Triad - no policeman would question it if he came out with his knees intact, and a small stack of bills.\n\nWith our suspect's range shrunk to the limits of the city, we can probably catch the two before they get wind and flee from Shanghai.

The best code breaking machines in our arsenal seem to find no pattern in the piles of messages delivered daily. It is near impossible any partisan could create an unbreakable code without help.\n\nSome are pointing the finger at Admiral Miles, who probably gets codes created by American computers across the Pacific, and gives them to Dai Li and any other Juntong groups in China.

He felt his blood seethe as this lone technician raved about the Kenpeitai. It couldn't be true. He was a madman, driven to lunacy in order to justify his lack of progress. He stood up and left the room, gathering Mr. Isuzu's files with him. Before he closed the heavy door, he remarked, with the thought beginning to gnaw at his mind, that maybe this seemingly crazed man had an inkling of truth to his theory."

While their aid in bringing the matter to the attention of the home minister was a significant sign of loyalty and trust, some of the investigating officers wondered if the Kenpeitai's newfound silence was a cause of concern. It might have been possible that Dai Li had infiltrated their lower ranks too, in order to remain one step ahead of his adversaries.\n\nDespite their well-meaning and ultimately friendly request to examine the Kenpeitai for signs of conspirator infiltration, the investigators were told to stand down by the military upon each attempt they made. Even the home minister received a sign of the military's scrutiny, in the form of a letter, encouraging him to \"focus his attention on the actual investigation\". Not wanting to be seemingly pacified by these idle demands to both himself and his investigators, the home minister began to consider what he could do to break through the military blockade. There were still many within the army and navy who he could count as allies. Some even owed him favors going years back. The minister had a few phone calls to make and even a couple of letters to write.\n\nWithin a few days, the investigators were finally granted access to sections of the army and navy's records, particularly regarding finance. It was, at the very least, a decent starting point. In order to investigate the Kenpeitai themselves, they would need to discover the reasons for the military's stubbornness. Hopefully, they would crack without too much resistance."

They had chosen to begin their investigation at the lowest levels, among the recently promoted junior officers. Among these enthusiastic and oftentimes fanatical army men, there was little sign infiltration or serious corruption. Apart from the odd case of a disciplinary issue, which was better handled by the army anyway, the investigators came across nothing of any note to cause them concern.\n\nMoving up the chain of command yielded some more resistance and overall reluctant on the part of the 'cooperating' officers. Questions were still answered and files were still promptly delivered to the investigating agents, yet it was clear from the looks on the faces of the interviewees that they were starting to perhaps provoke a sense of discomfort.\n\nA couple of days later, the home minister received a sharp, yet polite letter from the minister of war. Behind a genial tone, the war minister produced a detailed summary of the actions of the investigating agents. He made a point to highlight the significant number of issues he had found with their conduct. As such, the war minister felt it necessary to inform their superior of this issue and that it would best of all involved if he could ensure that their \"over-eagerness to protect the nation\" might be dialled back greatly.\n\nBy \"dialled back greatly\", the war minister was in truth asking for the investigation of the army to come to an end, or at the very least become a mere reenactment of a security check. The army was not afraid to apply pressure when need be, it seemed. The home minister was in truth not obliged to obey the request of his fellow minister, even with the potential consequences looming in low. There was no need to turn back now, he thought."

They were met with stern and almost defiant glances as they went about their work. Files arrived on time and interviews were carried out, always together with those seemingly ubiquitous looks of anger. Yet the agents were still able to carry out their task, albeit with an uncomfortable aura around them at all times. The investigation swept through a number of low level sections of the army and in seemingly very little time. The daunting and dangerous upper levels were next.\n\nFortunately for them, there would be a number of assets, courtesy of the home minister, to aid them. A number of 'aligned' army personnel would make sure the operation ran smoothly. If one soldier refused to deliver a document, it would soon enough be delivered by a superior officer. Interviews went by without too much difficulty, as a word or two from the home minister kept the army mostly in check. It was enough to make the officers know that cooperation would lead to a hastened promotion and not a hastened retirement. All in all, the assistance of the home minister was more than enough to aid his investigation.\n\nAmong the plethora of unusual and suspicious documents collected by the investigating agents, a selection of financial records stood out the most. The first detail of note, was that they concerned a number of Kenpeitai officers. The second detail was that these officers had become obscenely wealthy over the course of only a few weeks. Money had seeming been poured into the welfare of these military police officers, yet at no point did the record state why this had been authorised.\n\nA new series of interviews, all approved with great reluctance, by the minister of war, were conducted. Some of the soldiers had heard rumours of fortunes materialising for certain officers among the Kenpeitai. What these rumours hadn't told them anything of a source for the yen, the soldiers had come to an agreed hypothesis. It was simple enough - the Kenpeitai was now in the business of accepting particularly large bribes."

Their interrogations of the junior officers seemed to yield little of much interest. Documents and files produced similar results. Deciding that they were clearly being given only a fraction of what was actually available for them to read, the agents set about demanding direct access to the navy archives.\n\nIt did not take long for the war minister to take note of what was happening. His response to what seemed to him like a severe transgression was to dispatch a letter to the home minister. It arrived just as he was about to sit down for dinner. The letter was short, written with a considerably more genial tone than the home minister was used to the war minister using. The intent revealed that more usual tone.\n\nThe war minister had written to express his concern that the investigation into Dai Li was focusing its attention in the wrong places. Not only was this a serious worry for the Ministry of War, but the manner in which the investigation was being carried out seemed to bother them as well. While deeply polite in its prose, the letter ended with a warning:\n\n\"We fear that should your agents continue along their current course, they may perhaps cause more trouble then they are worth\"\n\nThe home minister, by now used to such hints or threats, decided that this was just a sign that he was looking in the right direction.

The navy, ever reluctant to submit to interrogations and to hand over their files, had still provided the investigating agents with enough information to reach a conclusion. It was certainly a disappointing end to another few weeks of hard work for them.\n\nThey had examined financial, recruitment and diplomatic records for tracers of anything incriminating, and turned up empty handed. Interviews provided little else of use to the investigation. Even a number of ships were searched; cargo was opened and checked and some boats were even partially dismantled to check for hidden compartments or storage areas. Nothing beyond the official records was ever found. It would never be quite possible to tell exactly what the navy was doing, for there was certainly a number of secrets that they would rather die than let slip, but they were not harbouring the pawns of Dai Li.\n\nWhile the lack of proper results was never a positive, the home minister was at least relieved to be able to check the navy off the list. The amusing thought of holding any and all meetings relevant to the Dai Li situation on navy ships from this point crossed his mind before he regained focus. There were other paths for the investigation to pursue. He hoped that they would be resolved as easily as the navy had been.\n\nSome had suggested that attempting to clear the army of suspicion would be a wise choice. It was in many ways quite dangerous to let either branch of the military operate without being cleared of suspicions, especially if Dai Li had turned so many officers into his puppets. Yet examining the military had certain... political complications too, just as with the navy.\n\nAs the home minister began to retire for the night, his head was filled with the choices he would once again have to make. It was never an easy choice, seemingly growing more difficult as the options narrowed. Failure seemed like a dangerously palpable possibility as this point. It would be another long night for the home minister."

The officers being questioned would either jump around answering the agents, or produce absurdly long answers that never seemed to quite reach any sort of true meaning. The investigators met great difficulty in even getting the army to provide them with officers willing to be questioned. If they ever agreed to be interrogated, they would arrive late or only comply with meeting the agents at particularly late or early hours.\n\nNot even physical evidence could be relied upon at this point. The army was surprisingly happy to honour the request made by the investigators to see a number of files relating to their finances, recruitment and interactions with other sections of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If the files were not suddenly lost in transit across the bureaucratic web, then they ended up being severely damaged in transit. The few files that did arrive in decent condition turned out to be the wrong documents and were sent back, never to be heard of again.\n\nThe investigators back to the home minister did not paint a picture of a particularly functional work environment for his agents. Despite it all, some scant progress had been made, mostly by rearranging ripped, or possibly shredded, papers. This had been part of what he had anticipated the army's initial response to be. There was still much work to be done, and yet at the same time, the pressure was becoming a serious problem. The home minister could either continue his investigation, or cut his losses and try another route. Neither option seemed particularly pleasant to him as he considered the possibilities to come."

Fortunately for the investigation, that was where the trail of money led them. The Kenpeitai official's suddenly discovered fortunes had not been sent directly to their bank accounts. Instead, the money had gone towards their close relations, whether that be their girlfriends, wives, parents or siblings.\n\nThe interviews with these relatives went well. Some coaxing was initially required, as many of them felt anxious about their money possibly being taken away from them. Their fears were eventually quelled with the realisation of the investigators' actual interest. Among those questioned, the universal story was that of a charitable donation having been made to them due to their Kenpeitai family member. The benefactor was always anonymous, at least to the recipients of their money.\n\nTheories raged as to just where the money could be coming from. Naturally, there were many ideas tossed about beyond the money merely coming from Dai Li, or an associate of his. Some suggested interference from powerful business groups, perhaps a keiretsu trying to utilise members of the Kenpeitai against their competitors. Possible American involvement was the idea that intrigued the investigators most. They wouldn't put it past the CIA to attempt to corrupt part of the military police into leaking valuable information or to overlook one or two spies.\n\nHypotheses aside, there was still much work to do to verify any one of them. The reports of mysterious sums of yen appearing out of thin air were certainly not good signs, no matter who the cash originally belonged to in the first place. The paper trail was there, the agents needed only to locate it."

In order to see the job done at twice the pace, the home minister had arranged for reinforcements to be sent to the investigation sites belonging to the navy.\n\nThe navy was ready too. After realising that the agents would not back down from their tasks, they had realised that a new strategy would need to be employed. The navy would seek to delay and tamper with the investigation as much as possible. With the discreet blessing of both the admiralty and the Ministry of War, the navy was fully prepared to hinder the agents of the home minister as much as they could.\n\nOn the very surface, little seemed to change for the investigation. The navy, still ever hostile in tone, did in fact agree to comply with whatever the agents required. Beneath the surface, however, there was a distinctly different environment awaiting them as they searched for clues. Ships due to be searched were suddenly sent out on assignment. Files were mysteriously transferred between archives for indefinite amounts of time. If they survived this endless journey, the documents would either be severely damaged or occasionally and miraculously arrive as intended.\n\nThe investigation ground to a sickening halt. In terms of viable leads, the agents where now dealing with the crumbs of breadcrumbs. It was uncertain if they would be able to garner much of anything from what little they had at this point. The home minister was naturally displeased with the development, as he had hoped the navy would back down. Yet again he would have to consider whether the secrets of the navy were truly worth the trouble - perhaps he could strike out against them in his own way to counter their efforts."

The army had tried to handicap them at every possible turn, but enough information slipped through grasp for the agents to make observations. From the home minister's perspective, it seemed as if his hardline perseverance would pay off in the long run. It might harm his already shaky relations with the Ministry of War, but that was simply part of the political day-to-day. Soon enough the investigation would be completed, and the war minister would be of no concern.\n\nA letter from that very man changed the home minister's outlook in a flash. In contrast to the war minister's previous letters, this one entirely lacked the calm and cordial tone that he had previously employed. There would be no pretense of friendship this time.\n\n\"Should you continue this ridiculous stunt of yours, then I will be forced to enact drastic measures that you and the rest of your colleagues cannot recover from\". A sense of impending defeat washed over the home minister as he continued to read.\n\n\"You must surely know that I have allies in the Diet that would be more than happy to see the prime minister removed from office. If you know that, then you must also be aware of the fact that I possess the means of making their ambitions possible. Put a stop to your investigation and return to your senses immediately.\"\n\nThat was not a challenge. It was a loaded pistol pointed right at the head of the home minister.

Perhaps there would be other opportunities."

Loose lips in the Ministry of War provided him with a rather peculiar fact: A number of Kenpeitai officers were on their way to Shanghai. Not only this, but orders supposedly from a Dai Li agent had just been intercepted outside the city. It was simply too big of a coincidence for the investigation to pass up on.\n\nWith a sense of direction restored, the investigating agents rushed to their new target. The investigation would look towards local officials for possible leads. A large enough bribe or a serious enough threat made all but the most stubborn of them comply with the investigation. Piece by piece, the trail reformd once again, all of the Kenpeitai agents had booked into the Astor House Hotel.\n\nIt was simple enough to 'win' the hotel over to their side. A phone call from the home minister assured the Astor House's manager that they would receive a rather generous donation should they comply with the investigation's demands. Relatively few of the officers left the hotel for more than a stroll through the streets, most stayed in their rooms or gathered in the lobby to discuss trivial matters. Yet after about two days of this seemingly dull routine, the officers would one by one visit the reception desk and book themselves into the conference room. They would all be attending some sort of meeting between two and five o'clock the next day, and at least two unnamed individuals would be joining them.\n\nAs the day of the meeting arrived, the investigation, together with local police units, stood ready to burst into the hotel conference room and arrest all those present. For that to happen, they would need the express approval of the senior investigating officer, who acted as an emissary for the home minister. Until he gave the command, the agents of the Home Ministry would watch the meeting, lest they miss some important building."

The rest of the jigsaw was locked away and guarded day and night. This was the true focus of the investigating agents at the present. While a skeleton crew worked on deciphering the information they had available to them, the rest of the agents worked on devising plans to acquire the documents they truly needed to actually make a breakthrough.\n\nIn the dead of night, a black car stopped a few streets away from the naval archives. The building was eerily quiet as the two agents who had just exited their vehicle headed towards it. It didn't take long for them to notice the lack of any guards outside the front gate, which had instead been crudely secured with a chain. After realising that there were no signs of life on the inside of the archive compound either, the chain was removed by way of bolt cutters.\n\nThe archive entrance itself had not even been shut properly, with one door hanging quite ajar, swaying slightly with the breeze. With something undoubtedly wrong with the naval archives, the two agents determined that they were possibly walking into a trap. Using the scant moonlight, one agent pointed a hand mirror at an angle through the open door to reveal... nothing. It was not that the reflection revealed no guards or that there was nothing of particular interest immediately inside. No, the archive's main hall was empty of anything at all. Every document, recording and file was missing.

Observations continued, as they were joined by members of the Shanghai police force.\n\nThe conference itself was proving to be rather dull. Although it had officially begun, the Kenpeitai officers present were still idly talking amongst themselves, with seemingly no coherent conversation between the lot of them. They could only be awaiting something to happen, that was seemingly out of their hands. An hour passed and still nothing happened. From their vantage point in a dubiously acquired apartment across the street, the agents could see the senior Kenpeitai being to check his watch more frequently. They were overdue for something to happen, possibly a late arrival.\n\nAnother hour passed and the mood in the conference room was growing more and more uneasy.

The officers in the conference room quietly surrendered themselves and were handcuffed, saying nothing as they were escorted out of the hotel through a back door. The Shanghai Police had been enthusiastic in aiding the operation, with more than a little contempt on display for the Kenpeitai. Despite the occasional punch or baton to the stomach, the prisoners arrived mostly in one piece. They were to be isolated from one another, with each one getting their own remote cell. Interviews began shortly after, before any one of the Kenpeitai officers had time to devise a smart enough alibi.\n\nIt quickly became clear that the Kenpeitai were more than prepared for being questioned.

After failing to recover anything from the naval archives, the agents had been forced to stoop even more by further committing acts of petty burglary.

There was nothing to do but report the facts to the home minister.\n\nThe home minister had little to say on the investigation for the next few days.

That was a face they had seen before. During the very beginning of the investigation, a dossier containing files on anyone close to Dai Li not accounted for during war had been passed around. The very same face had appeared in an old photograph of Dai Li, standing right beside him.

While the investigation might need to hold off on their most aggressive and uncomfortable methods, there were still plenty of options for how they could squeeze information out of the Dai Li operative.\n\nThe Kenpeitai agents on the other hand, were left in their cells. The investigation had little interest in the mere acomplacies of the Dai Li, especially now that they had a direct link to the man himself. By keeping them merely locked up and well fed, the army could do little more than grumble.

Even when they put just a little bit of pressure on his broken bones, they would only elicit a slight wince or twinge, never more.\n\nThe investigators, although disappointed with their captive's unwillingness to cooperate, was still confident that he would snap sooner or later. The contact was struggling to sleep, and his eyes seemed dimmer each time they paid him a visit. He was growing weary, but that would not prevent him from being kept alive for as long as the investigation needed him. Time was all they really needed, anyway."

This was the case with the investigation and their newly 'acquired' Kenpeitai prisoners. While they were hardened men of military background, there were still a number of methods that could prove effective. Many of those methods were ones that the Kenpeitai had employed themselves, tried and tested across the Sphere. The native Shanghai Police had been particularly forthcoming with the details of this methods of interrogation, having heard the stories of their application over the years. Behind clothes and bolted doors, the agents of the investigation began their bloody and agonizing work.\n\nOne by one, the Kenpeitai officers were escorted to a small room at the back of the police station. After an invariable amount of time, they would return. Some had been cut, others beaten, some had been burned and others seemingly electrocuted. The investigation knew that they could withstand most forms of torture, and that killing one of them 'by mistake' would not soften them up during questioning. This would be a battle of attrition. The longer that they were locked up, away from the wider world, the more worn down they would become. If they started to believe that no help was coming for them, then they would snap. After all, if this was loyalty's reward, then what good was keeping military secrets, really?\n\nThe military had been aware of the matter for some time, however. The dramatic raid of the Astor House has been hard for them to miss, and army intelligence was quickly able to locate where the Kenpeitai officers were being held. With the knowledge that the Kenpeitai officers were being detained, the Ministry of War was swift to issue a diplomatic protest against the investigation. While the home minister would keep the army busy by means of rescheduling their meetings about the matter at the last moment, the investigation would continue their interrogations. As long as the Kenpeitai were kept ignorant of the world outside, then they would eventually tell the agents everything they needed to know..."

The agents of the Home Ministry, together with the Shanghai Police, made their way into the third story conference room, where they found all of the Kenpeitai agents still seated. However, the agents just caught sight of the Chinese contact turning a corner down the hallway. He could only be heading to the emergency exits. While the police were left to deal with the men in the conference room, two agents pursued the Chinese contact down the hall.\n\nBy the time they had managed to turn the corner, he had already made his way through the emergency exit. The alarm connected to the door now blared throughout the hallway, causing a panicked wave of hotel guests to exit their rooms. The agents were forced to shove their way past as dozens of guests tried to rush towards the exits. After barging their way through, the agents were greeted by the sight of two of their own at the bottom of the spiral staircase. They had seen the contact for a split second, before he had disappeared back into the hotel through the first storey door. Blocked by the mass of guests descending the stairs at the same time, the agents awaiting below had no chance to fire upon him.\n\nEntering the hotel once again, the now four agents followed the trail of opened doors. With no rooms on these floors, he could only have attempted to leave through another fire escape, the main entrance or a staff entrance. Yet these paths would have this point been blocked off to him, any attempt would have resulted in arrest or death. The contact's trail did not seem to lead him towards said dead ends, instead heading for...\n\nAs the agents burst through the swinging double doors of the delivery bay, they caught sight of the contact driving off in one of the vans that had been halfway through unloading ingredients for the evening meals.

The sharp ticking of a clock was the only sound to permeate the room, until a seemingly invisible mosquito began to fly through the humid air.\n\n\"Again, would you tell us about these recent donations that were made to your colleagues\"\n\nThe officer repeated the same answer that he had given them a dozen times before, that he had no idea about such donations and that he was uncertain why he was being interrogated in the first place. He finished his retort with a brief chuckle. Deciding that their prisoner was perhaps growing too comfortable with his present conditions, one of the agents grabbed him by the face and thrust him to the ground.\n\n\"The time for answers is now. If you continue to fail to understand your situation, you will suffer worse by the end of the day.\"\n\nDazed by the pain at the back of his head, the Kenpeitai officer continued to lay on the floor. As he did so, the two agents circled above him, as if they were vultures about to feast on a dying animal.\n\n\"It would be simple enough for us to make you disappear. Do you think your colleagues will want you alive after what you have told us already?\"\n\nAs if in response, the officer's eyes snapped open. He attempted to lift himself back up but was forced to the ground again. His eyes became fixed to the ceiling for a good moment, before he exhaled.\n\n\"You're never going to find Dai Li. We don't know where he is. We don't even know if he is alive. The report we gave you was nothing short of an investigative travesty. Yet here you are, at your wit's end, looking for ghosts and conspiracies! \"\n\nHe laughed again, before a kick to the ribs cut him short. The officer spluttered on the floor, before resuming his answer. This time, there was a rage in his voice, as if the kick had only made him more desperate to speak.\n\n\"Ask any one of my peers these questions enough, and they will snap, and then tell you exactly what I am telling you now. The Dai Li you want is nothing more than a story that we cooked up, to cover our own asses! Now, you have your answer.\"\n\nHis final attempt to rise from the ground awarded him a kick to the face. It knocked him out cold. The guard sent in to remove the unconscious officer found the two agents sitting in opposite corners of the room with their heads in their laps. Not one to ask conquestions, he did what was asked of him and dragged the officer to the infirmary. The ticking of a clock and the buzzing of a mosquito filled the air once more."

Even with this fact, the agents elected to use more reasonable and subtle measures to acquire the information they needed. One would have been foolish to write all of the prisoners off as die-hard military loyalists, as shown by their willingness to take bribes from mysterious benefactors. Perhaps if their financial situations were to be taken care off, then they would be open to discussing their backroom deals.\n\nOther methods were employed too. Officers who had expressed great faith in the military soon arriving to release them were specifically told that they had been abandoned by their superiors. Some of the Kenpeitai were subjected to volleys of questions, that were directed to them at random with either a great deal of aggression or geniality.\n\nStubbornness had been expected, considered by the investigation to be part and parcel when dealing with members of the military, yet breaking them down was certainly not impossible. Cut off from the world, isolated from even each other and subjected to constant and repetitive questioning, the signs of their slipping composure would soon become more and more apparent. Eventually, their hope of the military intervening would begin to fade."

This was the third night of this routine. \"We are almost as tired as you at this point. Why were you meeting with officers of the Kenpeitai?\"\n\nNo response. The Chinese contact never spoke, his only method of response was to stare. He now always stared right into the eyes of his captives. The only respite he afforded them was when he lowered his eyelids momentarily. The agent holding the lamp seemed to finally suffer the effects of the staring, as he lowered the light and turned to face his colleague. \"He's not going to speak, we should consider other-\"\n\nA gloved hand struck the contact, sending a wave of pain across his face. Then it happened again. And then again. It was on the fifth strike that the ringing in his ears began. He watched the two agents argue with each other, catching echoes of their words through the din. The contact cleared his throat, which produced a loud and phlegm-filled wheeze. He was once again met with two pairs of vicious eyes. \"When this all began, did the behaviour of the Kenpeitai not trouble you? Did you not question how forthcoming they were about Dai Li? Did you even examine any of the information they sent you?\"\n\nThe investigating agents leaned in, to better hear his sudden confession. They demanded an explanation, that he reveal exactly what he was referring to. \"I worked for Dai Li, but that was decades ago. I have no idea what has become of him. As far as I know, Dai Li could be living as a hermit in Tibet! Ever since the war ended, the Kenpeitai have been forcing me to snuff out resistance movements in China. If they knew where he was, I would have been used against him at this point.\"\n\nHe was struck across the face again and called a bad liar by his captors. \"Surely everything you have gathered up to this point confirms this! Why were they so forthcoming with the rumours of Dai Li, haunting the countryside and murdering unsuspecting Japanese soldiers? Why tell you this, and then refuse to aid you in any meaningful way? Every time you've lifted the curtain just a little bit higher than the Kenpeitai, what have you found? Nothing.\"\n\nThe agents of the investigation did not respond when the Chinese contact finished giving them the answer to the question they had asked him so many times. One stared at the floor, while the other rested his head against the cool brick wall. It was just about beginning to click into place. One report from the Kenpeitai had spawned all this. A mere whisper of a ghost haunting China had sent the entire political establishment into a thunderous panic.\n\nThe agent with his head against the wall produced a sigh of both great anguish and great relief. \"Phone the home minister, tell him that investigation has taken a new turn.

The letter lay in the open, its seal exuding a dread from the contents housed within. The question was clear from the start: why all this secrecy?\n\nUnbinding the seal, [Root.GetLeader] unfolded the envelope. Inside was a piece of paper, neatly typed and spaced. Its contents were unremarkable. The army planned exercises to take place throughout Japan to test the readiness of the troops and reservists in cases of sudden attacks. The reason for secrecy answered itself: the enemy cannot know that Japan prepared to meet its enemy in the field.\n\nThe implication, however, was grim. The 'Great Conspiracy' as those in-the-know within the cabinet dubbed it, was quickly becoming capable of shaking the very foundation of the Japanese state. Hands trembling, he picked up the telephone's handset. He dialed the number of the army offices and asked to talk to the chief for a moment.

From the Imperial Palace, it looked as if today would be beautiful, idyllic, even.\n\nLines of uniformed men marched from the navy's base in Yokosuka. Their destination: the palace. The civilian government had failed the people of Japan, and it was up to her sons in the armed services to save her from doom. They were a curiosity to bystanders; armed to the teeth and wearing khaki uniforms, they walked the streets in full view of all they encounter on the way.\n\nThey were not alone in this line of thought. From the Saitama Prefecture, the army made their own move. Laws and propriety be damned; now is the time for the inferiors to rule from below, outside the structure. If all it took to save Japan were only a few violations of the rules, they would do it every time.\n\nThese conflicting forces would come against one another like waves against a wall; in the middle of Japan, they met. Unslinging their rifles and pointing it at each other, yet refusing to fire, they would garrison the buildings in the capital, maintaining the unstable equilibrium.

While not on the scale of a civil war or even the Mukden Incident, firefights broke out as no one in either service could ascertain if the other was planning a takeover of Japan.\n\nIn one notable event, an army unit entered a town occupied by another army division during the night. The latter opened fire, mistaking the uniforms of the former for navy ones. It took half an hour to defuse the situation, and by then, a dozen men had already died.\n\nThough the central government is in no state to entirely halt the movement of its armed forces, they still control police units throughout the country. A risky move would be to use these to slow down the progress of the army and the navy before chaos could erupt; however, should these units perish, the government would have no other means of restoring control and order."

The police found no clear suspects and the army, suspecting the navy to be behind all of this, can barely contain their anger.\n\nTime was of the essence.

With another deep breath, Kido began to utter his words again, this time slowly and with greater consideration of the room's resentment of him.\n\n\"He's our last hope. He will find out about the riots and protests over the government's actions at some point, there is no avoiding that - he will be outraged. All I ask is that do we tell him now and when we need him, or do we cushion the blow over an expensive dinner later down the line?\""

At first he was hesitant to hear, and many thought the severity of the news would enrage him, but it seemed that the serene display of respect and tranquility in the emperor's advisors' words had delivered them to a calm and reasonable conclusion.\n\nAn announcement came from the Tokyo Imperial Palace today, detailing that after days of deep pondering and consideration the emperor had decided to pardon Nishi Takeichi. He would receive an official pardoning ceremony in the next coming days, and return to the empire with a new accolade in his succession of lifetime achievements. The news came as a much-needed relief for the public, but for many the issue of governmental corruption and extra-judicial punishment remains unresolved."

He looked up at the bright sky, taking off his sunglasses to properly appreciate the fluffy clouds of the home isles. He glanced behind him, noticing the great capital, Tokyo, as he stepped onto the platform; her skyscrapers glimmered and glistened in the beaming Japanese sun. Closing his eyes for a brief moment, Nishi knew this would be the last time he would see his homeland.\n\nMr. Nishi was ordered to be exiled away from the Home Isles for his crimes, and was subsequently being sent to Bengal to live out the rest of his days. The humid, foreign lands under the jurisdiction of the Azad Hind government were decided to be his new home as they were the most distant and most alien to what he knew and grew up with in Tokyo. Now doomed to live the life of an outcast, Nishi Takeichi must painfully experience the rejection he could never see as a celebrity across Japan as a punishment for his alleged crimes against the state."

There he sat at his separate table, where he seemed much further away from his advisors than usual. The news of Nishi's trial had not been received well by the chrysanthemum throne, a feeling that he expressed plainly on his face. The emperor had even arrived late to the privy council meeting, which was particularly unusual. For half an hour, he had remained silent, barely even moving his eyes to look at the assembled council. Even the words of the lord keeper of the privy seal had not stirred the emperor enough to say even a simple \"yes\" or a \"no\".\n\nRegardless, the privy council was desperate for the emperor to speak, as it seemed increasingly likely that his voice would be the only thing that would calm the country. Protests against Nishi's sentence had become increasingly common and most were growing in size by the day. No amount of policing or promises by the government had so far worked. Indeed, the emperor's voice was in fact their last chance.\n\n\"Your Imperial Majesty, we once again beg of you to consider our request. Think of your subjects, think of your empire!\"\n\nWithout as much as a word, or a chance in his facial expression, the emperor stood up and departed from the room. The privy council president returned to his seat, too stunned to comment on what had just happened. The rest of the council were similarly shocked. Some around the room, hoping that someone would take the initiative to speak up. Others could barely look up from their papers. The silence of the chrysanthemum throne was more damning than any blunt refusal he could have uttered."

There had therefore been no time to find him a proper cell. Besides, the protesters outside the courthouse would have likely swarmed the car had they tried to take Nishi much further than a few city blocks away. In the brief moments he had stayed in the cell, Nishi had found the time to consider what he would say before his execution. He would reaffirm his innocence, and once again call on the military to do what was right for the nation. He did not wish to die, but fear was not what filled his mind when he thought about the execution. If anything, he felt disappointed at the state of the nation. How could the emperor let this happen?\n\n\"Sir? Colonel Nishi, are you there?\"\n\nFrom out of the shadows came the figures of three prison guards.\n\n\"What do you want? Do you have something for me?\" The colonel was unsure how to react to their respectful tone.\n\n\"We do sir. We've brought you the means to freedom.\"\n\nThe cell door sprung open and the three guards carefully stepped inside. Nishi quickly got to his feet, still suspicious of what seemed like something too good to be true.\n\n\"And what might that be?\"\n\nThe first guard stepped forward, bowed and presented Nishi with a pistol. The second one also bowed, but he presented the colonel with his own sword, retrieved from the armory of the nearby garrison. Nishi's careful paranoia has been converted to subtle trust.\n\n\"There's a car waiting for you at the back of the prison, sir. We'll escort you there, but after that, we can't go further.\"\n\nNishi took both the pistol and the sword before he saluted the three guards.\"Let's go.

The police presence was greatly heightened there; a result of the protests. The element of surprise had favored Nishi though. He was able to ride along the sidewalks and alleyways, providing momentary respite from the police cars. His path was still a chaotic one; Jupiter came close to trampling several bystanders along the way. Nishi would disappear down one street and then reappear moments later; always ahead of his pursuers. Attempts at erecting barricades were soon found to be pointless too. After all, what waist-high obstacle could stop a showjumping horse?\n\nAs Nishi reached the Imperial Palace gardens, his plan became clear to the police. Pursuit through into the park was impossible for the cars; their only hope was that the Imperial Guard could stop him - said guards had orders to kill anyone who attempted to break into the palace. However, the sight of Colonel Nishi charging straight at them on horseback was enough to freeze them in their tracks. In the end, it was the gate to the palace that stopped Nishi.

Both sides waved placards, yelled accusations, and threw small fragments of debris across the road at their opposition. Enraged and impassioned by the crowds, a student broke from the front-lines of the pacifists' crowd and charged to skirmish with a band of particularly aggressive veterans, and a great swarm was compelled to follow him. A great roar erupted from the street, followed soon after by the chatter and collision of makeshift batons, shields, and other equipment fashioned as weapons to fight the opposition.\n\nGreat crowds of people clashed in small groups throughout the street, tumbling on the floor and tussling with each other against brick walls and metal debris. The stench of violence grew thick in the warm sun, and brutality became a common sight between the groups.

In the course of the past few months, the roots of anti-Japanese corruption have been uncovered in our military apparatus.

This chaos was destructive, in a way he had never known before. Not only that, but he couldn't wipe the thought from his mind that something, some pale spectre, was orchestrating it all. Had someone beat him at his own game...?\n\nOut of Kido's ethereal dream of calm, a figure emerged. Kido, stone-faced and soft-spoken, prepared himself for a dialogue, as had been usual for the past three decades of politicking. As he opened his mouth...\n\nA world turned upside down. A bullet ripped through his stomach, spraying blood and viscera onto Kido's meditation mat. Kido, trembling, collapsed against the wall at his back. In an instant, the fog and euphoria dissipated, and so Kido awoke to his nightmare. The edges of his vision darkened with his fading cognition. All that remained to him was fury.\n\nAs the figure lumbered forward, aiming his pistol towards Kido's forehead, rage and rancor was all that Kido could summon to mind. So... many... years of laborious work, forging alliances and breaking down his political opponents. It was all for... nothing. And what was his reward for his works? To be killed with a pistol. They thought him so weak, weak, weak, he could be killed with only a goddamn fucking pistol and lackey. Insulting... insulting... insul-\n\nKido's final complexion was that of Sisyphus, before silence eclipsed all."

Yes, he did not see the point in all of this violence, but his duty was not to connect points, but instead to make them. He blew into the lock of a gateway, a final obstacle between him and Konoe. He shambled across the cobblestone pathway leading into Konoe's home. A shot into the door knob, and it acquiesced to his wants. He kicked in the doorway and raised his rifle for combat... but only the abyss was present to answer his knocking.\n\nHe smashed his hand against the wall of the entryway, cluelessly searching for anything resembling a light switch.

The IJA had a new master, Kishi Nobusuke, and he was adamant in securing the home isles as promptly as possible in time for his appointment as prime minister.

The crackle of gunfire bounced throughout the city and the great thuds of artillery shook besieged government buildings as citizens fled in fear. Families cowered in their homes as others caught in the streets were shepherded into tents, makeshift cover, or simply lined up and executed on the orders of particularly cruel commanding officers. News of the seizures did not spread fast enough to prepare anyone for the takeover, and when the trucks arrived to roll throughout the vast complexes of streets and highways, any resistance to their authority was crushed beneath an iron boot.\n\nWar had come to Japan, and despite the deafening sounds of it, it was to be a silent conflict."

The members knew what they were witnessing: a hush-hush coup d'état. This was no outcry of the nation's bureaucratic underbelly, but a concerted effort to overthrow the government. There was no one left to save them, all soldiers not in line with Kishi had been sent off to the outer rims of the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken. Hope was lost, but resistance remained in those with the will to fight. Kishi had not expected it, but they would fight.\n\nThey roared onto the ground floor of the House of Representatives, wielding high-tech weaponry and a blank check for all blood shed. A sea of grey and black helmets, the blood-red rays of the rising sun coating their arms, helmets and chest plates. Seizure. The members responded with force, running onto the speaking platform of the lower house to push back the wall of soldiers. First came the batons and canes, a frothing wave of flesh meeting metal. The members were repulsed, bruises and blinded eyes their gifts of return. The resistance had not yet died, Japan was not yet lost. A gang of those most libertarian or reformist members, headed by the up and coming Yasuhiro Nakasone, made a final, desperate push against Kishi's men. They were making progress, taking back the speaking platform, but then... the guns arrived. As Nakasone pushed back the last soldier off the speaking platform, a military grade shotgun was shoved up and against his stomach, and then came the waterfall. Nakasone collapsed, a torrent of blood streaming from out his chest. The soldiers returned to the speaking platform, trampling over Nakasone's corpse and shooting into the rest of those who dared oppose them. Ikeda, in a moment of undue bravery, rose to rally the rest of the members from the seats of the lower house. Japan would not die like this, he repeated to himself.

Ideas that would see a generation of Japanese children lost to war, ideas that would see the peoples of all Asia die suffocating from smokestacks and the chemicals of war. He became nauseous at the thought that he might be the only person left in Japan capable of igniting a resistance. His colleagues and servants of decades were all dead, bleeding out on the Diet's floors or murdered in their own homes. Dread was all he could muster to mind. Dread and loathing. Decades of formality and tradition, ripped away in an orgy of violence.\n\nThe door creaked open, bringing a frigid air into the room. From behind its confines emerged the Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda. He wore a sickly expression, as if the skin of a dead man had been stapled into his skull. The euphoria of victory fought against his stone-face, forming cracks in his mask. Odd stares and a fidgeting of his eyelids. Hirohito could not sense a human in his presence.\n\n\"Your Imperial Majesty, I come to ease any concerns that may have arisen over recent events. I assure you, our nation's systems and principles have not yet gone, but have only been strengthened by the actions of Nobusuke Kishi.

 japdlc_endgame.13.desc:0 "Martial law had been rumored about for weeks, slipping through conversations and streets like small rivers. The stony facade that the government put up as it ate itself alive couldn't hold forever. Sooner or later, something would give, and the Army would sweep the streets clean and hose the blood off afterwards. It hung over the heads of every crowd, every protestor, every slogan, a sword of Damocles angled at the Home Islands - would the Army do it?\n\nWhen it came, finally, the city knew in minutes. Alarm signals went out to every group of protestors dissatisfied with how the Conspiracy was handled, regardless of political leanings. Within hours, the streets of the cities of Japan, from Nagasaki to Sapporo, were choked with throngs of furious citizens, demanding an end to government incompetence and heavy-handed Army thugs.\n\nThose same thugs were there to meet them.\n\nJapan flailed and spasmed, its famous order and tranquility shattered by the death rattle of rifle fire and the heavy thump of tear gas grenades. In between the clouds of white-grey smoke, the Imperial Palace loomed. Within its grand halls, in a small, luxurious room, a group of soldiers threw the door open to the meeting place of the Jushin."

 japdlc_endgame.14.desc:0 "\"This is ridiculous!\" Kido spat, eyes furiously boring through his glasses into the bemedalled figure of General Akira. To his right, Konoe sat quietly, his gaze locked to the floor in resignation. \"I knew this was one of your Army tricks from the moment you started talking about order. [JAP.GetLeader] didn't listen to me, and now-\"\n\n\"[JAP.GetLeader] will not be listening to anyone important much longer, Lord Keeper. He must resign.\" Akira stated plainly. The short, bespectacled man seemed to almost boil over in rage. \"It's plain that his leadership has failed us in this time of crisis.\"\n\n\"Yes, in this time of crisis.\" Higashikuni butted in, his eyes lighting up for a moment in recognition of opportunity. \"Like it or not, Generals, the Conspiracy is still ongoing. Is it wise-\"\n\n\"The Conspiracy never existed, I'd bet.\" General Takushiro interrupted with a scoff, draining the energy from his opponent. \"This chaos is borne from the frantic flailing of a civilian government caught entirely out of its depth. They have led a shameful witch-hunt in the pursuit of a dead man, and Japan burns for it.\"\n\nAkira took over from his subordinate, pressing the advantage over his rapidly deflating opposition. \"No, Lord Keeper, the civilians cannot be trusted to maintain the Empire any longer. We must have order. We must have stability. We must have tranquility. That can only come from the upper ranks of the nation - the Emperor, his advisors -\" Now he gestured sweepingly over the room.\"- and his loyal soldiers.\" He pointed to himself and the soldiers behind him. \"And, my friends, if anyone is to run the Empire in an orderly fashion...\""

 japdlc_endgame.15.desc:0 "The Showa Restoration started - and ended - with a single phone call. That was all it took.\n\nAs Prime Minister [GetName] tried to drown out the cacophony of the protests and police bullhorns outside the Kantei, his secretary whispered that Lord Privy Seal Kido was calling. Kido, for his part, had only one thing to say:\n\n\"Prime Minister, in the name of the Emperor and by a unanimous agreement of the Jushin, you are to resign immediately as Prime Minister. General Mutō Akira and the Imperial Army will assume the Prime Ministership to fix the mess that the Yokusankai have created.\"\n\nAt this point the Prime Minister came to the crushing realization he should have had long before. He should have known that letting the military take control of Tokyo would allow them to take the revenge they were certain to want after all those witch hunts.\n\n\"Worst part is,\" the Prime Minister thought, \"there's nothing I can do, what with Kido on their side.\"\n\nThe now-former PM made to pack up his bags and get ready to high-tail it out of there, if he even could do so and live."

 japdlc_endgame.16.t:0 "Resignation"
 japdlc_endgame.16.desc:0 "When the public - still raging over Nishi and the Conspiracy and the government and all the rest - received the shocking news that the Prime Minister had been forced to resign in the aftermath of the recent chaos, they were deeply confused. That confusion turned to irritation, fear, and even rage when it became clear that a military cabinet under Mutō Akira was taking over from him.\n\nEveryone remembered the suffering and chaos brought about by the years of war with the Anglo-American imperialists and the Chinese reactionaries. Though it had certainly been worth it at the time - after all, Japan had won out - it was not so appealing a prospect where people wanted to go back to that era. \n\nThough many of the angry people, on hearing just who was in charge now, fled back to their homes and prayed to whoever was listening that they wouldn't get in trouble for being outside at the time, the prospect of Japan's falling back under a military dictatorship was enough to bring a few determined protestors out into the streets.\n\nWhen they went out to demand their freedom back and protest the overly-great influence of the armed forces, they were told they were acting against the Emperor's will. They refused to listen... \n\n... and were gunned down, the few streets they had occupied painted red with their blood. Such was the fate of the remaining public believers in democracy in the rule of law."

 japdlc_endgame.17.t:0 "Regression"
 japdlc_endgame.17.desc:0 "The Dai Li Conspiracy had laid the divisions in Japan bare in ways few had expected, for with the rise of Mutō Akira Japan tumbled headlong back into the darkest depths of military dictatorship at a time when it needed such governance the least. \n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army unveiled its cabinet, now utterly dominated by Army men and maybe one or two civilian lackeys. The army men had taken the opportunity to kick the Navy to the curb, leaving them only with the customary post of Navy Minister.\n\nPublic order and subjugation to the military fiat had become the name of the game. The Yokusankai were given a choice: \"get in line, or we will make you.\" The press, too, was not spared.  From the Asahi or Mainichi all the way down to the village papers in places like Shōdoshima or Muroram, all of it was shuttered en masse by military directives. The NHK and other broadcasting corporations were also ruthlessly restricted, with even pre-coup propaganda works harshly scrutinized for potentially unpatriotic concepts.\n\nJapan had succumbed to paranoia in the worst way possible even while they purported to be making their way past it. With soldiers on every corner, the Empire was being forced to withdraw troops from Asia even as its satellites increasingly asserted themselves. \n\nThe Emperor, observing all these goings-on and seeing a repeat of the era before the Second World War, shuddered and held his peace. Once more he successfully repressed the urge to speak, as he had virtually every single time his words could have made a difference in these matters. He could not repress the doubt that this era of military rule would be far less successful than the first."
