 CD.1.t:0 "도무스 마리아에 회의" # 도무스 마리아에
 CD.1.d:0 "승리의 희열이 가라앉았으니, 기독교민주당은 몇십 년 동안 파시즘에 뒤덮힌 나라의 통치를 시작해야만 한다. 더 심각한 것도 있다. 바로 당 내의 매우 다양한 세력들이 어떻게 통치할지에 관해 다양한 생각을 갖고 있다는 빅텐트 정당의 고질병이었다.\n\n진보주의자이자 실용주의자인 알도 모로 예비 총리는 이 사실을 깨달았다. 모로는 당이 이탈리아의 이 신 시대로 어떻게 나아갈지 결정하기 위해 도무스 마리아에 호텔에서 당 회의를 열자고 요구했다.\n\n호텔 회의실에서 당 지도자들과 관료들이 이탈리아의 대한 자신들의 비전이 왜 당을 위한 최고의 길인가를 두고 말다툼을 벌였다. 모로는 앞쪽 테이블 정중앙에서 그 광경을 봤다.\n\n자유보수주의 성향인 도로테이파의 간판, 마리아노 루모르와 에밀리오 콜롬보는 단결의 필요하다는 것과 지금 같은 상황에서 보트를 너무 많이 흔들면 안된다는 긴 연설을 했다. 애초에 당은 계속 정부에 '머무르고' 싶어했다. 그리고 로마는 하루 아침에 만들어지지 않았다. 수많은 기민당 의원들과 기민당 표 기반이 보수 성향이라는 것은 말할 필요도 없는 사실이었다.\n\n통로 반대편에는 진보주의 선동가이자 모로의 친한 친구인 아민토레 판파니가 지금 당장 개혁이 필요하다고 열정적으로 설교했다. 판파니는 북쪽에 있는 과거 동맹이었던 적국의 위협을 강조했다. 이탈리아는 강하고 자유로워야 했다. 점진적인 방법을 쓸 시간은 없었다.\n\n연설이 서서히 멈추고 모로가 일어났다. 방 안에 침묵이 흘렀다. 모로는 생각에 깊이 잠겨 목을 가다듬었다. 그리고는 테이블로 걸어가기 시작했다..."

PDIUM은 꽤 보수적인 정당입니다. 하지만 이들에게 제일 중요한건 이탈리아 왕정의 유지입니다. 그리고 우리에겐 왕정을 폐지할 이유가 없습니다.\n\n이런 인식과 약간의 양보 끝에 우리는 손을 잡고 PDIUM을 의회 연합에 끌어들였습니다. 알도 모로가 선보인 세심한 협상 기술로 우리 당의 자유주의자들도 강경 보수주의 정당의 합류에 만족하고 있습니다. 기민당의 투표층은 늘어났지만, 단결도는 여전히 강력합니다."

 CD.4.d:0 "알도 모로는 테이블에 커피잔을 내려놓으며 책상 밑으로 다리를 뻗었다. 주세페 사라가트가 모로와 얘기하고 싶을거라는걸 의심한 적은 한 번도 없었다. 둘은 지금 이 방에 있었다. 사민당원이 받은 서류를 읽는 척 했다. 기민당원은 참을성 있게 기다렸다. 마침내 사라가트가 약하게 고개를 끄덕이며 서류를 돌려줬다. 둘의 눈이 마주쳤다. 모로는 미소를 지었다. 사라가트도 눈을 빛내며 미소를 되돌려줬다. "알도, 우린 서로 잘 협력할 수 있어. 우리 당원들도 별 문제 없이 받아들일거야." 마침내 사라가트가 말했다. "정말 잘 되었군, 주세페." 모로가 대답했다. 모로는 담배를 권했다. 사라가트는 받았다. 이렇게 약 한 시간 만에 일이 끝났다. 이제 다른 이의 친구들에게 익숙해지는 것 외에는 해야할 일이 별로 없었다. "주세페, 우리가 생각하는건 같아." 잠시 후 모로가 말했다. "내가 몇몇 사람들과 함께 가야 한다는 건 알잖아. 예를 들어, 자네보다 더 보수적인 사고방식을 가진 사람들 말이야." 사라가트는 맞장구치듯 웃었다. 모로는 계속 말했다. "그래도 오늘 우린 더 나은 이탈리아를 만드는데 합의했어. 그러니 강경파는 별 문제가 안되지. 시뇨레 넨니가 이 만남에 대해 알고 무슨 말을 했는지 듣는건 재밌을거야."\n\n사라가트는 대화 상대를 만족시키며 싱긋 웃었다. "넨니는 언제나 할 말이 있지. 난 그런 부분을 존경해." 사라가트는 조용히 말했다. 그의 눈 속에서 뭔가 다른게 보였다. "하지만 그게 무슨 소용이 있을까? 내가 넨니를 만날 때 우리가 합의한 대로 민주전선에 반대표를 던질텐데 말이야. 그리고 자네는 총리가 되는거지." 모로는 이 말을 듣고 미소지었다. 하지만 대화에 그림자가 드리운 것 같았다. 모로가 파트너를 자세히 관찰했을 때, 그 동안 그림자는 잠시 동안 남아있었다. 주세페 사라가트는 모든 면에서 신사였고 모로가 상대했던 정치인들 중 부드럽게 말하는 타입이었다. 하지만 그것 외에도 다른 것들이 있었다. 모로는 이해했다. 상황이 기독교민주당에게 불리하게 된다면 사라가트는 주저 없이 이 '사소한 타협'을 무시할 것이다.\n\n사라가트는 다시 미소짓고 있었다. 그리고 약간의 시간이 흘렀다. 담배 몇 개비와 약간의 담화를 나눈 후 두 남자는 악수했다. "대화 고맙네, 알도." 사라가트가 말했다. "이 만남을 받아들여줘서 고마워." 모로는 그렇게 말하고는 미소지으며 사라가트를 사무실 밖으로 내보냈다."

 CD.5.t:0 "사회주의자와의 관계" # 정치적 시류 경향, 사회주의에게 덜 적대적
 CD.5.d:0 "이탈리아에서 몇십 년 동안 이루어진 선전은 사회주의에 대한 불만을 발효시켰습니다. 수많은 연장자들은 사회주의자를 이탈리아를 러시아같은 무정부 상태로 만드려는 아나키스트 폭탄 테러범으로 봅니다. 치아노의 정권도 강경한 반사회주의 정권이었습니다. 이는 당 내의 수많은 중도파와 중도우파들이 사회주의의 위협을 크게 두려워하는데 영향을 줬습니다. 하지만, 몇몇이 고난을 보는 곳에서 알도 모로는 기회를 보았습니다.\n\n사회주의자, 심지어 민주전선 대다수도 국가연합을 구성하는 네오파시스트들에 비하면 훨씬 더 낫습니다. 사회주의자들은 현재로써는 민주주의 사상에 꽤 헌신적이니까요. 이 점을 아는 모로는 사회주의가 이국의 사상이 아니라 민주주의의 한 분파에 지나지 않는다는 점을 보여주기 위해 사회주의자들에게 손을 내밀어야 한다고 봤습니다.\n\n처음에는 주저하며 한 행동이었지만, 모로의 노력이 결실을 본 것 같습니다. 기민당에서 보수적인 이들조차 이탈리아 전역의 다양한 사회주의자들과 더 우호적으로 되고자 합니다. 미래에 사회주의자들과 더 긴밀히 협력할 수 있는 가능성이 열린겁니다."

 CD.10.d:0 "It was an era of good feelings, the mayor had said in one of their discussions, where Italians felt they could change things for the better. Elena did not like the mayor very much, but she could agree with him on that. Ever since she had gone round the building and roped in all of the neighbours, the Condominium B7 Administration Group had become the talk of the entire neighbourhood.\n\nShe had always been outspoken, even as a girl, but only in the past year or so had the neighbours become so as well. The Group, composed mostly of the women living in the building, had been scorned at first by many of the husbands. Then the Group organised a few lunches, solved the problem of waste disposal outside the condominium, convinced the owner to shell out money for maintenance of the property and received the mayor of the district, twice. The husbands stopped complaining.\n\nElena knew the change that had come over her lady friends was neither sudden nor random. Even under Ciano they would not have dared raise such a fuss or involve themselves in politics, however minor. With democracy, however, they had been free to take much of the everyday 'policymaking' into their hands. There were still whispers in neighbouring buildings that she had nothing better to do with her time, but Elena didn't care. She had discovered that organising her peers gave her purpose, and she would not give it up no matter what anyone said. Maybe when the children were slightly older - who knows - she could replace the district mayor and do his job better."

 CD.11.d:0 "이제 일요일을 두 번의 실망을 안겨주는 날이 되었다. 파올로의 일과는 이웃 모두가 알고 있었다. 아내와 함께 만든 집 뒤 정원을 둘러본 뒤에 아내를 데리고 아침 미사로 간다. 미사가 끝나면 둘은 서로 헤어진다. 아내는 식료품점의 친구들을 만나러 간다. 파올로도 친구들을 만나러 교회 광장에 있는 작은 카페로 간다. 잠시 친구들과 얘기한 뒤 항상 앉던 곳 뒷자리 카운터에서 항상 사던 신문 두 부를 산다. 그리고 앉아 신문으로 보며 아침을 보낸다.\n\n파올로는 몇 년 동안 이 일과를 지켜왔다. 하지만 무언가 전과 같지 않았다. 어렸을 때부터 봐왔던 교구 성직자는 나이를 먹어 점점 노쇠해졌다. 그 가엾은 남자는 가끔씩 설교를 하다 멈춰서고 혼란에 빠졌다. 뭐가 뭔지 이해하지 못하는 것 같았다. 성직자의 설교는 파올로의 신앙심이 피어오르게 했다. 하지만 이제는 복사가 늙은 성직자를 친절하게 내려오게 이끌 때까지 어색한 침묵이 흐를 뿐이었다.\n\n파올로 예상했었다. 기민당이 총선에서 이기면 그의 가슴 속에 아직 살아 숨쉬는 종교적 열정으로 정치를 할거라고. 기민당을 뽑은건 성공할 수 있는 진짜 이탈리아 - 파올로처럼 아치오네 카톨리카의 단란함 속에서 자란 이탈리아인들 - 의 당이라고 믿었기 때문이었다. 하지만 이제는 매일 알도 모로, 그 부정직한 겁쟁이 모로 놈이 불가지론자랑 사회주의자랑 함께 일한다는 기사를 읽을 뿐이었다. 오늘자 신문은 '이니치아티바 데모크라티카'에 대해 말하고 있었다. 모로가 당 내 좌파랑 자신을 따르는 중도파를 데리고 함께 발표한 동맹이었다. 파올로는 화가 났다. 카톨릭 정치를 망치는 모로에게만 화난 것이 아니었다. 모로가 망칠 수 있게 놔둔 당 내 '가치 있는 사람들'에게도 화가 났었다.\n\n파올로는 탁자 위에 신문을 버려둔 채 집으로 돌아갔다. 그는 아직 기독교민주당을 포기하지 않았다. 기민당 외에 어딜 뽑겠는가? 하지만 과거 기민당을 대변했던 열정은 오래 전에 사라져있었다."

A sea of Democrazia Cristiana's representatives looked back at him, men of every shade of political persuasion, from reformed fascists and monarchists to those different from the moderate socialist bloc only by their chosen affiliation. Moro could not suppress a twinge of pride in this wide tent they had built, and then his eyes met those of Giulio Andreotti. Guilio smiled at him and nodded, encouraging, demanding. Democrazia Cristiana was by far the widest of the coalitions present in Parliament, but - Moro exhaled slowly and steeled himself - today it would become narrower.\n\n"I am proud because I am a Christian democrat," he began. "Our fellow representatives in the other parties are divided between themselves and speak only for parts of the society. This is their right." The usual heckling, sounds of approval from every DC faction represented. Moro continued speaking. "Christian democracy is a representation of the whole of our society. Before God we build a politics, every day, founded in our religious and social values and which will better the life of every Italian family. Some of our opponents, looking for something to attack us for, say we compromise excessively and do not stand by what we claim to be our beliefs." Already the Parliamentarians started to react accordingly, but Moro kept going. "Yet we know what our beliefs are. Democrazia Cristiana is.." He almost faltered. "A party for democracy, unity and values, and opposed to the destructiveness and division of the Left."\n\nAs the Parliament broke out in whispers, Moro narrowed his eyes at the paper laying before him on the podium. Mentally he made immediate adjustments, crossing out 'a malicious atheist attack on the family', 'assassins of democracy', substituting 'against our families' beliefs', 'misguided beliefs which can only harm democracy'. Aldo Moro looked up and threw a surveying glance around the room. Andreotti and the Primavera group nodding approvingly, the left faction looking angry and whispering while shooting daggers with their eyes. The Fronte Democratico representatives, ready to stand up and start shouting but curious to see how the speech would develop. The PSDI, sitting among them, looking more intrigued than angry. And across from the leftists, Almirante, flashing him a full toothed grin which sent a shiver down his spine. Moro kept going.\n\n"We stand against the Fronte Democratico, against the Left, because their beliefs are against our families' beliefs. They are not what Italy wants or needs, and whilst there are good men among them," Another edit, a slight grimace from Andreotti - "It is clear that their beliefs are badly misguided, and will only do harm to our young democracy. Perhaps they will call us conservative for saying so, opposed to reform, but we are the true reformers. Democrazia Cristiana represents the true centre of Italy, the soul of tens of millions of Italians and their families. Based on our values, and their values, and willing to fight the Left on the political battlefield, we will change Italy for the better and give its children a life better even than what we ourselves will enjoy."\n\nUproarious applause from Andreotti's corner, with every conservative member of the party on their feet clapping. Almirante and his fascists whistling and applauding, only half mockingly. The members of the Fronte Democratico jeering, calling him a Big Business puppet, an enemy of the worker and a fascist, while Saragat's moderates whispered quickly to one another. But Moro did not have eyes for any of them. He looked only at the leftists of Democrazia Cristiana, and noted how they sat there sullenly with anger in their eyes. Betrayal. Moro left the podium and went back to his seat, shaking hands and smiling absent-mindedly. Andreotti clapped him on the back and said, into his ear, "We have won a great victory today.""

We either act correctly or we do not act at all, and even the Military cannot move unless the politics is in place." To this more murmurs, and not all of them assent. One of the men suggested sending a reply to the DC office the letter had arrived from, but the first one to speak shook his head."

All the same, Enzio knew he had to at least try to make something out of his literary collection.\n\nIn his interactions with Saragat, Enzio was taken back by how approachable the man was. His whole demeanor was very calming. He didn't yell or scream or shout ideological dogma at Enzio. Whatever question Enzio had related to the party's platform Saragat was more than willing to explain, in great detail, his outline for the future. From Enzio's perspective, he saw a man committed not only to himself, like so many other politicians. Saragat was committed to democracy and to the Italian people. An honorable man in a cut-throat field.\n\nNenni however, what a contrast. If Enzio felt a sense of paternal comfort around Saragat, Nenni represented a father's rage. Rage against the injustices still present within Italy and its government. Nenni also had no qualms preaching to Enzio about how socialism, and socialism alone, would save Italy from backsliding into fascism. While Enzio was not fully convinced by the rhetoric, he couldn't help but be inspired by Nenni's commitment to his ideals. A socialist Italy still seemed unimaginable, almost impossible with a gentleman like Saragat. But with a firebrand like Nenni at the helm...\n\nEnzio went back to peering over his notes, determined to finish his column before morning."

 FD.2.d:0 "All of Rome today - or at least, the part of it with a taste for politics, which was everyone nowadays - could talk of nothing else. Giuseppe Saragat had prevailed in the factional struggle for control of the Fronte Democratico, and was named Secretary of the group, with Pietro Nenni to act as President.\n\nA moderate man, both in character and in his politics, Giuseppe Saragat had in the past years fostered a reputation of ruthless calculation. Having prevailed, members of the Saragat faction now exposed their internal disagreement in presenting two plans on the way forward to Nenni.\n\nThe first path was the more moderate one - working with Democrazia Cristiana directly, pooling the energy of the moderating forces in both the FD and the DC, and forming a social democratic government supported by Aldo Moro. Despite his willingness to sit with conservative and monarchist members in his group, Moro was a known compromiser, and a Nenni-Saragat-Moro pact could well achieve much for social democratic politics. Such a pact would also help reduce opposition from conservative elements in Italy, and strongly increase our ability to deliver an effective programme. The clear downside, however, would be the reaction in the Fronte Democratico. An alliance with Moro would be seen as a capitulation by many voters, badly damaging the FD's chance at reelection.\n\nThe other option was purer, and carried more risk. The path of socialist unity would have us form a government made only of the FD, creating a moderate left bloc which could implement our vision of Italy without any alliance with the Christian Democrats. This policy, for obvious reasons, would make our re-election far more likely - it is what people voted for, after all - and the healing of rifts in the socialist front would allow the government to work in stability. Yet the risk would have to be kept in mind. After all, conservative elements in the country would be disturbed by the prospect of a socialist bloc in power.\n\nWith the FD's factions waiting impatiently, Nenni finally came to a decision:"

Nenni was the first to speak: "Not everyone in the party is happy we're meeting you," he said gruffly, and Moro met him with a small smile. A test? Then Nenni laughed, and they got to business.\n\nThe next few hours went by in a consistent manner - Nenni talked a good deal, Saragat talked less and said more, and Moro talked enough. By the end of it everything was as clear as could be and a coalition agreement was on the table. Moro was pleasantly surprised to note his interlocutors did not agree on everything. They all came away with something they could sell to their people, and parted with an appointment to meet again very soon.\n\nIt had gone well, Moro noted as he left the café. But Nenni had been reasonable, and every time he wasn't Saragat steered the conversation back to their areas of agreement. In any case, it was only compromising, and Moro had squeezed as much as he could. The easy part was over."

Both men, despite their differences, respected his struggle against fascism and had told him so in person. But he was not so naïve as to think this was the only reason they were calling. Depending on their beliefs the former members of the party would flock in two directions, the more radical to the PSI and the more moderate to the PSDI.

While Enrico Berlinger was not available for comment, many of his supporters, led by other party deputies who were also expelled, have taken to the streets in protest against the "political puppets of the bourgeoisie". Police units have been mobilized and are conveying at the scene of the largest protests currently taking place. Although they have been ordered to only watch and ensure the protests do not spiral out of control, it is clear that the Socialist's Party's decision to expel the radicals may not have had the stabilizing effect they were hoping for.\n\nPietro Nenni issued a statement on the matter, ensuring that these protests were made up of mostly foolish students with too much time on their hands and their irresponsible ringleaders; the expelled party members. He went on to express his confidence in the Party and made it clear "...in no uncertain terms... the party shall not split over the ravings and poutings of a few radicals."

Nenni thought as he gasped for air, his voice cracked and his throat parched from spouting off rhetoric for the past 15 minutes. For days Nenni made sure every page, every paragraph, every sentence, and every syllable of his speech was perfect! He refused to recite nothing but his most truthful and analytical thoughts when speaking, especially on the topic of politics. If he was to secure Italian socialism against its political enemies, it was imperative Nenni built his support among the working class. The workers had to be made to understand the important role the PSI played in empowering them. Once they were made to see this, no doubt due to his impeccable oratory skills, the workers would unilaterally fall in line with the PSI party program. So when this crowd of workers gathered in the TV studio audience returned nothing more than a few whimpering whistles and scattered applause, Nenni could only stand aghast. Frozen in shock, like a deer in headlights, he regained enough courage to gather his papers and exit frame before the feed cut.\n\nNenni could not comprehend how his speech and charisma failed to inflame the workers' passions. Thankfully, Giuseppe Saragat made an appearance on the very same program and was able to win over the crowd's affection. Nenni pondered how Saragat, much more moderate and soft-spoken compared to himself, could have captured the hearts and minds of the working class assembled in the TV studio. And not just there either. All over the nation it seemed his fiery prose, meant to set hearts on fire, was overshadowed by Saragat's gentler and straight-talking attitude. It slowly dawned on Nenni that he was slowly but surely becoming an accessory to the real rising star of the party, Guiseppe Saragat."

He had already run through two pens, and now with the last drop of ink had used up a third. Still, it was important he covered the congress as thoroughly as possible. Gatherings like this didn't happen so often, and a journalist of Roberto's stature even rarer got the privilege to attend such a historic event.\n\nThe Americans from the National Progressive Party (what a curious name) seemed to get along with all the other delegates and attendees, Roberto included.

Only time would tell if this congress truly was the beginning of a sincere and lasting union of solidarity. Sheik Mujibur Rahman, in his address to the congress, seemed to summarize Roberto's more pessimistic feelings on the matter. "It's not over yet."\n\nThe Japanese delegates, of all the attendees, were the most optimistic about the gathering. Roberto found their speech, about hope for a freer world and their country to atone for its shameful and brutal past, a truly inspiring moment for the congress. It was, however, topped only by Oliver Tambo's bombastic speech. Roberto was moved by his stories of resistance against the reichskommissariats and the struggle of liberation his people fought for everyday. If a man like Tambo can so vigorously fight on against the fascisti, then maybe this truly was the beginning of the end for them.

Surely this much whispering, during his speech to inaugurate the Council, would detract from the fiery relevance of his words?\n\nHe need not have worried. The audience, a varied assortment of activists, academics and diplomats, listened attentively with their eyes fixed on him as translators whispered into their ear. Sanzō Nosaka, the Japanese communist whose entry into the room had caused a stir, was nodding vigorously to his colleague's whispers. As he spoke Nenni, picked out other figures he had been informed about by his advisers. From the US Dorothy Day, a Catholic pacifist, and a folk singer called Phil Ochs. From Britain Hugh Brock, a journalist, and from Spain Llorenzo Vidal Vidal, a writer. Many of his countrymen he recognized himself - Ernesto Balducci, a dissident priest, had come up to him and shaken his hand. Whilst the relative lack of politicians of much import stung at first, Nenni would see it later on as a blessing. The people in this room would talk freely, caring for the best ideas and not for national interests, and just perhaps, the seed sown here would be the beginning of a wider legacy.

The improved employment was nothing but a sham, an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Italian people. These leftists had a sinister goal in mind that it seemed only Luce could see: the implementation of a communist dictatorship.

But they had been shut down, and thank God for that. Now Maurizio was to oversee this construction, one of the largest automobile factories in Italy once it was built. He had not been surprised when they chose him, since his experience in the construction industry was well known, but was grateful nonetheless to-be given this, his biggest project so far. He supposed, in a moment of wry reflection, that he was a public official now. Maybe he should have someone stitch an Italian flag into his shirt!\n\nMaurizio dragged an elbow against his damp forehead. It was a hot day. He walked around leisurely, shouting instructions and keeping an eye out for the new builders. They had needed to fetch some people from the outside and there were disagreements with his men at first, but Maurizio tried to stifle arguing as it happened. He was happy with the extra hands, which would speed up the factory's opening, and it was good when something like this created more work. God knew work was not something which could be taken for granted, even in good times for the economy such as this one. So when one of the new builders made a very stupid mistake and cost them some of the construction materials, Maurizio had stood up for him and saved the man his job. Even as they grumbled, he could see the men respected him for it. Now morale was better than ever, and the kid who made the mistake learned quickly. All was well.\n\nA more economically minded man would have pointed to a larger pattern, saying that complex merging policy decisions had made the current building boom, with IRI opening worksites all over the country and creating prosperity wherever it did.

In building on the momentum of this victory Nenni's task now was to choose between two approaches, with differing degrees of radicalism.\n\nThe first approach would, whilst radical itself, see us working within the bourgeois system. Focusing our political efforts against the fascists of the Blocchi Nazionali, appealing to workers directly, and using the tools afforded us by the Constitution, we would forge socialism in the Italian way. If even this was too far for Saragat and his social democrats, who had been grumbling darkly since their loss, then Saragat be damned. This approach would keep the party's voting base behind us and strengthen our government, even as conservative elements in the country would do everything to undermine us.\n\nYet there were those who say this would not be enough, and Nenni is inclined to listen. The enemies of socialism in Italy would be against a Nenni-Berlinguer government no matter what, and could step in to destroy the socialist project. We could, then, seize the moment, and wage a revolution won through the ballot. By weakening the King and the armed forces, and rallying the people behind us, we could outwit the enemies of socialism and destroy their power over Italy forever.

 FD.21.d:0 "Luca held his morning paper with an iron grip; his knuckles turned white and his face beet red. He could not believe what he was reading. Right on the goddamn front page the title: "Moro to hold talks with Berlinguer, may come to political agreement" sent Luca into a conniption.\n\nWhile Luca had always been a solid conservative voter, more inclined to support the Primavera faction of the party, or even the more moderate Dorotei faction, he still accepted the leadership of Moro and Fanfai to lead the Christian Democrats to victory. While the recent election results did not turn out the way Luca was hoping, he was sure that the Democratic Front would surely collapse like the pitiful house of cards they are. Then, Italy could be saved from the dastardly socialists.\n\nBut this...this was a debilitating and humiliating betrayal to Luca, and the party. How could Moro do this? Enter into talks with a known communist? What's there to talk about? How to cripple the economy? Perhaps how to further secularize the nation and dismiss the Holy Father's authority? Berlinguer is a dangerous radical who should have been sent packing long ago. And now Moro, the patsy, is no doubt conspiring with Berlinguer, the dirty commie, on how to further destroy Luca's beautiful Italy.\n\nThe party can not stand for this. Efforts must be made to resist this capitulation to the radicals, and to replace Moro and his faction as the head of the party. The future of Italy depends on it!"

 FD.23.d:0 "Roman denizens awoke to a stunning display of vandalism early Tuesday morning. Several figures, now identified by witnesses as both male and female students from the Sapienza University of Rome, arrived armed with cans of spray paint and vandalised a statue of king Umberto II. The statue was defaced with egregious and indecent remarks that are not worth repeating in this publication. Besides the inflammatory remarks, radical political statements covered the statute as well: "Viva La Repubblica Socialista!", "Abbasso Umberto!", and "Morte Ai Fascisti." The students whereabouts are currently unknown; local police units are issuing an award for the location of these hostile persons.\n\nThe Blocchi Nazional, Democrazia Cristiana, and even moderates from Fronte Democratico have all called on Pietro Nenni to condemn this horrendous stunt. Nenni, believed to be the inspiration for this and similar occurrences because of his inflammatory rhetoric, issued a statement on the matter this afternoon. Standing in front of the parliament building he condemned the "immature and baseless acts" of a "few overzealous students." In the same speech, Nenni quickly pivoted to condemning recent provocations made by the Blocchi Nazional, going so far as to blame the party for the recent acts of vandalism. He stated that if they were not so "pig-headed" and "aggravatingly obtuse"; such "spontaneous undertakings" would be far more "sporadic and restrained." This has upset the Blocchi Nazional to no end; calling for action to be taken against Nenni for his remarks and dismal condemnation of the students."

While the rally, for the most part, proceeded throughout the night without incident; several arrests were made and a score of officers were sent to the hospital.\n\nThe rally had been planned in advance for weeks, organized by Fronte Democratico supporters. The purpose of the rally was to celebrate the programs established and laws passed by the newly elected government . While the plan was to have the rally be attended by several unions and political organizations, including known radical Enrico Berlinguer and his supporters; word of the demonstration quickly spread. By the night of the event, several student orgs. And thousands of workers spontaneously demonstrated their support by holding rallies of their own, or joining in on the official assembly. The tone of the rally quickly shifted to a more militant one; due to the influx of extremists at the event, spurred on by Berlinguer, who radicalized the crowd. Soon, workers were shouting pro-socialist slogans and demanding further major reforms to be implemented by the government; while still praising and honoring Fronte Democratico for its success so far.\n\nPolice units were called in to break up parts of the rally and to reign in the radicals who were inciting the crowd. This led to several altercations; many of them turning violent. One such including a young student being subdued and detained by an officer, before several workers shouting anti-police slogans assaulted the officer and freed the youth. Still, such cases were extremely limited and the rally was mostly unaffected by the police presence.\n\nBy the end of the assembly, Pietro Nenni made an appearance; humbly accepting the "groundswell of popular support" he and his party members had "graciously earned" from the Italian people. He stood atop a makeshift platform constructed for the event, along with several other Fronte Democratico members. Enrico Berlinguer was also present among the celebrated party members. He later went on to express his "cautious optimism for the future of the party"; implying that Fronte Democratico, due to its recent success and outpouring of support, may very well implement more comprehensive reforms in the near future."

"Nenni," said the other simply, and spat on the ground. The two laughed. "Everyone who isn't a communist will be out soon," returned Mattei. "But I wouldn't worry too much, Francesco. These things have a way of working out."\n\nFrancesco eyed his friend eagerly. What did he know? "He'll have to reinstate us?" he said hesitantly. He knew the higher ups, if a world away in terms of rank, were no friends to the socialists. Mattei had always been better with intrigues - had he heard something from one of their superiors? But his colleague was only laughing bitterly. "Nenni won't reinstate anything. His people have him by the neck, he can't be seen taking a step back. We will be reinstated, my friend, just you wait, but not by Nenni." A dark look was in Mattei's eyes, one Francesco had seen only rarely. It was the same look he had when another soldier insulted his family, and received a beating for the effort. The same look when they heard the socialists won the election. And now, the look not of defeat, but victory deferred. Mattei met his gaze."

 FD.26.d:0 "Pietro Nenni was nervous, the small folder in his hand suddenly weighing like a boulder. "This time, everything will go as it was meant to," he muttered to himself. The sudden call to the palace didn't sit well upon his mind: when he passed the law for the first, failed, referendum on the monarchy, nothing had transpired from the Quirinale, not even the smallest rumour or whisper. Dead silence. Therefore, it came as a great surprise that, now that he had passed the law for a second referendum to be held, the King had summoned him with all due fanfare.\n\nWhile he waited in front of the closed doors, he thought about it. Did he want to bargain? Was he going to abdicate? Yes! That was it, he wanted to officially recognise the right for the Italian people to choose its fate, free from crowns and shackles. The doors opened, and he entered the room. Umberto II, King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia, stood behind his ornate desk. "Welcome, Prime Minister, please have a sit" the King said, a kind smile on his lips. Nenni opened his mouth to speak, but the King was faster: "Your Ma-" "There will be no new referendum" The politician's eyes went wide. "That's impossible! The parliament has voted!" Umberto's voice and expression became hard: "With the powers given to me by the Albertine Statute, I refuse to promulgate the law, and hereby remove you from your office" "But wha-" "Did you ever consider the implications of such an action? Did you ever think about the consequences of turning from a fascist dictatorship into a socialist one?"\n\nNenni tried to explain, but suddenly two armed commandos entered the room. The King spoke once more, his voice strained by barely contained rage "You are a small man with an even smaller intellect: you may have spent months preparing for this political charade, but I have spent ten years preparing for democracy to return to Italy, and I will suffer no interlopers". Then, he looked at the soldiers: "Bring him away. Tell general De Lorenzo to commence execution of Piano Solo". The soldier saluted: "Yes, Your Majesty!" and brought the former Prime Minister away."

What made them finally take notice was when, the next minute, dozens of Carabinieri in mimetic uniform stormed Italy's political heart.No shots were fired. There was no need: politicians and party officers are not known for their military training, after all. When the first screams echoed in the corridors, there was at first surprise, then worry, and finally, panic.\n\nEveryone started running, to what they didn't know, but surely away from the men in camo uniform. Some, still remembering the days of the underground resistance, quietly slipped into secret corridors littering the ancient palace, but most weren't that lucky. Half an hour later, with Palazzo Chigi and the Parliament secured, hundreds of Carabinieri in more ordinary uniform came in dozens transport vans, filling them with ministers, MPs, party officers, bureaucrats, some still in formal dress, crowded like common criminals and sent to pre-selected reclusion structures. Some MPs from the DC, strangely untouched by the mayhem, protested with the officers now patrolling the empty corridors of what was once the beating heart of democracy, but all got the same answer: "The parliament is closed until further orders, we are not authorised to disclose confidential information".\n\nLess than an hour after Nenni's arrest, the operation was complete, but the true plan had just been set in motion: the gears of an ancient engine, rusted and rigid after years of stillness, suddenly jumped alive as if electrocuted, shedding the rust and revealing the cold, merciless steel beneath it."

It seemed everyone was gathered all at once in the lounge, desperate for any sort of news about the recent political events that had transpired. Dante and all his friends, though it seemed like everyone these days, was a committed socialist. After years of fascism, though Dante knew he never suffered like his parents did under the tyrant Mussolini, the country had transitioned to democracy. Due to the further liberalization of the government and its laxing of political restrictions, Dante and thousands of his fellow students were exposed to ideals they had never heard of before. Ideals like the works of Karl Marx, Amadeo Bordiga, and Antonio Gramsci. Contemporary figures such as Enrico Berlinguer were, miraculously, able to capture Dante and his compatriot's newfound radicalism and channel it into a more tightly honed expression of discontent. But it seems, despite all the political education and organizing on the part of the students, it was all going out the window. But Dante didn't care. For the triumphant moment of the working class had come. Or at least Dante hoped. Because just as easily things could go south, really fast. Hence, the ever overcrowding lobby full of socialist radicals of all-stripes. What was taking them so damn long? And then as if on cue, the screen flashed and the two men Dante was expecting appeared on screen. Dante held his breath as... his fears were calmed and hopes sent skyrocketing through the roof.\n\nHis confident smirk transformed into a wide-smile as Pietro Nenni heralded a new age for Italy. There was Berlinguer, standing side by side with Nenni, the powerful imagery not escaping Dante. The two most popular socialist figures of Italy, standing exultantly next to each other like old comrades, represented the now fully unified working class who were mobilized against the forces of capital. The disparagement political parties now under the single commanding banner of socialist liberation! With a leap out of his seat, Dante gathered his friends around him.\n\n"Now is the time! It is our duty to aid comrade Berlinguer and the working class in ushering in this new era of Italian Socialism!" Dashing out of the building, followed first by a few, then a whole swarming mass of fellow students, Dante made for the nearby town square. There, right in the center, stood a 7.62 metered flagpole. The flag of the old order flying limply in the air. Dante, with all the vigor he could muster, climbed to the top. As he was climbing, he called out for a plain red banner. With the banner of working people in one hand, he tore off the old Italian flag, and replaced it with the banner of the future. Clinging to the top, Dante could see for miles around other squares and poles, the lowering of the old flag and the raising of the red banner. Yet some, if not more, still flew the old national flag proudly along with the banner of socialism. Truly, the peoples' will was ascendant in his country. And Dante couldn't be more pleased."

'The Fronte Democratico is a danger to many of the virtues, namely order, civility and family values, by which Italians should live according to the teachings of the Church. By asking men to openly challenge authority, and to take things into their own hands, Nenni must be considered not only a servant of dark forces but a provocateur, seeking to create social strife which the communists can then use to establish an atheist society..' So it went, for the rest of the page. Marco smiled uncertainly and looked up, just as Nenni clapped him on the back and continued chuckling to himself. The secretary had work to do, but knew better than to interrupt the boss when he was in one of his talkative moods.\n\n"The best thing about it is it's not just the politicians," Nenni was saying now. "So you know how many reports I get per week of priests denouncing me in the churches as a communist? Guess, Marco, just guess." Marco guessed, but the number was larger. "It's unimaginable that they would want us to fail this badly. This is their country too, you know. When Mussolini was trampling over everything the Church held dear, where were these priests? And I don't even want to talk about the Army. Do you know what I heard this week? And this doesn't leave this room." Marco nodded. "They said I was working for foreign forces, a German provocateur trying to wreak havoc throughout society.All this because we fight for the workers, Marco.\n\nBut you know what I also know? That if they have this much complaining to do, then we are hurting them. If the elite has all these words for our action, then we need more action, and faster. And God help me, if we ever give in to these bastards, then all of our work will be undone, twice over. We can only respond to this provocation with more work!

The headline was still just barely legible on one of the scraps - something about Nenni's address to the Army. The bar hand who had been working that evening spoke calmly to the Police. No, Signoro, he had not heard anything unusual, he was inside the entire time and there was a lot of noise. He had served some soldiers, but none of them looked drunk.\n\nIn fact, Davide knew very well what had happened. Some of the soldiers were childhood friends of his; he knew the rest as good men. When they were in for a drink, they bemoaned to him a rumour they'd heard. Nenni was to publish a memorandum in the papers tomorrow, 'reminding the Army of their oath to defend the Government, as was their duty'. It was Davide himself who told them where the leftist papers were sold, where the vendor kept the key, and how they should show Nenni what they thought of his accusations.\n\nDavide felt like a general: giving orders to his troops, then standing back to watch the flames. When the rest of his friends went into the forces he had stayed behind, helping his uncle serve wine to drunkards and prostitutes. Sometimes he regretted it, but not today.

This may seem like an odd choice, but it actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe middle classes are usually the most economically-minded members of society, and they vote primarily on who'll be best for the economy, and, in turn, their own livelihood.

 BN.1.d:0 "The discussion at the main headquarters of the party started to get more heated. With the electoral victory of the Blocchi Nazionali, the high-ranking members reunited to discuss what should be the next steps. The moderate wing argued that the BN should respect the new democratic institutions to consolidate its own power, while the hardliner wing argued for a return to the glory days of fascism without any kind of compromises. After many accusations of "defeatism" and "lack of vision" on both sides, it became clear that there was no real plan or political agenda to follow the victory at the elections. "The political landscape has changed. I stand for the fascsist principles like anyone in this room, but we need to adapt to this new reality. Pragmatism is a necessary evil for our movement to survive." De Marsanich argued.\n\n"Nonsense. The movement is strong by itself. We need to crush these weak socialists and restore order like we did decades ago." answered Rauti passionately.\n\nLauro eventually joined the feud. "I understand that sometimes compromise is necessary but we can't sell our ideals like this. Democracy is the enemy of fascism not its friend!"\n\nEventually, everyone started to scream at each other without coming to any agreement. Rauti even requested Almirante to expel the moderates from the party for "treason to the fascist cause". Growing increasingly tired after hours of loud noise in that hot small room, Almirante slammed his fist into the table. "Enough of this! We are supposed to be the vanguard of fascism, not a bunch of screaming animals." Silence invaded the room, as Almirante finally made his decision. "I already made up my mind about what is the best course of action for fascism and I hope you'll respect my decision as Prime Minister and head of the party.""

Almirante planned for a more informal reunion at the sauna with his colleagues to relax a bit and laugh about the old times. But for a fascist, the duty always comes first. The congress of that day had the objective of reconsidering a coalition with the Democrazia Cristiana, discussing the possibility of a joint legislative agenda.\n\n"While our party still remains strong after the last elections, we may need support from the Democrats for our next projects. Besides, the Socialists could represent a threat and everyone in this room can agree that we don't want them to push their libertine agenda. Right, Mr. Andreotti?" De Marsanichi exposed.\n\n"Uh, sure. Our party appreciates that the Blocchi Nazionale was willing to approach us in the first place. If we can compromise on our...small differences, I'm sure that this coalition could work." Andreotti answered. The two gentlemen engaging in a civilized discussion was a breath of fresh air for Almirante compared to the loud madness from a couple of days ago. "However, the final decision is up to our leader. He'll decide if we move forward with this." De Marsanich said looking at Almirante with a smile.

As far as he could tell, the three were dead to him. All these years, he felt like he was truly alone in this world. But there was a time when he was truly happy.\n\nAfter returning from the First War bitter and resentful, he joined the Blackshirts with the hope that he could make a difference in saving his beloved Italy. That fateful day of October, he marched in Rome with his fellow Blackshirts to demand the King to end the weak democratic government and put a true patriot in power. With the appointment of Mussolini as Prime Minister, he felt like he was part of something bigger. It was the happiest day of his life and he loyally served the Duce for the next thirty years. Full of confidence, he was ready to save Italy from the abyss that was in it because of the traitor Ciano. Democracy won't corrupt the minds and souls of the children ever again. Italy will rise from the ashes with another march on Rome! With a smile on his face, Pietro closed the door to make history once again."

All were ready to execute the plan: storm the Quirinale and force the King to declare the state of emergency and suspend parliament. "Are you all ready to make Mussolini proud?" he said, raising his arm in salute, and all nodded. The group followed the slight slope of the hill, a light, continuous noise in the distance further masking their movements, until they reached the Palace's entrance, guarded by two Fanti dell'Aria of the Honour Guard: with a silent signal, one of the fascists, a decorated veteran of the Russian campaign, knocked one unconscious, while another put a hand on the second one's mouth to silence him. The light noise became more pronounced.\n\nWhile the Blackshirts bound and gagged the two men, the rest surrounded the gates. Almirante made to speak, but suddenly the noise became deafening. A helicopter appeared, bathing the square in artificial light, and dozens of windows opened to reveal the snipers lurking behind. One of the fascists tried to fire, but screamed in pain as he was hit to the shoulder. All others surrendered immediately.\n\nAn officer in high uniform came out of the Quirinale and went to the now-handcuffed Almirante. "Prime Minister, in light of your treason, His Majesty relieves you from your office" he said for everyone to hear. Then, he whispered into his ear: "You are a small man, with an even smaller intellect. You might have spent months preparing this little charade, but the King has spent 10 years preparing for the return of democracy, and he will suffer no interlopers" Almirante looked up, and saw a familiar face looking at him from a protected window. "DAMN YOU!" he screamed at the King, but Umberto didn't react. Then, the officer spoke to one of the soldiers: "Bring him away, perhaps he will enjoy confinement in Ventotene. By the King's order, activate Piano Solo" The soldier saluted: "Yes, commander!" and led the traitor away."

The Third Blackshirt "Ettore Fieramosca" moved silently in the night through Rome's underskirts, looking for their target: the RAI's HQ, where Almirante would have given a simultaneously broadcasted speech, proclaiming the new regime. They had barely reached the gates, when their leader, a young man who had impressed Almirante for his strong faith in fascism, felt something was off as he saw the entrance unguarded, and then he noticed something round and small rolling towards him. "STUN GRENADE!" he screamed to his men, but he had no time to react before it exploded, filling his eyes with white, and deafening him. He stumbled blindly, barely taking notice of the arms throwing him to the ground, but he definitely felt the handcuffs cutting into his wrists, and the shame coming with it.\n\nThe other teams met a similar end: the Fourth Blackshirts "Amba Alagi" couldn't even reach the Prefecture before they were seized by more than a hundred Carabinieri, the Sixth Blackshirts "Eroi di Legnano" took heavy losses when they tried to fight their way out from being encircled near the parliament, and the Eighth Blackshirts "Duce" suffered the same fate when they underestimated the enemy forces defending the armoury of the Polizia Municipale. All across Rome, gunshots could be heard, and the people ran to the windows, only to see dozens of police vans unloading hundreds of Carabinieri, and replacing their cargo with men in black shirts and camo uniforms, some limping, others holding their injuries, but every one of them shared the same expression: shame.

 #Fanfani
 
 christdem.35.t:0 "Victory for Democrazia Cristiana!"
 christdem.35.d:0 "The second ever Italian election after the end of Fascism in Italy have yielded a decisive result: the decidedly centrist coalition of various Christan and liberal parties have secured a majority of Parliament. A formally-dressed King Umberto II could be seen designating the small-statured Amintore Fanfani as Prime Minister, and instructing him to create a new cabinet. The new Prime Minister, who had previously overtaken Aldo Moro as the leading figure of Democrazia Cristiana, has shifted the party somewhat leftwards, promising cooperation and collaboration with the Fronte Democratico on the pushing of their agenda. This significant move has angered many of the more conservative members of the coalition making up the new government, but the dominant position Fanfani holds in the DC has allowed him to maintain this new direction the party has chosen to go down.\n\nIt now lies on Prime Minister Fanfati and his government to guide Italy through the increasingly-tenuous situation in the Middle East, along with the accompanying domestic unrest from the rapidly worsening economic situation Italy finds itself in. Needless to say, the new government faces many problems as it enters Parliament, but that has not swayed Fanfati's promises of success - one characterized by peace, liberty, and democracy."
 christdem.35.a:0 "Viva la DC!"
 
 christdem.51.t:0 "The Shadow of the Sun"
 christdem.51.d:0 "According to the press and television, the person guilty of the Piazza Fontana bombing has already been found: Pietro Valpreda, a known anarchist, was spotted entering the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura building with a large suitcase some time before the explosion. If one were to watch any Italian news broadcast, it would seem like this is an open-and-shut case - Valpreda has a flimsy alibi, a clear motive, and a connection to the crime scene. While many voices of varying levels of influence have criticized the narrative, pointing out its inconsistencies, most of the public, the journalists and the politicians all feel reassured to know that the horror can be easily explained away by pointing at a gang of radical anarchist fanatics - something which Amintore Fanfani is very happy to do, especially during his numerous appearances on national television.\n\nThe reports appearing on the desk of prime minister Fanfani tell a different story. After looking at some particular elements of the case, namely the bags used to carry the explosives and the timers which set them off, police and Carabinieri report point out to the possibility that the terrorist act was, in fact, not orchestrated by the Milanese anarchists. Some photographs, documents and recordings lend credibility to the fact that anarchist cells, dormant in Milan for a long time, have been infiltrated by extremist right wing and neo-fascist groups, with a sort of mesh of personal relationships and political contacts between these anarchist groups and several fascist militants being documented. A hypothesis even emerged that the attack was in fact not carried out by Valpreda, but by another person connected to underground fascist groups carefully disguised to look like Valpreda.\n\nHowever, this is not all. Through Aldo Moro and his extensive contacts in SIM, some top secret documents have reached Fanfani regarding the high possibility of foreign interference in the bombing. Some of the anarchist and fascist militants who were about to be further investigated by local police seem to have vanished into thin air, and some reference to what appear to be codenames for what might very well be foreign operatives pop up in the material that the police amassed. All the officers involved in gathering and analyzing these elements seem to have forbidden themselves from formulating theories regarding where this foreign influence could come from, almost as if they were in fear of the possible implications."

 christdem.52.d:0 "The Prime Minister stepped into the hotel ballroom surrounded by his usual entourage of aides, secretaries, and supporters. The many wings of the party looked back at him, their faces calm but their eyes betraying the uncertain hope they held in him to guide Italy through turbulent times. The political left could offer words of support where they agreed, and plenty of condemnation when they didn't. The political right sent him the nicest letters, when they could be stirred to bother sending them. Such was the price of attempting to chart a center course.\n\nIt had taken nearly five minutes to calm the assembled delegates before he was finally allowed to speak. His prepared speech lay written in cards in his suit pocket, but with the worried glances being shot into him from all sides of the room, it was quite obvious that taking it out would only further fracture the party. With a forced smile and a wiping of his brow, he attempted to speak on how the party could bridge the growing divide both within Italy and indeed within itself.\n\n"Compromise," he began, "Compromise had led to the end of fascism, to the end of political tyranny and uncertainty within Italy. The voters selected me for this office not because of radical ideas and bomb throwing populism, but because all Italians knew that whether they agreed with us or not, the Democrazia Cristiana offered practical, functioning solutions." He wiped his brow again and gave another forced smile. Some delegates even returned it. For the next thirty minutes he continued to offer his hopes for the future of Italy and its democracy, his hopes for party unity and confidence, and his hopes for an end to uncertainty and panic. Perhaps the delegates did not truly believe him, but as long as they could say that they did, it was good enough."

The camera flash echoed across the room, immortalizing the Prime Minister and the politician beside him within the finite medium of film.\n\nOn the left side of the photo stood the Prime Minister, dressed in a fine suit and tie, extending his hand out towards a local member of the Democrazia Cristiana. On the right side of the photo stood that local member, a former farmer and always pious catholic turned local politician for the city of Salerno. Captured in the back of the photo, behind Fanfani and the local politician was the Prime Minister's entourage, a motley assortment of baby faced university graduates turned interns, grizzled party operators, and trusted aides. If one could look close enough, they could see the relief in their eyes at another successful meeting. Few had suspected Fanfani's move to reconcile the Party's left and right would succeed, but all within the party would be glad that it had.\n\nGlancing at the photo, the reporter scowled when he saw that the lighting was off. Crumpling it up, he stuffed it in his jacket pocket and began moving to take another one."

A literal wall of televisions was presented, dozens of different models from not only Italy, but America and Japan as well. Despite the disparity, one thing was consistent. On each of the screens, a recording of the Prime Minister's speech from last night began playing.\n\nA podium stands empty, a member of the Carabinieri stands to the left of it and a member of the Polizia to its right. The Prime Minister walks into frame from the right, the two members begin clapping as he does so, he waves to the camera. The teleprompter screen is briefly visible in the reflection of his glasses. He stands on the stage and smiles, the lighting and editing effects ensure that he appears more photogenic than usual. "Good evening to the viewers both in the studio and at home, I am thankful that across our humble nation the vast majority of not only Democrazia Cristiana voters, but in fact all voters are watching." he begins, still maintaining his composure, "It is undeniable that times have been better, and some have even begun to question the very founding principles of our democracy. To these rioters and criminals within our streets, I can only offer my most sincere condemnation. If you truly wish for change then you can institute it like a normal, civilized member of the population and not as a bomb throwing barbarian. My government has embraced a wide ranging platform of simple, commonsense solutions to the crisis at hand and I will, if you give me just an hour of your time, explain them to y-"\n\nThe speech cuts out suddenly, as the store owner changes the TV's channels to last night's football game.

 christdem.55.t:0 "Meeting with His Holiness"
 christdem.55.d:0 "Despite all of the turbulence and upheaval within Italy, it was undeniable that many things remained consistent. The Catholic Church and its Pope, Paul VI, for example, had been more than willing to meet with the Prime Minister when asked. It didn't take a genius to figure out why. Fanfani could ask the Pope for stability and peace within these troubled times to shore up his government, and the Pope could use the photo opportunity to stress the unity of being both Italian and Catholic, two ideas that had once seemed almost irreconcilable.\n\nThe meeting itself was, to put it bluntly, almost benign in its content, both men clearly occupied elsewhere. The Pope would ask for guarantees of the government to maintain peace and ensure religious freedom, and the Prime Minister would agree. The Prime Minister would ask the Pope to make sure his flock would remain peaceful and equitable even in the face of violence within the streets, and the Pope would of course agree. At the end of the meeting came the most important part, where the two emerged from Saint Peter's Basilica and embraced.\n\nTomorrow, a photo of that embrace would be on the front page of every newspaper in Italy, and accompanying it would be the newest editorial from the Pope, requesting peace not just for the sake of the government, but for the sake of humanity everywhere."
 christdem.55.a:0 "His Holiness only serves to do what is right."
 
 christdem.56.t:0 "Building a New Coalition"
 christdem.56.d:0 "It had taken every year of political experience and grit that Fanfani had to accept the reality that no matter how many flowery speeches and calls for unity he gave, the simple reality was that the Democrazia Cristiana would not unite around him. The Party Right was too apathetic, and the Party Left too divided to ever build the coalition that Italy needed if it was to push forward through such troubled times. With a heavy heart, he had picked up the heavy phone on his desk and placed a call to an unlikely ally. Giuseppe Saragat, leader of the Partito Socialdemocratico Italiano.\n\nAs the two men sat together in the Prime Minister's office, a strange and awkward silence stood between them. In better times it would have been easy for them to talk the night away on topics of policy and politics, but the reality was that Fanfani was the Prime Minister, and the other was only an embattled party leader.\n\nWith some difficulty, the silence was eventually broken, and they began discussing how a middle ground could be formed. Saragat made sure to not let his surprise at the news of Fanfani's decision to move away from his own party show on his face, and Fanfani maintained his composure even during the diciest moment of their negotiations. In the end, a compromise was reached.\n\nThe foundations for Fanfani's most ambitious political gambit were laid."
 christdem.56.a:0 "The good of Italy demands more than just following the party."
 
 christdem.57.t:0 "Fanfani's Reflections"
 christdem.57.d:0 "He sat at his desk, his brow creased as he continued to crunch the numbers of support for the coalition he had been building. To say that the Democrazia Cristiana had been critical of the decision would be... an understatement. The press had been vicious, the voters savage, and his own former allies within the party the most critical of all. It didn't take much to imagine how they would react once tomorrow's paper broke the news of his recent meeting with the king.\n\nMeeting with the king under normal circumstances would have, at best, raised one or two eyebrows from the most radical members of the political spectrum. For years his Majesty had conducted himself with an aura of dignity, one that could only be formed through years of dedicated public service. Under normal circumstances, Fanfani would have had nothing to worry about when meeting his majesty.\n\nIt was a shame that these were not normal circumstances.\n\nHis intentions when meeting with his majesty, especially in light of the meeting with Saragat, were obvious. The BN, no matter how their ideas dispersed, could all still reliantly maintain their faith and support for the monarchy. Attempting to pander to them was a dangerous proposition for the Prime Minister, but one that had to be done. He had no idea how his legacy would look, how his supporters would react, and how his own party would fare at the next election. Whatever happened, it did not matter, for with a triumphant shout, he finally finished crunching the numbers. If everything panned out as it should, he would have his majority."

 christdem.58.d:0 ""Prosperity and peace through compromise, labour leaders and the Prime Minister agree this is the best way forward. Don't take our word for it, listen to from the horse's mouth!"\n\nThe campaign truck slowly drove down the road past the assembled workers, each side of it covered with campaign slogans and posters praising the Prime Minister. Through the speaker system placed on top of it, excerpts of a recent speech were played one after another, with Fanfani's words mixed in with the words of various prominent union officials. For the assembled factory workers, the campaign truck was either an interesting afternoon diversion or an annoyance distracting them from their food, depending on who you asked.\n\nTwo workers in particular, brothers from a small town outside of Naples, listened intently to the truck, even as it pulled away to drive to another factory. Turning to one another, the oldest spoke first, commenting on how glad he was to see the union bosses and the Prime Minister collaborating. A patriotic military veteran who served with distinction in the Levant, he stood as a polar opposite to his left minded younger brother. His younger brother folded his arms across his chest and listened intently, considering what to say. When at last he finally spoke, it was to the surprise of his older brother.\n\n"Despite what misgivings I have," he began, "I must say it is good to see the Prime Minister refusing to blame the violence on the unions. It would be terrible to have the actions of a few bomb throwing radicals put us all out of a job." As he finished speaking, the factory bell rang signaling the end of their lunch break.

 christdem.59.d:0 "The report on the Prime Minister's desk had been disturbing but expected. Following an intense period of review and investigation by a specially appointed commission, the reported findings had long been suspected but not confirmed. Until now. The Confindustria, an employers association and long a pillar of the Italian economy, was hopelessly inefficient as currently run.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, no obvious easy solution presented itself for remedying this issue. Within the report, the commission had offered two possible solutions, each one equally flawed in its own right. The first solution, written by the commission's more left leaning members and idealists, proposed to simply place greater government controls and regulations on the body, in order to ensure greater efficiency. Without a doubt the leaders of the Confindustria would fight such regulations as hard as they could, and it was questionable whether allowing the same corrupt bureaucrats to continue to run the organization would fix anything at all. The other option, written by pragmatists and the commission's old guard, proposed a simple fix. The Confindustria had been fine up until the democratization, they argued, all it would need to get back on its feet was the return of its old runners who knew the ins and outs of the economy. The only problem: that same old guard had been removed for being fascists without remorse. It is certainly doubtful that the population would simply accept such individuals regaining their old power.\n\nAs appalling as the options presented are, a choice must be made. We can only hope that we make the correct one."

 christdem.60.d:0 "For the priests and clergy who served in the Milan Cathedral during the era known as the Cold War, they would forever carry one memory with them.\n\nIt had begun mere hours after the first news came out about the Piazza Fontana bombing. A man dressed in a formerly fine suit, one now caked with dust, debris, and other bits of clutter stumbled into the Church. The clergy looked on with grave concern as he entered, unsure if the man should be in the church or in the hospital. To those present's imminent surprise, the man did not move to pray. Instead, he took the hat off his head and placed it in the center of the Church's foyer, and next to it he placed a simple picture of one of the victims. Out of respect, the clergy placed several candles to mark the spot and assumed nothing more would come of it.\n\nOver the next couple months they would be proven dead wrong.\n\nAt first they came as a trickle. Survivors, family, friends, and anyone else involved. With each visit, the shrine slowly grew. Soon it turned to a flood, as many who had no connection to the tragedy other than a shared sense of hopelessness came and added to the shrine. It grew steadily, soon attracting the intention of not only the press, but even the prime minister himself. In a photograph shown across the world, Prime Minister Fanfani visited the shrine, personally lowering his head in solidarity with those lost.\n\nWhile the shrine eventually was taken down and cleaned up, and for some, even forgotten, the clergy present would never forget it. Decades after the bombing and its aftermath, not a single member of the clergy had even once thought about throwing away the photo taken of them with the Prime Minister."

"Now I am sure many of you are less than pleased to have me interrupt your football game or television drama, but if you'll just lend me a minute of your time, I'm sure you will find it worthwhile. There has been much uncertainty and fear recently over the growing terrorist attacks and violence within our nation's streets. I am here to assure you that the government is doing everything possible to protect our citizens and find the cause of this rampant lawlessness.\n\nThe image changes, and now several clips begin playing in succession of one another. The Polizia are seen on patrol, each one dressed in an impressive uniform and brandishing a rifle. Next an Italian family is shown enjoying a midday meal outside, the children smile and play as the parents look at eachother free of worry. Finally, several successive scenes are shown of various investigators and detectives working, each one carefully and analytically completing their investigation.\n\nThe scene changes back to the Prime Minister who is now smiling at the camera. "As you can see, the government has everything under control. I can promise that we have already begun to get to the bottom of this and it will not be long before we return to normalcy."

If the reporters could have seen their thoughts, perhaps tomorrow's paper would have been quite different.\n\n"No matter how I think about it, I can't help feeling just a little disgust with that man to the right of the Prime Minister. Isn't he a friend of the last Duce, Galeazzo Ciano? Surely such a man's hands can not be completely clean in this whole ordeal, I wish Fanfani would stop associating with him." Saragat thought to himself.\n\n"This entire gesture is ridiculous, we're campaigning for unity when we should be crushing those protesting reds in our streets. If only I had won the last election... I'm sure Saragat must be thinking the same thing." Thought Lauro to himself.\n\n"At least they were both willing to do this. I can only hope the political blowback from the rest of the party won't be too severe... oh, the press wants a photo."

The many banks that compromised Italy's financial sector had, no matter how many promises of potential benefits and concessions offered by the government, stringently refused to work with the Prime Minister's platform of catholic capitalism on his terms. Rather, they continued to demand the right that if they were to work on it with him, it would have to be on their terms.\n\nAs the Prime Minister sat at his desk after another day of fruitless negotiations, his gaze fell on the calendar on his desk. He had known the date when he had woken up that morning. He had known the date when he had gotten lunch with his aides before the next round of negotiations with the Banks. Only now, at the midnight hour, did he truly recognize the significance of the date.\n\nHis term, one which had opened with promises of stability and prosperity and had stuck through thick and thin, was slowly nearing a close. The fight with the banks was clearly not going anywhere fast, not with the next round of lawsuits and ad campaigns they had threatened to kick up. And all the while he was losing what hair he had left dealing with this, many more important issues lay on the back burner. He had never been one to back down from a fight, but surely now was as good a time as any. As he finally broke his gaze with the calendar, he knew what to do."

It is unmistakable that because of his work, many of tomorrow's greatest thinkers, scientists, and military men will be able to look back at the former Prime Minister and thank him for his work. Expanding on such programs is not only a good way to build Italy's future today, but it is also a good way to boost Fanfani's stagnate approval numbers.\n\nWith every bill passed increasing funding for these widely popular programs, Fanfani has ensured that he will be the face of it. At the opening of new school's he will cut the ribbon, at the graduation of new university students he will clap in attendance, and at military parades for new cadets he will be there to salute the soldiers. It is important that every person who has benefited from the program will know firmly that it was the Democrazia Cristiana who made it all possible.\n\nWhile some may look at this with the disgust of a cynic, the people will know in their hearts that it is for the best.

At a podium in the center of the stage, a professor carefully vetted by the man's aides gave a gripping speech to the students in attendance. He spoke of the virtues of moderation and Catholic modesty in the face of soulless communist materialism and hateful fascist nationalism, every syllable going over the head of the thoroughly bored student body. In the back, reporters gathered to snap a photo of the moment of the Prime Minister cutting the oversized ribbon and bow placed before him, a symbolic ceremony to celebrate the opening of the campus's newest building.\n\nFar in the corner of the assembled students, under the cover of an old tree, two of the school's more left leaning students sat observing the spectacle. They joked together and mocked the speech being given, each one equal parts amused and agitated by the professor's dry speech on the evil's of an ideology he clearly knew little about. For them, it was all in all a pleasant enough way to spend half an hour.\n\nEventually the professor stepped down from his podium and the band present struck up the national anthem. With a broad smile, the prime minister received an oversized pair of scissors and moved forward to cut the oversized ribbon. As it split in two, the stage was covered by an outburst of camera flashes as the reporters finally had their shot. When it was all over and done, the two student's before remained seated under the tree. To the annoyance of one, his comrade in mockery had remained completely silent through the entire ribbon cutting.\n\nIt took some pressing, but eventually the man gave his answer in a low voice, not even daring to meet his friend's gaze. "I... I was already to mock it as well, but then I thought about my younger cousin. They don't have enough money to go to university on their own, not without the help of the government.

When you speak of my ideas to them, they all swear that it is like they are hearing them from myself for the first time. You certainly have a bright future ahead of yourself in this party, perhaps when my term ends it will be you who ends up taking my spot as PM."\n\nForlani smiled and looked down at his food, the Prime Minister's words echoing around his head. He had long been swayed by the man's ideas of Catholic capitalism and Christian democracy, without a doubt, and hearing such praise from the man himself was a dream come true... but...\n\nHe had the strangest feeling in the back of his mind, a sort of unease that refused to present itself into view. A most cowardly, traitorous thought ruining an otherwise perfect afternoon. As he looked back up from his meal, he looked over the Prime Minister's face, daring the thought to present itself.

 saragat.1.d:0 "The second ever Italian general election has yielded a decisive result: the leading leftist coalition, the Fronte Democratico, have won a stable majority of Parliament. Italian students can be seen celebrating in the streets, and King Umberto has personally entrusted Giuseppe Saragat as the Prime Minister. In the years after the inceptive election of Italian democracy, Saragat, the head of the more-moderate Italian Social Democratic Party, has steadily garnered his party a leading role in the leftist coalition. With more radical socialist and communist parties reduced to mere coalition partners or expelled from the leftist bloc entirely, and Pietro Nenni, the previous leader of the coalition, seemingly beginning to recede from the once crowning public position, the leftist coalition seems to be more united than ever.\n\nThe question now lies on the newly-formed government to manage the increasingly-deteriorating situation in the Middle East, as well as the ensuing domestic unrest, and to guide Italy once more towards the path of their agenda. In a move that surprised little, the Blocchi Nazioonali and it's related partners have pledged fierce opposition to the FD and all related activity. However, in a much more significant statement, the Democrazia Cristiana - likely because the more-moderate wing of the Fronte Democratico has taken control - has announced that they will be collaborating together to pursue an agenda that accommodates both of the coalition's agendas."

Ever since the Hot Autumn strikes a year earlier, Italy had been embroiled in the worst turmoil it had seen since the end of the war. Violence and terrorism were the order of the day, from both leftist and rightist agitators across the country.\n\nRestoring order to a deeply divided nation seemed like an Herculean, if not insurmountable task.\n\nBut whilst Saragat seemed like a meek, soft-spoken man, there was a hidden resolve beneath his spectacles. Now was his time. Time to not only restore order and heal the rifts of a deeply divided nation, but also to, as a result, create a fairer, more just Italy.

Claiming 17 lives and wounding many more, it was perhaps the deadliest incident yet in the troubled country.\n\nAnd yet, the perpetrators are still unknown, and thus, still at large.\n\nNot helping matters was the fact that many in the Servizio Informazioni Militare (SIM) are believed to be full of agents opposed to the FD's socialist agenda.\n\nThus, a reshuffle was in order. The government could not get to the bottom of the atrocity without the SIM's cooperation, after all.\n\nMany from both politicians and the general public criticized the government's decision to reshuffle the SIM. Some said the government was trying to stack the deck in their favor. Right-wingers and the BN in particular claimed that the government was 'politicising the SIM', and that it would abuse it in order to persecute them and their supporters.\n\nIt certainly was not a good look for the government, with newspapers and broadcasts across the country condemning it.

In other words, a far cry from the mild-mannered, down to earth Saragat. One would think that the two would have clashing personalities, and that they would be like oil and water.\n\nAnd yet, that was not the case.\n\nFanfani, whilst a firebrand, was also a great compromiser, just like Saragat. It stood to reason, after all, considering DC was a big-tent party with many factions. But meeting with him one-on-one, Saragat soon realized that the two men actually had quite a bit in common despite their differing personalities.\n\nThe meeting of the two men lasted quite some time. But by the time both left the room, both had smiles on their faces. Perhaps it was because they were able to get a lot of business done, or perhaps the two men just enjoyed each other's company.

Many moderates were already skeptical of socialism; needless to say, they balked at the radicalism of the Italian Communist Party. However, they formed an essential part of the FD coalition, so Saragat would have no choice but to meet with the leader of the PCI: Enrico Berlinguer.\n\nBerlinguer was certainly an interesting character. In some ways, he was a modest man quite similar to Saragat himself. That said, the man certainly was not wanting for charisma. He was a heartthrob for leftists across Italy, even those who weren't necessarily fans of the communists he was associated with. Perhaps it was because he gave off the aura of an honest, genuine man, who wanted to make life better for Italians. None could ever doubt the sincerity of his intentions on that front.\n\nWhilst Saragat would never be able to claim Berlinguer was a bad person with a straight face, he nevertheless needed him on board during these trying times. The problem was that Berlinguer is a very outspoken man, and he has had some biting criticism of Saragat's government, and its 'inaction' on the issues ravaging Italy.\n\nNevertheless, he was an integral part of the FD coalition.

As has been the case with leftist coalitions throughout history, division was often rife despite their nominally similar ideologies, to the point that sometimes their coalition seemed more fiction than fact.\n\nIf Italy were to have any confidence in the government to be strong and stable, it would need to have confidence in the party running said government to do the same.\n\nTo that end, a meeting was organized between the socialists and the communists in the FD in order to showcase unity within the FD and the wider left. Attended by notables from all the parties of the FD, the rally made it clear that, whatever divisions there may seem to be, FD was a united front. At least, on the issues that mattered.\n\nThe rally was a roaring success! It was widely reported throughout the Italian media.

As one party, and only one party. The PSI and the PCI, along with their many allies, no longer exist; its members, and elected officials, are now simply members of the Fronte Democratico. No ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nSome people from across the FD's various factions were not happy with this development. But the leaders of the FD argued its necessity. Both for making it easier to contest elections, as well as showing to the Italian people that the era of the fractious left was over. Italy needed unity now more than ever.

And drag through the mud the media did. It seemed like the FD could do nothing at all without being raked over the coals by the media.\n\nBut that did not perturb Saragat and the FD. They would not let broadcasters with chips on their shoulders dissuade them from doing what was right. For the party, and for the country.

 saragat.11.d:0 "The family was the bedrock of any society. Needless to say, appealing to the Italian family was critical for any party's electoral success. No party could hope to remain in government without at least paying lip service to 'family values'.\n\nOf course, 'family values' means different things to different people. To some, it's associated with fundamentalism and traditionalism.\n\nNot so for Saragat and the FD. Of course, they obviously supported 'family values'. But to them, it meant more "taking care of the family" than about traditionalism or morality.\n\n"Excellent healthcare for every Italian! Generous pensions for elderly Italians in their golden years! A thorough education for young Italians so that they may become productive members of society!"\n\nThese points underscored the FD's messaging on 'family values'. Every Italian family deserved a fair shot at life. From birth until their twilight years, no Italian family deserved anything less than the best."

 saragat.12.d:0 "The relationship between Saragat and PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer was not always good. But that, perhaps, was due to change.\n\nWith the merger of the FD into a single party, it was more important than ever to show that its leaders were a united front, to both FD members and the Italian public at large. It was for this reason that Berlinguer and Saragat increasingly began to voice their support for each other and increased their cooperation. After all, no progress could be made for Italy when the government could not agree with itself.\n\nSome of the moderates in the party were wary of working with a noted communist like Berlignuer, but they ultimately kept those doubts to themselves. The leftists in the party, of course, were nothing less than thrilled at this turn of events."

And when they did, it went without saying that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.\n\nFor now, though, the question remained... whodunnit?"

It was, to be sure, an annoyance, and not a good look for the government.\n\nThe question remained, though, of how to respond. Some favored letting them rant and then quietly dispersing them. They were peaceful, after all. Others favored cracking down on them harshly; in these fraught times, it was too dangerous to allow.\n\nIn the end, Saragat opted to go with..."

 saragat.18.d:0 "Students were one of the core constituencies of the FD's support base. It was necessary to appeal to them, as without their support, FD would be unable to succeed.\n\nTo that end, Saragat organized a speech at the University of Milan. It was a simple speech, meant to shore up support amongst the students for his government. A speech about how he supported the students, how the FD was tackling the terrorism crisis ravaging Italy, the economy, and so on.\n\nThe response of the students seemed to be positive! And ultimately, that meant that this could be considered a success."

Most notably the FD's large rival, Democrazia Cristiana.\n\nSome hardliners in both parties may grumble about the two rivals working together. But it was ultimately for the greater good. The important thing was that Italians knew the government was a rock of stability in these turbulent times. Come what may, the government would not degenerate into chaos like the rest of the country!"

Nobody could get ahold of him by any means, and it was unlike Moro to just up and vaporize like this. So what was going on?\n\nPeople in DC and FD were growing increasingly frantic as the hours passed with no trace of Moro to be found. Increasingly, the fears that this was a kidnapping grew steadily, which further added to the pandaemonium amongst the parties.\n\nSuffice to say, the investigation was immediately diverted into a manhunt for the missing Moro. Wherever he may be, they had to find him.\n\nAt any cost."

 marsanich.1.t:0 "Victory for the Blocchi Nazionali!"
 marsanich.1.d:0 "The second ever Italian general election has yielded a most unexpected result: the Blocchi Nazionali has just barely secured a narrow majority of Parliament. The conservative coalition, including members from both monarchist, post-fascist, and more moderate right-wing parties, has undergone a series of transformations since the first election since the revival of democracy in Italy.\n\nIn a telling display of the conclusion of the death of Fascism, the moderate bloc of the BN has ultimately began to take a commanding lead over the coalition, and the radical extremes of monarchism and those advocating a return to the Fascism of old have slowly been phased out of the mainstream.\n\nAs a stern-faced King Umberto II appoints Achille Lauro - the leader of the moderate wing of the BN - as Prime Minister, they are now faced with a challenging task: managing the rapidly worsening situation in the Middle East as well as on the homefront, while also preserving the democracy some in the coalition seem so eager to once again destroy."
 marsanich.1.a:0 "Viva la BN!"
 
 marsanich.2.t:0 "The New Strategy"
 marsanich.2.d:0 "A bloody disgrace, a horrible shame, an inhuman tragedy - these and other such expressions did Achille Lauro, new Italian prime minister, use to refer to the recent Piazza Fontana attack. And yet, when asked what the government was planning to do regarding the attack, prime minister Lauro's responds with words that are much more vague. Following the official police reports, the prime minister was happy to point at gangs of fanatics from extremist, most likely anarchist and perhaps communist, cells from Milan and the hinterland - and apart from invoking greater executive prerogatives and giving emergency powers to the police to deal with the matter as they see fit, Lauro hasn't exactly done much to address the bombing, at least publically.\n\nIn truth, Lauro does have a very clear plan in mind. To Lauro, the questions of who placed the bomb in Piazza Fontana and why simply don't matter. Was it anarchists, fascists, communists, foreign spies, Italian agents? Nobody knows, and nobody will probably ever be able to know. Whoever did it was most likely smart and powerful enough to hide his traces and cover up everything long before whoever's in charge of investigations will manage to get even close to the truth. What truly matters is how the bombing can be used. The people of Italy live in fear - a bomb, a bullet, a knife might reach anybody, anywhere - a crazed radical with bloodshot eyes and a red or black scarf might jump out of the shadows at a moment's notice - no train, tram or building is safe.\n\nIn such a climate, what the people need it to feel reassured. They need to hear the calm, strong hand of the state on their shoulders. Restrictive and authoritarian laws are welcomed by the majority, and the minority that protests is decried as an unwilling, or perhaps even willing, ally of the terrorists. In such a climate, governing a nation is easy - you simply need to tell them what they want to hear. Lauro realized this very well, and as the orders to give extraordinary powers to local police commissars are already being sent out, he knows that this is only the first step. Using tension as a weapon, Lauro and his allies plan to shape Italy into the mold they designed - a strong, moral and noble Italy, its children devoted to the King and to the Fatherland, and governed by the steady and firm hand of Achille Lauro."

But, has it given him exactly what he did not. The BN's friends, affiliates, are not viewed as well as the BN is itself, suffice to say. It must be stated these people are but extremely patriotic friends of the state, nothing more.\n\nThrough a wide array of phone calls, letters, and backroom deals the press started printing just what Lauro wanted. People that were once "monstrous extremists, brutish grunts" were now "valiant citizens, patriotic sons of Italy." What more could Lauro ask for? It seemed that to get what you wanted, all you had to do was nudge things in place."

 marsanich.4.d:0 "Lauro had a lot on his plate today, like he did every other day, but the next few decisions were going to be very important. And now, he was being driven to an undisclosed location in downtown Rome, surrounded by two men who had been his rivals in months past. Amintore Fanfani and Arnaldo Fortani, the kingpins of the Democrazia Christiana. The three of them were some of the most powerful men in Italy, and they were going out for brunch. Eventually, they parked outside of some quaint cafe amid one of the busiest areas of the city. As they sat down to eat, they realized they hadn't actually any idea what to talk about. So, they turned to the absolute centrepiece of any conversation, sports! It turned out that Amintore was a fan of soccer too, and watched the same teams Lauro did.\n\nOver the course of the meal, the tensions surrounding them melted away, and they were well into conversation after the eating was done. Political discourse, small talk and of course the odd joke about their own parties made the hour. It seemed that Amintore was a nice guy, and Arnaldo was interesting, as quiet as he was. Lauro had finally enjoyed his job for once, and got some erstwhile friends out of it too. He chuckled to himself, what else to mend political rifts than mediocre food and slightly better talk?"

The Fronte Democratico, a primary rival of the Blocchi Nazionali, has come under soft pressure. Many in the BN have taken it upon themselves to criticize those that have not called out the perpetrators, especially socialist groups. Despite the fact no clear evidence even proving the bombers are socialists, this has made a convenient route to demonize socialist groups that could serve as threats to the BN's rule.\n\nThe FD itself is included within this ring of parties, but no outright statements have been made against it, for fear of the press picking up on it and spreading the BN's blatant usage of the situation to further their own agenda. They may eventually concede, but for now, Lauro laughs knowing his rival bleeds."

With Giorgo Almirante taking a seat back from politics, he has effectively signed over control to Lauro and the moderates. Those original followers of Almirante and even Scorza have been taken aback to these actions and now some even leave the party. Public demonstrations, letters of resignation and complaints all show clearly the frustration present in the party. Despite all their crying and shouting, Lauro likely couldn't care less. In his mind, the more his section dominates, the better. He is even now purposely pushing these members to leave, and outright removing others. Regardless of how detrimental to short-term stability it may be, it will run out smooth, just like the plan says."

 marsanich.7.d:0 "As Lauro was walking onto the stage, he contemplated exactly what to say, what to do and how to act. Why was he doing this? People didn't trust him. Why didn't people trust him? His past. Or, at least, that was the story he wanted to present. Why people didn't like him wasn't a concern, only how he can change their minds. After some excruciatingly long strides, he reached the podium. Looking out across the sea of reporters, a barrage of lights assaulted his eyes. The press was always eager to take pictures. He looked away quickly, lest he go blind. Shuffling his neat collection of papers, he laid them out across the thick mahogany stand. The bleaching white lights that operated above him illuminated only his position in the large dark room. Unlucky, he thought, because he must've appeared quite nervous. Adjusting his collar and clearing his throat, he began.\n\n"...and that, the fair people of Italy, is why you must trust me! For the good of this nation and for the good of its citizens, I am the one who will lead you. My associates, and my own past, must be put aside. I am another son of Italy, as all of you are, and I share your struggles. That is why I must appeal to you for your trust so that our great nation may prosper."\n\nWith those closing remarks, his speech was done. Almost immediately, a wave of questions knocked aside the quietness of the room, asking him to respond to this accusation or that one, some scandal he must solve. He didn't have time for it. Rushing off the stage, his plea would be spread across the empire. For better or worse, Lauro cannot be viewed as an extremist, only as a friend of the people."

 marsanich.8.t:0 "A Most Royal Meeting"
 marsanich.8.d:0 "Another day, another meeting. Lauro had met so many faces, and shook so many hands at this point that it all started to blend. But today, this one was special. This time he would be meeting His Majesty Umberto II, King of Italy. Lauro, like any good Italian politician, is at his heart a monarchist. What else is Italy if not a monarchy? But, he also understands the power the king wields in government, and now must make a good impression. Pulling up in the limousine to the Quirinal Palace, Lauro just had to take a moment to admire its grand architecture. Its magnificent spire sat outside, triumphantly soaring into the sky. It was evident much meticulous effort was put into the construction of such a building. But now was not the time to gaze at carved stone, now, Lauro had to conduct politics. Entering through its grand doors, he was ushered into a finely decorated room without much reception. After some 20 minutes passed, the door opened.\n\nIn stepped the king, followed in close stride by a servant. Lauro hastily stood and bowed. The king, in truth, cared not for such pleasantries and wanted to get down to business, much the same as Lauro. The servant was waved out of the room on a mission to bring the two men tea. The king casually sat down on the couch across from Lauro, forgoing much of any greeting but a cold handshake. Lauro didn't entirely know what to do, but took a seat regardless. There was a still tension in the room for the longest time as the two men eyed each other. Eventually, Lauro broke the ice by talking about the building itself, the furniture of the room, whatever else to get things going. By the time the servant had brought the tea, the two started to indulge in small talk. And, of course, they eventually reached politics. In Umberto's mind, Lauro associates are perhaps an antithesis to the democracy he has helped construct, but he is tolerable. And so, the conversation went on, and so did the cups of tea. The talking only truly ended when the kettle was empty."

 marsanich.9.d:0 "Lauro was really starting to get sick of all these meetings. How many people did he have to talk with, eat with, shake hands with just to get what he wanted? A lot, apparently. And so it went on. Every week, he picked out the nicest suit he had, rode around in the limousine the government gave him, and met somebody of varying importance within the Italian hierarchy. And when it was done, he still had an entire day of work left! Madness, he thought, madness. If this is how frustratingly difficult being prime minister was, he would've never done it. At least today, he got to meet someone a little interesting.\n\nRiding into the Vatican is, technically, entering another nation. But, at the same time it is like crossing the street. Entering through the old and glorious marble structures, he finally received a warm reception. Bishops, cardinals, priests, all the like, greeted him. However, much like many of his other meetings, he was brought into a room and told to wait. The room he entered was not very quiet, however, cameras and their crews stood off to the wall and awaited the entrance of the man of the hour, the Pope. If the Pope liked the prime minister, it would be a comfort to much of Italy, being a catholic nation after all. And so, he entered, followed by a possy of different men in robes and suits. They both put on a good show for the cameras, discussing topics Lauro was told to talk about exclusively. And, at the end of it, perhaps the Pope really did like him, and with it the blessing of God."

 marsanich.10.d:0 "It was a warm, sunny day. Birds were chirping, flowers bloomed, and the sky cleared away entirely. The perfect day for political protests, surely! In Rome, the BN had decided to organize a rally for its members in wake of new tensions throughout the city, being the hotbed of politics within Italy. At the rally, there was more than just the average political guy who joined for something to do. Columns of BN "affiliates" lined the square, the very same affiliates which have been stirring up such a fuss for the past few weeks. Mostly what the average Italian citizen would consider an extremist, the groups caused a racket just getting to the parade square. For Lauro, managing these people was a nightmare, and standing on the stage above them he felt powerless. It is why he must get rid of them, eventually.\n\nA few blocks away, more activity was going on. Differing political groups had taken to the streets in an attempt to decry Lauro and his associates, regardless of their actual relationship. Polizia were dispatched to set up road barricades and control the protests' ever growing intensity. But it was for naught, and all they could do was sit by the side as the mob marched around, destroying cars, getting into fights, everything that makes a good protest. Lauro could hear their shouts, even from so far away, and worried about this rally of his. The current circumstances would have to do, so he thought. He had persisted through worse, and this will be no different."

Every day, police officers were pushed to the brink with constant calls about an attack somewhere or the other. Lauro's desk was being tested by the countless reports of political terrorism and underground movements. Many feared to leave their homes, what if they became the next target of some violent paramilitary? It was clear the situation was only getting worse, and that the fires were only being stoked by some unscrupulous groups.\n\nThe reality was that Italian politics had changed, and changed very quickly it had. Now in part dominated by illegalized movements and paramilitaries, the wars of politics are no longer just fought in parliaments with words and paper, but also in the streets with knives and guns. It was something many refused to believe for a long time, but now every decision made must have its repercussions considered even more."

Laying a wreath of flowers at its base, it would serve as his commemoration to Piazza Fontana. Making sure to have a camera following him, there was an effort to publicize the event and make him more sympathetic in everybody's eye. But, deep down, Lauro truly did mourn the event. The atmosphere of years past had now clearly faded, replaced with one of violence and bloodshed in the name of political gain, and Piazza Fontana was the hallmark of it. When once you could walk the streets at night without fear, families now cower in their homes before it is even dark. Where you could interact with practically anyone without dread of their intentions, now many avoid even locking eye contact with others.\n\nYes, on that day, a piece of Italy died with the many in the explosion. It is now up to Lauro to try and restore that, or at least try. The deaths of those on that terrible day would not go forgotten under his watch, not for a long time."

Everyday, somebody claimed to have finally exposed him for the extremist he is, or that he has been working with some group the equivalent of the Nazis and wishes to bring down hell on Italy. But today, it was different. The morning's timid quietness was suddenly broken by the cry of a paper boy.\n\n"Read all about it! Prime minister orders riot put down! Several injured in fight with police!" And so repeated these words many times, in many parts of the city, and eventually many parts of the nation. The day previously, one exceptionally large protest was getting too close to parliament for comfort. In a manner of minutes, riot boots were on the ground and tear gas canisters were being shot. Panic and chaos ensued, as it usually did, and rioters engaged the police in a brutal battle. Screams and shouts, punches and batons were thrown out across the street. By the end of the short lived carnage, the riot had dispersed and those unlucky ones were left on the street with several broken bones. And as Lauro slowly read the lines of the paper, he felt a mixed bag of emotions. The riot was suppressed, and the battle was over with him having won. But, any action always has its aftershocks. Anarchy is a springtrap always loaded, one wrong turn could be the one that opens it."

And so it went on. Today, he must make another plea to the people for their trust. Despite all his actions, or misactions, many still see him as an extremist, one that wishes to tear down everything Italy now is and spit on Ciano's work.\n\nOf course though, this couldn't be farther from the truth. But the reality of politics was that the truth isn't always what is believed, and Lauro knew this all too well. And so, as it was, he would host yet another press conference. The words he said were not as important as the message they conveyed, and sometimes getting the message through to the press is a nigh-on impossible task. He told them of his undying support of democracy and the values he and his predecessors have held up, of how much he loves the ballot box and not the will of dictators. Perhaps people did listen, but then again, they could very well have just not bothered. Maybe someone would read the speech on page 2, but others would be too busy flipping to the other channel or doing the crossword. He would get his message out, somehow."

You can't exactly fund a rally without the stuff, and you can't run a campaign if your bank account is negligible. So, if Lauro needed some extra cash, where could he find it? With the corporate fat cats, of course. And so a back alley meeting was organized, men from the government and guys from corporate.\n\nWalking into the old car park, Lauro felt as though he was about to be mugged. A sickly dampness wafted around the deteriorating concrete, and it was as though it could fall in on them at any given moment. At the center of the floor, a black van was parked, with three men in suits leaning against its side. To Lauro, this all seemed rather illegal, but whatever paid the bills. Meeting with the businessmen was an entirely different venture. The men themselves were the definition of sleazy, and their business reflected it. Fat cigars rolled around in their mouths, and they wore greasy suits with even greasier hair. The word crime just oozed from these guys, but they were cooperative. After some tense words were exchanged, they reached a mutual deal where Lauro would get his money and big corporate would get their power.

All of these events, he was closely followed by a camera. The point of all this after all, was to make him be seen as strong, relatable and valiant to the Italian people in these trying times.\n\nWhether people actually bought it was an entirely different story. News reels and pictures of the prime minister's visit to a summer festival in Tuscany could be skipped in favour of yesterday's game. But, regardless, Lauro followed the close advice of his public opinion board; who could possibly just be feeding him bullshit while they collect a hefty pay cheque.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The two men entered, both exquisitely dressed, and both controlling shares in some of the most important sectors of the Italian economy.\n\"I'm glad you made it! Come, have a seat, take off your coat."\n\nThe businessmen were evidently in a relaxed mood, taking their good time in sitting down. Lauro was quite the contrary, finding difficulty achieving even a modicum of comfort in his chair, fidgeting with his thumbs as he formed the words in his mind.\n\n"I'm sure you know the government appreciates your time here today, as do I. I was hoping we could try to come to some sort of ag-" Lauro was cut short by the man sitting to his right.\n\n"Yes yes, to make a deal. Do you think we come into these things without previous knowledge of what we're doing, Mr. Lauro?" The man was clearly quite rude, but Lauro needed his cooperation.\n\n"Err.. Yes, well, I will be giving you the land rights to a few profitable Algerian oil fields for your support in a number of contracts." Almost immediately after he said this, the man to his left spoke up.\n\n"Of course, we'll be happy to. Where do we sign?""

 marsanich.18.d:0 "To say the situation Italy faces is god awful is perhaps one of the greatest understatements one could make. Everyday, more riots and protests heat up. And every night, more terrorist activity occurs. Stabbings, shootings, robberies, beatings, brawls, all with political motive. And it seems that nothing Lauro does fixes it. His people hate him more by the day, and even his own government seems to have lost their trust in him. And everytime he reads an article about some kid gunned down on a street corner, or the police engaging with rioters, he loses a bit of trust in himself.\n\nIn the Italy of today, it is built as a house of cards. One little breeze, a protest suppression gone wrong, or a scandal sent out of control, is all it takes to knock it over. Lauro knows this, and the situation is pressed into his mind every time he has to meet with his advisors, or the police chief, or god knows who else. All of them will give him bad news. But despite this, he also knows he must persist, for the good of all of his nation. The cards cannot tumble, lest anarchy gain a stranglehold on Italy."

 marsanich.19.d:0 "All of these protests were really getting on Lauro's nerves. How ignorant could they be to not see what was in front of them? The government was not the cause of their suffering, but the answer. Lauro realized that people like this would never listen to words, no matter how many documents you shove in their faces, no matter how many speeches you make asking them to stop. No, you have to make them stop. And so it was, on a bright, sunday afternoon, that the call went out across the nation.\n\nPolice vans rumbled to life in every major city in Italy. Roadblocks, barricades and boots on the ground were placed in every intersection. Protests were contained and shut down. Almost in the blink of an eye, the riot police were marching triumphantly against a crumbling tide of protesters. The brute force of the Zhdanov cocktail and fist could not best kevlar gear and sturdy batons.\n\nBy morning, a strange sense of momentary calm had washed over the nation. Inevitably though, the press started printing. Lauro did not care, however. Those who threaten Italy would learn just what the answer to their actions was: a fist to the head and a jab in the gut."

Headlines were no longer repeating the words 'riot' and 'protest', and people could go out to the market without fear of being trampled by a mob of college students with signs. What was once a wave of anarchy that swept over Italy now disperses as protesters either go home or get locked up. Lauro's desk could now finally get a rest, no longer topped off by report after report of the hourly March on Rome. Lauro himself could now for once sit back and relax in his office, without being barged in on by a frantic intern with seven new letters from the chief of police.\n\nPublic reactions to the sudden change of atmosphere have certainly been varied. Some respect Lauro finally putting his foot down and teaching those no-good kids a thing or to. Others, not so much. But Lauro was used to it by now. The people don't have to love him, only tolerate him. And as he took that nap he has been waiting for, he rest easy knowing it was finally going according to plan."

 marsanich.21.t:0 "Lauro In The Limelight"
 marsanich.21.d:0 "After months upon months of pleading, press conferences, statements to the public and wishing, Lauro was finally getting what he wanted. A number of phone calls and exchanges with lower bureaucracy confirmed that any notions of him being an extremist have gone out the door, and that he is in the public what he wanted to be all this time, their prime minister. Very few criticize him for his beliefs, and he can show his face in the open without needing an entire security detachment to trail him.\n\nThe government itself has restored its faith in his leadership, and is not teetering on the verge of collapse anymore. Meetings run smoothly and efficiently, senators cooperate with government decisions and party rallies no longer end in bar fights and shanking. The legacy of Hot Autumn is long past. Lauro hadn't looked this carefree in months!"

 marsanich.22.t:0 "The Comforting Fist"
 marsanich.22.d:0 "Many said it could not ever be done, but Lauro has proved them all dreadfully wrong. His popularity is skyrocketing, the people enjoying the state's ever so gentle hand on their shoulder. Riots and protests are a thing of the past, all of them dispersing and going home, as they should've long ago. Radicals and extremists are being hunted like wild game, cornered and brought to extinction.\n\nAll those who ever dreamt of threatening Italy, all those who dared to try it, have been served the answer to such acts. Never again will such things happen, not so long as Lauro is alive and breathing. Never again will citizens be afraid to leave their houses and never again will terrorism haunt Italy's people. It turned out that determination really would see the plan through, just as Lauro envisioned it."
 marsanich.22.a:0 "Peace at last."
 
 marsanich.23.t:0 "Everything Good Must Come To An End"
 marsanich.23.d:0 "Months of calm and peace had now passed in Italy, not one report of political violence or riots threatening to topple government. The police have never had so little to do, Lauro has never had so much freetime, and the press has never had so little to report on. But, as with all good things, it must end one way or another.\n\nLauro was awoken with a jolt as a subordinate slapped a newspaper onto his desk. He almost wanted to lambast the man there on the spot, but his eyes instinctively drew to the headline. "Aldo Moro reported missing, political scene in shock!" Really. Would the work never end? Lauro got up from his chair with a haggard sigh.\n\n"I want a full investigation conducted on this, bring in the chief of police here, we need things to move fast." The subordinate seemed to understand well enough and nearly hopped out through the door, not wanting to catch the prime minister in a bad mood. Lauro tossed his suit on hastily and strided out the door. Much more work was left."

As an economic system, Spirito's corporatism is meant to bridge the gap and resolve the antithesis between the state and the individual in economic matters - the economy must be subsumed by the interests of the State, not a State as a collection of individuals, but as a spiritual entity in which the being of the individual is resolved. Thus, this State of producers must be organized along corporativist lines, allowing for the control of the productive forces and processes. We shall be inspired by this vision in our reforms, continuing Mussolini's path in ensuring that the Italian economy is governed by the Italian state, and not vice versa."

Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, after barely managing to secure leadership within his party, has carried it to victory in the elections - now, the DC stands to shape Italian politics as the new decade begins. Many things must be done in order to weather the difficult situation Italy finds itself in after Piazza Fontana - and the first priority is gaining total control over the Parliament. "

ita_clean_up_the_domus_mariae:0 "Clean Up The Domus Mariae"
ita_clean_up_the_domus_mariae_desc:0 "Despite not being a coalition, like the FD or the BN, the Democrazia Cristiana is far from being unified - despite the facade of unity that is shown off every year at the party congress in Domus Mariae. Several currents, cliques, and wings dominate its inner workings, and the party keeps itself together as a result of a delicate balance between all these different components. In order to truly dominate Italian politics, Fanfani must first dominate DC - and the Prime Minister has two ideas as to how to do that. The first would be concentrating on internal support from within the party, gathering supports from other cliques - the other would be seeking help from other moderate parties in order to solidify our government's stability."

ita_the_moderate_stronghold:0 "The Moderate Stronghold"
ita_the_moderate_stronghold_desc:0 "The young Italian democracy needs to be controlled by the only party which has championed liberalism, progressivism, and all the values that a moral, proper state should have - that party is DC. Prime Minister Fanfani must focus on making sure that all the most important factions of DC are under his wing - either through control or through appeasement. In particular, we must focus on the progressive politicians closer to Moro, the centrists of the Dorotei, and the more right wing figures of the party."

ita_take_over_moros_clique_desc:0 "Aldo Moro is, alongside Fanfani, one of the most public and important figures of DC - and around him a numerous group of politicians has coalesced, made up of the more progressive minded members of the party. While Fanfani himself belongs to this group of politicians, he must now ensure that they answer to him, not to Moro, in his ploy to further his political clout. A few handshakes, promises, and promotions within the party should be enough to sideline Moro and make the progressive wing of DC depend entirely from Fanfani."

ita_control_the_dorotei_desc:0 "Named after the Santa Dorotea convent in Rome, the Dorotei are sometimes considered the centrist grouping of DC - a sizeable number of politicians who are moderate liberal conservatives that are skeptical of leftist parties. Somewhat hostile to Fanfani, the Dorotei can still be reasoned with as long as we promise them to pass legislation favourable to their interests - namely, a strengthening of relationships with the Church and economic manoeuvres to help the industrial upper and middle classes of Italy. Those who don't want to reason with Fanfani, meanwhile, will be condemned to irrelevance within the party."

Staunchly opposed to Fanfani, these are conservatives who resent the progressive turn which Fanfani promises, and are much more friendly to the right wing parties. The only way for Fanfani to get them to play ball is to promise moderation in regards to his progressive policies - instead pursuing a centrist agenda of limited intervention. While it's not exactly what Fanfani has in mind, it will be necessary to ensure unity within the party itself."

Whenever they turn on the TV or open a newspaper, Italians will find the calming smile of the Prime Minister - whenever they listen to the radio, they will hear his reassuring voice. Fanfani and the DC must dominate the media - and to do so, we must ensure that our control of RAI and other media outlets allows us to truly let our message reach the people."

The vast majority of upstanding Italians is of the same opinion, that these violent outbursts are simply unacceptable in our society - and we must make sure that they know that Fanfani shares their sentiment.

The bad spell that has befallen us in the last few months is well on the way to being fixed by Fanfani, DC, and our government, so there is absolutely nothing to worry about.

This might prove extremely useful in bringing peace to the country once more - the priests shall deliver their good word of nonviolence and opposition to communist materialism and fascist extremism to the masses, hopefully turning public opinion even more against these radical ideologies."

By supporting Saragat and negotiating with him as the leader of FD, we will be able to ensure that the PSDI and the social democrats in FD gain the edge over the socialists, and thus open up to the possibility of an alliance between us and FD."

By strengthening our commitment to the Italian monarchy and its institutions, we can attempt to show the moderates of BN that we're not dangerous subversives, but actually the best option to maintain the strength and prestige of Italy in these hard times."

Our party played a key role in transition to democracy - and under Fanfani's helm, it has managed to cement its control over the country. The future looks bright, and most of the Italian population, even though who are most bitterly opposed to us, have started to get used to the idea that DC, the White Whale, is here to stay, and it will dominate Italian politics for years to come."

We of the DC have the reigns in Rome, and we will work to achieve our goals for the country, but please, remember that if we are pushed against by those after their own gain, we will be able to achieve nothing. We call on all those interested in a better Italy to support us at every level of government whenever elections are held in the interest of creating a stable and united front for progress. I would remind all those who would protest this call, those of the BN and FD, that the people of Italy have given their mandate to us, and they would see it fulfilled.

Still, it will require some rather extensive reforms of our current policies if we hope to achieve the needed changes quickly. Taking it slow might work, but we now have voters who hold us accountable. Our experts have already begun drafting initial proposals for our first phase, namely devaluing the lira. If we manipulate our own currency just right, our exports should explode. Perhaps even more substantial will be the significant incentive our people will have to rely on imports when we have our own products that work just as well.

Carried over land on roads and over seas by boats. The only major difference in how we conduct trade compared to our Roman forebears is that we possess the power to soar through the blue sky like eagles in our steel airplanes.\n\nIf we want to have an export industry that rivals the major powers, then we will need to pour all the funds we can muster into our roads, airports, and docks. Of the three, the airports should have the highest priority. After the damned Atlantropa forever destroyed our access to the Atlantic our seaborne trade has decreased significantly, only kept alive by our control of the Suez. Airplanes on the other hand have no such restrictions, and will surely be the transport method of the future."

The money that American, Japanese, and German investors among others will start to pour into our hands and they rush to invest in our new economic hotspot will go a long way indeed.

In a democracy as young as ours, making sure that this group that can exercise far more power than they often realize understands that we will fight for them better than any fascist or communist is crucial. We will talk to their union leaders and their spokesmen in the coming weeks to assure them of this.\n\nCapitalism is often cited as the bane of the working class, but this is a statement born of ignorance.

A particular issue the DC has been forced to grapple with it the fact that capitalism often promotes behavior that is decidedly immoral from a religious point of view. That's where the idea of Christian Capitalism comes in. The desire to profit without causing harm is a key tenet of this philosophy.

Plaques will be set up, portraits of those who died in the bombing will be hung on the walls of the prime minister's residence in the Palazzo Chigi and the President's at the Palazzo del Quirinale. There will be time for changes and debates soon enough, but for now, the people of Italy stand side by side in the wake of tragedy.

Was there outside support? What was the goal? At present there are many subversive groups who may have perpetrated this heinous crime. The fascists, willing to kill in order to bring back their old regime, or maybe the communists, eager to take advantage of the national turmoil to back their agenda.

Across from and between both representatives sat Fanfani, who had called both of these two partisans in order to hammer out some sort of arrangement regarding the precarious civil situation within the country. Piazza Fantana had made it clear that the growing tensions between political groups was becoming a clear danger to state stability. If communists and fascists pushed each other too far... Fanfani didn't need to spell it out for the two gentlemen. As the night wore on it was clear that nothing concrete had been established, but, Fanfani thought to himself as he watched the cars pull away, they had agreed on a second meeting.

Or see the many new neighborhoods of government-funded housing programs that now dot cities from Sicily to Lombardy. We have even given incentives that allow even our poorest citizens to pull themselves into a better life. Of course, the people remember the good we have done when it matter, we will make sure of it.

Rather than presenting ourselves as brutes only interested in our own gain at the expense of all others, Italy shall now strive to find its place in the world standing beside its partners in trade and diplomacy. Diplomacy and trade are not zero sum games when played correctly; they can lead to the benefit of both players when one is willing to play honorably and amicably.

For whatever further success the empire marches onwards to in the future, the hard work of DC and Fanfani in laying the foundation will be at credit."

In fact, we not only are we recovery, but we have once more begun to remember the warmth of prosperity. Straddling the line between hardliners and rabble-rousers within both FD and BN, our DC has managed to bring the people together better than they ever could have. With new purpose and a forward-looking spirit, we have boosted our exports, strengthened the empire, and relieve the burdens of the common people. We have made new friends and rekindled old alliances and the prospects of future relationships are high. We have no one to give thanks to more than God, who has always led us along the right path of success and victory."

Just because they have found success with their methods does not cancel out the possibility of us finding success with our own path, and perhaps we shall reach even more than they ever could. The Americans have a very market-based system compared to ours, and while we are certainly not socialist, even we balk at allowing private corporate interests so much influence and power. Other nations may have models that work just fine for them, but perhaps simply transplanting what works in America into Italy is a foolish notion. We can find our own way to success, as we Italians have always done since the days of Rome."

Indeed, it seems that the future is almost certainly destined to be one of electricity. If that is to be so, then should not the people of Italy benefit from its control? Private industry is both tolerated and promoted by DC, so long as it does not hurt others, but leaving something as vital to the people as fundamental as this is in the hands of profit driven men, however well intentioned, is unacceptable. No, if the primary duty of any government is to secure the well being of its citizens, then public ownership and oversight for utilities seems to be a necessary step. A new nationalized enterprise, ENEL, will be established to fulfill this step in securing the general welfare of the public."

A good tax system must be a careful balancing act, between allowing an individual to keep their hard-earned wealth as much as possible and keeping wealth in the hands of the state for the purpose of general welfare and maintenance. The current tax system is not a successful example of this balancing act, but it can be with enough tweaks. We aren't communists, we have no desire to redistribute wealth, but that doesn't mean we have no need for revenue. On the contrary, our social policies will require some tax increases in some areas. Still, we can hope to offset this with well-planned tax breaks and incentives for economically productive activities and programs. If we achieve our goal, the people of Italy will have no cause for complaint over how we collect our due money."

Ruling over an increasingly unstable state, Habash continues to champion a one-state solution to the Levantine problem: Stressing socialist values, secularism and democracy in a land thus far defined by opportunism, sectarianism and violence. The ANM has cut all ties to the Italian government, nationalizing colonial assets after a long-winded denunciation of Italy's neo-colonial ambitions and fascisitc government.\n\nThe ANM's rule is hardly secure. Both jewish and conservative arab paramilitaries remain in active revolt against the government in Jerusalem, and sectarian violence has been all but exacerbated with the introduction of new ideological currents to the region. Thus far Habash's response has been ill-defined at best and non-existent at worse, in fear of further splintering his own base of supporters. It appears that increasingly authoritarian measures will need to be taken in order to return the region to any semblance of stability, measures that Habash himself is unwilling to enforce as of yet. If violence continues to escalate, however, there is no telling as to what the ANM regime will be forced to do to stabilize the region once and for all.\n\nWhatever happens, this is certain: Italy has lost its last vestiges of influence over the Levant.

Jebril gave a short address the next day to a small crowd of supporters and soldiers: Declaring that Palestine would finally be liberated, and cleansed.\n\nRuling over a regime that managed to mobilize Arab suffering into an efficient and dedicated organization towards the purpose of establishing an Arab state, Jebril, the angel of death to his most rabid supporters, intends to uphold the essence of the PLF's mission on a national level, ruling not by petty subversive democracy but by terror and by pride.\n\nEvery day rumors of massacres and cleansing campaigns launched across former jewish territories crawl out of the isolationist hermit state in Jerusalem, whose only real interaction with the world at large boils down to long bills of arms shipments: The sound of screams is only drowned out by the cackling of bullets, and the blood is not in Colombo's or on Jebril's hands alone, but seeps through, and stains our own fingers."

Now in control of his Kingdom, Stern has seen it fit to declare a campaign of vengeance against the Arab natives and Italian settlers of his new Kingdom.

Begin's consolidated regime officially strives for a Jewish state that spans the Sinai and Transjordan, is unwilling to compromise or negotiate with Arab organizations, and is moving rapidly to enforce a system of segregation of non-Jewish minorities and coercive settlement of Jews across their new state.\n\nAlready, signs of a determined Arab resistance have sprung up across Israeli lands, and only seem poised to grow in strength and determination as Jerusalem continues to impose policies aimed at curbing Arab nationalism.

He had his fair of successes: Rising through the ranks of the Regia Marina, to the Admiralship of the fourth naval division, and then even further. To be frank, he did not know if he could consider his most recent appointment a success.\n\nHis deployment to Dubai was reportedly coveted by the ENI's suits, and came as a surprise even to himself, although he should have known better. With Ankara on the offensive, the balance of powers across the middle east had shifted significantly, and Italian authority needed to be reinforced and unquestioned. Under his firm hand, Dubai would be turned into an anchor of the Empire's authority. He had served his country well at sea, and now he would have to serve it from the office: His discipline and dedication unchanged.\n\nGiuseppe Oriana spent the rest of his day in various meetings. With the Emirs, with the ENI, and with the Admiralty. He had scarce time for the mannerisms of the first, could not bear the second, and barely felt at home with the third. Admittedly not seeing himself as some great mediator, the Admiral nonetheless knew what each of them wanted, and he knew just how they could help him get what he needed.

Mattei had his eyes on the province's governorship for years, and yet today was the first day in his tenure not just as Chairman Mattei, but as Count of Dubai.\n\nThe Emirs proved old-fashioned but impressionable, and to a degree, even approachable to the otherwise stern negotiator. ENI leadership conferences breezed by as symbolic confirmations to every decision Mattei put on the table, and even the Admiralty offered a confused sort of approval of the vigor with which the man conducted himself and his governorship. Regularly conducting talks and meetings with members of all three factions, Mattei somehow managed to tell each and everyone one of them exactly what they wanted to hear. The natives would see more rights gained and restored. The Dubai project would finally be materialized to its potential and beyond. The Regia Marina would reign dominant east of Suez. Best of all, the man knew that it could all be reasonably accomplished with drive and with capital.\n\nRelocating from his office as Chairman of the ENI to the rather drab government outpost nearby to the port was simple enough, and the man managed to maintain his sense of style in the cramped office building he was offered with the job. What he truly missed, however, was the sight of the Persian gulf greeting him from behind shimmering windows. Occupying himself instead with the melody streaming through radio, he began writing a letter headed for Rome, congratulating the Duce on his taste in governors."

 POLITICS_Augusto_De_Marsanich_DESC:0 "Among the many politicians of the BN who can boast a career dating back to the days of Mussolini, few can rival De Marsanich and his many years serving in politics. Serving as a member of parliament since the 1920s, De Marsanich held numerous offices before, during, and after the Second World War - and as the Duce died and a new one rose to take his place, De Marsanich immediately supported him and his projects. An old wolf of politics, De Marsanich knows that things change, and holding on to old symbols and ancient slogans is pointless - power belongs to the shrewd.\n\nOver the years, De Marsanich was fundamental in weaving together the BN from the remnants of the old PNF and other right wing groups, while Almirante was more preoccupied being the public face of the new party. However, with the catastrophe of Valle Giulia and the chaos of the Hot Autumn, the divisions within the BN threatened to rip apart De Marsanich's creation. Almirante had to go, and the party had to be taken into a new direction, one more willing to defeat the DC and the FD by their own rules - and De Marsanich, the grey eminence of the BN, was the best person to fill that role.\n\nPromising a return to law and order and the end of the red menace threatening Italy, De Marsanich appealed to the most base sentiment of the Italian populace - fear. By painting a grim picture of a nation in jeopardy, De Marsanich was voted in as the new Prime Minister to defend Italian democracy from itself - a leader of the people, an upholder of morals, and most of all a devout patriot. De Marsanich is all these things and more, but how he intends to save Italy from itself, is yet to be fully seen."
 POLITICS_Amintore_Fanfani_DESC:0 "Opinions about Amintore Fanfani tend to be varied, but there's one thing all agree on; that few can embody the soul of DC, with its infinite contradictions, better than him. Born into a poor family, Fanfani made a name for himself as a bright student and a professor of economics, but also as a staunch supporter of fascism. A devout Catholic, Fanfani at the time devoted his efforts to bridging the gap between the social doctrine of the Church and the fascist regime, even signing his support for the Manifesto of Race in 1938 and the other racial laws of the time.\n\nAs the years passed, Fanfani grew more and more disillusioned with fascism, drifting towards Ciano and his liberalizing politics. He was one of the chief architects of the DC, and eventually ended up as one of the leaders of the progressive current of the party. Opportunistic, shrewd and guileful, Fanfani always employed a smoke and mirrors approach to politics. A masterful negotiator, he was the perfect man to become the face of the DC after the crisis of the Hot Autumn.\n\nWith DC's victory in the elections, Fanfani is now free to openly play his political games. Behind the calls for moderation, progressivism and a fair and moral society, the Prime Minister knows that he is the only thin line standing between Italy and utter catastrophe. Compromise is viewed by many as a drawback, but for Fanfani, the Purebred Horse of DC, it is a weapon in his arsenal. The political machine of DC is the only one that can control Italian politics. Opposing parties, both right and left, will learn that the only way to survive in this house of cards is bowing to Fanfani's vision. A new director has entered the Italian political stage of Italian politics, and one way or another, he'll make sure that the whole orchestra plays to his tune."
 POLITICS_Giuseppe_Saragat_DESC:0 "Until just a few months ago, to most Italians Giuseppe Saragat was only one among many politicians making up the FD. Born into a middle class family in Turin, Saragat is almost the polar opposite to Nenni and his firebrand leadership, despite the two of them having a lot in common - both were exiled during the years of fascism, and both came back to rebuild an Italian left from the ashes. However, while Nenni fought his battles for democratic socialism, Saragat, with much less ado, rallied around himself the moderates of FD.\n\nWith the end of the fascist era, what the people needed was a reformist, a clean break from the past - a leader like Nenni. However, things have changed - and Italian democracy is already threatened from all sides. The chaos of the Hot Autumn and the recent wave of extremist terrorism have shaken the conscience of many, and as calls for moderation and peace rise from all side of the political spectrum, Saragat was the perfect candidate to become the polite and friendly face of the left.\n\nBy appealing to moderates and centrists, Saragat was able to paint himself as the candidate of peace and reconciliation - exactly what much of the Italian populace wishes for. Still, many are displeased with the new Prime Minister, especially in his own party. The growing radical faction of the FD is alienated by Saragat's alliance with DC, and despite all the promises, the violence in the streets of Italy shows no sign of stopping, rather appearing to escalate by the week.

 POLITICS_ENR_MATTEI_DESC:0 "Long before beginning his tenure as Governor of the Gulf, Enrico Mattei was one of the most powerful men in the Empire. Known for his disdain for politics and his little sympathy for fascism, Mattei spent his whole life doing business - from a humble start, he soon entered AGIP, the Italian state's oil company. There, he rose through the ranks, climbing the company's hierarchy before becoming its head just after the end of the war. Yet, Mattei's ambition was far from being satisfied.\n\nAs the Empire grew massively during the war, it found itself in control of a staggering amount of rich oil reserves. A new situation required new methods, new technology, new organization, new trade deals - more wells, more refineries, more workers, more money, more oil. AGIP grew under Mattei's direction, until it was finally reorganized into ENI, an industrial and financial behemoth capable of standing toe to toe with Japanese zaibatsus. From his new headquarters in the Gulf, Mattei watched his own empire grow, becoming the main architect of the Dubai Project - a shining city in the desert, which began as a pet project of fascist colonialism and turned into a capital for Mattei's oil kingdom.\n\nAfter the Italian victory against Turkey, Mattei made another grab for power, and pushed for his nomination as Governor of the Gulf. As the oil king's rule was recognized, his plans for reform in the country are already becoming reality, as he brings the local emirs into the colony's government, while at the same maintaining a cautious friendship with the Saudis - something his critics often point out. With Dubai firmly in Mattei's hands, his ambition has been given new and powerful tools - after all, if ENI prospers, Italy prospers, and now ENI's six legged dog roars a flame that burns brighter than ever."
 POLITICS_GG_ORIANA_DESC:0 "For many in the Regia Marina and in all of Italy, Giuseppe Oriana is the archetype of an officer and a gentleman, something which attracts towards him admiration and envy in equal amounts. Serving with distinction in World War Two as a lieutenant, Oriana was again and again at the forefront of the Italian navy's greatest victories in the Mediterranean, rising through the ranks before finally becoming admiral after the end of the war.\n\nKnown for his effective style of leadership and his attitude towards innovation and modernization in the nautical arts, he soon became disliked in the upper echelons of the Italian government as an outspoken critic of fascism. Eventually, Rome found the perfect place to employ Oriana's talents, one as far away from Italy as possible: the Persian Gulf. Leading the Regia Marina's Fourth Naval Division, admiral Oriana successfully eliminated piracy from the region, allowing the Gulf to prosper and the Dubai Project to continue.\n\nHowever, things took a turn for the worse. With the Italian defeat against Turkey, a shockwave of instability spread across the Middle East, and as the local emirs become more and more intolerant of Italian rule and turn to Riyadh instead, Oriana was named governor of the Gulf, as his Fourth Naval Division is the only force strong enough to provide stability in the region. With the Dubai Project now coming to a crashing halt, Oriana must do whatever necessary to maintain order - quickly understanding that the emirs' tyrannical and petty rule is the greatest obstacle in his path. Even as a storm approaches from the desert, admiral Oriana is ready to withstand it - and should everything truly fall apart, the new Governor knows that a captain's duties include going down with his ship."

 POLITICS_Achille_Lauro_DESC:0 "'O Comandante. For his supporters, an emblem of respect and praise, for his enemies, the name is an ironic joke, a pretentious title with little behind it. Whatever you call him elsewhere though, in Naples they call him 'Mayor Lauro', and you had better have some respect in your voice while saying it. He is beloved by many and reviled by some, and for better or worse, Achille Lauro is now the second prime minister of a new Italy.\n\nAs owner of the Flotta Lauro that gave jobs to much of Naples, Lauro found it easy enough to transfer his business success into political power. Further helping him was his close friendship with the Ciano family. A man of the people despite his extreme wealth, Lauro endeared himself to the voters as president of the revered Naples football team and promoted public welfare projects that gave housing to the poor and jobs for the workers.\n\nIdeologically, Lauro has been considered a mixed bag, a man of contradictions. Unlike others in his party, Lauro has been a strong supporter of democracy in Italy, putting him at odds with fascist holdouts within BN. Lauro is a monarchist at heart, and has a warm relationship with Umberto II. Hewing back to his days as mayor of Naples, Lauro has championed numerous populist economic and social reforms, vowing to stamp out the last vestiges of anarchism and communism within Italy while offering alternative economic policies to better the lives of the everyday worker. Lauro's work is cut out for him, Italy may be destined for greatness, but it will require a firm hand and an iron will to achieve them.

Despite his obvious preference for the DC moderates, Umberto II has refrained from any undue interference in the democratic process, and eagerly awaits for the moment when he'll be able to appoint the winner as Prime Minister, and finally return to the ceremonial role that any King or Queen, in his opinion, should fulfill.\n\nAfter all, if your King orders you to be free, what can you do if not obey?"

 itademdiplo.1.d:0 "The atmosphere was solemn at the Camera dei Deputati, the Lower Chamber of the Italian parliament, where the entire parliament had been summoned for a common session of both Chambers. King Umberto II sat on the chair usually reserved for the President, at his sides were the Presidents of both the Chamber and the Senate, and the entire parliament, almost a thousand people, was silent, for the Prime Minister, sitting on the chair right below the King and surrounded by his ministers, was scheduled to announce the new foreign policy of the Kingdom. [ROOT.getleader] stood, facing the assembly, and feeling the King's eyes burn holes into his back: he knew that the King's support depended on whether he could truly protect the Kingdom from the enemies lurking outside, so he had to make a good initial impression. He nervously cleared his throat, gave a last look to his papers, then commenced.\n\n"Honoured members of the Parliament or, in the ways of our ancestors, Patres Conscripti! Today is a momentous day for our young democracy, as we shall decide the place our beloved Kingdom will take among the great powers of the world, as it should have always been, and as it will always be from now on!" A small round of applause from his majority, silence from the rest of the hemicycle. "After twenty years of isolationism, decided by cowards who could only try to avoid being washed away by the newly rising tide of freedom, we shall look outside! For the first time in decades, this government will make contact with the nations in Europe that still have to see the light of democracy, or have been forcibly blinded to it. We shall fight alongside them against those who would extinguish our flame! A new dawn has risen for Italy, and it will far outlast the night we leave behind our shoulders!"\n\nThis time, the applause came from the entirety of Parliament, even the opposition MPs begrudgingly clapping their hands, though for [ROOT.getleader] the greatest satisfaction came from the quiet clapping he could hear coming from directly behind him. As he sat down to let the Minister for Foreign Affairs speak in detail, he knew he had set the first stone."

Though well-kept, and patrolled by a small garrison from Italy, it showed - as everything in Romania these days - the passing of time, with a bit of plaster falling and some ivy growing on the walls, giving it an air of placid laziness. Until a few weeks ago, the most activity one could see there was a few Italian expatriates visiting the embassy for documents, or the annual courtesy visit from the Romanian minister for foreign affairs.\n\nNow, everything has changed.\n\nThe entire building has been renovated by a cadre of architects, and colourful Carrara marbles shine on the new, monumental stairway and in the graceful columns supporting the neoclassical façade. Even the inside has been completely renovated: engraved mahogany furniture, sporting those intricate wooden mosaics so loved by Charles Albert, embellish the official meeting rooms, while in the corridors, precious glass vases from Murano peek out from equally valuable showcases.\n\nEven the personnel has been overhauled, with more than forty new diplomatic officials being admitted, among which are economic, military and political attachès, and a cadre of bureaucrats and entrepreneurs. The Italian embassy in Bucharest is now a shining beacon of beauty and efficiency in the beleaguered East, and if everything goes as it should, soon it will bring light to all of Romania."

The last had been King Edward of England in 1949, and it had been a dull meeting, with relationships between Italy and the Einheitspakt already strained... Valets, chamberlains, butlers and maids moved with practiced hurry through the long corridors as they prepared everything to perfection, while in the basement, vans filled with the best delicacies from across the Empire unloaded their precious cargo: wine from Veneto, grapes from Athens, coffee from East Africa and many, many others, in preparation for the grand banquet.\n\nThe next day, the Romanian monarch arrived in Rome: while the governments of the two nations started talking about alliances, treaties and incentives, the two monarchs retreated into Umberto's private study to talk about more... delicate business. Everyone knew the one holding the true power in Romania was the King, and that's exactly where Umberto II came in: he believed, as Michael was a moderate at heart, and strongly admired his Italian counterpart for having managed to restore democracy to his country, that with enough effort, he could be set on the same path. When both Kings were seated, a coffee on the small table set before them, Umberto smiled courteously towards his guest: "Dear Michael" he began, "There is so much we have to talk about...".\n\nThe meeting lasted well into the evening, but when the two Heads of State presented themselves to the press, everyone could notice Umberto's triumphant smile, and their joint declaration about "common views" and "the Crown ultimately serving the people" left little room for doubts on the meeting's results."

We are informed now that the Romanian army is working with the Italians to draw up cooperation arrangements, in the event of a German invasion of the country.

In the years of Hungary's entry into the Pakt, with all the erosion of Italian influence that followed, and then Hungary's abrupt exit from the alliance, a number of Italian businessmen and powerbrokers remained in the city, albeit operating at a far lower level. Now these men, resilient enough to survive the harassment of the Volksbund and the cold shoulder of the government, shall be the germ of Italy's new influence in Budapest.\n\nThe first matter of business, naturally, is to reach out to these exemplary Italians and entice them to cooperate. Though surely solid patriots all, these men will be encouraged by a simple promise. Should Hungary become a friend of the Italian Empire, they will be well positioned to displace the German business establishment and become the new masters of the Hungarian economy.\n\nTo these sweeteners, we must look to the Hungarians as well. The Imredy regime, even as it despises the Germans, is not inclined to cooperate with a newly democratic power such as Italy. We shall have to be sly in our efforts, working to bolster the Hungarian economy whilst undermining the government.

The Germans despised him for his well publicised views on the Jewish question, but as the former Regent's son, he was too popular to attack openly. The man was no liberal democrat, of course. But he was the best candidate to enact the destruction of national socialism in Hungary, and to do so without bringing about societal collapse.\n\nThe Deputy Consul set out some conditions for Italian assistance. Should István become regent, the Italian government would expect a process of democratisation, to be overseen by Rome directly. Every milestone met in this process would be rewarded with further economic and military cooperation. And, naturally, this conversation had never occurred. It would be preferable that the Hungarians believe their favorite son had won out on his own. István looked back at him, bemused, while the conditions were set out.

Every so often the 'fucking Italians' were mentioned, and all those hours became worth it.\n\nFrom the reports gathered by Bianchi and the others, it was clear that the Germans were planning something. They had been receiving funds from Germania for an unspecified period of time - Bianchi guessed it was a number of years, from the context of the discussions - and mentions of Hungarian military and government personnel were becoming more frequent. Bianchi was paid to listen and report, not make political judgements. But he knew, as did every agent he worked with, that Italy would have to move quickly to push its interests in Hungary. To fail to do so would invite the Volksbund to take a far greater role in the governance of Hungary, and killing any remaining hope for Hungarian democracy."

As soon as the camera was lowered he brought an end to the handshake, peering darkly at his interlocutor. The other man, an Italian businessman with longstanding ties in Hungary, had in the past weeks become a representative of the Italian government in Budapest. His grin remained, and the Minister forced himself to make some strained small talk. After a few minutes of trite nonsense, Reményi-Schneller excused himself. "Government business" called, he insisted, barely attempting to make the lie sound believable.\n\nThe Minister entered his office and locked the door behind him. In normal circumstances, today's events would have been a victory for any Economy Minister. The Italians had pledged to buy up Hungarian grain in bulk, without pressing their advantage too thoroughly, and in doing so had offered a lifeline to the Hungarian economy. A damned shame that the circumstances were not normal. Reményi-Schneller had clawed himself into power as a friend of the Germans. After his country left the Pakt, he had stayed in the cabinet only through lack of a successor. And today, his job had forced him to shake hands with the enemy.\n\nHis mind raced.

His beautiful Lancia Flaminia - the mainstay of the Italian ambassadorial corps - looked almost out-of-the-world as it passed the overgrown dirt road cutting the enormous refugee camp: thousands of desperate men, women and children had fled the Burgundian invasion only to find poverty and despair, and the view of the gothic Cathedral was obscured by the thick smoke coming from dozens of camp fires and wood stoves.\n\nWith a sigh, the seasoned diplomat focused once again on his task. Personal feelings and pity couldn't distract him from the orders he had been given, and he would see them fulfilled: with Goering's Germany on the warpath once again, Italy needed allies, and what better ally than someone who hates the Germans with their entire being? Convincing France to join the Italian effort to contain the Reich would be easy, but Domizio knew that turning hate for a common enemy into something more... meaningful wasn't that immediate.\n\nFinally, his car stopped in front of the Hotel De Ville - once Bordeaux's town hall, now a poorly-equipped headquarters for an equally poorly-equipped government - interrupting him from his reflections. Ambassador Del Gallo was used to much better, but it would have to do: as his driver opened the door, he plastered a corteous smile on his face and prepared himself to meet the French delegation. The storm was coming, and all of Europe needed to join forces if it wanted to turn the tide of destruction: the barbarians that once devastated the Roman Empire were now preparing for an encore, and Domizio would be at the forefront of the resistance."

In this age of extraordinary danger, however, with a newly reunited and increasingly militant Reich looming ever larger, cooperation was of utmost importance. Domizio Del Gallo was no stranger to hard bargains. After all, he had earned his spurs in the increasingly unstable world of Atlantropa and watched Italy rise up to seize a dominant place in European politics.\n\nFrench pride was something he had not come upon previously.\nLong hours and sometimes days would go by without any serious progress towards Détente, spent in arguing over semantics and impossibilities. And still...Every day the chants of 'La Marseillaise' grew louder and more numerous than those of 'Maréchal, nous voilà.' Del Gallo could see with his own two eyes that the French nation was in shambles, but it appeared to him that that the French spirit was crucially not yet lost. When the time came, France and Italy would face the resurgent Riech hand in hand.\n\nAt least he hoped they would, if he did his job well."

The grueling hunger, the columns of refugees, and the determination and unbent pride the French people had borne it all with. The French government...was another matter.\n\nWhile political friction and long-winded argument no doubt interspersed almost all of their meetings in the Hotel De Ville, compromise and comradery had carried the day, or they would not have been standing arm in arm as they now were. Disagreements were ironed out, and common ground found in enough matters to secure a positive outcome to the negotiations, one they now held up proudly: The Bordeaux Accords.\n\nTo Göring's militarist clique in Germania, the news would no doubt be received with spite. Europe was at last determined to close ranks in the face of renewed aggression by the Reich, the disunity and disbelief of 1940 would not assist the Hun this time. And should a unified front not suffice to dissuade the Führer? Well, Italy has gained an invaluable and resilient ally in Bordeaux nonetheless.

Gone is the hegemonistic exploitation of tyrants, soon to be replaced by true democratic cooperation between equals on the international stage.

 ita_LImpero_Colpisce_Ancora_desc:0 "The Italian Empire is vast and varied, holding as it does the entire Medditerannean sphere within its grasp. Yes, from the Alpine mountains to beaches of the Gulf Coast, the dream of an Italian world power has finally been recognized following our victory in the Second World War. And yet, there is still something wrong with this picture, something... incomplete. For while we may have gained possession of most of the near East and eastern Africa along with the Balkans, one cannot help but remember the glory of the past. The Roman empire had all that we now do far more. Of course, the world has changed drastically in the proceeding centuries and it would be impossible to fully return ourselves to such a state, but with the waning of the German goliath that held us in check, we have a chance to push our influence once more."

 ita_legacy_of_domitian_desc:0 "Sitting on the very doorstep of the Reich, Hungary will prove to be a key piece on the board of Europe if we hope to capitalize on the current chaos. Securing either its loyalty or compliance will allow us to place a check upon German ambitions in a neighboring region while expanding our power significantly. If the Hungarian state was at present a stable one, such a task could prove difficult as well as dubious in terms of its expected benefits. Luckily for us, the Hungarians have no more survived the last few decades of insanity unscathed than have the rest of us who have watched as madmen turned the world upside down. There is growing discontent in Hungary, not just within the halls of their government but also on the very streets and homes of the people. The regent is a sad, greying old man who sits in wait for the return of a king never to come. In short, they are broken and ripe for the taking if we but seize the opportunity."
 
 ita_the_faltering_government:0 "The Faltering Government"
 ita_the_faltering_government_desc:0 "Under the late Horthy, the state party in all but name, the MEP, had been largely a cohesive unit. More than that, it lay almost entirely unchallenged by any significant opposition. Under Horthy, that is, but Horthy is no longer in charge, and the new regent, Béla Imrédy seems to lack either the charisma or the good luck to maintain such a grip over his own party. Now, the formerly monolithic coalition has begun to fracture and pull apart at the seams with the conservatives, monarchists, and out-and-out fascists openly vying for influence. Such division may prove to be the least of the regime's problems however, as now even opposition parties have begun to show signs of life, and what's more, of a willingness to fight. For the Hungarians, this is a headache, but for us, this could prove advantageous. We can leverage factions against one another, finding those who are sympathetic and backing them while pushing down those who may be less susceptible."
 
 ita_the_desperate_regent:0 "The Desperate Regent"
 ita_the_desperate_regent_desc:0 "By most standards, the current regent of Hungary, for they still persist in the conviction that they are a genuine monarchy, has been less than successful in his time. Those who may have hoped that the seemingly energetic, if zealous, Imrédy would be able to match considerable exploits of his predecessor were sorely disappointed. This lack of success on his part has made the regent many a powerful enemy within Hungary, and by all accounts has driven him to desperation if not paranoia. After all, a leader who lacks support even within his own party is a man with cause to worry.\n\nOn the other hand, a beggar can hardly choose from whom he can take support from, and if say, the Empire were to offer assistance to such a man, it would naturally follow for that individual to express their personal gratitude for said support."
 
 ita_the_exhausted_people:0 "The Exhausted People"
 ita_the_exhausted_people_desc: "The people of Hungary are weary, and it is hard to blame them for being so at this point. The nation has not seen much good luck in the roughly half a century since the dissolution of the old Austro-Hungarian empire following the First World War. In the interwar period they had to contend with the global depression and a great deal of uncertainty over their future as a people. Then war came once again to the world and Hungary fell in with the victors, and for a time it seemed as if they would actually reap the benefits of victory. Pity for them, that the sting of betrayal lands harder than the blow of an adversary. After Romania had done its work they were now out of the Pakt and isolated as the economic collapse of the fifties arrived. Now the citizens can do little but wait to see how the cards will land. That is, unless we step in and give them a new chance and prosperity and strength."

 ita_meet_with_imredy_desc:0 "To put it bluntly, Béla Imrédy is not a very capable man. He has displayed a frightening inability to manage his own internal regime, much less make competent foreign and domestic decisions. With every passing day his grip upon the reigns loosens and his opposition grows more emboldened and organized, and the man knows this. The poor regent must be under a great deal of stress indeed. We believe he may require a small vacation, and what better place to have that vacacation than in Rome, the city of culture and beauty? While he spends his time relaxing, with all his expenses graciously paid for by our government, who's to say that the Duce might not pay him a cordial visit? Just to talk pleasantries, naturally, we will assure the Germans; merely showing our guest due courtesy as a head of state. If by some chance, the two do discuss matters of any significance, well, there'd be no need to rush to inform anyone else of what was said. Just a simple vacation after all."

 ita_military_excersizes_in_lubiana_desc:0 "In every good negotiation there is a carrot and a stick. When both are suitably present it should be, theoretically, impossible to fail. The Germans certainly understood this when they bulldozed across Europe, offering enticing benefits to those nations which did not require conquest to be added into the fold. Point of fact, Hungary was one such nation, along with Romania and Bulgaria. As German power waned however, it lost the ability to either entice or compel Hungarian obedience in the Pakt.\n\nWe can offer Hungary the moon, but if they feel threatened by a powerful Reich they may still refuse us. That is why Duce Scorza intends to remind them that Germany is not the power on the continent capable of carrying out threats. A display of force is required to serve this purpose and elements of the XII and IV corps have been dispatched to Slovenia to carry it out."

This malignant tumor within the regime has been allowed to fester only because of the Reich's looming presence making such a concession a matter of survival. Now though, with the German state largely preoccupied with its own problems there is a real chance of excising the malignant tissue. Not only would doing so pave the way for an alliance, but it would also indebt us to many within the Hungarian leadership, not the least of whom being Imrédy himself, who is known to be sick of the presence of the haughty Germans who believe that because their fatherland is "master of Europe" they have a right to dictate from within."

We won't be able to pull every Hungarian to a pro-Italian point of view of course, but we can target sections that may prove more susceptible, or at the least, deny Germany the chance of doing the same.\n\nFerenc Szálasi is a proud Hungarian nationalist, but apparently not too proud to refuse to cooperate with the Germans. We cannot allow such a partnership to be born. If the Germans won over the cooperation of Szálasi's Arrow Cross Party and Basch's Volksbund, we would be hard pressed to find a counter play. No, we cannot allow Szalasi to see the German's as his allies. We must get to him before they do and convince him that an Italian partnership will be best for the Hungarian people and state."

 ita_new_agricultural_treaties_desc:0 "Once upon a time, the people of Hungary had access to the bountiful breadbaskets of the Pakt, Ukraine and Norway, but things have changed significantly since they once stood shoulder to shoulder with the Reich. Now they are alone, surrounded, isolated on all sides and with no connection to the Mediterannean or Baltic, their ability to trade is severely hobbled. That is where we enter the picture with armfuls of food from Mother Italia and our colonies to feed a weary nation. In return, all we ask is for a just recompense that adequately reimburses our hard-working farmers. Such a deal would no doubt increase the good will between our two nations and we look forward to seeing the drafts upon Duce Scorza's desk, waiting for approval."

We have been generous in our overtures and magnanimous in our displays of might in our attempt to woo the dame called Hungary, and yet it may not be enough. The fickle whims of men are impossible to ever truly pin down with certainty, and this goes double for the whims of politicians and bureaucrats. We cannot guarantee success even after all we have done, the Hungarains may still refuse our advances and leave us to wallow like a scorned suitor. So we shall simply give them no alternative. We will be blunt to them, accept or face inevitable death either at our hands should they choose to resist all compromise or death at the hands of the reawakened Hun if they are foolish enough to think that they can survive alone. We cannot afford to lose a game of chance, if the deck must be rigged then so be it."

 ita_offer_to_buy_MAVAG_desc:0 "Much like the rest of Europe, Hungary was not spared by the economic turmoil of the Fifties. Adding salt to the wound was the fact that, after leaving the Pakt, Hungary was forced to weather the brunt of this collapse on its own without any assistance from its erstwhile partners in the greater Reich. We can sympathize, for we too were exploited by German greed and cast aside when we objected to such treatment. Keeping that in mind, it would make a good deal of sense for us to sweeten any prospective deal with Hungary by offering to help them in their recovery. In particular, their national machine works, MAVAG, has seen tough times lately, and our chief economists have communicated to the diplomatic corps that an offer to buy it at a slightly above market price could prove to be the dealmaker we need. Our financial situation is such that this proposal is doable, and this could endear us to the Hungarian people."

After several tense days of deliberation, debate, argument, and two almost brawls between the diplomatic parties, a deal has been reached that, if not what the Hungarian people may necessarily want, will be for the greater good of the nation. Negotiations have ended, and Italy has emerged victorious. The days when Italy was liable to be dragged this way or that along the chessboard of the major world powers is over. Now Italy does the playing while once domineering France quails at the Burgundian horor, proud England lies emaciated, shattered into a thousand parts by the German hammer, and the once mighty behemoth of the Reich lies scarred from the wounds it brought upon itself. Together, Italy and Hungary will forge a new path irrespective of the wishes of these has-been powers, one towards true peace and brotherhood among the like minded countries of Europe sick of the old song and dance!"
 
 ita_legacy_of_trajan:0 "Legacy of Trajan"
 ita_legacy_of_trajan_desc:0 "It says something about the treacherous nature of the Reich that of the original independent members of the Axis in Europe, only Bulgaria remains. In much the same fashion as Hungary did, in much the same fashion as we did, Romania has learned how comfortable the Germans are with abandoning former friends. Still, it would be unfair to lay all the blame for their present condition on Germany alone, for they have themselves to blame as much as anyone else.\n\nIn plain terms, Romania is having a crisis of identity. It seems to be a common occurrence in these uncertain times. The current king, Mihai I is a would-be, if somewhat tepid, reformer, doing his best to move the country away from its days of power in the brotherhood of fascism and into democracy. Perhaps a well-meaning goal, but foolish all the same. We can keep them from the cliff's edge, but we must work quickly."

Romania may or may not be considered a Balkan state depending on which expert is consulted, but it has the spirit of one regardless. Hungarians, Serbs, Germans, Jews, Ukranians, and Romani all packed in together and each group furious at their lack of independence. Antonescu and his supporters understood the hard truth that only a powerful hand could keep all of these groups in line, but Mihai? He thinks a democracy could work, nevermind how stupid it is to think that once the squabbling masses figure out that they can pull the levers of power so easily they won't simply tear the state apart for their own intersts. We can play a subtle hand here, inflaming tensions to the point where Mihai's regime collapses but preventing a full collapse of the system our chosen successor will inherit."

The saying goes that beggars cannot be picky, but Romania is not yet quite a beggar. We have means of changing that, With the war in the Middle East over we can divert some of the guns produced but never sent over to arm militant groups in Romania. I'm sure they'll be grateful for any material support and the best thing about it is that we need not be implicated in any of it. The SIM has been instructed to make sure there is no evidence linking the shipments to our government."

Well, we live in chaotic times, and there are many communities in Romania, big communities in fact. Communities that border on the size of small nations of their own. And what do all self-respecting nations need? Why, militaries of course! But militaries are quite expensive unfortunately, and even if they pooled their wealth it seems doubtful that any of the groups in Romania could fund their own forces. Unless, of course, someone else provided the capital for such a program. Who would be willing to make such an investment though? Who could possibly gain more from a destabilized Romania than from keeping their coin? We of course are just as mystified by this little puzzle as anyone else is."

Some have been forced out by the agents of the state and have no choice, some chose to depart before such a fate could befall them, and still others travel to seek assistance from mercenary groups, rival nations, and their own people abroad. If we wish to see the removal of Mihai with the minimum direct action exerted, it is with these very terrorists, expatriates, and general scattered dissidents who we must make common cause with. By direct order of Duce Scroza, our border control agency has been instructed to expedite the asylum process for any person or persons who can prove origin in Romania regardless of stated reason for asylum or status within Romania itself. No doubt we will hear protests over this but the Romanians know full well they have no way to enforce their demands and what's more: they know that we know this. Their complaints will fall on deaf ears."

His decadence and general debauchery was the shame of his homeland and contributed greatly to the disillusionment of its people towards the status quo in the years preceding the last war. Why is this relevant? After all, Mihai is not this man but merely his son and surely bears no guilt for his father's sins. We however no longer live in a world where truth is the final arbiter if anything is to be learned by the successes of the late Dr. Goebbels. By the time our propaganda campaign has ended the whole of Romania will remember the scandals of Caroll, they will learn that the son clearly does not fall far from the tree, and they will long for the return of an Antonescu who can deliver them from their failure of a king."

 ita_discredit_the_government_desc:0 "The current government of Romania is too soft, far too soft, to stand up to a resurgent Reich. If such an eventuality were to come to pass we might face the prospect of the Hun menace once more blitzing its way through the Balkans unimpeded all because the fools in Bucharest thought themselves virtuous defenders of "democracy". They are clearly unwilling to face the truth of the matter: they had far more success in half a dozen years as staunch fascists than they have had in the rest of their entire history as a state. We need to remind the people of this if we wish to bring them back into the brotherhood. It also bears extensive repeating that a government based on so-called 'democratic values' exists wholly due to the scheming and backdoor dealings of a past-his-prime monarch. They want the people to decide the national fate? We'll give the people the tools to do just that."

 ita_force_them_to_comply_desc:0 "Some of our diplomats fear that our lack of a direct border with Romania may make their government less likely to bend to our whims, either because they doubt our ability to provide them security or they believe Germany will retaliate. Duce Scorza was not impressed by this concern in the slightest. In fact, when all of this was conveyed to him, he was seen to smile, although there was no warmth behind it. After jotting a quick note on a pad he always keeps on his desk, the Duce turned to the diplomatic team. He told them, calmly and without any hint of either humor or anger, to remind our Romanian friends that while our boots may not touch their land so quickly, our planes and missiles can render such a step unnecessary. He asked that this point be stressed during the negotiation and then waved the diplomats away."

 ita_forward_bases_in_romania_desc:0 "A key challenge in our quest to assert our rightful place as the world's fourth superpower is our own lack of ability to project our influence and power both diplomatically and militarily. We have not the continent straddling empire of the Germans nor the ocean-embracing dominion of Japan. We do not even possess the global, if scattered, presence of the OFN and we have nothing comparable to the US's economic might. In short, we are trapped largely within the mediterannean in Europe and our furthest colonial extent is the Gulf. Things were somewhat better in the days of the Triumvirate but with its death we are back to square one. Establishing suzerainty over Romania will be one of our first big steps into rectifying this long standing deficiency. The world will come to respect our might even if we have to leave a trail of bruised and bound nations in our wake to do so."

The Romanians will agree to our deals one way or the other; they have no real choice when all is said and done. No, what the trust determines is not the success in achieving the deal but creating an environment where the long term effects of the deal can be maximized in our favor. We have had our fill of fair-weather friends, first the Germans and then our fellow Triumvirs, there will not be a third betrayal. So if we need to establish a few missile launch sites in the mountains to deter any aggression against Romania then no problem. In reality, this serves us just as much as them, because our investment will mean nothing if Romania falls."

They had their little experiment in doing so and look where that has lead them. We have no plans at this time to micromanage in the minute details of their laws and regulations but it is in our interest to supervise their transition back order from the brink of utter ruin. Every major department and office within their government will be required to have an Italian official who can monitor and direct their progress. Those who seem to us to be committed to improving their state will find it rewarding in terms of rank and office, but if we suspect that any of them are attempting to sabotage the effort out of some misguided notion of "freedom" or some such foolishness the consequences will be severe indeed."

In all honesty, we don't really require any more oil than we already possess thanks to our colonies and the resource rights held by ENI. Still, it never hurts to have back ups even for back ups and having this supply means our foes will not have access to it.\n\nBut before we can get ahead of ourselves, we will need to make sure that oil is ours and not the Romanian governments in fact as well as in name. If we leave it in their hands we have no guarantee they won't sell it behind our backs. The treaties we have drawn up to address this issue may not be "fair" but neither is life.

Well, Duce Scorza is a well read man, and in his quest to perfect his beloved fascism, he will take whatever he can find that works. The Roman system worked, and thus we shall see if the classical lessons can be applied to modern times. Romania's economy will act as subordinate to our own in all things from here on out. Their trade will be tied to our trade, their production to our production, and so on. Let us hope that we can take from their successes while avoiding their failures."

When the second World War broke out we seized the opportunity, therefore, to take the land we had originally been planning to press for: Savoia. No, our recent history with France has not been a happy one. Yet it doesn't have to stay that way, after all, we share far more in culture and spirit than we have had differences politically.

Now that we plan to establish closer ties with the French state however, there is a possible solution to this long-standing issue that will hopefully satisfy both parties. We have agreed to repatriate these former French citizens who wish to return to France and have even thrown in a good deal of money for compensation so that they may start their new lives there.

A few well placed demonstrations of our naval might off of France's southern coast will serve as a useful reminder of our overwhelming difference in power. Perhaps a task force made up of our Littorio Battleships and a carrier or two could even dock at Marseilles under the pretense of "repairs".

We border both them and the Black State and can have their border fully covered in just days if they only say the word. If they are not yet willing to go that far, we can still let it be known that those who would harm France risk the wrath of the Empire."

Between German occupation, the arrival of the Burgundians, and the retreat of the Free French regime to the coast of Africa there just isn't much left of them either in manpower or energy. Still, what they lack in actual threat they make up for in their presence in the consciousness of the French people. After all, they did end up killing Dr. Goebbels once upon a time and to have brought down one of the Reidh's titans was no mean feat back in the day. SIM tells us that the current organization is as porous as a colander and they'll have no trouble gaining access to it should we order them to. If we manage to get a hold of their decision making, we should be able to utilize them in very tactile and creative ways to further our agenda in France."

The late Fuhrer of the Reich was known to favor such underhanded methods and while one may deplore the negative aspects of such means the results cannot be argued with. The spooks over at SIM are well versed in such tactics and no doubt already have scripts covering dozens of potential 'incidents' with the French. They will need to be small enough so as to not provide a justification for all-out war, but significant enough that we are obliged to take action, even if we have to strong arm the French into cooperating. Of course, any power worth its salt will no doubt see through our trickery, but we will leave no traces that would allow them to definitively pin it on us."

Fear causes them to lose sight of what they need and they can lose the ability to reason correctly. Governments, being the constructions of men, are liable to fall under this same condition, and it seems as if France has it. So far they have been cooperative and we appreciate that, but we cannot take the chance that they will suddenly and irrationally reject our support because of some misguided notion of sovereignty or nationalism. We wish to help France, but tough love may be required to keep France from any self-destructive tendencies it may harbor. Why should we wait for their permission to save them? Do firefighters wait to receive permission to save people trapped in a burning building? Of course they don't, and we shouldn't wait either."

The Alps separate our two nations making land travel already difficult and cumbersome, and given our relations with France, we have allowed what little exists in the way of roads and other transport infrastructure to languish. Having a path into our soon-to-be ally as quickly as possible is paramount, which is why the army's engineering corps has been called on to spearhead the task of updating old roads and blasting mountain tunnels for new ones. The French government does not yet know the full extent of this refurbishment, but it only benefits them, so why have them worry about it now?"

With that crucial step completed, we can now turn to the second phase of our plan to drag the French state to our side: the decisive replacement of their government and then de facto integration of the empire. We need something quite big to justify such an act however, and that's where the rubes of the resistance come into play. Codenamed AEITIUS, the plan will see one of our border supply depots blown up completely. Luckily for us, we will only lose some outdated equipment, as all of the guards will be miraculously on break when the attack happens. Still, they will arrive just in time to kill one of the perpetrators, a member of the French resistance as it will be discovered, and our casus belli will be assured. Then, we can begin the second half of Aeitus, wherein we use our newfound excuse to overthrow the current French Regime."

No one in there seems to know how to deal with the system shock of the past two decades, let alone the past few years. At every level, military, economic, and legal, they are paralyzed at best. Our arrival and offer of support has calmed them somewhat but it's likely that without our prompt assistance the brain damage the French nation seems to be going through could become permanent. We cannot allow that to happen. In a directive authored by Duce Scorza himself and signed by the French head of state, the Italian government will begin to deploy some of its most seasoned generals and bureaucrats to reverse what they can of this damage."

Duce Scorza is quite clear on this point: while he may tolerate cooperation with non-fascist nations, and those that merely claim the title without adhering to the form are not fascists, he will never ally with them. They will always be looking for a chance to subvert us from within, because incompatible entities can never cooperate long term. It is the nature of life to kill rivals and we will brook no competition. The French will just have to accept our lead if they want us to pull them back from the brink."

It has simply lost too much materiel, troops, and competent officers, either to Burgundy, the Bretons, the Free French Remnants, or the Germans to have a chance at standing dominant once more in Europe for at least a few decades. No, those glory days seem well and truly gone no matter how much time passes.\n\nBut that is not to say we can't find a use for what France does have. Its divisions will be broken up and reorganized into light infantry brigades that will be incorporated as auxiliary units for our forces. What little heavy industry is left can be spent on light infantry fighting vehicles and scout cars for our benefit. Its remaining tanks will serve us well as reserve supply and even as decoy units should things become dire."

As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I will stand ready to review our findings with you at length whenever you may request it.\n\nNow that the formalities are out of the way, let me write bluntly sir. The whole thing is a mess, a total disaster. The report will go into more detail but suffice to say that without immediate economic intervention France will be completely crippled. They've lost their industrial heartland and that's on top of the effects of the crash. My thoughts: immediate industrial support yesterday if we want an actual return on this investment."

Our generals have been helping their forces transition into their new role as light auxiliary infantry and shipments of our cutting edge equipment have been sent out to great fanfare. Still, we could always take this one step more with really no downsides. With the French military de facto a branch of our army now, some of the generals have suggested we begin to deploy some of our own forces to bolster the defenses. This will, our generals tell us, not only make our commitment to France crystal clear to the rest of the world, but will also be helpful in training and preparing the French soldiers in our doctrines."

With a single command from his desk, Duce Scorza can begin a chain of actions that may reshape the balance of European power significantly.\n\nThe French will be caught completely off-guard as the takeover begins in earnest. Our ships will train their guns on their ports as our planes fly over the tops of their government buildings. No shots need be fired; the French will understand the futility of their situation instantly. When the reality of the situation is inescapable, our army will begin marching into the country, disarming their forces and occupying the capital."

We have called on the Regia Aeronautica to support our efforts by ferrying key troops and personnel across the French state for the purpose of intercepting possible targets and securing government buildings and other vital sites of communication and infrastructure. At the same time, we have sent an entire squadron's worth of our heaviest bombers to the skies to circle the skies of France so that our seriousness is made perfectly clear. Our airforce has always served us honorably, and we have no doubt that it will further distinguish itself in its latest mission."

Luckily for us, they have yet to discover our total infiltration of our organization, and information we pass to them will be taken as the absolute truth. No doubt they will become desperate, not only will the French government still remain anti-democratic, but they will see us as little better than the Germans. Well, let them think that, if we can convince them to initiate an attack on what they believe is an unprotected target only to realize too late that they have been fatally misled all the better for us. We may lose some small amount of men and equipment, it is true, but sacrifices are unavoidable in the brutal game we find ourselves playing."

Before her collapse, the British Empire was adept at this style of force projection and the United States was not far behind in terms of skill with this handy trick if one looks towards their record in the early twentieth century. The minutiae of its history are largely irrelevant to use however, what matters is that it is proven to work.\n\nDuce Scorza is not too proud as to be unwilling to learn from the success of others, but neither is he a man too uncreative as to simply copy methods like a schoolboy copies facts. No, Scorza will take from the pages of history, but he will modify the implementation to fit his own grand designs. Instead of mere gunboat diplomacy, he will have battleship diplomacy."

Once upon a time, the French were strong, and so they naturally and rightly dominated all others over whom they held sway, including Italy. Now though? The roles have been reversed and just as it was no more than natural for French hegemony to be backed by force and violence, it is equally natural for our hegemony to be similarly enforced. They are the newest part of the glorious Italian Empire, and in time they will come to be proud of this. In the meantime, they will have to be taught to show due difference, at the point of a bayonet if needs be. The global situation has reached a point where there is no time for niceties or respect. For the future of the Empire, even the roughest methods must be accepted."
