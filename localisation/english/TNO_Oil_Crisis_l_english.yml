 OIL.500.desc:0 "Like the she-wolf that nursed Romulus and his treacherous brother Remus, the United States has come to offer succor to Italy in its hour of need. Our newly democratic ally, wracked by rebellion in the Middle East, has little hope of holding onto their oil-rich colonial territory without the kind of help a superpower can provide. If Italy is able to re-establish their control over the region, not only will we be able to spread the OFN's influence but we will have a limitless source of oil, ready to keep the lights on in the US for decades to come.\n\nHowever, like just about every issue these days, intervention in the Middle East has become a fiercely debated issue, with two camps forming in Congress; those who advocate indirect intervention by supplying the Italians with funds, advisors and materiel, and those who argue for direct military intervention. The Republican-Democrats for the most part support limited intervention, while the NPP argue to slam the brunt of the United States military down on the enemy, but support for either policy come from both sides of the party line. The debate, consequently, is fierce at best and caustic at worst.\n\nDirect interventionists argue that the Italian military combined with the full force of the United States in combat is more than sufficient to defeat groups of ragtag desert guerrillas, and will ensure OFN supremacy in the region for the foreseeable future. On the other side, it is suggested that, while perhaps not quite as effective, indirect intervention is more than enough to help Italy win the war on their own, and prevent thousands of American boys dying in the sand.\n\nWith the memories of South Africa still fresh in the minds of every American, war in the Middle East could be a greatly polarizing issue. Whichever degree of intervention is chosen, we must be careful not to get mired in a conflict we can't win."

In a couple of years, we will have re-established our control over the region and our future as the world's oil provider will be assured.\n\nAll that remains is to get our boys ready and make our way into the sands.

With American boots on the ground we would've been unstoppable, but now the situation is far from certain. A lot of us were sure the Americans would come to our aid to ensure their supply of oil, and although they're helping us it's a hell of a lot less than they could be doing.\n\nWe've still got a strong chance, mainly because we're the most modern, well-trained and best-equipped army in the region, especially when compared to the corrupt Saudis and the ragtag pan-Arabist guerrillas.

This was the coup de grace, a slap in the Emperor's face, and there wasn't a damn thing those snivelling bastards could do about it without admitting that they were running guns to the pan-Arabists.\n\nIt had been a good few months, all in all. His boys had, with great success, managed to covertly destroy Japanese spy networks across the Middle East and impede their shipments of materiel to the guerrillas. No doubt the Japanese knew precisely what was going on, but couldn't retaliate without escalating tension with America.

It seems that our program of providing indirect aid to the Italians in the form of funding, materiel and advisors has become widely considered to be ineffective by the public and many in Congress.\n\nSupporters of the war have widely criticized the President's policy of keeping combat troops out of the Middle East, and are calling for us to enact a policy of more direct intervention in support of our Italian allies by putting boots on the ground and accentuating the Italian forces with our own. This, they say, will make the war unwinnable for the enemy. Some are even suggesting that any other decision on the President's part would be patently unpatriotic, a tacit admission that the American military isn't up to the task, that we don't give enough of a damn to protect the interests of our allies.\n\nIt's strange that, after the widespread anti-war sentiment from the public during the South Africa War, they would become so willing to send thousands more boys to die in the desert for the cynical and often obtuse interests of nation-states, but here we are. There's a lot of fear circulating that, without deploying combat troops, our intervention in the Middle East is doomed, and with it our economy.

 OIL.505.desc:0 "The Oval Office has a busy day as always. After all, the fate of millions of people not only from the United States but the entire world hinders on the decisions that are made on this room. In this case, the possibility of a proxy attack on Saudi Arabia in order to destabilize the country and recover our control over the oil wells is being discussed. In a reunion with the President, CIA Director Richard Helms explains the advantages of Operation Checkmate. \"The idea is sending Arabian rebels to storm Tarout Bay, Dammam. Right...here\" as he points at a map of Saudi Arabia. President [GetPresidentLastName] holds [GetPresidentPossissiveLowercase] fingertips \"Who we are sending to do the dirty work?\" the President asked. A bunch of wackos called Arabian Peninsula People's Union. Basically Arab Nationalists inspired by that Egyptian general, Nasser. They don't have any political plan or any way to reach the Arabian capital\"\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName] starts to get concerned all the sudden. \"If they cannot win, then why we are wasting money on this project?\" Sweat is visible on Helms's face. The President caught him off guard with that question. Probably being blunt about it wasn't the best strategy. \"The objective is to destabilize the Monarchy rather than making an actual government. The Saudis will have to deal with a guerilla, making them more vulnerable to accept our demands. It's for the better: dealing with a group of crazy Nationalists controlling most of the oil in the Middle East would be complicated\" explains Helms\n\n\"Fair enough. How much all this is gonna cost?\" the President asks.\"That depends. If we have enough funding for the operation, we can invest more in training and equipment for the rebels. That would increase our chances of success\"\n\nThe President reclines on the chair. \"I see. This is what we are going to do\""

Camp Pendleton, Virginia has witnessed the same kind of exercises for at least half-a-century, but this time the ones on the field weren't Americans. \"Not bad\" said Ahmed with satisfaction \"You improved a lot from last time. Two months ago, you barely knew how these things worked. That would be enough for today. Try to eat and rest well because we are going to Florida tomorrow to work in our landings\" Ahmed realized that they only had at least six weeks before departing to the Persian Gulf. Could that be enough to break the Royalist defences? Ahmed was a former employee of ARAMCO. Twenty years of service under terrible conditions were rewarded with four fingers on his left hand when he tried to unionize, courtesy of Saudi thugs. However, the two years of service under the CIA to train Saudi dissidents could bear some fruits other than a mutilated hand. The dream of a free Arab nation seemed to be closer than ever.\n\nAs the recruits retired to their quarters, he was approached by Nasir al-Sa'id, leader of the Arabian People's Peninsula Union. Nasir introduced Ahmed to the US government when both escaped the country. \"So, are these boys ready to bring me the head of the King?\" asked Nasir filled with optimism.\"They are improving. Maybe we can spark a revolt after we deal with the coastal defences. But what we are going to do with the Americans once we take over? The CIA doesn't look a charity organization to me\" remarked Ahmed. Nasir laughed confidently \"Remember the oil wells, my friend. We'll have what they want\" Ahmed wished on that moment to have the confidence of his leader. \"Anyway, what's for dinner?\""

While trained for these kind of situations, some of the soldiers couldn't avoid being affected by sea sickness. The D-Day was finally here. Even Nasir himself was struggling to stand on the balcony of the transport ship USS Lawrence of Arabia to address his men a last time. \"Brave soldiers of the Arabian nation. You are about to embark on a crusade to liberate our oppressed brothers and sisters from the tyranny of the Monarchy\" screamed from his megaphone. The sound of a Douglas B-26B cut through Nasir's speech. Ahmed interpreted this as a bad omen. Shouldn't the Americans have neutralized the Saudi air force by now? It is vital for the success of the operation that their paratroopers can land unopposed. The pilots that the CIA offered for ground support weren't doing their job properly\n\n\"As we enter our decisive battle, the enemy will fight fiercely to protect the privileges of the King and his cronies\" continued Nasir in a louder voice. Once again, the speech of the revolutionary leader was interrupted this time by the loud noise of Saudi anti-aircraft artillery. From the ship, Ahmed could guess that probably were old WW2 models. \"But this battle will be the founding stone to build a future for our child...\" Suddenly, a company of five old German tanks started to fire the freighters from the beach. Ahmed wondered if the Nazis were the reason behind the Saudis being so well informed of the operation. Probably aware of this, Nasir couldn't hide the anger on his face. \"You know what? To hell with this. Let's get to Riyadh right now. Glory to the Arab people!\" The rest of Ahmed's squadron cheered raising their fists into the air. Ahmed felt like this was the highlight of his life. The battle for the fate of Arabia was about to begin."

The remaining men were barely able to hold on the pier. The USS Scheherazade was supposed to bring more supplies, but now is part of the seabed. But when you are outnumbered 10 to 1, supplies don't make the difference. It was a miracle that they even lasted a single day. \"You were right this whole time, Ahmed. The Americans only used us as bait\" exclaimed Nasir with despair. Ahmed was desperately holding the wound of his friend. Just twenty-four hours ago, he was joking about putting the King's head on his wall. \"I don't lose hope yet. Maybe the Arab people revolts against the Saudis or maybe Nasser invades the region. Either way, I don't want this scum to get away so easily\". There was nothing Ahmed could do anymore. \"Honestly, I should have stayed in Egypt\" exhaled Nasir for the last time.\n\nAhmed made the proper military salute thinking of how everything went wrong. He cursed the CIA for sending them to this deadly trap without proper training. How could he expect that the people that got their asses kicked by the Germans knew something about warfare?The noises of approaching steps on the sand filled Ahmed with enough determination to avenge his fallen comrades. The Arab officer grabbed his machine gun for a final confrontation with the Saudis. After all, it was a better end than being beaten to death by strikebreakers for a minimum wage.

Of the 46 American pilots assigned to the operation, we only lost 3. One fell into enemy lines, but we don't know if he used the cyanide capsule assigned to him. One of the big factors behind the failure was underestimating the position of the enemy. The Saudis were well prepared to reject the invasion. Is very likely that they were informed by the Germans but we don't discard the possibility of an Italian double -crossing behind our backs. The reason of this is unknown to us.

The USS Scheherazade unloaded the necessary supplies that will soon be necessary for a long march through the desert. Nasir had his doubts about the effectiveness of the equipment given but they did he job just fine. Enough to curbstomp the poorly trained Saudi militiamen and take control of the entire island. The reconnaissance patrol informed him of the apparent last Saudi holding point: the Tarout Castle in Qatif. Apparently, the Saudis made their gamble for a last stand on the ancient fortress \"The past is a perfect place for these rats to hide\" commented Nasir jokingly\n\nFrom the top of a M26 Pershing, Nasir guided the advance towards the old castle but the Saudis made no attempt at defense. No artillery or machine guns could be seen at the top of the building \"They want to surrender already?\" asked Nasir to himself. A group of soldiers came from the ruins. \"Lay down your weapons now!\" screamed one of Nasir's men as they aimed their guns. It was then that they recognized the uniforms of the men coming through the doors: they were their guys! \"So, when we are going to Riyadh?\" joked Ahmed. A burst of cheers and laughter came from Nasir's squadron. Ahmed already foresaw the possibility of the Saudis entrenching on the fort, so he made sure to occupy it beforehand. The few unfortunate Saudis that tried to take it where put down unceremoniously. \"You scared me the shit out of me, you magnificent bastard\" expressed Nasir laughing."

Nasir's calculations that the population would rise up in revolt proved to be naively optimistic. While some people from nearby villages have collaborated and even joined him, the majority of the Saudis has remained loyal or neutral at best. On this dire situation, Nasir called for an emergency reunion of his military staff. \"It looks like we have overestimated our own capacities for a quick takeover of the country\" admitted Nasir with sorrow. The sand-filled wind hit the faces of the Arab officers relentlessly. \"We have been advancing for two days and we are still two-hundred kilometers away from Riyadh\"\n\n\"Ahmed, what's the state of our forces?\" asked Nasir. \"We lost a third of our men, Sir. If you are referring to the morale, well...\" Ahmed stopped for what it seemed like an eternity. He knew like anyone else on that improvised tent that they didn't stand a chance against the reinforced garrison from the capital. \"Look, I'm gonna honest. If we send our men against the King, they are gonna be slaughtered. They have been marching through the desert for days\" bluntly admitted Ahmed. An awful sensation of impotence stroke the rebel leader like an arrow through his chest. His army losing his morale was what it hurt the most. If his own men lose the faith on the cause, what is even to point to continue? Nasir took a small sip from his water bottle to refresh his mind. \"Ok, how many supplies do we...\""

Take cover now!\" screamed Ahmed. The desperate screams of the other Arab rebels could be heard from the distance as they were being hunted down one by one. While Ahmed managed to take cover behind a truck, the other members of Nasir's staff weren't so lucky as they were gunned down. The Saudis managed to track them somehow.

The success of the initial landings can be attributed to their prior training in airborne operations. However, the rebels started to experience real setbacks once they advanced through the countryside. Their attempts to reach the population for support have been warm at best. Also, their supplies started to run out once they entered the Arabian desert and the continuous harassment by Saudi forces only worsened the situation.

Worse, it appeared that the incident had set off all sorts of invisible lines between the men.

Perhaps the biggest mistake he made was asking just why those two Sunni troops felt it necessary to start a fight with one of the Maronites: That set the entire group off on a debate in four languages on family feuds, 12th-century crusader states, and obscure religious movements.\n\nIt was all too much. After 30 minutes of this circus, Booth decided to send the men back to their barracks and in separate groups- god forbid they see each other on the way back.

 OILflavor.4.desc:0 "Tahara Katsumi was not a fan of this \"Oil Crisis\" that had descended upon the world. Cycling to work to ration fuel was the least of it (though the unanticipated cost of the bicycle did put a dent in his monthly income). The factory managed, a part of the Toyota Industries' supply chain, was in worst shape than he'd ever seen before: Late deliveries, lacking equipment, absent-minded employees, and every report from company higher-ups bringing worse news than the last.\n\nThis month's report understandably put a smile on his face. While the Crisis had harmed nearly every part of Japan's economy in some way, the time for a turnaround had come. Due to what the report could only attribute to \"a variety of purchase orders from unknown groups across the middle east,\" Toyota's vehicle orders had skyrocketed and so did the factory's projected revenues. At last, a ray of sunshine managed to sneak in through the rainclouds.\n\nOnly after reading the report from front to back did he realize that it made no mention of alleviating the issues faced by the factory. The only conclusion he could draw is that they would somehow need to meet this surge in demand with the already limited means they were working with. The rainclouds had decided to close ranks after a brief shuffle.\n\nKatsumi was a resourceful man. Rainclouds or sunny day, this would need to be done. Immediately two options presented themselves. It was an open secret that most workers could not cope with the increased expenses multiplied by the crisis. Up until now, this was considered irrelevant to the running of the firm, but would most workers refuse longer hours if it means a chance to pay their bills? He reasoned they would not. On the other hand, he maintained a long list of connections to tap into on such a rainy day. Normally his lack of faith in the quality of outsourced tasks would prevent him from opening that drawer, but hard times called for hard measures, and the final product would be shipped thousands of kilometers away. After weighing the costs and benefits of each choice, it was decided that:"

There was nothing to do in this hellhole other than stay in the shade of the camp and glance at the mountainous desert landscape that lied outside, or stroll out the camp's door and succumb to the scorching sun above them. Joachim might have served through similar conditions under Rommel's command during his tenure on the North African front, yet he was no longer the same man he was three decades ago.\n\nHe was a shell of his former self, his bones creaked, his muscles ached and he could hardly take a stroll without running out of breath; he was stricken by the ills of old age, the same ills that he once mocked in his youth. That was not the only thing to change, the looks that the Arabs gave him were now ones of distrust and rage, not the cheers and salutations that accompanied the German victories in the middle east during the war. Back then he had read some local papers with the little scraps of Arabic he had learned in Libya and had seen images of celebration and earnest belief in a coming renaissance for the Arabs. They had welcomed the german army as liberators, an iron phalanx sent by God to avenge their subjugation, to strike fear into the hearts of the colonisers and throw off their foreign yoke, unleashing the Arab people from their shackles.\n\nBut come to the end of the war and the collapse of the Anglo-French empires, that bubble of euphoria would rapture as the Italian phoenix and the Turkish mob, aided by the Germans, descended onto the carcases of the fallen empires and chained these aspiring countries to their own rising empires. After all, that was the natural order of things, the uncivilised and backwards races would forever serve their more refined, European masters.\n\nAt least that was what Joachim always believed, yet now he was here serving at the hands of Arab independence rebels wishing to break free from the Italian protectorate, why and for what reason? He did not know, yet it was the Führer's command- and the ever-wise Führer, infallible as he is, was surely correct in his motives and plans. His line of thought was interrupted by the sudden arrival of a stern-looking Arab calling on him to attend to an envoy arriving from Germania."

The unrest-.\"\n\nA loud, phlegm-filled cough forced Mark Daniels, Chicago Tribune, to look up from his portable typewriter. Standing before him, in the cramped hallway of his hotel, was a man dressed in the uniform of an Egyptian palace guard. In the corner of his mouth was a large cigar. He removed the cigar and made another guttural noise with his throat. \"You the American asking around for...\" He twirled the hand holding the cigar. \"Sources?\"\n\nMark gave a confused smile. \"I'm on a deadline but, uh... yes. Of course. You are?\"\n\nThe man stuck the cigar back into his mouth. \"I can get you in the palace for thirty American dollars.\"\n\nMark Daniels blinked. He blinked again. \"Do you have any idea how many people I've had to bribe already today? The taxi driver was going to let some religious fanatics kill me unless I gave him five bucks. A police officer outside threatened-.\"\n\n\"Twenty American dollars for a big-time scoop, as you say. No one else has this offer,\" said the man. Based on the expensive cigar, Mark somehow doubted that was true. \"Maybe bring a photographer and five extra dollars and you can get some nice photos for your bosses.\"\n\nMark massaged the bridge of his nose. The Tribune's accounting department was going to kill him for subsidizing the income of every crooked guard, policeman, and bureaucrat in Egypt but they knew how to get sources and he wasn't about to lose out on an exclusive to the fucking Times.

With that, the presumed representative of the Ba'athists knocked on the window, climbed into the car, and took a seat next to his fellow guest in the city of Sofia. \"Herr Strik, tell me, do they still allow you to smoke this much in Lufthansa?\" Wilhelm held out his cigar box, which the Arab opened graciously. \n\n\"Of course not, Herr Ahmad! This car alone must be only second to the smokestacks in the east, no?\" Ahmad smiled, a look of discomfort coating his face as he leaned back in his seat. \"Don't worry, the Ba'athist cause is one which seems to fall directly in line with the Reich's, therefore you're the safest men on the planet.\" The tension in the room lifted, even if the smoke hadn't, and Ahmad removed a stack of papers from his briefcase. \n\n\"First order of business, how much can we count on you in terms of providing us with firearms?\" Wilhelm scoffed at the question and put on a smirk over his raised eyebrow. \n\n\"Ahmad, Germania backs our cheques from here to kingdom come, this is only really a matter of how confident you are you can put the guns to good use.

Ciano's mismanagement of foreign policy and the Italian Empire, the turmoil stirred up by the transition to democracy, and the incompetence of the Italian colonial administration has led to an explosion of chaos in the Middle East.\n\nThis would not be our concern except for two reasons. First, Italy is an extremely valuable ally with vast influence over the Mediterranean, a powerful military, and economic ties to both us and our allies. Second, Italy's empire is one of the world's largest producers of oil, and the collapse of their colonial governments has dramatically destabilized the oil market. Both of these are reason enough to intervene, the only question is the nature of that intervention."
