ENG_DECCAT_PreEcwHmmlrGuns:0 "HMMLR-OFN 관계도"
ENG_DECCAT_PreEcwHmmlrGuns_desc:0 "당연하게도, 본격적인 작전을 수행하기 위해서는 소총, 수류탄, 탄약 등의 무기가 필요합니다. 또한 그 무기로 무장할 사람도 지금보단 더 많이 필요하죠. 이 문제를 해결하기 위한 유일한 방법은 법적으로 정당화 받지 못하는... 총기 거래입니다.\n\n우리는 우리에게 친근한 몇몇 연락책을 통해 자유국가들로부터 무기를 지원받을 수 있습니다. 그러나 실제로 들여올 수 있는 수량은 북부 잉글랜드가 얼마나 불안정하냐에 달려있습니다.\n\n일단 우리가 정부와 전면전 상태에 들어간다면 그렇게 모인 무기들은 일선 부대에 §T장비§!로 지급될 것입니다. 뉴캐슬, 랭커셔, 요크셔의 §T주 안정도§!가 낮아질수록 우리의 총기가 통과할 가능성도 높아지며 정부에 발각되는 횟수도 줄어들 것입니다. 관계는 매월 자동적으로 §x조금씩§! 하락합니다.\n\n§YHMMLR§!이 받은 총기: [?ENG.ENG_Hmmlr_Guns] £weapon_icon \n§YHMMLR§!-§MOFN§! 관계: [GetENG_HMMMLR_OFN_Relations]"

A state is considered §Rcontested§! when no one side has full control over the state or its neighbouring states.

ENG_intro.2.desc:0 "'그 멍청이가 연설을 하기로 결정한 것은-' 알렉산더 더글러스 흄 총리는 마음 속으로 은밀하게 욕설을 퍼부었습니다. 그는 자주 독일인들이 조지 왕의 유감스러운 꼭두각시 형을 다시 왕좌에 앉혀놓고, 훌륭한 군주로서 행동하도록 붙잡아 두라고 요구할 때마다 총리직을 때려치우고 싶어졌습니다. 4년이라는 시간은 종전 이후 모든 내각의 임기 중에서 가장 긴 기간이었지만, 그에게는 단지 이보다 더 끔찍할 수 없는 4년이었을 뿐이었습니다. 그러나 지난 4년간 얻은 모든 화병조차 방금 그가 들은 청천벽력같은 말에 비하면 아무것도 아니었습니다. 그는 자신을 끔찍이도 경멸하는 대중을 감언이설로 감동시키고자 하는 머저리에게 그게 '위험'하다는 사실을 이해시킬 자신이 없었습니다.\n\n그리고 이 말은 곧, 그가 무슨 수를 써서라도 왕을 사지 멀쩡하게 연단에서 내려오도록 만들어야 한다는 뜻이기도 했습니다. 독일과의 평화는 겉으로는 그럭저럭 안정된 것처럼 보이지만, 당장 왕위가 공석이 되면 콘월 주둔군이 어떻게 나올지 감조차 잡히지 않았습니다. 미꾸라지같은 할더 그 개자식은 표정에서 의중을 좀 읽어볼라 치면 철면피를 깔기 일쑤였고, 떠벌리고 다니는 말들은 아예 해석이 불가능했습니다. 놈이 저항군 문제에 불간섭으로 일관했던 것을 생각하면 놀라운 일도 아니었지만요.\n\n흄이 잉글랜드를 기어코 파멸로 몰아넣을 쥐새끼를 색출하는데 필비를 투입한 이후부터 조금씩 소득이 생기기 시작했지만, 그 과정은 여전히 느렸습니다. 놈들이 반역적인 스코틀랜드인들의 지원을 받기 위해 북부로 숨어들어간 이후 그의 내각은 끝없는 공장지대와 험준한 구릉 사이에서 응당 끼쳐야 하는 것보다 더 적은 영향력을 행사하고 있었습니다. 그러나 내일 문제를 오늘 고민하는 것은 작금의 잉글랜드에겐 사치였습니다. 이제 왕의 연설이 무엇에 관한 것인지 결정해야 합니다."

He'd find himself in a room filled to the brim with dead bodies that pressed in upon him until he could not breathe. Sometimes they were those of his fellow soldiers from the East African campaign that left him with symptoms of malaria and dysentery. This time, on the other hand, it was those who died in that gas attack in the Great War that ruined his lungs and left him with respiratory illnesses forty years later.\n\nGetting up, he reflected on how futile it had been to fight the Germans. All it had done was bring ruin to England every time it happened. Truly, it was better for the English nation to instead support the Masters of Europe and fight against Jewish-Bolshevik degeneracy and the asinine rigmarole of the left-liberals and moderates. By promoting this mindset over the past thirty years, especially after the Invasion, Chesterton had won the esteem of his German masters; this, more recently, allowed him a life of luxury and influence.\n\nGulping down glass after glass of an expensive German wine given to him by Franz Halder at his birthday, Chesterton sat down and read the day's communiques. Noting down potential courses of action, he reflected on his situation.\nMany accused him of treason and selling out; those ungrateful words hurt him more than he let on. Besides that he was tormented by alcoholism, nervous breakdowns, and episodes of neurasthenia. Between those and the pressure of the dead bodies he saw in his sleep, he began to regard the world as no more than a vast necropolis.

All this time, he had just sat around and done nothing, busying himself with the running of the nation; those people in his party just papered over their own differences with no intervention on his part.\n\nShaking his head, the Prime Minister - a somewhat traditional, personable man of the Royal Establishment - took stock of his situation. The Alec Douglas-Home of 1962 had but one priority, and that was to protect the broken remnants of Olde England from all that threatened it: the German tyranny, Halder and his gang of enforcers squatting in Cornwall, the fascist hardliners of Chesterton, and, most importantly, the communist-ridden Resistance.\n\nHome was sympathetic to those who wanted out of the Pakt, he really was. He wanted rid of the Germans too. But if these socialist madmen took hold of England, the Nazis would be provoked into invading, and they would destroy what little remained of England, finally and completely breaking the English spirit.

Resistance cells were being given advance notice of his movements; suspected HMMLR sympathizers would disappear in the dead of night before he could disappear them.\nThe civilians in the streets of the North looked at him with open disgust, many of them muttering under their breaths that he was a traitor and villain where he could hear it. He dared not act against them for fear that Parliament would go after him, but he wished he could make those scum appreciate the work he was doing to defend what little was left of England.\n\nOverall it had devolved into a situation in which Templer was being forced to accept more and more loss for less and less gain, and he hated it. How would he be able to protect the Kingdom if things kept on going like this, and he was forced to go on with exactly no help from London?\n\nCursing his bad fortune for the umpteenth time, Templer wrote another situation report to send to General Headquarters.

What remained was a partly hollowed-out shell denounced by the Resistance as a fallen hero, a thrice-damned craven.\n\n"This isn't to say that I especially like my job these days," Montgomery thought, as he had for years. He, just like anyone else in Britain whose name was not "A.K.

"If we cut the Germans off, or if God forbid the Resistance take over, they'll snuff us out the way they did the first time around. Then they'll probably give us over to Heydrich or some other such monster, and the last of England will fall to pieces."\n\nDeep down, however, Montgomery's fondest wish - that of a free England, saved from tyranny and dishonor as it was in his youth - remained. But, as long as Hitler remained master of Europe, nothing could come of that, and all Montgomery could hope to do was keep the south in order before Halder felt tempted to intrude again.\n\n"It's worth it," Montgomery thought.

"Whatever you must, but if you have to sacrifice a cell ensure they aren't aware of too many figures in the command structure." As the spy nodded Claude rose from his chair, after all this was only one of four meetings he had today. "I must be off gentlemen, best of luck and God save the Queen.""

One side of the hastily converted pool table in the room's centre was covered in heavily scrawled maps, the remainder of the space being covered with radios, weaponry and schematics, but what caught her attention was the people she was sharing the room with.\n\nLightly puffing a cigarette on one side of the room was none other than Bill Alexander, surrounded by a small knot of aged men in red armbands, veterans of campaigns ranging from Russia to Spain but here and now awaiting their commander's move before they fully lowered their weapons. The reason for their caution was the man who'd just trod down the basement stairs with rather too little noise for Natalie's liking. Dressed in the uniform of an army twenty years dead and gone David Stirling strode with purpose to the map table, two grizzled men in equally aged uniforms following behind, eyes scanning the room for a potential trap.\n\nAfter a short silence, it was the reds who got to business first. "The Boss wants us to put something together for our friend in the peaked cap." Alexander took a break from his cigarette to gesture at the maps of Cornwall and Devon, each of them showing in intricate detail the topography of the region. "Something permanent."\n\nStirling barely seemed to acknowledge that the man had spoken at all, instead peering over the sheets of paper like they would reveal some arcane mystery before he responded. "Cornwall isn't some traitor barracks where the fuckers can't shoot straight to save their lives. Those Garrison bastards are hard, and their equipment is fresh."\n\nBill Alexander just smiled and gestured at Natalie to come forward. Natalie knew her role, so she simply placed the photograph in front of Stirling before returning to the corner. And was in a prime position to see his frown turn into a savage grin. "Well now."

Of course, had it really been perfect, the plane would never touch tarmac again, though there is only so much one can ask for. Of course, Edward wasn't the only one who wanted him to never touch the ground again, otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to leave for Germany in the first place. Letting out a sigh, Edward tapped his almost-desk made up of the back of the chair holding god-knows which government functionary and tried to think of something else, anything else.\n\n"Your majesty, would you like anything to drink?" An airline hostess had apparently been standing next to Edward for a moment long enough to heighten the non-existent tension between them. The hostess was certainly not English, probably German, and without a doubt keeping her smile on with nothing but hope that Edward would actually order something.\n\n"Uh, whiskey, please." Half-nodding her head, Edward returned to thinking of what his life had become. Why did the government even need a monarchy? More than that, why did it have to be him? Most anyone -aside from some of those who held a universal disgust from anyone with respect to their name- had no love for the Germans, though the only real difference between the government and these rebels was a split in not ideology, but policy. Were they really so different? The German threat is nothing but an inevitability, couldn't these insubordinate children see that?\n\n"Whiskey, your honor." The hostess placed the glass on the rickety table, walked away, stopped as though to say something, presumably thought better of it, and walked off. Edward smiled.

Of course, he had spoken with him almost every month in the months following the war, in those chaotic days of constant partisan warfare across the nation, gathering support for the collaboration efforts was essential to forming at least some trust in autonomy for England. Since borders were settled, however, Edward had relegated his meetings to the Führer to occur only when utterly essential. Given the state of affairs in England, this was undoubtedly one of those moments of absolute necessity.\n\nWalking into the office of the Führer, as planned and practiced thousands of times prior, Edward's hand extended to the emperor of Europe- an old man, hardly standing, looking as though there was nothing behind his eyes, a nearly-grey shade of blue. It was nearly unnerving as they snapped to meet Edward's.\n\n"Your majesty." His voice crackled, and the pair shook hands, the "indomitable leader" looking confused for a split moment, before gesturing for Edward to sit at one of a pair of seats. Walking towards the chairs, the small crowd of photographers and video crew moved with them, snapping photos and staring at the pair take their seats. "Now, my friend, I am sure you've heard of the terrible terrorism within England, and-" The Führer began half of a coughing fit, managing out the words "terrible".\n\n"...I am afraid I must come to you in my hour of great need, and ask a favor; for your intrepid soldiers to aid in pacifying our unstable territories." King Edward looked to Hitler with what sincerity he could muster, though he knew it would be hard for anyone to take him seriously.\n\n"Of course. I will... refer you to my... successor. He will have an answer for you. I know his... trust his judgement." Reaching out to shake the Führer's hand, Hitler seemed almost confused, or repulsed. Edward sighed, and stood up."

More than anything else, it was their lack of respect, whether or not he deserved it.\n\n"Herr Bormann, we both know that the English army is ill-equipped to take on the rampant terrorism in the north, and we may very well soon have another London uprising on our hands, only twice as worse and we'd be half as prepared. I don't expect you to review or repeal the treaty of London, I simply need some help." Bormann smiled.\n\n"Of course, your majesty, though you must understand that there are some restrictions which I have found myself under as of late, yes? You and I know how little I can send to England, I'm not Führer quite yet, though I can still lend something of a hand. Now, equipment is running rather short for the proper German army, though we do have something of a manpower surplus at the moment- new recruits, you know, always need some proper experience. I understand you have the whole list forwarded my way, I've read it over, though you should know that we're still tight on equipment, garrisons, you know how it is." Bormann locked his hands, and smugly smiled at the "royalty" which he'd loved to taunt.\n\nKing Edward stood up and straightened out his uniform. "Thank you, Herr Führer. Best of luck with Germany." Bormann gave a half-nod half-bow, gesturing towards the door. King Edward slunk out of the office as fast as his legs would permit, though couldn't help but feel Bormann's presence looming over him.

Slicing up his steak, the man opposite Edward seemed happy enough to be there, talking with him. So far as Edward could tell, he looked as though with every bite of steak, sip of wine, and breath of air, the man was put more and more at ease. The only thing that even might sour the evening was the whole point of Edward's presence in the first place.\n\n"I have... reviewed your list of requests for the bolstering of England's forces, and I must say that I sympathize with the troubles which have plagued England these past few years. Unfortunately, I cannot promise you anything in the way of manpower." Edward felt a pang of disappointment strike him, letting his cutlery set against his plate. "Hold your horses, hold your horses. Now, at the moment, I have no reason to hand out my manpower reserves like... candy. What I can hand out to a close ally, however, would be quite a bit of equipment. Some guns here and there, a sprinkling of artillery and anti-tank guns, I will see what can be diverted England's way."\n\nEdward's face lit up, and it was certainly apparent to Herr Goring. "And planes. Plenty of aircraft, I've got more than enough planes laying around which can be used for anti-partisan activities, as you may know."

Upon being put in front of a military court, it wouldn't take longer than ten minutes to get through the semantics of evidence. Then came the verdict- determined sometime last week. Home had been informed of the betrayal as soon as it came to light, and it took hardly a minute to decide on his fate. The look splayed across Wingate's face was certainly upsetting in its shock, though it did more than enough to satiate the hopes of the newscasters for the night. A death sentence was far from uncommon for traitors, but for a man of Wingate's repute, it was certainly one of the more surprising trials in the past years.\n\nAs the disgraced General was escorted out of the courthouse with his hands cuffed, the pair of officers behind either side of him, hand on either shoulder pushed their way through the crowds of reporters and bystanders. Home watched as they were swallowed by the crowd before a squad car emerged from the far end of the crowd, set alongside the sidewalk.\n\nAs Lord Home himself and his small army of security made their way out, the crowds of reporters ran up to Home, and asked the usual few questions.\n\n"Lord Home!

The finer details are attached in the report, but the overview I felt important enough to address to you here.\n\nIt is currently believed that Major David Stirling deserted his post in the immediate hours after the Armistice of 1943 was declared, managing to suborn a not insignificant amount of General William Slim's command in the process and taking a supermajority of surviving SAS forces with him alongside a handful of regular army units. This is important because those army units, alongside scattered Home Guard sections and a small amount of recruiting since, have made up the core of his forces ever since. We believe that Stirling has never had a fighting force larger than perhaps three or four thousand men for the entire 20 years he has been engaged in terrorism against the government, and yet I would point out he is still very much alive.\n\nNo less than 120 separate attempts have been made on his life by our government and on occasion other terrorist organisations over the years, he has been assumed dead on three separate occasions and his group is to our knowledge, the only active rebel combatant from before the London Uprising to still regularly engage our forces in any meaningful form. This has only increased in frequency since his recent alliance with HMMLR.\n\nIt is my professional opinion given the danger his organisation represents, that the utmost priority should be given to coordinating our efforts against his forces. If nothing else, eliminating one or two of his cells would likely drive him to focus his efforts in the north and cease action in the south where the Germans might take notice. As mentioned previously, he doesn't possess the manpower to take casualties and anything we do now will likely bring benefits to us later on."

As far as my people have been able to determine, it is overwhelmingly likely that the core of the "Left Resistance" is formed by surviving elements of the Communist Party of Great Britain, previously thought to be largely eliminated during the course of the 1953 London Uprising. It seems however, that one or more figures of significance were able to escape the roundup and executions that followed. Now based primarily in the industrial sections of the Midlands, the Left Resistance appears to have absorbed the "Labour Underground'' as well, and it should concern the government greatly that this has occurred. All previous knowledge indicated that Labour and the CPGB would continue their typical squabbling for their support bases, yet at some point prior to 1959 this turned into an outright alliance. The current organisation, we suspect, is therefore able to draw support not just from the radical elements of trade union movements and industrial workers, but also dissatisfied portions of the intelligentsia and youth movements. The sole consolation of the situation seeming to be that they have been unable to recoup the losses in trained military personnel they sustained in 1953. Broadly speaking, as the files attached to this brief should show, the Left Resistance seem distinctly more radical than the majority of HMMLR (of which we can confirm they are a member organisation) and if as per the Prime Ministers wishes we aim to keep the current situation with regards to the Reich's influence inside England, we ought to deal with this organisation before they can attempt a general rising in the Midlands or something else equally likely to bring the Garrison down on all our heads.

This is unconfirmed, but the extent of HMMLR's influence and the origins of much of its equipment in American cast offs leave little for interpretation that the organisation is anything other proxy of Washington DC regardless, and thus this remains the more pressing concern.\n\nFirst coming to government attention in the aftermath of the London Uprising in 1953, the group claims as many prior terrorist organisations did, a loyalty to the pretender Queen of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth of Windsor. Unlike these groups however, HMMLR has been willing and able to look past its nominal trappings to secure alliances with all manner of fellow travellers. Not least in the past four years the Left Resistance, itself an amalgam of communists and the Labour party, and the rogue military formations of David Stirling. Both of these groups have little in common on an ideological level with HMMLR's stated goals of restoring the political situation to its 1939 position, and yet whomever leads HMMLR has managed to wrangle the three organisations into a united front against the Government.\n\nIt cannot be stated with enough clarity that HMMLR is currently the greatest extant threat to the continued existence of our government.

And even he has nothing on Major General Orde Charles Wingate.\n\nUnlike the rest of the army, Orde never truly agreed to cooperate with the Germans and to betray his country. He was on the other side of the world when this nation collapsed, and found himself inconvenienced by detention in a Japanese prison camp. His liberation was arranged by the English Government, and he found himself repatriated to England well after any meaningful resistance had ended. Wanting to reward a war hero as propaganda, the government allowed him to be restored to active duty and file him away into a position in the Royal Artillery, allowing him a relatively comfortable semi-retirement.\n\nBy the next saturday he was in direct contact with Alexander, arranged by a Mister Philby in MI6.\n\nGeneral Wingate is an infiltrator of the highest order, and possibly the most important one of the Left Resistance. Even Claude cannot have this much influence in the military, and the SAS cannot compare at all with what he offers. Practically nobody is this big of a blind spot in the enemy army. He is a ticking time bomb in the English Military, and when he goes off, the regime will fall."

"What exactly is going on over in your regiment?"\n\n"Sir, if this is about the Leicester train robbery," and indeed Wingate knew it was, "I am currently looking into just exactly how things went-"\n\n"A full train of ammunition and German weaponry just stopped in the middle of nowhere and unloaded by the communists like it's their intended stop! And where the hell were your men? They took a half hour to begin to respond, and they missed the rebels by a mile!"\n\n"Sir, it was most likely the railway workers, we couldn't find them, so we assume there was some sort of conspiracy going on with them-"\n\n"That's your responsibility, Wingate! Find out who did it, or I'll have to replace you! This army has no place for your incompetence, and we'll find some place to hide you away if you keep acting like that, am I clear?"\n\n"Yes sir." and Monty hung up.\n\nWingate relaxed and took another bite of onion. Of course the train was his responsibility. He gave the route to Bill, and he made sure his men were on drill when the call came through. This wasn't the first time this had happened, and it wasn't the first time Monty had tried to put his ass on a plaque either.\n\nThe threat was hollow as well. Monty never found time to reassign him.

As workers gathered outside the openings of the steel mills and iron mines across the Midlands, large numbers of workers turned their backs to the gates and confronted anyone who tried to pass. A few gruff words and a shove or two was enough to dissuade anyone else from entering. And when the gates officially opened, and nobody entered, it was instantly clear an enormous labor action, the likes of which hadn't been seen since Cable Street, was beginning.\n\nThe effective closure of the all-important steel industry sent shockwaves among the urban centers of the area. Birmingham was the first to feel the effects, with streets getting clogged by protesting workers and everyone knowing at least someone who was probably in the picket line. Thus there were many supporters who came out behind them, many of which were family members of the steel and iron workers. Schools were unable to hold classes, and many places were unable to conduct work with the massive demonstrations going on below.\n\nSoon came the inevitable sympathy strikes. Steel workers were going to walk off, so why not the related industries? The railroad workers had issues as well, so they could just put the engines into park around Northampton and walk off. Why not show solidarity with the working class, thought the students of De Montfort University, and leave class early? What if the bus drivers of Stoke-on-Trent threw another spanner into the works and left as well? Well, why not?\n\nIt seemed like the middle of England was in full revolt, openly defying their bosses, and the authorities. This London could not stand.\n\nThe call was sent out to mobilize the army divisions in the area."

A quick glance around told him the rest of his squad were following suit, separating their grenades, cleaning their firearms and applying ad hoc camouflage where they could. Men might say what they liked about how General Stirling was mad after all, but no one ever said he tolerated ill discipline.\n\nThe communists on the other hand, were not so well prepared. Of the two sections who'd accompanied his squad, perhaps only five men looked like they were old enough to see the last war. The rest? Youths to a man and woman, with mismatched weapons and an enthusiastic but still amateur sense of discipline. But they had fire in their bellies, Bullock could tell that from looking at them. They all hated the Germans as much as he did, and for now that would have to do. Wiping his face, he walked over to his nominal ally and the communist in charge, Lt Hart.\n\nThe woman, and hadn't Bullock been surprised to see that the first time he'd met her, was sharpening the fancy Indian knife she tended to carry around, and barely looked up to acknowledge him as he approached. "We're ready, you?" The scouse accent of the woman standing out amidst her colleagues hushed chatter.\n\n"Aye." Bullock responded. "Your men will take the front, my lads will get in the back and finish things, that's still the plan?"\n\n"If the situation hasn't changed, then yes." The Lieutenant looked up at him finally. "Command says the signal will be when the port facilities blow up, we're to have everything done and dusted in two hours, or we bug out."\n\nBullock simply grinned as he walked back to his soldiers.

ENG_intro.44.desc:0 "For a few glorious seconds, the night outside the Plymouth countryside was lit up by a tremendous fireball stretching a hundred metres into the sky. Unterfeldwebel Alois Gensch could only stare in horror at something he'd dearly hoped would stay east of the Garrison's border, before training and sanity reasserted itself seconds later. "Move!" He thundered at the 9 terrified men who were manning the checkpoint with him. "Get to your fucking positions before-"\n\nThe first bullet struck home, and unfortunately for Gensch it hit his radioman, Wagner, directly in his throat. Amidst a flurry of expletives, Gensch ducked behind one of the concrete posts which made up the checkpoint's inner blocks, and returned fire in the general direction he'd seen the muzzle flash. The response this time was a fusillade of gunfire, little of it accurate, not that it saved poor Schmidt as the rifleman collapsed to the ground wheezing and coughing blood.\n\nGensch reviewed his options as he reloaded, he needed to get his men into better cover than the checkpoint for sure, yet if they moved the suppressing fire would certainly kill or worse, wound some of his squad. "Keep firing!" He roared at his men, and to their credit they'd gotten over their shock quickly enough. A short burst rang out and an Englishmen who'd been trying to sneak up on the position fell dead not three metres from Gensch's hiding place. Close enough that he could see the red armband tied around their coat. "Communists" Gensch spat. That was good, he'd fought this kind of foe in London, it wouldn't be too hard to drive them off once they realised his men were over their shock and that reinforcements were on the way.\n\nGensch was so immersed in readying his weapon to take another shot that he didn't notice the two dozen men who stalked out of the Depot to his right until they'd already gotten into cover of their own. It took him another few moments to realize they weren't German. Not a minute later, the SAS Commando's stalked over the cooling corpses of Gensch's squad and signaled to the Communists the all clear. And the looting of the Cornwall Garrison's explosives depot could begin."

The scattered observers to the conflict were mostly huddled under their beds like they had been twenty years ago, but a scant few due to recklessness or simple apathy glanced outside their windows to watch the battle continue.\n\nThe Germans were fighting as well as could be expected, these were not raw recruits after all, and their General had drilled them often and well on the possibilities of an attack on their home base. But it was not enough, they had after all been trained on fighting the tactics of the various English rebel organisations operating on their own, not together and in concert.\n\nThe red armbands of Leftist fighters starkly marked the majority of the men and women who'd ambushed the Garrison patrol, certainly the rest of their equipment was hardly unified enough to distinguish them from from badly dressed civilians, but their ferocity had pushed the Germans back from the beginning. Heedless of casualties the Left Resistance pushed forwards and onwards, aiming to drive the Germans off the roadside and into the shrubbery that marked the edge of the Detention Camps for reasons the Germans could likely only guess at.\n\nThe question was rendered moot when a speeding lorry drove around the bend in the middle of the firefight, and proceeded to ram through the camp's flimsy wooden gates. Gawping, the horrified remnants of the Camp guards who had attempted to reinforce the patrol were suddenly treated to the other participants in the engagement, in the form of some two dozen heavily armed commandos, and a lorry mounted heavy machine gun. The fighting in that section of the town ended quickly after that.\n\nMore lorries arrived, and the 2nd part of Claude's gambit began as prisoners took their chance for freedom and began piling into the vehicles, to go they knew not where.

But he supposed the world was a strange place, and he had an enemy far worse than the communists to battle.\n\n"Hold your ground!" He shouted amidst the bullets and shellfire raining onto the harbour wharf where he and his men were encamped. He punctuated the statement by lobbing a grenade at one group of Germans who'd made the mistake of thinking that just because the communists were poorly equipped, that the same applied to his own men. "Make them pay for every inch!" The explosion and German screams that followed added an appropriate amount of gravitas he felt. Inwardly though, Lee was getting worried as the night wore on. The Germans who were responding now weren't the raw recruits he'd slain up until this point, these men were older, veterans of Russia if he was to guess. They died hard, and his men didn't have enough ammunition to keep them constantly suppressed.\n\nTaking cover, he gestured for his radio man to join him. "This is Charlemagne to Dead Astor, do not answer, Jerry is pressing us and we'll need Dover ready to extract us before long. Out." Lee gestured for the man to continue his role in the firefight before peering around the corner of the masonry he was hiding behind. He'd hoped that calling in the boats to evacuate his men wouldn't be necessary but he wouldn't bet on being able to hold out for long if the Germans got off their asses and brought in some armour. At least their airfields were out of commission for a few precious hours.\n\nHearing movement, Lee lined up a shot and caught the reckless German who'd tried to flank his position in the head. "Gentlemen, just a little bit longer!" He hoped it would only be a little bit longer anyway. Callsign Dover was meant to respond in minutes. In the meantime though, Christopher Lee raised his rifle towards the enemy once more."

The transcript in front of him was the joint report from Stirling and Alexander, and if nothing else it was mildly entertaining. The losses thankfully were few, and each of the men asserted their forces had done more damage to the Germans, which both thankfully seemed to think had gotten off rather poorly.\n\nSignalling over one of the guards, he wrote a message thanking them for their service and to withdraw their men to the North once they were back outside the Garrison's demesne. To stay once they had their airfields running again would be folly after all. Thinking, Auchinleck added a note at the bottom to see if any of the men rescued from the camp would be willing to join the cause, new recruits were always valuable after all.\n\nAs a test run for the Liberation plan, everything in Plymouth had gone near perfectly. The Germans were as fragile as they looked, the Traitors hadn't even been able to mobilize troops in time to intercept his men.

It was the silent, steely gaze of the Prime Minister that had their undivided attention. Field Marshal's Templar and Montgomery, alongside special agent Philby were some of the best men alive in their particular fields. Two had fought the Germans years ago, and Philby had proven himself in the years since in the field of intelligence work. Yet before the gaze of the mild mannered and evidently furious PM they were careful to keep composed, and to wait for him to speak first.\n\n"Gentlemen, we face a conundrum by my understanding." Douglas-Home idly spoke as he looked at the series of reports in front of him.

The fact was though, he knew he couldn't hope to take down HMMLR with a single strike.\n\nThe forces required, it would give the terrorists too much warning. No, it was too risky to attempt to strike the entire organisation as one. But a single key piece, that was more achievable. To eliminate Bill Alexander would be a propaganda victory without compare, the communist had been on the run for almost a decade and a half. To strike down Stirling might actually be better, without him blowing up half the barracks in England the army might get something done.\n\nThe third option though, well it was tempting. To put down whatever mad dog headed HMMLR and had forged the compromise which bound the organisation was very, very tempting. Men like that couldn't be easily replaced by terrorist groups. Still, the Prime Minister knew he had to choose. Looking up at last, he spoke to the men gathered in front of him."

Maybe it was pressure from the US, as the Yanks were more focused on the Pacific or South Africa to help liberate the homeland of representative democracy, and told the Canadians to shove it. The socialists in the unified movement to overthrow the Nazis in Britain pointed out that this just shows that the "true" Monarchy, safely ensconced in Canada, was now not even going to lift a finger to help restore them.

He sat in silence for a moment, listening to their pained and feverish breathing echo through the concrete basement. Behind him, he felt the presence of a few of the lads-the good, young, patriotic boys who had been trying their hardest to talk some sense into them traitors, to give up the game.\n\nHe took a deep breath and gave the assembled men a grandfatherly smile. "Now, you must understand that I have little desire to impugn you or deny how spirited your resistance to good sense has been." One of the men began to sob. "Quite to the contrary, one could say that your fortitude, your commitment to this cause, is evidence of the strength that Britons have to offer." A man stared at him with his one remaining eye.

Chesterton watched as the one-eyed man raised his head and gathered as much dignity as he could. "Kill-.

We now no longer know about certain Government attack plans, we no longer have an eye on what Home and the others are up to in London, and the cherry on top of the Shit cake; Chesterton's lackeys have apparently tortured our captured insiders into giving up sensitive details regarding our own plans and operations.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a crushing blow for the resistance, and our war effort at large. Some of our operatives are insisting we mount a rescue operation, no matter the risk, for strategic and moral reasons, as well as to minimize whatever other info Chesterton might squeeze out of them. However, for once, Auchinleck, Alexander, and Stirling are all in agreement that it would be a poor idea, and a wasteful operation with virtually no chance at success. Even if we wanted to, we simply do not have the resources nor manpower readily available, as we need everyone and everything we can find on the front lines and in support roles, we cannot spare a thing.\n\nSo for that reason, we'll just have to hope we can rescue them the day we storm London and destroy the treacherous Home Government, and pray the Blackshirts don't murder them in captivity.

"Naval forces were not necessary in this past war. But if there's a German invasion, the navy will become highly relevant.

I think we should consider an alternative route."\n\nThis caught the attention of the other generals. They had been pretty unanimous at this meeting up until this point. Macmillan was interested as well, asking "so what are you proposing, General?"\n\n"As much as it pains me to say this," he said, "we need to get the Americans to help us out with our defense."\n\nThis took the room by surprise, "You're out of line, General," said Field Marshal Montgomery. "The Americans were funding Auchinleck and the rest of HMMLR. They aren't going to help us out! And even if they did, the help will have to travel all the way from North America over here. No, the only way we can guarantee our defense is to concentrate on making sure we can stand up to Germany."\n\n"Sir, your disdain for the Americans is well noted. However, they have technologies, equipment, and experience that we need to fight a war against Germany. And they aren't idiotic, they know we aren't on good terms with the Germans right now, and they'll support our efforts to keep them off the isle."\n\n"It'll be a fair-weather support," scoffed Monty. "And all the American technology won't replace British defences and factories. The war's coming, and we need to have the fortifications and defences ready."\n\n"The war is coming, Field Marshall," responded Baker, "and we need all the outside help we can get.""

ENG_mac.3.desc:0 ""When I was in charge of the housing programme in 1957, I had the honor of presiding over the opening of a housing complex in Folkestone, near Dover. Folkestone was near the German landing zones, and as such, it had taken the worst of the invasion. Many homes were destroyed, either by shelling, or aerial bombardment. Years after the invasion, one could still see the burnt buildings, the shell holes, and the exteriors pockmarked with bullet holes.\n\n"It has been a considerable time since those days, and last week I decided to visit the town myself to see how they were getting on. There had been considerable trouble in the area recently, but this did not obscure the scars of war still underneath the surface. Buildings were still burnt, the holes were still in the ground, and there were still bullets embedded in the walls of Folkestone.\n\n"Outside the city, on my way to Dover, I saw a group of workers on the beach. A German bomb had been uncovered, I was told, and they were trying to dispose of it. As I watched them work, my gaze was drawn across the ocean. There was Calais, now under perpetual occupation by Herr Himmler's SS. And at that time, I realized two fundamental truths; the invasion was an abuse that England will never forget, yet the chance of another one, possibly worse, was still high.\n\n"Every once and awhile, I've heard people say that England is on the way out. That we are no longer capable of standing up for ourselves. Nonsense. This is a great country, one that has a superb record of achievement of every kind. We have no need to fear temporary setbacks.

ENG_mac.4.desc:0 "At the request of the Prime Minister, we have been tasked with conducting an investigation into the failings of the British Military during the 1943 invasion. This commission, led by General Carver, enlisted the support of the Public Record Office, the Historical Records Commission, and RMA Sandhurst. After much study, several critical failings have been reported by the commission:\n\n1. In the crucial initial hours of the invasion, there was a massive organizational breakdown, with many home guard units being overwhelmed and unable to provide an effective defense. Manpower had been stretched thin, and what few units there were on coastal defence were unable to stand their ground.\n\n2. British defensive fortifications were inadequate and lackluster. A few blockhouses were in place, but they were scarcely enough to hold the enemy back and provide our forces with meaningful cover. A lack of fortified positions meant English forces had few places to hold and launch counter-attacks from.\n\n3. The Royal Air Force was unable to provide a degree of arial protection against the Luftwaffe. The organization was unable to keep up with German aircraft production or pilot training. Other ways of mitigating this advantage were not available, leading to effective German ground support and attacks against infrastructure.\n\nWe have not included in this report much analysis of naval failings, as those have been well documented elsewhere. This report is primarily for strategic and tactical problems with the Army and RAF. We will say, however, that a lack of intelligence and early warning systems played a part in the battle, especially in regards to the German deception in Operation Herbstreise."

ENG_mac.5.t:0 "Conclusions of the Sandhurst Exercise"
ENG_mac.5.desc:0 "In summary, the war game ended in a English victory, by a vote of 6-0 from the umpires. The Germans were limited in the areas they could invade without access to the French coast, and were forced to conduct operations on the eastern shore of England. The English team had expected this and were able to deploy their units in the area.\n\nThis ended up giving them the crucial advantage, as they were able to hold onto the ports and prevent the Germans from gaining them. Without an avenue for resupply, the German beachheads were pushed back into the sea, with a great loss of men and materiel. There were, however, some difficulties for the English that should not be discounted:\n\n1. German armor provided a level of hardness to the invasion that was difficult to overcome. It was responsible for most of Germany's early gains in the exercise. England was unable to counter these tanks, and oftentimes lost engagements to them. Only the lack of supply eventually allowed England to defeat the panzer divisions.\n\n2. Germany started the exercise with air superiority, and maintained it throughout the game. This made any English operation difficult, and was responsible for prolonging the German defense. England lacked the ability to counter this advantage."

ENG_mac.21.t:0 "The State of the Royal Navy, Conclusion"
ENG_mac.21.desc:0 "It is obvious that the Royal Navy is in dire shape and in no way prepared for a modern conflict. On the surface, the Royal Navy comprises a respectable number of vessels, more than many other countries, and backed up by a decent dockyard base. What this hides, however, is an aged navy in no way able to compete with any modern fleet.\n\nThe major vessels of the Royal Navy are not really impressive. Battleships like the HMS Howe are relegated to tasks like shore bombardment and are functionally obsolete in naval combat. The pride of the fleet, HMS Implacable, is a relic of the Second World War, relying on a small flight of prop-driven aircraft to provide air support.\n\nScreening vessels are where the navy derives most of its strength. Even there, the destroyers are mostly out of date, with a few exceptions. The main armaments, such as torpedoes and cannons, are ancient. The lack of modern anti-aircraft, a necessity, is also extremely concerning. Most alarmingly, our fleet lacks proper ASW radar and weaponry, making our destroyers next to useless in a potential conflict.\n\nOur submarine fleet is small, obsolete, and ineffective. Comprising only a few vessels, it has been mothballed since the Second World War, and woefully obsolete. Other submarines are better in nearly every respect, and so will enemy ASW ships.\n\nIt is clear an upgrade is in order, with newer ships with modern armament needing to be produced. If we wish to keep these ships, they need to be modernized as well. And a complete rebuilding of the fleet air arm must also take place. Only by massive effort can we hope the Royal Navy to regain some semblance of her former strength."

ENG_mac.22.t:0 "England's Charter"
ENG_mac.22.desc:0 "The British Navy was once the strongest and largest in the world. Dominating the world since the age of sail, the navy had been a legendary and terrifying force. Every man could recall the names and heroism of Drake, Nelson, and Cook. Memories of the HMS Victory still stirred the hearts, and the name HMS Dreadnought still would deliver chills to some. Like the sun never setting on the British Empire, there was nary an ocean in the world where the British Fleet would not be patrolling the waves.\n\nThen, the war happened. What had once terrified the world was on the bottom of the ocean, laid low by bombs or torpedoes. Peace was more devastating. Many ships now flew under different flags, those of Scotland, the Commonwealth, the OFN, all now independent of London. The vanquishers of the British fleet scrapped what ships left that had been deemed a threat, and mothballed the rest so England would never have its fabled weapon again.\n\nBut this was a new era. Those in London today would not be cowed by Teutonic threats. Now, they would make sure no enemy force would land on England again and subjugate the people of the isle. In shipyards across the nation, people lined up to build what the occupiers had said they could not. No agreement made under durress with the Nazi beast would be respected now.\n\nThousands of shipyard workers took their tools up again and marched into the dockyards. Every drydock would have a hull in it, and if it didn't, there would be one. Looking at the first ship sailing out of the historic dockyard of Portsmouth, even those with the faintest memories of the British Empire could hardly suppress their smiles at the memory of the line "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.""

They also are satisfied with their concrete position overlooking Margate.\n\nPetty Officer Powell's first assignment was in a rusting submarine from the Second World War. It looked like it belonged at the bottom of the ocean, and there were fears that it would really stay there next dive. Powell no longer needs to loathe his assignment, however. He now is quite comfortable on his new submarine, one that is considerably faster, armed, and more habitable than his original posting.\n\nFlight Sergeant Foster didn't think he would be in any sort of Royal Air Force if he joined the military. Eveb if he did, he fully expected to be flying prop-driven aircraft. He believed that he would end up in the Army like everyone else. Well, life's funny, sometimes. He now flies a modern jet fighter, and can claim to be a pilot like his father was back in the war.\n\nAll across Britain, there are men like Booth, Powell, and Foster. Men of the British Armed Forces, granted the ability to be far more effective and strong than they thought possible. No longer is it a token force.

Out of respect for the work we did together back in the war, I claimed to lack any knowledge of you and what I did give them was misleading and not helpful. I hope they haven't given you too much trouble, and that you were aware of their interest in you.\n\nRecently, however, circumstances have come about where I must contact you. My government wishes to discuss an issue of great importance with a representative of the United States. I immediately suggested that you should be the one we talk with. It is a deal that could radically transform the alignment of Western Europe in this Cold War. If you are interested, come to Rome immediately and contact our embassy there.

England will offer the United States the ability to station troops within its borders. The American armed forces will be allowed to conduct operations from our territory, and to receive supplies as well. The United States Navy will also be granted the ability to resupply and rearm in English ports.\n\nIn return, England will be paid for these rights in regular shipments of American equipment, which we will use to arm ourselves against foreign aggression. We also wish to enter a technology sharing agreement, where we can study American technological developments and use them for our own needs.\n\nI sincerely hope you consider this agreement to be fair.

"We have a fleet of seven destroyers and corvettes with us today, mostly for ASW and AA protection. But the real striking power is in the aircraft. A good air arm is worth way more than a battleship." The Captain was willing to share a lot of information about the fleet. Mostly because the Americans figured the Japanese were watching this exercise anyway. They were meant to.\n\n"And, it's typical for a carrier to operate in a strike group like this alone?\n\n"The Captain looked at him and said "you get a big enough air wing, you can do most anything with a carrier.

Delivering a wreath to the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier would show sincerity. England hadn't forgotten the ANZACs, and that would be conveyed to Australia by that action. Remembering what Australia had done for the British Empire would also acknowledge the reasons for it declaring itself a republic. And at the end of the day, the biggest issues between England and Australia would be bridged by understanding."

ENG_mac.115.desc:0 "With the sun breaking over the eastern horizon, a jet lands on a runway in the Australian Capital Territory. It is an English aircraft, and it comes from Heathrow in London. It pulls up to the terminal, and offloads an extremely important cargo. A wide variety of people come out. Executives, politicians, trade representatives, diplomats, all representing England, and here on a mission of goodwill.\n\nThe diplomats get into their taxis and rental cars, and disperse amongst the city of Canberra. Every one of them has a certain destination in mind. Some will go to the headquarters of various industry groups and corporate headquarters. Others will rub shoulders at the Department of External Affairs or the halls of Parliament. One or two will even make it inside Government House.\n\nTheir goal is simple. Relations between England and Australia are not as good as they should be, according to the English government. The old way would be to merely convince the President that England can be useful as a friend and not an enemy, but that's not enough. A government is a complex mechanism, and policy is not just determined by the one at the top.\n\nCanberrians of all positions will be courted. They will begin to associate England with all sorts of positive things. A profitable trading partner. A historical friend. And a potential ally in various foreign policy goals. When that jet leaves for Heathrow, those feelings will be embedded in the minds of the policymakers of Canberra."

Well, we are, and we're joining the OFN at the first opportunity. But I can't say that! We're friends, we're willing to work with you, and you shouldn't invade us.\n\nFirst topic: trade. Everybody loves trade. Especially if you can sell stuff to us. And we'll buy it. What's that? Domestic production? Everybody has to work, don't they? And we need to improve our own economy, you can understand that, Mr. Autarky, can't you? Trade with the OFN? We just need to diversify!\n\nSecond topic: foreign relations. We aren't going to challenge your hold on Europe. At least not until we have a few US Air Force bases. You can stay subjugating the people of Estern Europe, and bombing anybody beyond that. We literally can't do anything about it, so we'll say it's not our responsibility.\n\nThird topic: we're better off being friends. We need each other! You wouldn't like it if we went with the OFN, wouldn't you? Well, you catch more flies with honey, so they say. We stay friends, you don't have to invade, and we won't go running to the US.

ENG_mac.117.desc:0 "Hello there! I'm Parker Macdonald, from the Embassy. I'm just out here getting a feel for the general mood of Germania towards us. There's a large amount of misconceptions that need to be corrected. There isn't as much animosity in England towards the Pakt as you may think. We're still dedicated to a friendly relationship with you.\n\nEngland still relies on Germany for its trade, about as much as it did before the civil war. And I'm sure there's a large number of German businesses that rely on us as well. Our programs to increase domestic production? Doesn't everyone want to produce as much as possible in their own country? And we have to advance, or we get left behind. The OFN? Well, it's just an open option that we use to get things we absolutely can't from the Pakt. A mere trifle, really!\n\nWe really aren't in the business of Pakt busting right now. England isn't going to stand up to you, and if I may confide in you for a moment, we really have no way to. We know you are the major power on the continent, and we know we can't compete, and we're just fine if we leave each other alone.\n\nI mean, good relations between England and Germany is what we want, correct? We're better off together. If not, it would be unfortunate, and may cause us to go seeking out other powers. Good relations, in my view, will keep England where it is now in relation to the Pakt. Otherwise, if things sour, there may be an unfortunate situation, one which may very well cause us to seek aid from other sources.\n\nWell, good to meet you. I have to go, unfortunately. There's a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce I'm scheduled to speak at. Let's keep in touch! Hope we meet again sometime."

He got to see how they reacted to the Reich welcoming England back into the civilised world. To his confusion however, when looking at the German Embassy very few of the English smiled. Some scowled, some cursed, none would go far as to spit whilst men with guns were around though. Hans simply couldn't understand why they felt that way though. Germany was a bulwark against bolshevism and American puppetry, could the English not see that?

And it wasn't like he hadn't looked it over before the address to parliament.\n\nMacmillan sighed. The thought of working with the Germans had been anathema to him. The well documented problems United England had with the Reich were well known. They had dropped a bomb in this very chamber, hadn't they? And on a personal note, they had tried to kill Macmillan. Damn nearly succeeded as well at the Somme, making him play dead in a shell hole for half a day then making him spend months on crutches afterwards.\n\nAnd yet, this was necessary. If England was to have a peaceful future, they had to get on Germany's good side. Convince them England wouldn't be a problem. Tell them England would not be a threat against their horrific ambitions for the world. And sweeten the deal with a trade offer. Why not be friends anyway? England had nothing more to need from the Reich, and a war would certainly result in thousands of dead Germans.\n\nThe crowd applauded. Some boos, but what could one expect in the House of Commons?

They were fascists afterall, the Prime Minister would rather take any other course of action than having to bargain with such villains.\n\nThe real plan was for a military invasion of the peninsula, the negotiations would only ever be used as a distraction. Then, when the time was right, the army would push, seizing back England's rightful land.\n\nYet there Macmillan sat, baldfaced, waiting for the German response.

However, with the additional support of some crucial pieces of armor the early stages of the attack appeared to have been a moderate success.\n\nVictory still hangs in the balance, either side could triumph, especially if more German troops arrive and the English attack stalls.

Our chief advisors have been greatly divided and even bewildered from this recent request for weaponry. Having a friend in what was once a core part of the Einheitspakt would be the beginning of a sea change in Europe, but it would cost us a fair amount of equipment (and we can't even be sure Macmillan wants to deepen relations with us).

Men may not have faith in many things after all that has befallen England in these years, but they have faith in Macmillan because he's dragged them out of hell before.\n\nThe smaller portion of the party are led by Reginald Maudling, the "Liberals". Unlike the Macmillanists, the Liberals are loyal to the idea of democracy rather than to a single person.

They were equally astonished when he told them Cornwall was English once again. Maudling was surprised by the subdued initial reaction, but Macmillan assured him that the people who heard Lloyd George announcing from his window the Great War would end in a few hours probably were confused as well.\n\nOnce again, Macmillan's instincts proved correct, for when they arrived at the memorial, people had begun to hear about it. Bicycle commuters stopped to shake the PM's hand and tell him \"job well done.\" Even the police officers who were on patrol of the park left their routes to congratulate Maudling.\n\nAs they walked back, a small entourage formed, cheering Maudling on, singing patriotic songs, and making rude remarks about the Germans and, occasionally, the head of the Shadow Cabinet. When they made it back to Number 10, a crowd was already waiting for them, and so were plenty of press. As they went inside, Maudling waved to the cheering crowd that was ever growing, while Macmillan rebuffed the media's questions by saying they could expect a complete address from the Prime Minister shortly.\n\nMacmillan and Maudling were later told by Scotland Yard not to do something so risky again. The crowds grew too large, too fast. But that risk had been accounted for by both the PM and his loyal assistant. And they felt this moment of triumph had been richly deserved."

ENG_mac.200.t:0 "Regional Unemployment – Where to Focus?"
ENG_mac.200.desc:0 "We desperately need to revitalize our struggling economy before any other goals of our government can be achieved. As we have already studied, all three regions have had it rough for some time now. However, we cannot solve all three problems at once. We need to be able to focus our efforts on the place where our programs can do the most good.\n\nThe North was the hardest hit, even before the war. It will take some convincing, as the North was a hotbed of resistance prior to the war, but no small part of that resistance was due to a lack of economic programs centered around this poorest region. Showing that the government is willing to make amends for past omissions might go a long way towards shoring up our economy and national unity. It is risky, but the rewards could be very valuable.\n\nThe Midlands are primarily agricultural, and so our program of industrialization would present a significant change in the overall lifestyle of the region. However, it would also show our commitment to an oft-forgotten region and stamp down Stirlingite sympathies among the population.\n\nThe South has always been the richest region, owing in no small part to a London-centered government. It has also been the least turbulent region and was a bulwark of the government during the English Civil War. Our efforts here would be most likely to succeed and would certainly benefit the government's standing with the upper classes. However, leaving out the other regions might sour national unity.\n\nWhere should we focus the efforts of our new programs?"

ENG_mac.201.desc:0 "Our businesses have many opportunities abroad to open up shop and begin bringing in the wealth that we will need to restore England's economic future and infrastructure. However, relations have become increasingly strained with our partners on the continent and in America, due to the antipathy between those two trading partners. We have two options: Stick with neutrality as long as possible, or begin to open up towards either European markets with German support or try to attract American finances.\n\nNeutrality would give us the best of both worlds and allow trade relations with both sides, which is why we have been so hesitant so far to pick a side. However, this window is quickly closing, and continuing neutrality now might hurt our negotiations later due to our disloyalty to either party.\n\nAmerica has massive trading power and an unrivaled financial system, but working with America would antagonize our European trading partners, not to mention the national security risk of working with the main opponent of a militarily aggressive neighbor. We could also draw closer to Germany- were there appears to be some economic liberalization taking place. We could take advantage of this new system to slip ourselves into the European sphere and reap the rewards of the markets there.\n\nShould we delay taking a side, or look across our shores to international markets?"

The legislation was nothing new - indeed, it was long overdue. Small, token reforms to England's healthcare and labor regulations, to prove that the government could actually look after the people, now that the specter of German intervention in English politics was gone.\n\nWas it going to be enough to convince the people that United England had their interests in mind? On its own, perhaps not. But in the post-Civil War political landscape, Macmillan was the best the people were going to get - the only one who knew Westminster inside and out, who could deliver the promised, better future for England. Everyone else would just cock it up.\n\nTomorrow, England would see what competent leadership could do for the country, and Macmillan would make sure they wouldn't forget who made it all possible."

The result was a hundred-page behemoth that defied easy description, encompassing everything from mechanizing English agriculture, investing in English science, and investing in the industrial heartlands.\n\nBut the details were from - and for - the bureaucrats. Now Maudling had to sell it to Parliament, and to the people. He had no doubt that, if implemented fully, his plan would transform England, freeing it from two decades of stagnation. If nothing else, the numbers would look impressive, coming from a low base.\n\nBut the English people would see a country rebuilt from ashes, the return of dignified work, and the restoration of prosperity. The English people would dare to dream again, to look at the world with something other than survival in mind. To know that their country, restored to greatness, would grow still greater.

And doubtlessly, there would be more across the kingdom. All thanks to Mac, of course.\n\nEngland had a chance for a future, thanks to him and Mac. one of freedom and plenty under liberalism. Not brought about by the gun, but by the pen. And that, he could drink too."

ENG_mac.1117.desc:0 "Maudling decided that he had quite enough of corporatism after his first term. The ill-meaning corporations, running around, buying influence in his Parliament, doing all they could to reintroduce corruption to his institutions. It had to be stopped. And he knew what to do about it.\n\nThere would be a plan. Track down the bribes. Find the corrupt officials. Follow the money. And Identify the people making the payments. Then, in one fell swoop, England would be rid of any undue corporate influence. And anyone who wanted to try the same thing again would find new laws and restrictions in their way."

ENG_mac.1118.t:0 "At the Desk"
ENG_mac.1118.desc:0 "Today at work, Maudling was going to get a handle on this military-industrial complex. Whoever said it was a threat to democracy was right. And England wanted to be a democracy. So it had to get a handle on this cycle of warmongering and fraud.\n\nFirst step would be to clean up the ranks. Several generals had been identified as accepting money or other perks in exchange for lobbying for contracts. They would have to go. Maudling signed the papers that would begin court-marshals against them first. Maybe they would be successful, maybe not. But they would be permitted to resign rather than face the humiliation. And that would get them out of the way.\n\nNext, legal proceedings of a different type. Lawsuits against armament companies. They were bribing military officials, and they were defrauding the government out of money. That was highly illegal in England. And now the hammer would be coming down.\n\nHe sighed. It had been an hour of work, and he had to go to Buckingham to receive the new ambassador from Cuba. One day, he would get the entire military industry under the government's control, but that would have to wait for now. It had been a pretty active and accomplished day on that front anyway."

Whenever the subject was brought up, Harold's expression would grow fearsome, his words terrifying and dictatorial. Thankfully, Maudling had thus far kept the Chairmen's reactionary authoritarianism in check, but the fascists were still a problem and he was going to eliminate them.\n\nOrders went out. Find the blackshirts in the government, wherever they were. Get their names, and their positions. If they were in parliament or any public office, Maudling needed to know about it.\n\nAnd they would be sent to him.\n\nMaudling was going to exterminate the menace as Mac wanted to.

Fifteen years? That's quite an accomplishment. And you kept your seat since before the civil war. I do so wonder how you were so fortunate as to have gotten the seat. Would it be rude to wonder if it might have been that the Germans knew you from your affiliation with Mosely back in the thirties? Could it have been that? You do know the old pre-war government kept tabs on that sort of thing, didn't you? We have the MI5 files.\n\nMister Richardson, let's stop beating around the bush. You're a fascist. You worked with fascists. And you were probably as much a traitor to the old government as you are to mine. But I'm giving you a chance. You renounce your affiliations now, and work with me, and everything will be fine, nobody has to know. Otherwise you'll just have to be sent to a place that appreciates your sentiments, and I dare say you'll be staying there for a very long time.

One which had suited him well. But it could be more. A lot more. There were still vestigial structures from the Royal Party reformist wing in there.

They were highly influential members, and in positions that held a lot of sway. And they were gumming up the works. They had to be removed.\n\nThe plan was extremely simple. The Prime Minister would write to them, and demand their immediate resignations. They were getting old, and new people would need to replace them. People that were more liberal than their predecessors. And more in tune with what the Prime Minister wanted.\n\nThe risks were incalculable.

And what he was looking at in front of him seemed to prove him right.\n\nOne may declare England to be a conservative country, based on its government. For the longest time, it was a one-party state only catering to the elites and the rich. It was highly regressive in pretty much every aspect. And the furthest left was Maudling and the UE party.\n\nBut that was only the government. Maudling long knew the government wasn't representative. And he felt there were a number of people who were significantly more left than the government currently represented. So he made the poll.\n\nHe was correct. There were a great number of voters who weren't quite socialists, but they weren't represented in parliament either. That opened up an enormous opportunity. If one was to sweep up these center-left voters, they could well open up a path to a massive majority in the next election..."

ENG_mac.1125.desc:0 "The party was split irreconcilably. Maudling's supporters and the Macmillanists were no longer talking with each other. The Liberals believed the Macmillanists were too stuck in the past. The Macmillanists had been tired of the Liberals and Maudling abusing them for so long. For a United England Party, it really was anything but.\n\nBut not in voting. Every time a bill needed to be passed by the PM, both sides got together and passed it. They still sat in the same benches. And they would still identify themselves with the party label.\n\n\This peculiar situation had one explanation. Despite their hatred of each other, there still was a common goal between them. Both sides were close to a democratic England. They needed only stay together for a little bit, and they could get the bills they needed passed. Then, they could be rid of the other forever.\n\nJust as Maudling wanted it to be."

Sure, they try to put on a respectable face today, but we know what they really think. And what they have done. From the early days of the occupation, to Cable Street, to the Civil War, even to last week.\n\nWe'll start gathering all the dirt we can find on the Royal Party. Records, private conversations, MI5 files, everything. Then, we reveal all of it to the public. Then, the poor and the suffering will realize what the Royal Party really is.\n\nThe first step towards improving a situation is to make smart decisions. And we'll ensure every Englander votes with care when they step into the ballot box."

The radio would carry it as well. And the next day would be the morning news shows. Surrogates had been recruited to go out to everywhere in the press and promote the findings. It would be a full press offensive.\n\nThere was plenty of nasty information found about the Royal Party. Did anyone expect there to not be? You don't collaborate with the Nazis for twenty years without doing some despicable things. And being the unashamed party of the rich and the elite wasn't exactly a populist move. Then, there were the damned lies they had told. It had all been gathered into a series of reports that were about to go out after this speech.\n\nMaudling checked it again, making sure it was good. He would have to hit every note for maximum effect. To catch the Royal Party off guard. To discredit them in the eyes of the public.

Highly important things that would ensure a Democracy would truly exist in England. And he had the paperwork to do so right here. He took it out and went to work.\n\nA few pages, and a few signatures. That's all it took. Now, there were a lot fewer restrictions on political organizations. They could begin organizing, and electing their chosen members to public office. And they would be loyal to him for the immediate, and crucial, first part.\n\nThe left was now back.

The one man in the Royal Party with the balls to stand up to the rest of the organization. The independent who dragged the island kicking and screaming from a single-party oligarchy to a free democracy. And yet...the man who had to rely on Macmillan's protection for most of the time in parliament. The man who served as the shadowmaster's puppet for most of his time as PM. And the man who betrayed his friends in the war, and the man who betrayed his party after that. Was it really worth the cost?\n\nBut did it matter? What's done was done. And one couldn't argue with the results. They had the right to criticize him for what he did now. The restrictions on speech were lifted, after all. And no matter what people thought of Reggie, or what Reggie thought of himself, he'd still be the one who freed the island, and showed them a future free of the disaster and oppression of the past.\n\nAnd that future of a glorious Britain was worth it in the end."

And yet, there was always the potential, always the concern that they could rise again. But would they be the same self serving fools? Of course they would be. The Royal Party could not be saved, could not be rehabilitated.\n\nIt was time to kill the wounded beast completely, leaving only the barest whisper of an opposition, if only to preserve democracy.\n\nBut how would he do it?

She signed one, and picked up another, and so on. Being Prime Minister had its benefits, undoubtedly, but also its downsides. She grabbed a thick manila folder from the pile and saw that it had a large red 'SECRET' stamped on the front cover. She opened it.\n\n"Failures of the Loyalist government in the English Civil War," read the title. She continued on, skimming through the pages. Apparently, in the view of the general who had compiled the report, it was a miracle the loyalists won at all. They suffered from "a drastic lack of modern, quality equipment" and "great difficulty in procuring munitions". Thatcher couldn't believe what she was reading: most generals claimed that the loyalist army was well equipped and supplied, and that victory wasn't all that surprising.\n\n"In addition, when contrasted with the armed rebels, loyalist troops suffered from a massive lack of organization, cohesion, and morale. It is the opinion of this author that, if these issues are not rectified quickly, the English army will surely suffer from them in future conflicts."\n\nThatcher closed the report and breathed deeply. Picking up the phone, she dialed in the number for the Defence Secretary. He would answer for these claims."

Two weeks of preparations for this exercise had led to headache after headache in terms of practice, as well as convincing the locals that there would not be any property destruction. Why on Earth a place like Hull was chosen for the operation continued to elude him. Crouching beneath a tree to cover himself from non-existent weaponry, looking at the map provided of the area. A man somewhere he couldn't see shouted, "TIME!".\n\nThey had done better than previous trials, but still below the requirement. Walking back to the landing craft, he kept puzzling over the map and his surroundings. What was this place supposed to be a simulation of? Low, rolling hills; a broad, shallow estuary; large city nearby; and a bridge. He thought it over, reaching for an old map of Britain that he had in his bag.\n\nBeing very careful not to rip the tired old creases in the map, he unfolded it. He doubted very much that there were any plans for an excursion to the Continent, so a map of the British Isles would be just fine. The operation obviously wasn't meant to be in England, and much of Wales had more highland terrain than here, and there were no large estuaries there. His eyes moved up to Scotland. Glasgow had a river, but Edinburgh... the Firth of Forth must've been similar enough to the Humber, and the terrain would have been similar. He scratched his chin and hurriedly put the maps back into his bag. They might be handy where he'd be going, he thought."

However, per your request when you met with Defence Secretary Pym, new capital ships will also be laid down. There are two possible options, as the designs have already been available for years. As carriers have been ruled out as an option, only large, battleship-type vessels will be able to fill this role. We can either build a single, massive ship, armed with the largest guns in the world, and a length nearing a quarter of a mile; or we can build two, somewhat more modestly sized battlecruisers, comparable in size with the Kriegsmarine's old Bismarck-class ships in terms of size.\n\nWhile the larger ship would definitely provide a greater propaganda and prestige opportunity, as it would give us the single largest naval vessel in the world-- even larger than the Japanese Yamato-class-- it would probably be more practical to have the two smaller ships. They would be faster, and obviously could handle two situations simultaneously. Either way, the project will be expensive and take many months to complete."

With a carrying capacity of up to 80 aircraft, a length of more than a thousand feet, and a displacement of 95,000 tons, she was a sight to behold. The long flat runway cast an almost monolithic shadow that, with the low hanging morning sun in the distance, almost touched the shore.\n\nThere must have been a thousand people to admire the start of her first deployment. Propaganda film crews stood in the background, cameras in hand, capturing the moment for the rest of the world to see. David looked at the people in the crowd, waving their St. George's Crosses in patriotic fervor. He saw a child sitting on his father's back waving a Union Jack, as well.

David Scott, a local naval worker, watched with the thousands as two massive battlecruisers steamed out of His Majesty's Naval Base, Devonport. The HMS King Edward VIII, in front, and the identical HMS Wallis Simpson, farther from the onlooking crowds.\n\nAs camera crews and citizens alike scrambled to get a good view, one for propaganda, the other for pleasure, David simply admired the two ships. With 14-inch guns and a top speed of 35 noughts, it was deadly and fast-- something he had labored to ensure. As the morning sun still hung low in the distance, the ships cast shadows that almost touched the shore. The way their behemoth silhouettes pulled out of port made David feel almost like an ant watching a man go past.\n\nThe people calmed down slightly from their rabid cheering, simply content to watch in amazement as the two ships went out to sea. Still, the children happily waved their St. George's Crosses and their few Union Jacks. David looked back to the ships and wondered how long the old Jack might be gone."

With 12 18-inch guns, a displacement that had to have been 75,000 tons or more, and a total length of almost 1000 feet: the battleship was a sight to behold. It cast a long shadow as the morning sun still hung low on the horizon, leaving the cheering, patriotic masses in the dark of its ominous silhouette. Camera crews, filming what David presumed to be propaganda of some sort, tried their best to get decent light, to no avail.\n\nDavid had never seen the crowds so riled up before, or so big. It was an endless, noisy sea of humanity that simply kept cheering while waving their little St. George's Crosses, and a few Union Jacks. David turned back towards the ship and wondered how long the old Jack would be gone."

For, after all, their party, United England, had emerged victorious over the dirty fascists in the RP. An enormous burden was lifted from Macmillan's chest. He felt that he could breathe again, and see again. Everything was clear to him, in that hazy smoking room, as clear as the Courvoisier in his glass. Now he had the power to reshape England however he liked. And by Jove, he would do it.\n\nMacmillan watched Maudling slump into a leather chair and cozy up. The old boy was English at heart and English in nature, nobody could ever doubt that. But did he really have the stomach for what was going to come next? What Macmillan would have to do to prevent fascism from ever rising again wasn't going to be pleasant for everyone. He continued to stare at his erstwhile ally and took a brief sip."

He was wounded in that war three times serving in the Grenadier Guards, and was lucky not to be killed in it. While he was too old to fight in the Second World War, he fought from the bench, railing against appeasement and avoidance of the onflict that had to come eventually.\n\nWhen that conflict did come, Britain lost. After the invasion and the fall of London, Macmillan realized that the situation was impossible. And, patient as ever, he knew the time had come to cut England's losses and move forward. This meant untold humiliation for a nation not used to it, but that was better than what he had experienced in the Great War. One can live with humiliation. One cannot live whilst being bombed and shelled and shot and mined.\n\nSo he organized the surrender, with Monty and Mountbatten and the rest. This allowed him a strong position in the RP, being an official collaborator. He never liked that label, and came rather close to defecting entirely during the English Civil War. Yet again, the time was not right – or was it? This most careful of decisions turned into one of his greatest personal failings, as the horrors of the German Civil War stretched on without end. This was, indeed, the golden window for England to assert her independence once more.\n\nBut this is no time to cry over spilled milk. The party – nay, the country – needs a leader.

And so, due to Macmillan's power, no one was willing to get rid of him.\n\nInstead, the dreamer stuck around, obsessed with his ridiculous dream of restoring something that had already been lost. Or had it?\n\nFor when the English Civil War came, and the German Civil War along with it, there was a brief window for England to break away entirely, and become truly free again. And while Maudling sided with Macmillan again and stayed with the government, he still sees this window as wide open.\n\nNow, his task is to ensure that a free England, one with true democracy and rights for the people, is fully restored. While he is willing to pay any price for it, including another war with any German interventionists, he is not willing to compromise on that essential freedom for England. The only question is, can he convince the Chairman? For Macmillan has plans of his own, and they look very different from Maudling's fever dream."

To many, this was a burial of the old and welcoming of the new. A new government, a new king... a new nation?\n\nNow that King Edward IX was to be coronated as such, people were hopeful again that the promised national revitalization could be guided by someone who might take a more active role than previous monarchs in monitoring its progress and rallying the people towards the common good.

If he could just get rid of these loonies, what he might be able to do with a truly united Parliament...\n\nFor all the benefits of democracy, people like the Honourable Gentleman from Beaconsfield was one of many costs.

Montgomery gently prompted.\n\n"Yes, the food is... is..." said Macmillan, began after lazily snapping to attention and then trailed off with his disinterest at the topic. "Marshal, you have a reputation for planning. Overplanning some would say. What guides your plans since the rebels surrendered?"\n\nSo then, it seemed Bernard's dinner companion had largely called him here for consultation. It was a duty he'd have gladly performed without the misdirection.\n\n"Well, the civil war has changed the status quo significantly," he said, before eating another bite of steak and allowing himself to swallow.

Even so, Englishmen have found new things to squabble over, and now that compatriots have shed each other's blood in this generation, the gates are open, the taboo is lifted and it may happen again."\n\n"You plan for the next war?" asked Macmillan in surprise.\n\n"Always."\n\n"Good," replied the Prime Minister, smiling conspiratorially.

Have a big army to deter your enemies and give your allies what they want so that they stay your allies."\n\nMacmillan eyed his companion suspiciously as he boastfully sauntered through the forest.\n\n"And if I were to want you as my ally, Marshall, what would you say you wanted?"\n\nTempler dropped low onto one knee, pointing a careful finger to a flash of red fur.\n\n"You see, I'm rather easy to please, Prime Minister," he said in a low whisper as he snapped his rifle up to aim at their prey.

For a moment, an eternal moment, Maudling stared regretfully into Macmillan's eyes. With every fiber of his being, Macmillan tried to convey a pleading message through their locked gaze - a message for Maudling to not to do what the Prime Minister suspected was to come. Maudling's head shook just the barest amount.\n\n"Friends," he said, still glaring at the Prime Minister.

Even the Germans could not strip all those rights away if they wished to make an England that could be considered legitimate. Thus, England was left with a parliament, an election system, and a party to run things.

Any decree made by a prime minister must have proper legal basis and reasoning to take effect. Emergency periods shall have a strict time limit, and must be reapproved by parliament after the time period has passed. And emergency decrees can be overturned at any time by an act of parliament.

A new panel is rotated in every week, and a new location for the event is chosen as well, giving the listeners a variety of perspectives and topics.\n\nThe fifty minute show is an amazing hit. People tune in to hear the discussions and debates, unheard of for so long. Crowds are eager to attend the program and ask what they want. This leads to more interest in domestic affairs by the public. Democratic participation is also increased by this show as well. And the Prime Minister is almost certainly happy to have more programs with this type of response go on the air."

This new secondary school had been built in Newham, in Eastern London. The state of education in the country was very poor, he had to admit. And the civil war hadn't helped things along. Many schools didn't need new teachers and textbooks, they needed to be rebuilt entirely.\n\nIf every school was like this new one, thought Maudling, then England would have nothing to worry about. Everything was clean and modern, and the children were working with far more than he had when he was their age. There wouldn't be a problem getting things back on track, he knew. And once again England would lead the world in science, like Mac said it would.\n\n\"Would you like to see the art classes?\" asked the principal.\n\nThat brought Maudling back down to earth. \"Yes please,\" he said. \"What room is it?\""

Today, Macmillan was talking about the dangers of authoritarianism again, arguing that outside forces still seeked to turn things against the country. The government was not doing enough to change things, even with the progress that had been made.\n\nBut then, he laid out his policy proposal on the matter, and it was a huge shock. That every Englishman and Englishwoman be given the right to vote for parliament. No more would the House of Commons be a playground for the rich and well connected. The average person would have their say. This would, he claimed, make England safer by ensuring that PMs were answerable not to tiny cabals, but to every person in their district.\n\nReaction was swift. Liberals cheered the move, as how could a supposedly republican system exist without the participation of everyone in it? Others were not so keen on this. The old guard and the elite were angry that the influence of the upper classes were being taken away. Their base was the rich, for God's sakes!

We've been in the lead on industrial and scientific progress since James Watt and the steam engine. That we have no need to fear temporary difficulties if we just work together.\n\nBut then I realized, this 'we' is not a small group of the upper class that guided the masses from inception. It is the people of Britain, the ones who have done the work, who have done these accomplishments. And parliament does not represent these people. Instead it represents only a few well off, reactionary individuals.\n\nWhen parliament was only representative of the elite, England was a minor European power. When parliament was for every man and woman, Britain ruled the globe. If we are to reclaim any semblance of our former greatness, we must expand the vote to everyone. England shall give the people an equal vote, and a system free of corruption and fraud.\n\nThere are some who say the masses are not ready.

In the newsstands of London, one may find magazines and papers dealing with every topic imaginable, from music and sports, to news and gardening, to trade journals and monthly academic publications.\n\nAnd, I ask myself, is the regulation of all these papers really necessary? Is it worth the government's time to inspect every word of a company newsletter or a travel magazine for auto tourists in the midlands? And the people who publish these papers are constantly forced to comply with the absurd levels of censorship that may come from the government on this.\n\nI therefore propose an act that will limit and deprioritize these investigations.

It's the first stop-over in his tour of the most important military installations around England, and the situation is already painfully evident. The Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich, just a few miles from London, are home to one of the most prestigious corps of the Royal Army, but it seems that two decades of neglect and a civil war can break even the toughest spirits and the proudest military traditions...\n\nThe elegant neoclassical façade is still filled with bullet holes from when several collaborator loyalists had barricaded themselves inside, forcing the partisans to dig a hole in the ground and collapse part of the western wall to break in. The debris still clogs the road. Inside, the signs of the fighting that took place there are even more visible, with broken doors and windows, grenade impacts and even a few bloodstains here and there.\n\nThe Royal Artillery themselves must examine the state of their barracks. Most men have tired expressions, and there are holes in their line. The guns are old and rusty, mostly German leftovers. He swears he can recognize a couple BL 7.2 inches from the last war, the Union Jack hastily scratched out in favor of Saint George's cross.

The umpteenth meeting on the matter is to be held in the restored House of the Admiralty. The building shines just like the old days, and it would be so easy to forget that everything must be rebuilt from scratch...\n\nDespite the participation of the Prime Minister himself, the meeting soon degenerates into a battle between two sides. On one side are the younger officers, mostly returned exiles from Canada who have studied with the Americans: they strongly advocate for a "modern" fleet, based on carriers rather than battleships. While a sound proposal, this would mean abandoning the image of the Royal Navy as it has been for centuries, and some would see it as a sign of subservience to the Americans.\n\nThe other faction, counting among them several old admirals who have just been reinstated, proposes a completely different doctrine. The Royal Navy - they say - is more than just a fleet: it is the symbol of British greatness, one that is far from past, and that must return! Also, they claim that the people will surely appreciate a show of strength...\n\nThe meeting is dismissed without any serious progress being made, but Jellicoe knows there is no more time to be lost.

Instead of having Philby removed, the government could try to pacify him. All future investigations into his influence would be halted, with immediate effect. There would be none of the public downsides of ousting him, but he would remain an issue, leaving the possibility of communist takeover disturbingly high.\n\nThe Prime Minister had to make a decision.

Nelson returned here from Trafalgar, and Wellington sailed from its docks to face Napoleon, but in more recent times it had been the stage from some of the greatest humiliations in the long history of the Empire: the return of the fugitives from Dunkirk, the heavy German bombings, and - as a last insult - the "triumphal" return of King Edward VIII after the final surrender of the Commonwealth. Today's ceremony is a happy one, however, hopefully the first of many to come.\n\nIn the presence of the Queen herself, the entire government and a crowd of more than fifty thousands have come to see the launch of the new flagship of the Royal Navy, the HMS Jellicoe. Named after the Prime Minister's father, the admiral who led the Grand Fleet against the German Hochseeflotte at the Battle of Jutland, the HMS Jellicoe is a sight to behold: with a length overall of 256 meters, she is longer than the Bismarck - a point of honor for the shipbuilders - and just shy of equalling the Yamato. Thanks to 15 inches of steel armor, and an armament of three triple 40 cm guns, eight double 15 cm guns, dozens of smaller emplacements for both anti-aircraft and anti-ship duty, anti-ship missile launchers and anti-submarine mortars, this battleship excels both in offense and defense.\n\nAll the cameras record the moment when the Queen, exceptional sponsor of the ship, perfectly aims the bottle and delivers a flawless inauguration, to deafening applause. When the Prime Minister takes the podium for the final speech, he's almost in tears from joy: his words are few and cracked by emotion, but everyone catches the final phrase, and cheers even louder."

News reports of the recently liberated England showed a nation in ruins, the crumbling of an empire with rampant poverty and social problems. But now that he was here, he could see that was not true.

Our brave Tommies guarded the Isles for hundreds of years, and now that England is at peace, we can afford to restore a great tradition of a small and professional army. This would be very popular and increase our political standing.\n\nWe can also keep conscription just as it is. The civil war decimated many of our units, and we will need to keep our men up to snuff (including reserves) to make sure that any German intervention can be parried. Also, we can begin to reassert ourselves over the Isles from a stronger position. Since this is currently the status quo, it is also unlikely to do damage to our standing amongst the populace.\n\nThe third option is increasing conscription. This would make our army's position stronger, but might have serious consequences for us politically. It would allow the hardliners an edge and give them something to promise defecting members from our faction. Furthermore, the populace would probably be furious that, as peace is declared, we increase conscription.\n\nShould we remake our volunteer army, keep conscription the same, or increase conscription?"

In an emergency, the Germans could move a large number of troops into Plymouth, and we would be dealing with an army group on English soil when the war begins.

Most are stuck on policing duty around the area anyway.\n\nThe only danger is in a protracted war that lasts long enough for them to get aid and support from Europe. This will be a strong possibility if we go through the land border region. While simple to pull off, this has been where they expected our forces to come through for quite a while. They will certainly have defenses in place, quite possibly enough to slow us down until Germany can intervene.\n\nOur strategy, then, is not to fight them head to head, but to pull off a flanking maneuver from the sea. There is plenty of coastline where an amphibious detachment could come in and cut the garrison off from reinforcements and resupply.

Two methods have been proposed, both rely on the opening of England's markets to bring foreign money increasing the volume of the country's exports.\nThe first harkens back to the days of the industrialised England of the nineteenth century, of course the same exploitative practices of unchecked capitalism will be avoided. Instead the government will help build factories and protect the workers, thus taking many workers out of employment. The profits will be reinvested by the government on behalf of the workers, ensuring a fair exchange for their labor.\nThe second involves the exploitation of England's natural resources, from coal to steel. Both these industries will be nationalised and maintained by the government to ensure maximum efficiency and rights of the miners and workers.\nEither way, England's economy will become more reliant on foreign consumers from the Organization of Free Nations, but the people would rather we were dependent on them than the Germans."

And any of the minor decisions were made by people under him who hated his guts. And there was a bit of hesitation within the NDL to execute a close family member of the Queen, anyway.

But still, there was a massive debate about it. Exile was something out of the 1700s. Stripping his titles was too lenient.

And everyone not in the crowd outside was gathered around a television set for the duration of the ceremony. Everyone could see the coronation, and everyone could be a part of it.\n\nNot to say this had dampened attendance along the procession route. Everyone wanted to see the new Queen in person, riding with her husband in a gilded carriage, with her newly incorporated royal guards in front and behind her. And the reception was mostly positive. The SLP had elements who were going to protest the ceremony, but they had been drowned out by the cheers of the onlookers and the martial music. No disruptions on the route happened, which was Jellicoe's main concern.\n\nThe ceremony began with the Queen entering Westminster Abbey to a choir singing "I Was Glad." Once she had seated herself on the chair of Estate, the religious paraphernalia and the coronation garments were brought in. Then came the first, necessary step. The Queen stood next to King Edward's Chair. "Sirs," said the Archbishop of Canterbury, \"I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?"\n\n"God save Queen Elizabeth!" affirmed the crowd. Throughout the rest of the ceremony, filled with oaths and traditions, he was never bored or found himself wishing for a quick end. For everything that HMMLR had worked for, everything that so many men had died to do, and every sacrifice made by the people of England, it was for this. The true heir had returned, and the world knew that prewar England had returned.

A million here, a million there, pretty soon it all added up to real money.\n\nJellicoe put the file in his safe, along with other items of utmost importance and secrecy.

There were many who had given their lives for such a dream, and many who believed it would never come to fruition.\n\nBut if those who had died at the hands of the collaborators could look down from heaven, they would scarcely be able to believe how their dreams had come true.

"You met him yourself, if I recall correctly."\n\n"Yes, he was working as a Pakt diplomat at the time, 1958 if I recall correctly. We believed he was a bit arrogant, like most of the people in the English government.

After being discharged from service, some officers just went to their homes. However, others had committed more severe crimes against the nation. Now they will be forced to reconstruct the country they helped to destroy. As the inmates entered the camps, the guards assigned a task to each one of them. Field Marshal Templer chuckled a bit as he resignedly complied. After all, following orders is what a soldier does best."

FEN_reconstruction.19.t:0 "The Trial of Harold MacMillan"
FEN_reconstruction.19.desc:0 "Macmillan was always going to be a controversial case. For many years, he headed up the Reformist faction in the Royal Party, and had at least somewhat pushed for partial reform. But when the war came, he ended up in the cabinet of Douglas-Home, and anyone in the cabinet ended up at Oxford. Even if they were primarily dealing with His Majesty's Treasury.\n\nThings took a strange turn, as at the opening of the trial, Macmillan stood up and read a prepared statement. In it, he told the jury that he had joined the collaborators out of a desire to stop the suffering of English citizens back in the war, and that he attempted to subvert the will of the Germans at every turn he could. His goal had been to see a return to English democracy. However, he had decided to remain in the Royal Party during the war out of a fear the rebellion would be unsuccessful and because of a fear that the garrison at Cornwall would put an end to organized resistance along with Germany. It was only after the war had ended, with a free government restored, the garrison crushed, and Germany still in chaos did he realize the enormity of his mistake. He accepted responsibility for his actions, and apologized.\n\nThis threw the trial into a tailspin. The defense argued that Macmillan was sincere about his regret for an enormous mistake done with the best of intentions. The prosecution argued it was not enough and merely a last-ditch attempt to save his life. The jury was divided as well. The NDL-oriented ones argued that he should be exiled, while the Stirlingites wanted him dead for his actions. The leftists were more merciful, however. They wished to see him experience a new England taking shape first-handedly. Removed from any of its politics, of course."

Harold Macmillan stopped for a few moments just to contemplate his surroundings. He couldn't fool himself: he was just trying to delay the inevitable. Like the leaves helplessly carried by the wind in that cloudy English morning, Macmillan thought of himself as a victim of the inevitable course of history. Leaving his home wasn't an easy thing to do, but there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nEven with the sound of the airplane turbine, Macmillan was still caught in his thoughts. Could the rebels even succeed with the German threat still present? Would he have done better if he had been there? It was a futile exercise. His intentions were maybe good, but he was at the wrong time to put them into practice. And the wrong place. Before climbing the stairs, he made a respectful bow to say goodbye to the land that saw him grow. Wishing that England could once again be a free nation, Macmillan closed his eyes and settled into his seat."

Just stunned silence as the condemned was read his last rites and the noose was put around his neck.\n\nSurely there was some mistake. Surely Stirling's influence was not that great, and surely the government not so dictatorial and unflinching that they would hang a decent man?\n\n"Do you have any last words?" Even the executioner was flat in his delivery. Something was terribly off.\n\nMacmillan looked over those responsible. These heartless despots who pulled the strings and made the choices.

On the other hand, his new business (well, technically his old job) offered better opportunities to succeed.\n\nNot only in monetary terms but also to save his good name. Thanks to the resources of his editorial house, he would publish his memoirs, telling his version of the events. The ambitious autobiography aimed to emphasize his role as the reformist that wanted to save the rotting government, debunking the smears from mediocre politicians. When this information reaches the public, they won't be able to label him as a fascist stooge anymore.\n\nMacmillan admired once again the portrait of his ancestor Daniel hanged in the wall. The life accomplishments from him and his descents weren't going to be undone by the bitter rebel disdain for their rivals. Publishing books all over England has been the family tradition for generations, and he is going to make sure to respect that sacred legacy!"

Many people thought he would be a sure defector to HMMLR, and were dismayed that he did not. Now, he was hauled in front of Oxford to answer for this betrayal.\n\nHe entered a plea of "not guilty." That was the only normal thing about his trial. It turns out there was scant evidence that he did anything really wrong, or what was already committed by thousands of other collaborators who were walking the streets free at this moment. The prosecution argued he was responsible for at least some of the decisions made by the government, while his defense painted the trial as a political vendetta against a man with a decent history of anti-authoritarian actions.\n\nThis led to a hung jury again. Claude's supporters thought he shouldn't be given anything more than a slap on the wrist. Bill's supporters still wanted him banned from the political scene. And David's supporters were initially wanting him dead too, but eventually lowered their proposal to exile once the rest of the jury deemed it ludicrous."

After leaving the box on the floor, Maudling opened the cupboard that still had his old drinking set intact, with a filled whiskey bottle no less! Pouring a glass in celebration, he reclined on his chair and rested his legs on the desk.\n\nThe politician was annoyed that he had no ice to put in his glass: it would help him better digest the huge tasks ahead of him. Making new connections to make his way back to the top was going to be a chore, but it was a better alternative than falling into irrelevance. Besides, the rest of his partners got the shortest end of the stick, so he couldn't complain.\n\nHowever, the new administration was still out for blood, and putting the traitors in their place was high on their list of priorities. Maudling looked at his reflection, sighing. Maybe defecting to the HMMLR would have been a better idea. But he decided to toss those problematic thoughts aside and enjoy having a new chance at political success."

But why in the first place? Why were they sending him away at all?\n\nThe answer was clear. He had a chance to stick with the people who had his ideas. To join them in the fight for freedom. Something he had wanted for a long time. And yet, he didn't. Was it that bitterness over his actions that led to him being expelled from the country? A fate reserved for senior ministers in the collaborationists?\n\nFrom what he heard, it was just retaliation, pure and simple. The NDL wanted him off. The SLP wanted him out of any public office. It was the hardliners who wanted him out. And if they were making the decisions around here, well...\n\nAs the lights of his country disappeared over the horizon, he felt sadness.

He felt like he didn't do anything particularly wrong, but the rebels disliked him for some reason. The disgraced politician liked to think that it was because he could be a future threat to their new order. Despite all their talks about "freedom" and "democracy", the HMMLR was no different than them with it came to running the show.\n\nDistracted for a moment in his frustrated political aspirations, Maudling noticed that some of the numbers didn't add up: it looked like someone was withholding money that wasn't theirs. "Whatever," Maudling thought to himself, passing the page. He would figure out later who it was and maybe teach the poor bastard how to embezzle their money better.

From this point onwards, we can say with certainty that Europe has found itself a safer place, as OFN ships once more sail into the Atlantic Ocean, and American troops begin to garrison the isles.\n\nWe cannot expect the reception to the OFN moving into England to be a wholly positive one, of course. While there has been a considerable amount of celebrations occurring across the nation, not all of those taking to the streets have been celebrating. Disparate protests have broken out across England, expressing anger at the Prime Minister's government for mismanaging the Battle for the Atlantic.\n\nUnfortunately, England's own incompetencies must be dealt with by themselves.

While it can be inferred that those across the isles and OFN are upset by this change of events, it takes no expert to see the reaction of the Pakt.

While the usual crowd had filed into the office on their own accord as the day progressed and rumors spread, things certainly hit a turning point once Johnson had announced to his closest allies on the hill that Thatcher had seemingly lost it. She may very well have been offering the OFN a firm position on all of the isles. So much it seemed, anyway, why else would president Johnson be getting an invitation to this "Dover conference"? The Oval Office had been alight with conversation and debate all morning, and there was nobody quite in the thick of it like President Johnson. \n\n"What I'm saying, Will, is that we lost our chance in '63, and this is going to be our last chance for the isles." Johnson felt himself beginning to break into a sweat. "And I am not letting them go, not again." Spending the day arguing over how much an investment in Thatcher could pay back was one of the most frustrating things he'd ever done, but even the thought of what the return could be was breathtaking for those that had bothered to listen to him for half a second. \n\n"What would we even have to gain from this? This is Thatcher we're talking about here, not De Graaff, she wouldn't exactly be meeting our expectations as we'd need of her, let alone what we'd want of her if you even did manage to bring her in, you and I both know that!" \n\nThe end of these arguments didn't exactly seem to be in sight. "It's well damned better than letting the Nazis take herm! If we do nothing, we've done worse than lose, we've sat around and let them win!" Johnson took the moment to breathe.

If nobody else, Thatcher had to be the most slippery of all those that Robert had needed to deal with, in terms of foreign policy and moral fiber. Even still, the notion of establishing the borders of the Cold War -and with England within the OFN- was an opportunity that no competent president could deny. \n\n"Mr. President, do you plan on bringing those who executed or imprisoned anti-German resistance into the OFN?" The press hadn't lightened up on Bobby just for being put in a good position with the English- even if this was an anomaly with a clear cause. Whether Thatcher had simply been trying to lure Bobby into dropping more funds into England or not, there were more than a few ways to spin bringing in a collection of probable war criminals. There weren't any second chances that would let you bring back what you'd fought for so many times before. Unless you were a Kennedy. \n\n"Yes, I am aware that the government of England has hosted the presence of some particularly sketchy characters in its government, and I do know that those individuals have been forced out of relevancy as of Thatcher's inauguration in 1964. The fascists are long gone, and it is my intention to keep them out." Of course, Robby was still on the fence as to what to do with England.

Now, it was none other than Margaret Thatcher inviting him to England to talk over how much aid she could suck from the OFN. \n\nSitting in the Oval Office, it was hard not to feel like a beaten dog for LeMay. Of course, he had always acted like one, too. He wouldn't stop. He wouldn't give up, and he would be damned if he gave the isles back to the Germans on a silver platter. Nobody got a reprieve from the big man in the sky for just any reason, and it certainly seemed like destiny that America was being set an opportunity on its lap, yet again. \n\nIn the mountains of Scotland, ages ago, when Kennedy and Truman had their turns limp-wristing their way through the greatest war mankind had ever known.

As it was too early to start drinking by his own standards, Führer Bormann decided to look at the former pile first. Flipping through the collection of envelopes, there were the usual. For the most part, there were personal letters, hopefully, a notification of retirement, though probably a request for a favor. There were the interesting letters, of course, the missions from a few nations here and there, looking for help or closer relations. Among them was the most interesting nation to reach out to Germany. This, however, had come straight from London. \n\n"...which we are undoubtedly grateful for. As this conference is for nothing else but to clarify the position of England within the Cold War, we are open to changes in our foreign policy if the circumstances permit it, such as from contributions from one power or another, yourself included. We expect to see..." Bormann had taken a moment to process what he'd just skimmed through. From what he could tell, the English were about to destabilize the foreign policy they'd spent the last years building up. The Führer smiled."

"Tell me, Schmidt, what would England want to do with Germany?" Speer nearly spat his words out, and his blunt tone only further unsettled Schmidt. \n\n"W-Well, nothing, sir. Thatcher's isolationism hasn't been given any real exceptions excluding the occasional trade deal with ourselves or the Americans." The Führer let out a sigh and handed the letter sitting on his desk to his foreign minister. Schmidt snatched it and gave it a read-through. \n\n"They've got to be joking." Schmidt reread the letter. "This can't be real, can it?" \n\nSpeer let out a sigh. "I've had the letter checked. I've contacted London. Thatcher seems to honestly want this to come about." Schmidt stifled a groan. \n\n"You've read this over, sir, do you think we can spare the resources to bring Thatcher into the Pakt, let alone keep her away from the Americans?" Speer looked up from his papers and stared at Schmidt. The room grew quiet save for the clock on the wall, providing a timer for just how long Schmidt stood in the brown-hued office. \n\n"Schmidt... I have spent the last hour... pondering this little problem with Thatcher. This is our path into the North Atlantic, and that's to say nothing of the value inherent in bringing Thatcher on our side. Similarly, I have given your position on this matter plenty of thought. I have given your past actions some thought, and I admit I'm uncertain as to whether or not you should be the one to go to Dover. I'm still thinking about it." \n\nSchmidt stood in the office, holding the letter, not entirely sure what to make of Speer insulting him to his face."

Walking out into the salty rain staining the air around him, Johnson smiled widely and waved to the crowds which cheered as he began to step down the stairs towards England. Just across the steps to the tarmac, Johnson made out a podium with the flag of England on either side. Standing alongside either side of the flags seemed to be a collection of party bureaucrats and Cabinet members to Thatcher. As the crowds surrounding President Johnson continued to cheer as he waved towards the sparse cameras hidden within the crowds surrounding him. Shaking the hands of the English politicians and taking his place behind the podium, President Johnson found himself with a perfect view of the crowds, as well as the stars of cameras flashing. Reaching into his pocket, Johnson pulled out a scrap of paper and leaned towards the microphone so graciously provided by his hosts. \n\n"Ladies and gentlemen of England... it is rare that history is allowed to be subdued, that the actions of the past are reversed, and a second chance is given to the people of God's green earth. Today, I stand here with nothing but hope; a hope our great nations can reconcile, a hope that England and America can return to form, even as it has faced insurmountable odds and trials meant for nothing but to further harden the English spirit, from the fiery hours of Operation Sealion to the heartbreaking conflict of your Civil War, England has been set alight and survived not through the mercy of others, but the strength and tenacity of its inhabitants. I hope that you, England, will take America's hand, and march into tomorrow, side by side with us." At that, the crowd broke into polite -if still enthusiastic- applause. At the sight of the crowds, it was hard for President Johnson not to feel confident of his odds in the conference.

The air was muggy, as though he had been stuck in a steam room and been let out into the streets of England, and the questions of the press had only hammered home the notion that he wasn't in the states' anymore.

The euphoria of the victory of the Great War, the horrors of what the war had brought for the few that fought therein, and the highs of the colonial empire. India, Africa, Malaysia, Canada, Australasia, all of them under the colonial reigns of the British. Then, the rise of Hitler. The warmongering, the head-in-the-sand management, and the absolute state of the foreign policy. The fall of France, the pullout from Africa, the navy's entrapment in the Mediterranean. The first jackboots to hit the beaches. The hills. The streets. All the way to the highlands. The fighting, the Welsh hitting the road when they had their chance. The Scots getting away at the end of it all, the fighting in the mountains. \n\nAir Force one came to a complete stop on the tarmac of Heathrow airport.

Stepping out on the platform in front of the applauding crowds on the steps to the city hall of Dover, President LeMay put on his smile as he waved to the crowds, and walked up to the podium with Margaret Thatcher behind it. Shaking hands with her, LeMay looked to the flashing lights of the reporters in the crowd and cleared his throat. \n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you all for the hospitality which I have been subjected to since I first arrived in England, and I would also like to voice my admiration for the lot of you surviving in this damned weather." The crowd chuckled. The weather hadn't actually been that bad since LeMay first arrived, the current grey of the sky notwithstanding, but he'd heard that joking about the weather was a safe bet to get the crowd on his side. \n\n"Now, as many of you know, myself and Thatcher have spoken plenty on exactly where England finds itself given its neutrality and the state of the Cold War.

They had successfully transformed from a wartorn hellhole that hardly resembled an insulting shadow of its former self to only a shell of what it once was. It was a start, certainly, though it wasn't much of a position to move off from. Furthermore, it would be nigh impossible to return to what it once was. Having observed the island for some time, as well as his frequent conversations with Thatcher, Thurmond could tell that the island would become nothing without an American in office lending a hand, and he would be damned if he wasn't the one to do it. \n\n"Two minutes to touch-down, two minutes to Heathrow." The voice on the intercom clicked off, as the plane began to come into view of a legitimately urban set of buildings. \n\nLooking out at the crowd assembled outside of Air Force One, Thurmond found himself a tad confused. It wasn't a crowd, so much as an assembled group of government officials, a handful of officers looking over the more civilian crowd, and the civilian crowd which seemed relatively sparse, even with the rain most likely driving away the majority of those who would have come otherwise. Stepping down the staircase towards the assembled party bureaucrats of Thatcher's Cabinet standing along either side of the podium, the cheers of the crowd seemed fierce when paired with the staccato of the rain, if not as plentiful as Thurmond had hoped to hear.

This has led Wimberley himself to reappear in the public eye to release a new autobiography that he hopes will cause the \"misconceptions\" of his time as Chief of Staff of the Scottish military to be cleared up.\n\n\"Scottish Soldier,\" Wimberley's book, is the culmination of work that the Field Marshal started some time before his retirement and the reunification. It is a complete recounting of his military service, with special emphasis given to his time in the First and Second World Wars, and the formation of the Scottish Republic. Wimberly argues the republic was a necessary action to defend Scotland, and was not merely a case of opportunism. He also defends some of the more controversial actions the Scottish Armed Forces took under his tenure, declaring those actions kept Scotland free, and made the liberation of and eventual unification with England possible.\n\nDespite massive sales in the north and midlands, the book has come in for a fair share of controversy. Some unionists and leftists accused Wimberley of being a malignant spirit in Scotland, and one that potentially jeopardized both Scottish freedom and union with England. Others have claimed the book is evidence that Wimberley was merely being misunderstood this entire time, pointing to his support of HMMLR and loyal service in the war as proof. Wimberley himself has not commented on the matter. He has, however, donated a collection of personal papers to the National Records of Scotland, hoping they and the book will be of aid to future researchers of the Scottish Republic."

Miles of open snow, vast mountains, and prime skiing routes. And the best part, he thought as he prepared to go down the path, it was now all British.\n\nGod, he thought as he accelerated down the mountain, he missed this! Skiing opportunities were few and far between after the war. The Alps were either fascist or cut off by them. There were a few hills in the United States that diplomats like him went on to talk with the American politicians. But there just wasn't a good hill for people in England to enjoy like this. And now, there was, with Scotland firmly united with England once more.\n\nWhatever the costs of union, they were worth it, he thought as he reached the bottom. The boys at the Ski Club loved it too. They were one of the first of his friends he called, promising a grand get-together at this resort in the highlands. And they came. Even some of the newer members from the reintegrated Scottish chapter. After so long, they were extremely happy to have mountains that could be accessible to every Englishman and woman.\n\nAnd Jellicoe was happy that one of his favorite sports was now readily available."

And they didn't know what to expect when they landed there. Long ago, they decided Sweden wasn't safe because of its friendly ties with Germany. So they crossed the country to get on another ship. One which took them to another country, one that for sure wouldn't betray them to Germany. And thus they knew the worst was over when the smugglers dropped them off in Norwich.\n\nEventually the Kulesas ended up with many other Lithuanian immigrants in the neighborhood of Becktown. There, life was tough. Crime was rampant, poverty widespread, and oftentimes it felt they were not wanted by the public. Little Joakimas was harassed by his peers at school for his limited understanding of English. Edvardas had trouble finding steady work for the longest time. And the neighborhood had quite a fright when some youths painted a swastika on the side of the Kulesa's apartment building. Sometimes, they considered moving to somewhere else. Scotland, New York, or even Vancouver. But in the end, they stuck it out.\n\nNow things are looking up. Edvardas found a job as a chef for a local restaurant, cooking up cepelinai for hungry Londoners. The kids are doing well in school. And it seems like the Kulesa family has finally put the violence and starvation of their homeland behind them forever, basking in the peace and prosperity of Free England instead."

With the Civil War tearing apart our land, an interesting contradiction emerged, that of an inability to focus on anything except the ground in front of you... and a desire to be anywhere except the ground in front of you. From that tension first emerged David Bowie.\n\nThe Londoner's self-titled second album has already sent waves throughout the youth of our nation. In particular, the cosmic dreaming featured on the track Space Oddity has captured the desire of millions to reclaim some part of our universe as a place of serenity, of neutrality. With the album lauded worldwide for its peaceful and optimistic tone, paired to progressive guitar riffs and soft-spoken vocals, Bowie's name has already become a mainstay in the international community of hippies and anyone who enjoys taking acid trips."

Now that we have won, those who stood by us to bring light to England prove again and again that we are the side of hope. The young Elton John has lit up the music clubs of England for his rollicking performances replete with gaudy costumes and gravity-defying stage tricks. His headlining hit, Rocket Man, tells the story of an average man ascending to the stars. In the ballad told by Elton, this astronaut laments society's lack of regard for his deeds, the wondrous cosmos of his youth now dismissed as the domain of fascists. As he leaves his family to the harsh realities on the ground, he attempts to place himself amongst the broader universe.

In the misty, cracked roadway in the town's south, she'd enter Everett's Book Shop, the quaint building made of dark oak marked only by its bright green name painted above the entrance. Time to look for another volume to spend her nights with, once the kids were fed and tucked in.\n\nAfter the brief greeting and chatting with old Everett, Irena went over to the world literature section. She perused the shelves like a skilled detective, an eye for any title from her native Poland, knowing that anything she found would likely be at least thirty years old. As she ran her fingers through each section of the towering shelf, she fully expected to come up empty handed...until reaching a toppled over collection on the very bottom level. All in nondescript red binding, within these titles were hundreds of pages written in Polish, some so old that she could hardly comprehend half of what was being said. Tales of medieval rebels, supernatural battles, and the daily struggles of family life: all memories of a land she could hardly envision since first arriving on England's shores ten years ago. In an instant, piled up the books and pressed them up against her chest, moving carefully over to Everett, calculating in her head to see if she could even afford such a collection with her meager wages.\n\n"Find everything you need?" Everett said in a nasally yet ever-amicable tone. Irena replied that yes, she found exactly what she needed, but was about 15 pounds short. "No worries, love. This looks about as important to your family as a nightly ration package. It's yours, free of charge." With a smile and a statement of absolutely bewildered appreciation, Irena helped Everett fill up a large brown bag, then quickly made her way out of the shop and towards the bus stop."

When they were hiding in grimy bunkers and running from house to house, most of them were ardent in their beliefs that once in power all reactionary opposition should be destroyed. If it could be the Collaborationists, it could beat opponents of revolution. When Wilson took over the SLP, they of course viewed him as a counter-revolutionary, a liberal in red clothing. But his steadfast backing by their hero Bill Alexander, and the host of popular reforms already passed despite so-called bourgeois elements still prevailing, these vigorous men thought it was perhaps time to consider Lenin's ruthless pragmatism.\n\nAs the sun broke over the Thames, the five suited party members prepared their makeshift stage near the house of commons, ready to give a speech billed as "an urgent intervention among comrades." When the most hardcore of supporters showed up to watch the speech, Bill Alexander sitting comfortably in the front row, they expected the announcement of some new revolutionary campaign, some way to carry the torch of the Communist Party. None of them anticipated what was actually said.\n\n"Comrades," began the oldest of the five, a balding yet slim man with a serious case of vocal fry. "We are all ardent disciples of Comrade Alexander, we all risked our lives to bring socialism to Britain.

After much discussion, based on present material conditions, we see this analysis as incorrect."\n\nCheers quickly turned to shock, a few jeers piercing the air, then quieting down as the men took turns calmly outlining their position. Bill Alexander always believed in bringing moderates to our side, they said, and we cannot win support by simply establishing a new dictatorship. Revolution is not being deflected, they said, but rather adapting to contemporary Britain and the needs of its working class. Already, came the declaration, vastly successful reforms have begun to be implemented which promise great gains for all. Finally: "We are revolutionaries through and through. We will die with that vigor. That is why we ask all of you to support the government of Harold Wilson, as Comrade Alexander has done since day one.""

We're pinned down and they're advancing on the south door sharpish."\n\n"Good lord, corporal, you should get yourself checked out."\n\n"Afraid the medic is quite busy, sir. What are we going to do, sir?"\n\nThe lieutenant sighed. "The only thing we can do, corporal. I'm afraid there's nothing for it. Check for a bedsheet in one of the rooms. A towel, otherwise."\n\nThe little corporal hesitated for a moment. "Y-yes, sir. Right away, sir."\n\nMinutes later, the gunfire had stopped thudding into the siding, and the remaining 10 men of 2nd Platoon that were uninjured were sitting on the lawn, prisoners of the bloody Collabs. It was there that Lieutenant Dreyer noticed a Collab weeping over one of his compatriots. The man's best childhood friend, perhaps? An old pal from university? A brother? He sighed. One day, this awful war will be over, and there will be no more fields full of bodies. He was proud of the job that his lads had done, but it was rather sickening to see their work up close. The Collab assault had taken what looked to be 200 casualties, by his estimate.\n\nThe lieutenant watched the crying man get up, tears streaming down his face. He watched as he drew a pistol. He watched the flash as he fired. He heard a sickening crunch to his left. He sat, in shock, as more pops, bangs, and rattles went off all around him. Finally, he felt all the wind knocked out of him and he slumped to the ground. The corporal's glassy eyes stared into his, as the whole world went dark."

Houses were stormed with grenades and elderly sub-machine guns, with rockets being used against more stubborn positions. The little town of Myerscough was theirs in an hour. But they were not there to take the town. Stirling's boys were out for bodies, plain and simple.\n\nAll the prisoners – walking, wounded, half-dead – were pushed and prodded towards an open field or into single rooms. On a colonel's whistle, the shooting started. A few seconds later, "This is for Drummersdale, Kraut bastards!" A grenade was lobbed into the prisoner's room. The scene was unspeakable. It got worse when a few of the men came in to clean up the rest.\n\nA few hours later, nothing moved in the whole of the town. Stirling's men were gone. They didn't intend to hold the town – in fact, they meant for the Government to take it back. This was a message and an escalation for the sins of Drummersdale."

It was only sensible, as one would hope that the people responsible for drafting laws and potentially advising the monarch would have their best interests in mind and would not be associating with any devious foreign rulers. When Parliament opened again under the auspices of Her Majesty, it was widely accepted that the oath would be administered to the new parliamentarians without complaint.\n\nHowever, a few hardliners in the Socialist Labour Party objected to this. Why would they declare their loyalty to some unelected monarch when their true allegiance is to the proletariat of England who elected them and gave them their positions? This sparked a massive controversy, as many of the privileges of an MP, such as the salary, debate privileges, and the ability to actually vote on things, were dependent on the person taking the oath.\n\nImmediately, the Patriots pounced, with Powell calling for the immediate expulsion of the communists. This further enraged the hardliners, and spirited debate soon followed. However, Jellicoe did not wish to be responsible for throwing out several elected members of parliament, and Stevas also advised against it. Harold Wilson wasn't willing to give up a segment of what support he had, and even Birch could see the potential problem of a portion of his caucus being tossed.\n\nAfter much negotiation between the parties, a workaround was found. While the hardliners would be required to take the oath declaring their faithfulness, they would be allowed to omit the \"bear true allegiance\" segment, so they could affirm they would follow the Queen's laws without committing what they deemed as a betrayal of their constituents.

If Germany was able to get their submarines through it, it would give them a tremendous opportunity to attack OFN shipping in the mid-Atlantic, and station nuclear-armed submarines off the eastern seaboard. Thus, when the American SOSUS sonar detected a German Type 401 off the Faroe islands, the forces of the free world began their typical, yet necessary hunt.\n\nFirst, aircraft from all of the OFN immediately raced to find the intruder. Despite the large numbers searching for the submarine, it was a helicopter from England guarding a frigate that first reported they had picked something up on the sonar system. Their microphone they had suspended from a cable had heard the unmistakable sound of U-boat propellers. A few hours later, a Sonobuoy dropped from an American P-3 Orion confirmed the discovery.\n\nIf this had been an actual combat situation, the U-boat would be blown up by a torpedo as soon as the helicopter had contact. But this was not, and the OFN had a better idea for what to do with the intruder. A Canadian sub was given their new instructions. They were to divert from their patrol and instead lie low with their engines off, and completely silent. The crew could no longer use the cooking equipment either, having to temporarily subsist on a diet of cold cheese sandwiches.\n\nFinally, the sonar operator picked up the U-boat. The Canadian submarine soon had a clear picture of the enemy. And as it traveled overhead with no hesitation or change in course, the Canadian crew could smile. They now had found and begun to track a Nazi submarine with no detection by the opposing side. If a war would break out, the OFN had this incredible advantage.

Dozens of news crews from across the globe gathered to witness the event as well, as many government officials of the new OFN-aligned English government came to greet the President, and thank him for "never giving up hope for the nation of the British." This has been the EBC Nightly News Show, wishing you a bright light for the day of tomorrow."

He would need to be quick and lucky if he was to bring a story back to the Times.\n\nLuck happened to be on his side, when he spotted an encampment of Resistance soldiers milling about, on patrol. They raised their weapons, but seeing his camera, happily invited him to talk. Three of them on patrol, of three different ideologies. A lithe man with an upper-class accent introduced himself as William, and proudly announced that he was fighting for the Queen's return. A giant of a man, Jack, followed with a gruff pronouncement of his Socialist ideals. The last one, Henry, barely Sixteen, paraded ideals of liberty, ideals of which he had never truly experienced. Despite their different views, all three of the men laughed heartily with each other, brothers in the Resistance. This would be a winning story, Eddie knew; the common bond of anti-fascism breaking creating an unlikely friendship. As they all posed for the picture, Jack embracing the other two, smiles gleaming on the faces of all three, Eddie snapped the shot...\n\nNot a moment after, a deafening crack echoed across the field, and Eddie was thrown backwards. Bleeding, Eddie looked for his camera, and found that it was miraculously unbroken. Looking towards the subjects of his last photograph, though, he found that they were anything but. Eddie knew that, if he ever got his pictures developed, it would show the last moments of three men. On the ground, near the bodies, Eddie waited an eternity for the battle to end. It seemed that the Government forces had won, and a group of mean-faced soldiers approached him. Eddie knew that this was the end, that he would be killed, here and now. That is, until they asked him if he could take their picture. Eddie rapidly nodded, and watched as the three collaborators took their spots right where William, Jack, and Henry had once stood."

And of course, they had come so far, such an amazing distance. And here they were... back where they started.\n\n"Hey! Mattie!" Olivia shouted. The cane was new to Olivia, her leg having recovered to the point that she didn't need the wheelchair anymore. She stumbled over to Matilda, smiling confidently. "God, it really hasn't changed at all, has it?"\nMatilda grinned, and snorted. "I suppose not. Why did you want to come back?"\n"Well, it's where we met, isn't it?" Olivia replied. The girls wandered, noting the little things they remembered. Olivia's chalk scratching that got people gossiping about whether Maggie Thomas was snogging a layabout named Otto from a nearby boy's comp. The classrooms where Matilda would stare out the window thinking of the 10 minutes that she would have with Olivia at the end of the day. Lastly, of course, the bike sheds. The same bike sheds she would swear she lived in.\n\n"God, we used to sit down here all the time?" Olivia said as she looked up and down the back of the sheds covered in dried mud and overgrown moss. "Yeah, it was never really very tidy." Matilda said, sitting down. Olivia sat down alongside her. "Mattie, um... I remember, a couple years ago, I was sitting here, and crying because my dad said something about people like us, and, well... you said you would always stay by my side. And that's really stuck with me, because, you have. And, I love you, and... I want to stay by your side too. And well..."\nOlivia took a small box out of her jacket. "Matilda Lewis, will you marry me?"\n\nMatilda was in shock. "Olivia what do you mean, we can't, it's not legal..."\n"It won't be legal, but we can hide it. I know we can hide it."\n"Then... yes. Yes!" Matilda teared up as Olivia grabbed her into a kiss.\n\nThe two women, hand in hand, left the school together, into a brighter future."

ENG_Wales_unification.1.t:0 "The Welsh Issue"
ENG_Wales_unification.1.desc:0 "[ENG.GetLeader] has deemed England able to expand, Wales will soon become its likely target. The nation has been a mess from the start and will likely have no other option than to join us. Afterall, they are fully aware of the measures we will be willing to use if they were to dare to defy us.\n\nThey would have to be led by some sort of mad man to decline.\n\nThe time for unification talks with the Welsh are upon us, a letter will be sent to Cardiff immediately to get the process started."
ENG_Wales_unification.1.a:0 "What choice do they have?"
                                                                

ENG_Wales_unification.2.t:0 "The English Demands"
ENG_Wales_unification.2.desc:0 "A letter has arrived in Cardiff from across the eastern border, it is from the English government and they have demanded that we begin the unification process. This has not been an unexpected moment yet it is one that we would have rather avoided. The English army is ready to enforce their demands, therefore the government will have to think carefully before they make up their mind.\n\nMany have already accepted that the dream of an independent Welsh Republic is over, and that we will soon awaken to the new English reality. To decline would mean suicide, but the government will have to do what is best for the people of Wales."
ENG_Wales_unification.2.a:0 "We have no choice."
ENG_Wales_unification.2.b:0 "Wales will be free forever!"

ENG_Wales_unification.3.t:0 "The Delegations Meet"
ENG_Wales_unification.3.desc:0 "The English delegations arrived in Cardiff soon after they had been accepted. The keenness of the English to reassert their control over Wales was obvious, however there was nothing that could prevent them now.\n\nNo time was wasted in taking pictures of the two sides together for the frontpages of tomorrow's newspapers. All the images would show everyone present beaming and ready to get on with the business of unification.\n\nYet [ENG.GetLeader] was slightly surprised to catch the Welsh Prime Minister looking so dejected once they had moved on from the flash of the press. Perhaps things were not exactly as the English would have liked, but they thought it best to get on with the job at hand. Best not to let the mind linger on such things."
ENG_Wales_unification.3.a:0 "They just need some convincing."

ENG_Wales_unification.4.t:0 "The English Delegation Arrives"
ENG_Wales_unification.4.desc:0 "I did not take long for the English to send their negotiators over to Cardiff, their enthusiasm was even seen as vulgar as some. But little could be done to stop them now. It was obvious that the English were now entirely in control of what followed from here on out.\n\nThe flash of a camera captured the moment, the Welsh did their best to look as optimistic as they could. The unfortunate truth was some of them had regrets even as they entered the negotiation room.\n\nEven [ENG.GetLeader] momentarily let his facade drop, but for little longer than a second, fearing that the English Prime Minister might have caught him. No matter, he thought, it would not have changed much even if they had."
ENG_Wales_unification.4.a:0 "Let's get on with it."
                                                      

ENG_Wales_unification.5.t:0 "Set the Tone"
ENG_Wales_unification.5.desc:0 "Negotiations with the English got off to an acceptable start, but the English felt like the Welsh had to be reminded who was in control. A demand would have to be made and Wales would have to, in turn, accept it.\n\nThe target of the order would be the Welsh Army. The English suspected it to still be a hotbed for nationalist activity, which would inevitably have to be removed come unification anyway. Thus Welsh demilitarisation became the first key issue of the negotiations.\n\nThe Welsh delegation were also reminded that if they refused, no further actions would be off limits, and Wales would have to suffer the consequences. If they would not demilitarise, the English would be more than happy to do it for them."
ENG_Wales_unification.5.a:0 "The end of the Welsh Army."
ENG_Wales_unification.5.b:0 "Come and take it."

ENG_Wales_unification.6.t:0 "The Welsh Demilitarise"
ENG_Wales_unification.6.desc:0 "The Welsh were quick in sending their reply back to the English. They had unsurprisingly accepted the demand of demilitarisation and assured the English that they had already begun disarming their soldiers.\n\nWales is now vulnerable to the wills of the English, there is nothing left to protect it and the Welsh people have all but surrendered themselves to the English as a result.\n\nBut what choice did their government have?\n\nAll things considered, it would be better for them to disarm peacefully now than suffer the harmful consequences of defiance in the future."
ENG_Wales_unification.6.a:0 "A dragon without its flame."
                                                              

ENG_Wales_unification.7.t:0 "Surrendering Our Markets"
ENG_Wales_unification.7.desc:0 "Next on the English agenda came the need to integrate the Welsh economy into England's. Such a change could actually become a benefit for the people of Wales and would welcome an influx of English goods.\n\nHowever, many smaller Welsh businesses would be put at risk of simply being outcompeted by their English counterparts. Unemployment in the region would rise substantially, something that would take a great deal of time to recover from.\n\nTo refuse the English demands would again risk war, but without an army how could such a battle be fought? Time is running out and the crown will soon seize total control and there is increasingly little that can be done to stop it."
ENG_Wales_unification.7.a:0 "Let them in."
ENG_Wales_unification.7.b:0 "Maybe it is not too late?"

ENG_Wales_unification.8.t:0 "Access to Welsh Markets"
ENG_Wales_unification.8.desc:0 "After their willingness to lay down their arms, nobody within the English delegation was surprised to hear that Wales had surrendered its markets too. Another stage toward the eventual integration of all of Wales had been taken and England was already starting to profit.\n\nMerging the two economies would be a quick and painless process for the English but likely would be a more troublesome experience for the Welsh. Yet no one in England's government felt much regret for having to force such an ordeal on to Wales.\n\nIn their eyes it was the Welsh government's fault for betraying the English Crown all those years ago. If they had not left then they would not have had to suffer the ramifications now."
ENG_Wales_unification.8.a:0 "Another step closer."

ENG_Wales_unification.9.t:0 "We Will Make Our Demands"
ENG_Wales_unification.9.desc:0 "By this point of the negotiations the Welsh were sick of accepting the demands of the English. They had acted in good faith, but where had that led them? Now Wales was without an army and an economy which was slowly dying before its eyes. Things could not go on this way forever, Wales would have to stand up for itself. They would request that Wales be granted autonomy, yet remain underneath the English crown.\n\nSome thought it foolish to make a stand against the English so late.\n\nHowever, the demands had already been sent, there was nothing left to do beside wait, and hope that whatever limited sympathies the English had for Wales allowed them to accept their offer."
ENG_Wales_unification.9.a:0 "The last hope of Wales."
                                                             

ENG_Wales_unification.10.t:0 "The Welsh Demands"
ENG_Wales_unification.10.desc:0 "It was strange for the English negotiators to realise that for once they would be the ones receiving demands, not the Welsh. The message they received requested that Wales receive a degree of autonomy after it is reunified with England.\n\nSome of the English allowed themselves to be persuaded, because Wales would still be bought under the English crown. If they could avoid a needless war and bring Wales into the fold then there would be no reason to decline.\n\nOthers were of an altogether different mind. Wales have no army, what other response could they expect in response to such an insolent demand.\n\nEither way the choice would have to be made, and the fate of Wales would be decided in the process."
ENG_Wales_unification.10.a:0 "Grant them autonomy."
ENG_Wales_unification.10.b:0 "They will pay for this."

ENG_Wales_unification.11.t:0 "Unification at Last"
ENG_Wales_unification.11.desc:0 "With the final issue of Welsh autonomy resolved, the agreement was ready to be signed and with it the death of the Welsh Republic would soon become official. The Welsh and English people would be united once more, and neither side would have to suffer a drop of blood.\n\nBoth sides gathered round the table pens in hand and a copy of the agreement before each of the leaders. [ENG.GetLeader] looked down upon the document, it was good enough they thought, nothing worth dying over, but good enough.\n\nThey raised thier hand and with the stroke of a pen, the Welsh dream died."
ENG_Wales_unification.11.a:0 "All things come to end."

ENG_Wales_unification.12.t:0 "The Border Opens"
ENG_Wales_unification.12.desc:0 "For the first time in twenty years, the border between Wales and England was open and both their peoples were united again. Little celebration could be seen, but somewhere in Westminster, the English delegation cheered at the news. The United Kingdom of the past was not dead yet and they still had a chance to revive it.\n\nYet back in Wales much was changing. The first few Englishmen had crossed the border and had already taken a great interest in Wales. For them Wales was seen as a land of opportunity, not one of dull stagnation that the locals had grown to tolerate. These locals were also greatly disgruntled to see the wave of the English arrive, Wales may have been a miserable place to live, but at least it was theirs.\n\nSomewhere over the rooftops of Cardiff an English flag flies and all is slowly forgotten."
ENG_Wales_unification.12.a:0 "Peace Survives in England"

ENG_Wales_unification.13.t:0 "The End"
ENG_Wales_unification.13.desc:0 "So the hope of a Welsh Republic was over.\n\nAnd it had been nothing more than a hope. For all the years of its corruption, its feigned democracy and its tensions running high had always meant naught. As England lied on its border,waiting for the time it would awaken, knowing it would not lay dormant forever. England was bound to rear its head again and come back for Wales once more.\n\nYet peace in the valleys of Wales would and endure and for all its flaws, Wales dies peacefully."
ENG_Wales_unification.13.a:0 "It's all over."

ENG_Wales_unification.14.t:0 "Wales Reject's Our Demands!"
ENG_Wales_unification.14.desc:0 "Wales has sent its response and to the immense surprise of the English negotiators, their demands have been rejected.\n\nNevertheless, England will press forward, the time for talking may be over but reunification will not be postponed. Those in power in England believe they have been left with no other option than to declare war. The English army was positioned along the border for a reason.\n\nWar will take over where peace could have reigned. Neither side sees themselves as responsible for what will come next, though both will inevitably suffer."
ENG_Wales_unification.14.a:0 "For England!"

ENG_Wales_unification.144.t:0 "England Refuses Autonomy"
ENG_Wales_unification.144.desc:0 "The English reply was the opposite of what the Welsh government had been hoping for. Their suggestion of the English granting Wales some autonomy had been rejected and the future of Wales had become exceedingly uncertain.\n\nYet the likely result of Welsh autonomy would be a continued deterioration of the situation, as talks between the two nations would probably break down. What is worse is the reports that have already started to emerge suggesting that the English have doubled down on their rejection and sent in their army to finalize the unification.\n\nThe Welsh government can at least be sure that it had tried its best to do what was best for Wales. Yet in doing so it may have lost everything."
ENG_Wales_unification.144.a:0 "To war."

ENG_Wales_unification.15.t:0 "The English Attack!"
ENG_Wales_unification.15.desc:0 "News of an English invasion has been anticipated the moment after the rejection of their demands had been sent. There has been very little time to prepare and only limited defenses exist to protect the nation. The English soldiers march forward and conflict is now inevitable.\n\nNo one wished that it would come to this, but the final moments of the Welsh nation are upon us. The Welsh now have a choice between death or acceptance, as they all know that the English Army is much more vast than that of Wales.\n\nFew expect Wales to last much longer, but at least it will not go quietly."
ENG_Wales_unification.15.a:0 "Long live Wales."

ENG_Wales_unification.16.t:0 "The Effects of Unification"
ENG_Wales_unification.16.desc:0 "Now that some time has passed since unification was finally realised its effects have started to be felt by the people of Wales. Initially nothing much changed, the shops stayed open and they spoke the same language as before. Many even wondered what all the fuss had been about to begin with.\n\nHowever, this would change; English goods would fill the shelves of Welsh stores, joblessness became increasingly common and with less people to sell to, the stores shut down too. An influx of English arriving in the country would also make the Welsh language worthless, wiping out much of the local country with it.\n\nA way of life was passing away in front of them, one they had never thought they would miss and there was nothing they could do to stop it from fading away."
ENG_Wales_unification.16.a:0 "They're stuck with us now."

ENG_Wales_unification.160.desc:0 "Two senior bureaucrats were discussing the security situation in an office somewhere in the newly reunified Kingdom of England and Wales.\n\nOne of them asked, "So they've given up terrorism, have they?" Several months ago, he had just narrowly avoided getting blown up by a Welsh separatists' improvised bomb.\n\nThe other nodded eagerly. "Yes, they have. They've resorted to far more low-level methods, and their resistance groups are disorganized now. Few pickets here and there, some flag desecrations in private, nothing more intensive than you'd expect from a lot of witless university students."\n\nThe first bureaucrat leaned back and sipped some wine. "So it's almost done, isn't it? Not much longer now until the Welsh accept their new situation."\n\nHis friend nodded. "Precisely so."
ENG_Wales_unification.160.a:0 "The Dragon slumbers."

ENG_Wales_unification.166.desc:0 "It's odd to think that, for a moment in Alys fairly short life, Wales was an independent country; born from the humiliation of the crown, did the nation of Wales rise to be a free entity in the Isles, free to choose her own path, her own sovereignty.\n\nOf course that's not the case anymore, but one cannot say that Wales simply bowed her head and accepted being part of the Union smoothily; Alys, for the past weeks, had to take a very roundabout path to her work in the sewing shop, dank and suspicious alleyways being somehow much safer than the main streets, who could at any moment turn into a violent riot and a clash between the people and the police.\n\nReally, nobody should get used to the sound of rubber bullets, and mallets against flesh, but Alys sure did.\n\nAnd yet, today...was odd. For the first time in quite a while, Alys could see in the newspaper banal news about the day, instead of another shop or another car bombed; it wasn't really getting any better, all it took was a few pages to see more protests across the city, but she felt something in her chest that she haven't felt for a while...\n\nHope, really. Hope she can get to work without being terrified of being dragged to something she really had no desire being involved. Alys picked up her things, and locked the door of her apartment before going to her own way...she'll still stick to the shadows, but perhaps one day she can walk down a Boulevard without being terrified of her life for once."
ENG_Wales_unification.166.a:0 "All in a day's work."

ENG_Wales_unification.1666.desc:0 "Caricatures of the English Prime Minister were held high, together with banners, flags and other demands of the protesters, who went down High St. screaming and shouting for freedom, justice for independence they once had, the shackles that for a brief moment they were free off before being tied again. The Protesters went down the street, screaming and demanding until their throat became sore, the line of bystanders observing them with different reactions, from silent agreement to general discontent, but one expression that didn't change, was the stonefaced, apathetic line of policemen guarding the protester from each side.\n\nAngharad didn't believe in violent movements to bring back their freedom, like what was happening before, and she was proven right as the firecrackers were arrested and dragged off to jail cells, violence would only justify and bolden the British Beast, the Welsh had to show they were above such violent approaches, that discussion could be made in a proper and civilized matter.\n\nShe organized this protest, she let the police know in advance, the street was organized as such, and she rallied the people to protest like civilized, proper people against this agression to their sovereignity.\n\nIt was a protest on the English terms, by English security, within their specifications, but maybe this will embolden the spirit of the people, to join her...that Wales can be herself again, not in violent reprisal, but peaceful denial, right?\n\nAnd yet, as she screams herself hoarse, the doubt in her mind simply increases more and more."
ENG_Wales_unification.1666.a:0 "That she was played for a fool."

ENG_Wales_unification.16666.desc:0 "Angharad rubs the bridge of her nose, exhaustion threatening to overtake her, as she wrote the...what, Seventieth? Probably, she isn't proud to admit she must have lost count, the seventieth letter to any representative in the Wales Administration, almost begging them to remember what Wales once was, what Wales could be. Each day she organized the protesters, fewer people came, as they accepted the creeping fact of their culture, their identity, being more and more tied to the Hegemon of Britain, to a point that eventually she was simply seen as a nuisance, and the police and the mayor simply stopped replying to her correspondence.\n\nShe was an idiot. The peaceful dialogue was still the means to safeguard her nation's future, but all she made was a walking parade for the people in Wales to mock, a show to see how more and more the flames of independence went from righteous anger to a line of dozens, holding bold letters and drawings, going down a street and generally causing a nuisance.\n\nAnd now, her purpose to that show was done, and she was simply cast aside as a crazy lady that wrote to representatives, desperate for them to do something she couldn't do anymore...but really, would that change anything?\n\nShe was being isolated. Sidelined. An idiot whose purpose was done.\n\nShe picked up the letter, tears burning on the edge of her eyes as she tore it apart silently; first in half, then in four pieces, then in eight, until they were hundreds of tiny fragments, as wide as the center of her pinky finger, and threw them out of the window, to fly on a windy night.\n\nThat was Wales now. Insignificant pieces, to scatter about in a greater whole until what was once whole was simply undistinguishable. Angharad rose from her seat and went to bed, clothes and all, too tired to take a bath or put on her robe."

ENG_Wales_unification.166666.desc:0 "Alys woke up to a bright morning, making her breakfast with a grin on her expression. Making her breakfast, a hearty portion of eggs, mushrooms, and sausages, she got ready to work. No longer did she have to fear for her life, as she walked down the peaceful boulevard, wishing most people on her way a good morning, even if most wouldn't even glance at her.\nBecause nobody could spoil her day anymore, she was promoted, her small business got a healthy incentive from the government, and tomorrow she would be traveling to Oxford to promote sales for her brand across the country; not the country of wales, but the United Kingdom.\nSo invested was she in her mood that she slammed against another person, falling on the floor. Stars swarmed her vision for a moment, and she could feel a bump growing on the back of her head, her vision swarming for a moment, as she closed her eyes, wincing...\n"Oh, Christ, are you okay?"\nHer eyes opened up to a washed-up woman, likely close to her age. Her hair was barely kept, falling to her hips in knots and twists, her expression and bags under her eyes talking of exhaustion that she couldn't just notice, but feel around the woman, the bottle she was holding on her other arm speaking of her activity in the morning."Oh, it's nothing. J-just an accident in the morning, it's all."\nShe accepted the help, cleaning the dirt that got on her dress a bit, and nodding her thanks to the woman, who simply nodded, mouthed an apology, and wished her a good morning, before going on her way...\nAlys couldn't help but stare, looking at the woman until she completely blended with the crowds... a pang of peculiar guilt rose to her chest; should have she said something, offered anything? Ask her name? She never met that woman, but for a brief moment, she felt some odd manner of...kinship.\nThis feeling went away quickly, as she would check the street clock, and realized she would be late for the meeting."

Clearly more aggressive measures will have to be utilised in order to bring about unification with Wales. Measures which the English have made clear that they would not shy away from.\n\nCayo and his damned clique of nationalist terrorisers will be put down. They will not stand a chance against the might of the English military. The English army will require some time to prepare, but given time Cayo's men will all be retreating from the cause they claimed they would die for.\n\nThose in England are all in one mind over how all this will end:"

ENG_Wales_unification.18.desc:0 "War has become unavoidable, [WAL.GetNameDEF] will no doubt be prepared to defend their homeland with a degree of ferocity few would have expected from the Welsh. If the English are to avoid all out humiliation at the hands of the [WAL.GetRulingParty] more men will have to be called up to do their duty. The nation's reserves will help bring the fight to the Welsh.\n\nThe General's of the English armed forces are keen to avoid even the slightest chance of humiliation at the hands of the Welsh. England's army may dwarf its Welsh counterpart but this action is seen as necessary to bolster its ranks of soldiers and overwhelm the defenders of Wales.\n\nNothing will be left to chance."
ENG_Wales_unification.18.a:0 "More must serve."

ENG_Wales_unification.19.t:0 "Ready the RAF"
ENG_Wales_unification.19.desc:0 "One of England's greatest advantages over [WAL.GetNameDEF] is the fact that it has an air force at its disposal. Limited as the Royal Air Force may be, it will still be of significant use come the time of the invasion.\n\nTherefore, more warplanes will be stationed in the airfields closest to Wales and they will prepare to take to the skies and rain hell upon the Welsh. This may well be one of the first times many of our pilots will see active combat, these men will especially need extra training before the time of the invasion.\n\nThe roar of English engines would soon be heard all over Wales, and one could only imagine that it would shake the Welsh people to their cores."
ENG_Wales_unification.19.a:0 "Take to the skies."

ENG_Wales_unification.20.t:0 "Testing the Welsh"
ENG_Wales_unification.20.desc:0 "Given the Welsh's enduring stubbornness to accept English hegemony, a plan has been drawn up to start a small scale attack on the Welsh border. This fight will draw out the soldiers of [WAL.GetNameDEF] and enable the English to realise how capable they really are. An English victory is, of course, the expected outcome.\n\nYet in the unlikely event of a [WAL.GetRulingParty] victory, the English army will be greatly dismayed, and the government will also be embarrassed.\n\nGunfire will be exchanged and soldiers will fall; but whatever the outcome, war will follow and it will be much more bloody than a simple skirmish."

This failed skirmish will certainly be used as a justification for all out war to be declared against Wales.\n\nThey may have beaten England this time, but it is unlikely they will succeed again."
ENG_Wales_unification.22.a:0 "A surprise, to be sure."

ENG_Wales_unification.23.desc:0 "Since the outcome of the border conflict was announced, on both sides of the border, troops and civilians alike have been awaiting the start of the inevitable English invasion. The [WAL.GetName] has had some time to prepare, but it will no doubt struggle to hold off the advancing English, all the while harried by enemy aerial superiority.\n\nHowever, the excruciating wait will soon be over. The order to attack will be ordered from the English High Command and the English army will march into Wales."

ENG_Cornwall.1.t:0 "수치스러운 광경"
ENG_Cornwall.1.d:0 "카를 피셔 국방군 대령은 두 손으로 머리를 감싸쥐고 눈앞에 펼쳐지는 우스꽝스러운 광경을 보았습니다. 야전 원수 버나드 몽고메리가 북부의 HMMLR 반군으로부터 다시 위협을 받고 있는 상황에서 전투 준비태세를 갖추고자 콘월 주둔군과 영국군 간의 합동 군사 훈련을 제안한 것입니다. 이에 국방군 상급대장이 동의했고, 그리고 모의전 개시일이 잡혔습니다.\n\n지금까지의 결과는 만족스럽지 못했습니다.\n\n모의전을 진행하기 위해 선발된 지역이 내려다보이는 언덕 꼭대기의 지휘소에서 피셔와 다른 많은 장교들은 영국 군인들이 다양한 시나리오를 헤쳐 나가는 것을 보았습니다. 특히 주목할 만한 시나리오는 영국군 대위가 수비대 병사들을 찾기 위해 가상의 마을을 수색하는 임무를 맡았을 때입니다. 대위는 즉시 최선을 다했고, 병사들을 한명 한명씩 찾아냈습니다. 참모들까지 내보내고도 마을 밖에 홀로 남겨져 있던 그는 대항군에게 붙잡혔습니다. 포로로 잡혔을 때 교전지역 밖에 있었다고 우기던 그는, 대항군이 공평한 조건에서 모의전을 진행하지 않았다은 사실을 알려주자 잠잠해졌습니다.\n\n"전 이 폭도들보다 잘 훈련된 생도들 보았습니다,"라고 말한 한 국방군 중령은 포탄을 장전하기 위해 이리저리 돌아다는 분대를 보며 말합니다,"전쟁 중에 우리가 이놈들을 세게 후려친 건 알지만, 정말 부끄럽기 짝이 없습니다."\n\n피셔 국방군 대령은 부하의 의견에게 동의했습니다. "잉글랜드인들은 싸울만한 적이 없어져서 살찌고 유해진거야,"라고 그는 대답하면서, "이런 수준이라면, HMMLR 세력은 이들을 짓밟아 버리겠지. 우리가 할 수 있는 건 한가지 뿐이야. 이놈들이 어떤 적이라도 대항할 준비가 되도록 가르쳐야 하네."라고 말합니다.\n\n장교들은 조용히 동의하면서, 절차를 향해 돌아섰습니다."
ENG_Cornwall.1.a:0 "본론으로 들어가자."
ENG_Cornwall.2.t:0 "조짐 좋은 보고서"
ENG_Cornwall.2.d:0 "클로드 오친렉은 앉아서 스파이들이 전달한 보고서를 읽었습니다. 그는 자신이 느끼는 즐거움을 감추기 위해 차를 한 모금 마시는 것은 신사답지 못한 행동이라고 생각했습니다. 일종의 씁쓸한 유쾌함입니다; 그가 읽고 있던 보고서에 따르면, 한때 영국의 위대한 군대는 대열에 합류하는 것 외에는 할 줄 아는 게 없는 횡설수설한 멍청이 무리로 전락했다는 겁니다. 먼저 있었던 보고에 따르면 그마저도 힘들다고 합니다.\n\n"이 보고서들이 정확한 게 확실한 건가?" 그가 보고서를 건네준 스파이에게 묻습니다.\n\n"예, 모의전을 진행하는 것을 보았습니다."라고 스파이가 대답합니다. "끝내주는 광경이었습니다. 간신히 대형을 이루고 움직이는 게 불쌍하기 그지없더군요."\n\n오친렉은 흥얼거리며 서류를 훑어보더니 차를 한 모금 더 마셨습니다. 모든 면에서 모의전은 참담했던 것 같았습니다; 이것은 영국인의 무능함을 놀라울 정도로 보여주었습니다. "이대로 간다면," 그는 생각에 잠깁니다. "영국군은 대규모 봉기를 진압할 수 없을 것 같군."\n\n"제가 보기론" 스파이가 웃으면서 말합니다. "녀석들은 무장 봉기는 고사하고, 훌리건 무리도 간신히 진압할 겁니다."\n\n오친렉이 인상을 찌부립니다. "문제는 언제나 독일놈들이야. 무슨 짓을 벌이는 지 잘 알고 있으니까."\n\n스파이는 "우리 수가 많으니, 콘월 주둔군 자체로는 인력이 충분하지 않을 겁니다. 놈들이 더 잘 훈련되어 있더라도, 우린 머릿수로 간단하게 제압할 수 있을 겁니다."라고 주장합니다.\n\n오친렉은 "그게 요점이 아니네"라며, "독일놈들은 우리가 봤던 것과 정확히 같은 보았을 것이고, 아마 똑같은 결론에 도달했을 것이네. 우리가 여기 있다는 것을 알면서도 영국군을 바보처럼 가만히 둘 것이라고 생각한다면, 잘못 생각한 걸세. 우리는 준비가 필요해...""
ENG_Cornwall.2.a:0 "아니면 결과를 받아들일 뿐이다."
ENG_Cornwall.3.t:0 "콘월 요구"
ENG_Cornwall.3.d:0 "영국 정부는 외부와 내부의 적들로부터 포위되었고 끊임없이 공격을 받고 있습니다. 이미 반란군 해충들을 처리하는 데 애를 먹고 있으며, 이제 다른 전선에서도 압박을 받고 있습니다. 우리에게 오놀, 콘월 주둔군에게 가능한 한 빨리 이행되어야 할 일련의 요구 사항을 담은 메시지를 받았습니다.\n\n할더 장군이 우리를 더 많이 통제하려는 시도처럼 보이기도 합니다. 하지만, 현재 상황에서 이 요구를 들어주는 것이 최선의 조치가 될 것입니다. 무슨 일이 있어도, 이 예상치 못한 상황에 빨리 대처해야 합니다."
ENG_Cornwall.3.a:0 "원하는 게 뭐지?"
ENG_Cornwall.4.t:0 "Getting Used"
ENG_Cornwall.4.d:0 ""This must be a fucking joke," Bernard Montgomery cursed angrily, almost ripping the piece of paper on his hands. Behind him, Field Marshal Templer was equally apoplectic with rage by the news but tried to keep his composure. Murmuring insults and sweating uncontrollably, the other generals at the English High Command were also furious.\n\n"The Cornwall Garrison is abandoning us to the rebels and stealing our equipment! This is asinine!" Montgomery yelled, throwing the paper over the desk with anger. For a moment, he empathized with the rebels. Putting their trust in the Germans to put things in order was a great mistake.\n\n"From what my sources have gathered, apparently they say that is some kind of strategic retreat, and the equipment is for anti-partisan purposes," Templer exposed. But Montgomery was fixated on the map in front of him, with his hands firmly grabbing the desk. The German retreat left so many gaps in their defenses, especially without tanks and heavy artillery. How are they going to even replace the lost equipment?\n\n"In other words, they are kindly telling us to fuck off," Marshal Templer also added. Freezing for a few seconds to reflect, Montogomery decided to go back to the drawing board. Empathy or not, the rebels needed to be crushed for the good of England.\n\n"To hell with those bastards from Cornwall. It looks like we are on our own. Marshal Templer; we need to delineate a new strategy based on our remaining resources.""
ENG_Cornwall.4.a:0 "German treachery never stops."
ENG_Cornwall.5.t:0 "Field Report"
ENG_Cornwall.5.d:0 "A dozen men continued to run around the camp, heavily breathing on the cold English morning. In the distance, the mortars roared, accurately hitting their marks. Meanwhile, another group practiced with rifles, destroying the ragdolls' heads one by one in a perfect synchronized fashion.\n\nDressed in his impeccable military uniform proudly displaying the Iron Cross, Field Marshal Franz Halder witnessed this spectacle alongside his English counterpart, satisfied. "I have to admit, Marshal, I'm impressed at how well you have trained your men. These men could have stood a better chance against us."\n\n"No thanks to you, prick." Marshal Templer thought to himself. "I appreciate the compliment, Mr. Halder. We have trained our forces with the highest of standards," he exclaimed, displaying a forced smile.\n\nThe men running through the obstacle course continued the exercise, climbing ropes and crawling on the ground. "I feel confident that these men will crush the rebels, and we'll provide the equipment you need," Halder said extending his hand.\n\nAs the two officers shook their hands, Templer thought about how to deal with the Cornwall issue in the future."
ENG_Cornwall.5.a:0 "Our grateful German ally."
