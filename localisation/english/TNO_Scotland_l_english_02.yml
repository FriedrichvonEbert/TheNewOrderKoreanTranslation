A regional unit of old men and young boys, thrown together in the panicked days after Dunkirk. When the invasion came, your unit fought alongside us, being pushed to the north and clashing with the Germans every step of the way.\n\nWhen the war was about to end, and we held the convention to declare our independence, we expected to count on the support of only a few scattered scottish regiments and my own 51st Division. I could hardly expect the officers of a division entirely composed of Englishmen to be the first to offer their services. Rather than lay down their arms and return to their home, they would rather live in Scotland and fight for a nation of strangers. They were committed to a higher cause than Scottish independence, they were committed to freedom.\n\nYears went by, and your unit stood with us on guard against the Nazi menace. When the older soldiers had to retire, new Englishmen stood up to take their place on the watch. With your help, we have detered a nazi invasion, and ensured the people of Scotland would be able to live peacefully and freely. This service will never be forgotten by the grateful north you chose to serve.\n\nNow, England has been freed, and the danger of invasion is much less than it was before. And you have expressed interest in returning home, now that your homeland is free. I wish to assure you that I hold no ill will toward you for wanting to return, and this is an amicable separation. On behalf of the Scottish nation, I thank you for your duty, and wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours."

And it wasn't a complete division, some of the men had decided to stay in Scotland and had transferred to other units in the Scottish Army.\n\nThe whistle blew, and the chartered train left the station. An hour after it left the station, it passed through the Lamberton rail checkpoint, leaving Scotland to a cheer from the men. Passing through the HMMLR checkpoint just a few meters away, they were greeted with a salute by several customs officials. The men were eager to disembark, but the train didn't stop at the northernmost English station of Berwick upon Theed. It continued going further and further into Northumberland County, until it reached the village of Pegswood.\n\nThe men got off the train and filtered into a line, not taking their luggage. Still in the Scottish uniform, they marched in a line off the platform, up the footpath to the road, made a right, and after a brief stroll alongside the road, onto the green of the Pegswood community park. There, they were greeted by crowds of cheering people, local notables, HMMLR soldiers, and a symphony orchestra, playing Pomp and Circumstance. Even before all the men had arrived, even before the speeches, even before the reunification with the long separated family members, the men were moved to tears. Some choked up as they sang "Land of hope of glory, mother of the free..."\n\nThe exiles of the Northumberland County Division had returned home."

"Scotland owes the Northumberland County Division a great debt for what you did during our independence and after the war. The facts are, changing circumstances have made us take a fresh look at our armed forces, and several changes are going to be needed to adequately defend Scotland."\n\nA colonel said "I don't want to speculate, but is the reason that having a division of Englishmen in Scotland is untrustworthy?

They would guide the local formations of training units and home guardsmen in defense against the invasion. When the invasion came, the units were instead transferred to fight alongside the regulars on the front. The divisions fought bravely, but lack of weapons and trained men hindered them in their desperate fight to stop the onslaught of Nazi mechanized slaughter. Thus, when the war ended, the county divisions were disbanded, demobilized, and forgotten.\n\nBut one division was not content with an honorable surrender. The officers and men of Northumberland County offered their services to the new republic to the north, and Major General Douglas Wimberley accepted this English unit as part of the Scottish Army. For years, they waited on the Scottish border, ready to defend the last bastion of democracy on the isles. They gathered strength from the exiles in Scotland, equipped themselves to the best of their ability, and trained for the inevitable.\n\nIn a part of the scottish border that lacked Collaborator patrols, the chain link fence that marked the border was cut with a pair of wire cutters. A squad made the first tentative steps onto English territory, and were soon followed by infantry making their own gaps in the wire. More and more of the fencing was peeled back or just driven over by trucks, jeeps, and artillery pieces, all marked with the English flag. By morning, there existed on the border a massive gap that had burst into the English countryside.\n\nThe men of Northumberland had returned to their ancestral home. And the Northumberland County Division, the English division that had never surrendered, had arrived from the past to free England from tyranny."

There was one unit that was originally a static formation meant to coordinate defense units in Northumberland County, and its officers decided to stick it out in Scotland, for whatever bloody reason."\n\n"And I take it they've stayed up there ever since?" asked Powell.\n\n"They did. Intelligence reported it was the unit of choice for many defectors, but the Scottish were mostly using them as a regular division. Standing on the border, waiting for us to come up, the usual nonsense. Even recently, there wasn't any unusual movements on their part, and we mostly ignored them."\n\n"So why am I hearing about this 'Northumberland County Division' now?"\n\n"Last night, scouts reported Scottish troops invading from the north. The other sectors reported all quiet, so we disregarded the report. But then our units in the area reported clashes with well armed infantry in Scottish uniforms. It's clear at least one unit has jumped the fence and it is probably the one with the Englishmen."\n\n"So this division has invaded us.""

We have a record of that, we got their names, and we know where they moved to or ended up. So that's a database of every Englander who entered the country in the past twenty years, which are going to be the ones who probably want to leave the most, and are the ones we want to help.\n\n"So what we do is mail them an offer. If they leave Scotland, we give them a small stipend to help them with the moving and resettlement costs. At the customs office, they file a notice of emigration, and they get a check in return. Then they go home with some cash, making them happy. We get rid of them gently, making us happy. And since they're gone, we don't mistreat them, making the English people and HMMLR happy. And those that don't leave are already happy with us, which makes us happy with them.\n\n"So it's simple, it defuses a potential race riot, has basically no downside, and it makes everyone, from the refugee to the citizen to the government happy.

 sco_fen.8.desc:0 "EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) - Many English exiles are taking advantage of the new repatriation program where the Scottish government covers part or all of the costs of emigrating back to England.\n\n"Our research has found that many refugees in Scotland have a desire to return home, but the main factor in preventing that is lack of resources to afford moving," Government Spokesman Tom McLeod said. "English refugees typically lacked financial resources when they arrived to begin with, so this support helps them get back on their feet when they return."\n\nReaction to the program in Scottish media has been mixed. Most credit the government for finding a solution to recent tensions with the exiles, one that avoids the forced population deportations that have plagued the continent in the past few decades. Some papers, however, oppose the program. Some are calling any action to move people as inhumane, and others decry the use of taxpayer money for this purpose and call for harsher methods instead.\n\nBut the exile community has almost universal praise for the program. Edinburgh Waverley Train Station has plenty of refugees purchasing one-way tickets to the English town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, where they plan to ride on English railroads the rest of the way to their new homes. Nearly all of the departing exiles there have claimed their rebates.\n\n"I think it's wonderful," said Emmeline Cooper, a housewife who is returning with her husband and two children to the town of Malton, North Yorkshire.

This was a momentous occasion, though one repeated many times before. However, this one was extremely special. For the couple who got out of the carriage and entered the building was the Ambassador of Scotland and his wife.\n\nA member of the diplomatic corps greeted the couple as they walked through the ambassador's entrance. As they were led through the palace, the ambassador was nervous. He had been trained in diplomatic procedure, yes, and was aware of how ambassadors were received at the Court of St James's. But now a whole new provisional government was in place, one that was in a technical limbo when it came to the monarchy. While he passed the grand staircase, the ambassador thought for a moment he might be told to go to Canada to meet the real head of state.\n\nClaude Auchinleck was waiting for the ambassador as he entered the throne room. The ambassador walked over and introduced himself and his wife, while giving a little bow, just to be safe. He then handed over a letter from the President of Scotland intended for Auchinleck, informing him the ambassador did represent the Scottish government, and was highly qualified for the task. Auchinleck read the letter for a moment, and then smiled and shook the ambassador's hand.\n\nAt that moment, for the first time since 1707, Scotland was recognized as an independent nation by the English government."

They got into a limousine, provided for them by the Scottish government.\n\nThe motorcade departed the airport soon after, and after a left turn, it was a straight shot to central Edinburgh. Farmland turned into small homes, and small homes turned into multistory commercial buildings as they arrived downtown. Holyrood Palace, the official home of the Scottish President, came into view, and the vehicles were allowed onto the grounds after a security check.\n\nThe ambassador and his family went inside, and waited while the President of Scotland finished up the last few minutes of a meeting with their economic advisors. After that, the ambassador was allowed in. The President greeted them all personally, and asked what the children thought of Scotland. Then, the letter of credence from Auchinleck was presented, signifying the ambassador was the official representative of England to the President. A picture was taken of the handoff, with both the President of Scotland and the English Ambassador smiling.\n\nThis photo got a lot of coverage in Scotland the next day, as well as the Scottish ambassador in England presenting his credentials at the same time.

Stirling was well known to McIntyre, a Scottish war hero who had founded a commando unit back in the war, ended up getting captured, released after the end of the conflict, and had never stopped fighting, really. His Special Air Service unit had played an important part in the ECW, and he had gotten on well initially with McIntyre.\n\nInitially, the topic had been about Stirling's war service, and how the unidentified British Soldier from the First World War might have very well been a Scotsman. However, the conversion slowly drifted to Scottish politics and Unionism, which made McIntyre a little uncomfortable.

London considered this possibility, but decided it would make more sense if these structures were kept under their control in the case of one of these governments suddenly breaking with Nazi Germany and deciding to pursue a more independent policy. They did attempt to make a bid for the old German Embassy, but this was never taken seriously.\n\nSo, they had to shop around for a location, and settled on an area near Belgrave Square. This was an obvious choice, as many nations had nearby embassies. But it did take a bit of time to find a building that was big enough to handle the work that was expected to happen. Scotland was expected to be England's biggest trading partner afterall. The English government helpfully offered the old Malayan High Commision building for cheap since they were now a Japanese military reservation, but the space issues led Scotland to reject this proposal.\n\nFortunately, only two blocks away, they found a row of buildings that were perfect. It was on a major road, across from the palace grounds, and, best of all, was damaged after being attacked in the ECW. They quickly bought the place, fixed it up, brought in some new furniture, and put a new coat of paint on the inside.

So they decided to compromise and purchase a pre-existing structure that was close to Scotland's government. They found what they needed in a building almost next to the Old Parliament House in Edinburgh. It looked like an embassy, it had the space for one, and it was close enough to get the message across, so the English set up shop there.

And everyone could agree the HMMLR counterparts were more friendly than the Collaborationist counterparts, more apt to greet and always ready to have a chat during the dull periods.\n\nThe work at the border patrol station was harder though. In the old days, only a few busses or cars would come through each day, and everything and everyone on board was known. That had changed. Now, the amount of people coming and leaving had increased tremendously. More regular people making business trips, going on holiday or passing through to shop. Even whole trains were starting to move through. They were thankful the identification requirements had been relaxed, because otherwise, there was no way they could meet this demand.\n\nThe biggest change the border guards noticed was the sheer amount of goods that were coming through from England. Trucks full of boxes meant for Scottish stores, marked with English brands long unavailable from Scotland's shelves. Train cars full of raw materials for the industries of Scotland.\n\nThe amount of advertising from English firms was a topic at break as well. Everyone had seen the posters and billboards for English goods and services. Some of the younger guards thought the nationalistic scotts wouldn't buy from England, regardless of it being free. The older ones thought that brands from before the war would find eager return customers. There were doubts about the sheer amount of goods going into scotland, but everyone noticed the trains and trucks brought Scottish gods to England as well."

But now it's here, and it's plentiful. And it's all due to Scotland opening up.\n\nThe Grocer is putting in a lighter beverage; the soft drink Irn-Bru. They are more eager to get their hands on the large amount of seafood that suddenly has become available. Whitefish from Peterhead and shellfish from Fraserburgh are shipped here directly now, filling the meat section with crab, herring, haddock, lobster, and cod. The butcher is pleased with the beef, lamb, and mutton from up north as well.\n\nAt the end of the street, the power plant has closed a deal with a mine up north. They can now expect to take in trains of coal regularly from up there, at a good price. With a steady supply secured, they can now start to think about the possibility of putting in another generator to meet demand. They wouldn't have been having these thoughts, they must admit, if the collaborationists were still in charge.\n\nAnd at the other end, the office is planning to make a series of big moves up in Scotland. They want to open up an office up there. They hope their affiliate will bring them a large amount of profit.

And this must apply to taxation as well. We need to ensure that we will be able to tax ourselves fairly and not have our voices be drowned out by the bustle of England's many cities.\n\nThe Scottish language needs to be protected as well.

And that governing body has authority over every domestic matter in Scotland, taxes, laws, whatever.

They have, however, conceded that several matters, such as electricity and power, employment, social security, and drug policy, are better off on a national scale, rather than a local one. But the taxes and laws that take effect in Scotland are mostly going to come from the Scottish parliament rather than from London.\n\n"There is also the matter of language.

Two lanes of traffic, brick construction, two arches with a base in the middle of the river. It would be utterly unimportant if it wasn't the westernmost border crossing between Scotland and England.\n\nBy the time the bridge had been built, the situation between England and Scotland had calmed down enough that it scarcely needed to be guarded. Just a toll house on the Scottish side was needed. On the English side, an inn was established. For many years, people crossed over the bridge regularly, thinking hardly anything of it.\n\nThen came the war. The border, which was hardly even noticed, was manned and armed. The Toll house was manned by Scottish Troops, who turned it into a border crossing. Collaborationist forces manned the inn on the other side, turning it into a border station. This nondescript bridge became a link between the free world on the Scottish side, and the slave world under the collaborators on the other.\n\nWhen the slave world was chased off, some normalcy returned to the Scottish border, but there was still tension. What would Free England do? They wanted to reunite with Scotland, but the Scottish wanted to protect their freedom. What if these differences were insurmountable? Would there be war?\n\nBut none of the fears that troops would cross the bridge were justified. Scotland gave their terms for reentry, and England accepted. As simple as that, the gates on both sides of the border went up, the troops went away, and soon normalcy would return to the bridge, once again not a link between two worlds, but a link under a single flag of two united peoples."

And we really agree the same thing should be applied here.\n\n"Running around independently is great and all, but what happens when a massive disaster happens? What if the Nazis finally invade? You want somebody at the top to coordinate the response. You want a centralized system that makes the major changes and leaves the minor ones up to you.

And that's gonna lead to war.\n\n"I can understand how much you would like your own legal system, and how you would like it to be seperate, and overriding what England puts out. Why this is an issue is that England has several laws that they don't want to be possibly overridden by Scotland. Things more basic, such as criminal law and economic policy. They fear the possibility that some whackos might make it legal to beat their wives up here and London couldn't do anything about it, for instance.\n\n"I know, that's an extreme example. But the point still stands. What if someone commits a crime in England and flees to Scotland? Who's responsible for their apprehension and their deportation? What if a company based in England runs afoul of Scottish Pollution laws? If hunters and fishers run afoul of Scottish game regulations, but not English ones?\n\n"There has to be national laws and standards on some things.

Things like having an Army, Navy, and Air Force, or give out foreign aid, or build massive infrastructure projects like dams and highways that benefit everyone. And the things that benefit everyone needs everyone to chip in a little.\n\n"You can't have a federal government without it raising some sort of income. Hell, even at our most decentralized the US government collected taxes. Federal beer taxes paid for our Civil War! It isn't enough to just give a certain amount to London just because you feel like it. What if you stop? That's what the English are worried about.\n\n"I know there's this big thing about no taxation without representation, but you are going to have a voice in London, while we did not.

We're not gonna convince England if there's an option between a flawed deal and a hypothetically perfect one, but we could convince them if we make it between the deal and throwing Britain into war."\n\nJack thought it over.

You yourself have said it's going to happen, by deal or conflict.\n\n"But now, I have to tell you directly that you aren't making a good decision.

You should be asking questions like 'how many OFN forces are in Scotland?' Or 'how many US Navy carrier groups are in the North Atlantic?' 'How many OFN Army Units are on the east coast of North America?' Or most importantly, 'how many nuclear capable B-52s are in Iceland and how long would it take for them to get here?'\n\n"You should chew on those questions for a while. Think about the enormity of a war with the OFN. Think about how long it would be before the US Air Force decimates your bridges, your famous railway system, your proud factories. Think about how many US and Canadian forces we could cram into Scotland. Think about how easily you could be cut off by a blockade from the US Navy. But most importantly, think of your people. Those who have suffered from war so many times, and now you subject them to one against a power that England has never faced before.\n\n"There isn't a choice, if you want to spare the people the suffering which war would force upon them.

That built an empire that spanned the globe. That developed the sciences and industries that had made the modern world that so many others claim mastery over.\n\nBut the most unfortunate circumstances tore the nation apart. England lay subjugated to the Germans and starving. Scotland lay up in the north, supported by independence-minded politicians and their friends in the British Army. They stared at each other from across the border for years, until a free England, devoted to the old British ideals of freedom, burst forth and ended the fake England imposed by the occupiers. For a brief moment, there was hope that the two nations could once again reunite.\n\nIt was not to be. The Scots demanded too much from England. So much so, that a true Union would be impossible. There would only be a scrap of cloth and little else in common between England and Scotland. And this would not do.\n\nScotland has failed to see reason.

It had excited the population, who believed it the next logical step after the overthrow of the fascists towards recreating the United Kingdom. However, Scotland joining the OFN stopped any optimism towards the prospects of such a Union. And as the negotiations became more and more dragged out, another fear started gripping the papers and a public. The prospect that the Scottish unreasonableness and the English desire to sit atop a United Kingdom would lead to yet another war.\n\nLate in the night, after the evening tabloids had come out, an urgent press conference was called on the subject. While the people slept, reporters funneled into a room in London with some government officials and the Americans who had been negotiating with the scots. When they filtered out, they immediately called up their papers, whose editors instantly called for the presses to stop.

These refugees shall be granted full citizenship provisional to a completion of a tour of service in the new Scottish Armed Forces, and their immediate families granted citizenship. Any who refuse this offer shall be considered for Category B or C refugee status, along with their immediate families.\n\nCategory B refugees shall consist of citizens of the United Kingdom born within the British Isles either located within Scottish borders at the ceasefire not eligible for Category A. The status of their claim will be evaluated by the Home Office - those deemed safe will be repatriated. Those deemed unsafe to repatriate will be granted papers of residency, and a license to work until such a time as they can be repatriated. They will be subject to monthly check-ins with the authorities. Those who apply for citizenship shall be evaluated based on work experience and criminal record.\n\nCategory C refugees shall consist of citizens of the Commonwealth Realms not eligible for or who refuse Category A or B status. Category C refugees shall be repatriated if it is deemed safe to do so. Those who remain shall be subject to literacy testing. Those deemed acceptable shall be elevated into Category B.

 sco_collab.5.desc:0 "The soldier stood at his post, peering over the railing at what lay beyond. A mixture of barbed wire and land mines, and then, a chain-link fence that marked the boundary between Scotland and England. Over the boundary was some defences on the English side, and a watch-post similar to his own on The Cheviot. Sometimes, there was a collaborator soldier just like himself on the other side, but he couldn't see one standing outside in the morning light at this point.\n\nBut the border was not an exact mirror. For beyond him was the slave world that threatened the free. There was the side that refugees fled from, and here was the site they fled to. There was the side where the English soldiers gathered, and here was the side they would be headed over to. There was the side where machinations and plans for the humiliation and subjugation of Scotland were being devised, and here was the side that must defend a free people against them.\n\nThis soldier would maintain a static watch over the border today, keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity. Tomorrow, he might join in a patrol, to make sure the defences were up to snuff and that nobody was sabotaging them. The day after that, he might contribute more to the defense of the border by helping to construct fortifications. And after that might be the day when all of Scotland's work would be put to the ultimate test. He did not know what the future held for him.\n\nWhat he did know was that the men and women of Scotland's armed forces were many, and would do their utmost to defend their land against the invaders to the south. And that whatever the English were planning on, the border patrols of Scotland stood ready to catch them in the act."

The young Englishwoman who has just arrived from the south and the old man who has ancestors back to before Roman times are both equally affected. The residents of the cities are not exempt, and neither are those who reside in the most remote farms. Rich and poor alike, SNP, ILP, and UP. All have come to a mass realization that they are in a terrifying and hopeless situation.\n\nYears ago, the British isles were home to one of the oldest and most stable democracies in the world. Now, that state is fragmented, and only Scotland is left. If the pakt attacks, no one on the isle will come to Scotland's aid. No more United Kingdom to protect it, now it is entirely reliant on itself.\n\nAnd the situation is worse than ever. When HMMLR in the south rose up, there was a brief moment of hope. That England would turn back into the Democracy that everyone once knew it as. That they would then be on much friendlier terms with Scotland, and they would then start reclaiming the isles for democracy. That hope is gone. The collaborators reign supreme down south, and with their opposition out of the way, there is nothing stopping them from attacking.\n\nThe OFN is the easiest answer to this malaise. Get the armed forces of the United States to defend Scotland and Democracy once again. But they won't. Washington says the situation is too delicate right now, and they can't allow Scotland in. They know that a clash on the border would mean a war between the OFN and the Pakt. And they would rather throw Scotland to the wolves than make another stand for freedom like in South Africa.\n\nThe nation is stuck in an unenviable situation. And no answers for this discomfort are available. All it seems they can do is wait for what comes next."

At the next meeting, a question was raised by a member.\n\n"What if the Organization of Free Nations attempts to back the Scottish"\n\nA simple question immediately caused an uproar between the MPs. The soldiers from the Garrison looked on in awe at the sight that was occuring. Insults got slung back and forth between parties before they calmed down. It was apparent they had overlooked one of the most pivotal factors in this entire plan, the OFN was a major divot for them in this plan. A wave of silence flew over the parliament building, members quietly thinking of the possible repercussions and the danger of angering the OFN.

Scarcely anyone believes that we should wait until we are at war with them before we prepare our defense. As the Chinese saying goes, victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.\n\nWith that in mind, I have ordered an analysis of the military industry of Scotland, and its communication network. The results are disheartening. Our military industry will not be able to withstand a prolonged conflict with England, and has many shortcomings. In addition, our communications network relies on outdated technology, and is vulnerable to sabotage. These shortcomings will make the outcome for a conflict with England extremely grim.\n\nI therefore request that the civilian government make every effort to fix these extreme issues before a conflict with England arises. A complete list of our findings has come with this letter. Scotland must move without delay or hesitation to ensure we have adequate systems to rely on when the time of trial comes.\n\nI therefore remain, your most obedient servant,\n\nField Marshall Douglas Wimberley"

There are many prominent supporters on both sides, and benefits and downsides to each. I therefore believe the civilian government would be best suited to make this decision, as you may be aware of other outside factors that may affect the decision.\n\nOne of the aforementioned sides is a group of officers who believe that many civilians should be called up to provide national service in the form of construction brigades along the border. They would be set to work developing bunkers, blockhouses, and tank traps in areas that the army deems crucial for defense. Their goal is to build a wall of concrete and steel that will insulate Scotland from enemy attacks.\n\nAnother group of officers believes this is pure folly. If we are to go to the trouble of putting these men to work, they say, then it would be more worthwhile to outfit them with guns instead of shovels. Manpower is at a critical level, they say, and we must ensure that we have a larger supply than now.\n\nOf course, you may explore these arguments in further detail in the documents I have attached with this letter.

So when he saw the SNP coddling the collaborationist bastards, he had seen enough.\n\nOn a whim, he went around Edinburgh, putting up hand-made posters calling for a march on Edinburgh that saturday. The posters didn't identify who would organize this demonstration, or if it even had a permit. Truth be told, it was only Wood behind it, not any group or organization. And he didn't have any other plans besides walking from the Scottish Government Building to Holyroodhouse But it was going to happen, even if he was the only one.\n\nThe day came, and to his surprise, a sizable number of people showed up. Fellow exiles who hated the idea of working with the collabs. Nationalistic veterans who refused to give an inch to the people they fought against. SNP voters who felt betrayed by the government's soft position. ILP supporters who were happy to voice their frustration with anything the SNP did. It was a diverse march, united only by a hatred for England and anyone who would work with them. And it got plenty of media attention.\n\nNext week, the protests in Edinburgh were even bigger. And copycat events in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and Inverness happened as well.

The pivotal one was that the Scottish Republic would cease to exist and be absorbed by Collabarist forces. Soon after this revelation, the Scottish Army was elevated to high alert and there was to be an arming on the border in case of a possible attack by the English. Scottish Parliament was immediately called to deal with this possible threat of war. Generals dusted off plans for a possible invasion, wondering if they would have to use them. The American diplomat to Scotland, David K.E Bruce was notified by his attache and a wire was immediately sent back to Washington and OFN headquarters. It would only be a matter of time before they must respond. The Field Marshal was notified after the fact it had been brought to the President's attention, exploding into a mix of passion and rage after hearing the fact that a crisis was starting to boil on the Scottish-English borders. He suspected he was notified after due to his temper and his anxiousness when it comes to events such as this. After hearing the news, he called all of his generals and marshals to Glasgow Barracks, to the war room to start planning a possible invasion and counter attack. Scotland would not be lost. "

Mayne thought about if the fight against tyranny was truly worth it. So many lost for nothing. However as he thought, a fire was ignited in him. He would not let a setback as big as this crush the plans he had made for Scotland. While this could have been seen as devastating to some, to Mayne it was just another day. However, the next time the Collaborators and Scots meet on the battlefield, there will only be one true victor, the Scottish."

Colonel David Ackenshire asked this to the officer with one eyebrow raised. The young officer had barged into his office. The officer opened the door with such ferocity, nearly knocking over the bookcase to the left of the door and startling David. The officer nodded after Ackenshire responded. He rubbed his temple before responding while grabbing a mound of papers from inside his desk.\n\n"Well Lieutenant York, it says right here that Stirling is presumed dead. We had attacked him and the remaining terrorists out by Newcastle Upon Tyne. So now I'll ask this question. How do we know this?" Asked Ackenshire to the York, who was slumped down in a chair, sweating bullets.\n\n"Well, you see sir, we had been out on patrol near the border when all of a sudden bullets began to fly near our head. We've walked that path hundreds of times and have seen Scottish soldiers who usually stare at us with rifles mustered or taunt us." Ackenshire motioned for him to continue. "Well, we scrambled to find cover. Unlike the soldiers we had fought before, some had the knife patch on them. They had also chased us across the border" York finally finished and slumped over even more in the chair, before shooting up after remembering he was in the presence of a Colonel. However, before Ackenshire could respond the phone rang.\n\n"Ackenshire, what seems to be the issue?" He pulled the phone a bit from his face for a few seconds, before putting it closer again. His eyes widened. "The fuck do you mean they've swarmed across the border? They're already by Newcastle? What the hell is our garrison doing?" Replied Ackenshire into the phone, as he frantically scribbled down notes."

Your freedoms have been restricted in these times of troubles, and for that I apologise. These times are soon coming to a close however.

The movie ended like most of those American movies now. Explosions and Nazi's dying. This was one of the only movies that they had been allowed to watch as the Unionists had been overthrown by the Army.\n\nHe excited the theatre and walked down a road back to his flat. On the wall near him was a freshly applied poster. It was quite large and he could see the three workers plaster more onto the walls and streets of Glasgow. He couldn't take his eyes off of the poster. The poster had large blue letters that seemed to jump off the paper. Screaming at any passerby saying.\n\n"This is a threat to all Scots, let this never occur again"\n\nIt was a grim poster, on the ground was a dead Scottish soldier with the Scottish flag draped over him while a fist with the Union Flag painted on it came down onto a soldier who was attempting to block the fist from smashing his compatriots body. Tim gulped and then started to walk once again to his house. While he didn't care at the moment, he later knew that the Unionists had been awful to Scotland and its people. They had prepared to send thousands of Scotland's youth into the fires of England to fight for a side that may engulf them one day.

The public didn't like it, that was certain, but sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. He turned his eyes to the desk, where a selection of death warrants awaited his review. They were guilty of treason, that much was certain, but what of the rest? What of the rank and file, who may not have planned the coup but gladly went along with it? Many Scots voted for the Unionist Party, many had family within its ranks or over the border. Their coup was a great crime, to be sure, but many of the plotters have met a dire fate. They had done everything they could to show the people the magnitude of their crimes, but still there was dissent.\n\nAnother puff, and his eyes flickered to the streets once more. What would happen when he finally let go of the reins of the cart? He had spared little time for after, focusing only on the now of dealing with traitors. Would the presses sing his praise once they were free, or would they denounce him as another plotter? Would he get the chance to sit on his laurels and finish his memoirs, or would he be an icon of shame and authoritarianism, not fit to speak of?

The response to this sudden development had been positive from the people of Scotland who had seen this as a return to normalcy and hopefully a return to democracy. He had received some backlash from the other members of the junta. However he reminded them that they overthrow the Unionists so democracy could return to Scotland. However he still had to decide what party to officially endorse.\n\nThe natural choice was to endorse the SNP. There was an issue with this however, they had experienced a harsh split and then the party nearly breaking down when John McCormick passed away due to sickness. He was weary of the SNP possibly collapsing in on itself. Compared to the other option of the ILP, it seemed to be the best choice. It worried him to see a Scotland corrupted by the influence of less savory individuals such as communists. The Marshal after thinking for a few moments decided that the best course of action was to support the SNP. Wimberley, after talking to some of the other members of the junta, decided that he would need to make a public announcement saying that he intends to support the SNP.\n\nWimberley had decided to make the speech the following day after talking to the other members and writing it into the late hours of the night. While it didn't need to be perfect, it needed to sound convincing enough to the Scottish public so that would support the actions. However this was just a ploy. While it seemed that all of the parties in Scotland could have a chance of running and winning, it was set in stone that the SNP would win. Not the ILP who could tear down the foundations that Wimberley had set. He then walked out and started his speech to the public."

We had overthrown the Unionists due to their actions. They had threatened the foundation of Scottish freedom and independence just to attempt to reunite the Isles and take away something we fought so hard for against the English. While it may seem like this was an unlawful action, I will ask you this. What would you do if your son was sent to England to die for a cause that they don't see as noble? What if they didn't come back and all? This question was the one that had made us take action."\n\n"Many of us could not agree with the actions of the Unionist Party. Why would we send our men to die for a cause that we didn't agree with on both a personal level and patriotic one? For these reasons, we had to overthrow the Unionists and attempt to preserve Scotland's independence. Now I will say this. I am fully committed to returning Scotland back to its democratic roots. However this will take time and dedication from all Scots to prepare for this. I do not have any fear in this, we Scots have had an independent and strong country for nearly twenty years. We will stand strong."\n\nThe crowd roared in approval. The other remembers of the junta had been standing behind Wimberley, clapping with approval.

The result was fresh, young and resolutely patriotic.\n\nA poster with bold font and bright colors. "Join the Heroic Army who saved your country." it said. "Fight against cruelty, cowardice and ineptitude. Join the ranks of the victors." The sentence was followed by an image of two young men with bright smiles on their faces. They were both heavily armed and striking a dynamic pose. The image exulted power, strength, health and virility. In big letters you could read "Join the army and learn next to the saviours of the nation! Join their ranks and leave your own mark in history. Make your country proud! Be the next hero! Be the greatest man you can be! Be the proud soldier we know you can be!"\n\nWimberley himself felt somewhat moved by the image. The next part of the recruitment campaign would be to send their most handsome soldiers and most attractive nurses to go and talk with the population.

Not after all the fighting and killing. She couldn't celebrate those men. She was however very excited for the city fair. It was her biggest contract in months. Everything had to be perfect. Her reputation, her florist shop and maybe even her life depended on it. She didn't want to think about the consequences of failing an event of this significance. She was preparing flowers bouquets and centerpieces. Wreath for the doors and crown of flowers for the women. Headpiece for the children and baskets full of flowers to put on the stage.

The Edinburgh Times was one of them.\n\nAs he flipped through the paper, he read the text on it. It was shorter than the issues before due to the limited amount of news inside Scotland at the moment. He noticed on the second page that there was a full page recruitment ad for the Armed Forces of Scotland. It was in full color with all the patriotic colors of Scotland. Luke rolled his eyes and flipped the page. He then came upon an actual news story. It was a transcript and a small story that had been written about the Marshal's speech. Luke's life has basically remained the same since the Marshal took power a couple of weeks ago. He read the transcript slowly, curling his lip once he read that Wimberley had decided to step up and take over as the head of government. His eyes widened even more when he saw that Parliament was being dissolved until the new elections. It made a bit of sense to Luke, they had basically been sitting in Holyrood since the Armed Forces had taken power. He was relieved to finally read that elections would return.\n\nHe read the rest of the newspaper and was bored with it by the time he reached the eleventh page.

They'll visit for rest and relaxation, they'll do business across the border, they'll live over in the other country, they'll fall in love with each other and marry. They'll inevitably be on a close level with us, and we will be with them.\n\n"So I started thinking, we both have a large degree of familiarity with the other nation's culture, history, and customs. We both speak English, and can easily communicate with anybody from down there. And now we're both friendly with the other government. Why not just make it easy for everyone to do what they want to do and allow them to become citizens easier?"\n\nThe elder MacCormick was intrigued. "Explain, lad."\n\n"You see, if a person from England wants to move up to Scotland, they get some of the requirements waived or limited before they become a dual citizen. We'll assume they have a lot of familiarity with Scotland already, and they don't have to live here as long as other immigrants. Dual citizenship will be instituted, and any child born to a english person and a scottish person gets it automatically. That'll make it easy for all those mixed nationality parents."\n\n"I see your point. But we'll want England to..."\n\n"We ask them to do the same thing.

That is why the Scottish Ministry of the Interior has made this handy pamphlet to explain the agreement recently made between England and Scotland.\n\nNATURALIZATION: Previous requirements of Scottish citizenship were for the person to be over eighteen years old, of upstanding character, having lived in Scotland for five years with fewer than the number of allowed days absent. The immigrant must also have passed an English language and cultural literacy test. Under the agreement with England, an immigrant from England will have the English language section of the test waived, as well as being granted a modified cultural test that does not put as much emphasis on historical events or figures. They will also be able to apply for citizenship with three years of residency, while also having the same amount of allowed absences.\n\nDUAL CITIZENSHIP: A person who meets the qualifications of citizenship for both Scotland and England will no longer have to renounce their citizenship of one nation. They will instead be considered a "dual national" and retain the rights granted to them by both nations. Citizens will no longer be asked to renounce their previous nationality during a naturalization ceremony.\n\nLEGAL RIGHTS: Dual nationals are granted the full legal rights afforded to any other national in Scotland. They will be allowed to work or live in either nation without need for a visa, however, any non-dual citizens accompanying them would need a visa. Dual nationals must follow the laws of the nation in which they reside. If they are convicted of a crime, they will not be eligible to be deported to the other nation the are a citizen of.\n\nENGLISH CITIZENSHIP: Qualifications for English citizenship are roughly the same as in Scotland. However, one must reside in England for a period of time before they qualify to be naturalized. One cannot obtain English citizenship while residing in Scotland. Some residents of Scotland who qualify as an English Refugee In Scotland (ERIS) may already be English citizens. For more information, we request you contact the English embassy in Edinburgh."

A visitor had been coming from and going to Germany a lot, specifically company headquarters in Oberkochen. This was not unheard of, but the short stays of the visitor aroused suspicions that they were sending something back to Germany.\n\nJohn McDermot remembered the briefing as he stood in the hallway, looking out for anyone who may stumble upon the operation that Henderson and Stuart were doing in the director's office. He was thankful they did not need to use force to get into the building, as the Scottish custodian was more than willing to help them out for a few pounds. Now, he would just keep a lookout for any early arrivals. Not that he expected any, the daily operations of the office were well documented and they wouldn't expect company for quite a while.\n\nJohn knew what Henderson and Stuart were doing in the office. He had been a part of operations like this plenty of times before. They would divide the room in two so no man would search the same thing twice. Then, they would go search everything. Every drawer, every book, every window, behind every painting, the panels on the walls, everything. No matter how innocent, search it, they were told, because a quick search is worse than no search at all. And they took great care to make it look like they were never there.\n\nAn hour and thirty five minutes after the search began, Henderson and Stuart walked out of the office. A quick shake of Stuart's head told the whole story. Nothing unusual was there. No evidence of corporate espionage. And the visitor, it turned out, was relaying company information to Edinburgh, and not from. It seemed that Carl Zeiss, at least, was playing fair."

John McDermot's team was to make sure they hadn't stolen any from Scotland.\n\nAfter entering through a ventilation duct in the dead of night, the team had made their way to the head office for IG Farben's Scottish subsidiary. Stuart kept watch as John picked the lock on the door. He was having trouble, but he still kept calm as he worked the lock. A broken lock would surely alert the Germans that something had happened last night, he reminded himself. Finally, he heard the satisfying click and opened the door.\n\nPointing his light inside, the first thing that caught his attention was a paper package shaped like a bottle on the desk of the director. It appeared like it had been placed by a visitor in the time between the director leaving and the closing of operations. John motioned for Henderson to work on the other side of the room as he walked up and took the bottle out of the package.\n\nA bottle of red wine. American, from Napa Valley, California. Nothing too unusual about that, but the writing on the inside of the wrapping paper? The one that looked like notes on a chemical production process? That warranted further investigation. He called Henderson over, who took a look, and silently nodded, confirming John's analysis. But John had a suspicion there was more to the bottle.\n\nAs Henderson held a torch steady, John took a knife and worked his way around the edge of the label, peeling it back slightly. He only went a short way around it before finding microfilm. If the paper had the process, he thought, then this film must have the recipe. Then he popped open the cork, finding a vial full of a chemical that wasn't red wine attached to it.\n\nOne package, three pieces of evidence, and irrefutable proof of corporate espionage."

They were granted a visa so they could conduct market research and make contact with potential Scottish distributors. Duck's case wasn't unheard of, and they lost our attention for a good while. However, recent evidence has caused us to reevaluate Duck, and we have concluded that Duck is a possible agent working for the German Reich.\n\nDuck popped back up on our radar when they had purchased some ham radio equipment from a store in Glasgow. Local authorities were tipped off about the sale, and found it suspicious that Duck had not applied for a radio operator's license before the purchase of the equipment. It was then passed on to us, which led us to begin surveillance of Duck throughout their normal routine.\n\nDuck's career requires them to make constant trips around Scotland, one that Duck prefers to make by car. Duck's travels near several important military and civilian installations on these trips, such as ports and the defensive structures on the English border, allowing them ample opportunity to observe the happenings at these locations. We cannot discount the possibility that Duck is using their job as cover to gather information about these potential targets.\n\nThe evidence we have raises the possibility that Duck is either a Swiss national working as an unregistered agent for the German government, or a German who entered Scotland under false pretenses. They have been working in Scotland since that time to scout out possible targets, and have acquired radio equipment to ease the transmission of that information.\n\nOf course, none of this is definitive, and Duck could really be a Swiss national in Scotland for a legitimate purpose, entirely unrelated to the purchase of the equipment.

 sco_snp.18.desc:0 "Subject Plaza is an employee of the Scottish Foreign Ministry, and has been for the past 10 years, since graduating college. With only a few minor incidents, they have otherwise been a model employee. However, we now have reason to believe that he has begun to work as an informant for the English government.\n\nRecently, Plaza has made several visits to the English Embassy in Edinburgh. We cannot determine the nature of these visits, but they are out of character for Plaza, who has not made any previous visits to the embassy. More worrying is that he was reported to have been seen with a known employee of the embassy in a public setting.\n\nPlaza may be meeting with English Embassy staff for any number of reasons, most of which would not compromise the security of Scotland. But embassy staff are known to be an easy way to insert government intelligence agents into a foreign country where they can establish spy cells. This was a favorite tactic of the prewar MI6, and it's likely England has learned from their predicessor's playbook.\n\nWe have been looking for a possible motive to explain Plaza's possible disaffection towards Scotland. Plaza hasn't expressed any radical political positions at work. Their spouse is an English exile, and they could be an agent of the English government as well. However, the English government may be holding up an exit visa for one of the spouses relatives instead in an effort to coerce Plaza's cooperation. This would explain the embassy visits, and why Plaza's spouse has never been flagged as a spy.\n\nAt this point, we cannot recommend a course of action to take for this situation. However, if the government desires it, we could arrest Plaza immediately and charge them with aiding English intelligence."

 sco_snp.19.desc:0 "The Young Britain Party is a nationalist group that is dedicated to the eventual reformation of the United Kingdom. It is currently active in Scotland, and has an active roster of about twenty members. At the request of the Interior Minister, we have carried out an infiltration and threat assessment of the organization.\n\nWe inserted two undercover agents to join the group and monitor their meetings, which numbered an average of eight party members per event. Reports from them make pointing out the exact political alignment of the group hard to pinpoint. Many are supporters of the English resistance group HMMLR, but there seems to be a deep divide between those who support the more left leaning elements and supporters of Claude Auchinleck and the right wing SAS. One member opined that the Collaborators had elements that could offer a favorable deal to both English and Scottish alike, but they were ostracised.\n\nMany of the Party members are English exiles, though there are some native Scottish residents as well. Many are members of the Union Party, though some are members of the ILP and are vocal that the UP supporters are idiotic in their support. Others have no affiliation other than to the Rangers Football Club, apparently.\n\nHow they plan to recreate the United Kingdom is also up for debate. One or two of the more radical members are vocal about taking over the government in a coup, but this is a small minority. The vast majority of the Young Britain Party believe protests and supporting Unionist candidates is the way to go, though the small size of the group makes any large scale disruptions unlikely. Some of the more elderly party members have suggested a sustained letter-writing campaign.\n\nConclusion: Despite the beliefs of some of its members, the Young Britain Party is too small and too paralyzed by political infighting to pose a threat to Scotland, and it's unlikely to pose one in the near future as long as it is home to the same group of misfits it currently has.."

We are pleased to report that we have a recent breakthrough and have successfully begun to get a trickle of information from the Embassy.\n\nAgent Pioneer, one of our assets, has gotten semi-regular access to the facility by forming a relationship with a member of the ambassador's household staff. This allows them to make visits to the embassy grounds, and pick up on tidbits of information that are talked about by the staff. It isn't a perfect or constant source of intelligence, but it gives us a much clearer picture of German foreign policy and goals in Scotland, as well as in the OFN.\n\nOur next steps for Easy Chair is to share this information with the CIA in the hopes they could use the information to create a more complete picture. We are debating whether to expand this program by having Pioneer sabotage or damage an appliance, allowing us to insert agents disguised as workmen to install covert listening devices in the embassy.\n\nWe will keep you updated in the case of any further developments in the Operation."

Now under our management."\n\n"You mind telling me why we are in such a remote place, General?" said Wiemberly.\n\n"Well, sir, the OFN has been looking for a place to conduct mountain training for a while now, and the Ministry of Defense thought we should step up, both as a matter of international commitment, and national pride. After all, why not have the best mountain warfare school in the world here in Scotland?" The car turned onto the approach road.\n\n"So, the MoD first wanted to use Garelochhead, but the Army had concerns that it would be too much to run the program on top of our regular training duties. Fortunately, this resort out here in Lochaber had some financial difficulties, so we swept in and bought it and the surrounding areas, and then started turning it into Glencoe Training Area."\n\nThe car stopped at the Camp parking lot, and the passengers got out. "The plan is simple, Marshal," Speakman continued. "We get some of the best mountain instructors from across the OFN and base them here. We develop a curriculum where the trainees learn the ins and outs of mountain warfare and winter operations. Then, we rotate OFN units through, teach them what we know, and everyone involved gets to learn about alpine warfare. That's what we are doing out here, sir. It isn't for the closeness of the pubs, that's for sure."\n\nThe Marshal nodded."

No, the upper body is down the hill, you bloody fool, did I fucking stutter?

And it didn't have any snow either, because it was in bloody April. We can go up eleven times that in elevation, and if you say 'Vimy Ridge' one more time you useless sods, you will run that course!"\n\n"Come on laddies! The huns have three times the number of mountain troops we do! They'll be coming into these mountains any day now! And how are we going to beat them? By being three times better than them! And that means training three times harder than they do! So pick up the bloody pace! Up and down the hill before breakfast!"\n\nA new school of mountain warfare has opened up in the Scottish Highlands. The instructors there take great pleasure in subjecting the soldiers sent there to a world-class course in alpine operations.

I was raised on stories of legendary scientists, politicians, kings, generals, and admirals. I don't think you could go back then and find anyone who wasn't proud to be British.\n\n"Do you remember why we became an independent nation in the first place? It wasn't because we had finally had enough of the United Kingdom and all their 'atrocities', as some would have you believe. It was because we didn't want to follow the United Kingdom down into the depths of Nazi opression. Our ties weren't choking us, rather they were dragging us down into the depths.\n\n"Now, we have in England a government that has freed themselves from the oppression of the axis and stands amongst the free nations of the world. They are no longer a syringe ready to inject fascism into our lands. They are now our greatest ally. And they act like it! They are eager to trade, eager to talk, eager to help, eager to do all the things they once did. They are our friends, and are going to be forevermore.\n\n"A lot of people are thinking like me, that we should start thinking about sticking together with them.

But they didn't.\n\n"Instead, that Macmillan chap ended up in charge, and he told all those fascists down there to bugger off, he tells the huns to bugger off, he tells Edwardd to bugger off, and he gets really friendly with the OFN as well. And I haven't heard so many bad things about him on the domestic front, either. They're now setting up a real democracy down there. And they are going away from that state run industry nonsense.\n\n"At this point, we all have to realize those reformists down there are great, both for the English and for us. And we have a lot in common. We both want a democratic government. We both want the huns as far away from the island as possible. And we are both eager to make a deal with the Americans to do it. It seems that our interests and ideals align for the first time in a while.\n\n"So it's logical that if our goals align, then we should work together to secure the isles from a return of fascism. And that means an alliance, certainly. But it also means that a much closer relationship wouldn't be disagreeable. Far from it.

Churches in remote villages, schools in small towns, libraries in the suburbs, and community centers in the big cities were ready to handle the massive amount of expected voters. And turnout was high, more than other elections. Lines for the polling places spilled out onto the sidewalks, and they only grew bigger as the day went on. Each of these individuals would be given a ballot, and asked one question; "should Scotland and England join together as a single country?"\n\nAt 10 PM, the polls shut. Only those who were already in line could be allowed to vote after that. Those who weren't in line were glued to their television sets, waiting for news. Some exit polls had come out, but nobody could know for sure how things were going to go.\n\nSlowly, the numbers came in.

What would happen then?\n\nBut most didn't care. For a long time England had been working to recover from the oppression and barbarity of the Nazis. They had thrown the Germans off the island.

We haven't had the most friendly relationship with England, it is true. And our nations have had extreme conflict in the past, and a highly contentious relationship in recent history. However, it would be foolish of us to forget that Union with England did, in fact, bring us some tangible benefits.\n\nUnion suddenly opened up administrative positions for Scots across the empire, as well as giving the Scottish economy a massive boost. Raw goods from the empire built up the industrial base in Glasgow and Edinburgh. And let's not forget that together we built one of the largest empires on earth. Our armed forces stopped Napoleon and Wilhelm from ever setting foot on our island. Sure, we couldn't stop the Germans, but England lost far more than we ever did, and their sacrifices tired the Germans just enough that they had no choice but to leave us alone as the last remnant of democracy on the isle.\n\nWe won't look at our history with rose-tinted glasses and say the English were entirely benevolent.

The amount the government had put forward was far below the actual worth of the company, and made the takeover unlawful, according to Muir. He also said the takeover would doubtlessly lead to massive job losses, which would affect both urban cities and rural communities hard.\n\nGovernment lawyer Felix MacKie had a different view of the situation, however. In his argument for the defense, he said the Scottish Railway had engaged in price fixing, as well as anticompetitive behavior. The actions the company took made it necessary for the government to intervene for the good of the people, said MacKie. The defense also cast doubt on the effects of the takeover, arguing the company was rich enough to absorb the losses that would result from the lack of compensation. As for the job losses, the government argued that former Scottish Railway employees would be hired by them to operate the newly nationalized rail lines.\n\nThe justices have given no hint how they would rule in this situation, and many court watchers are expecting a close decision."

It is a series of cases of people not having enough, with different causes and different levels of severity. It is also a case of some people having too much.\n\nIt may seem paradoxical, but extreme concentrated wealth is exacerbating the welfare situation in Scotland. The rich are holding onto far more than they can spend, and take much of what they earn out of economic circulation. They also spend more money on housing and real estate than poorer Scots, outpricing the needy out of the housing system.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the English Diaspora also make them more likely to be poor. Many of them had to leave whatever wealth they had when they fled to Scotland. When they came here, they also had few, if any, connections that would allow them to get work. A cold attitude by many Scots toward these refugees also hurts their prospects.\n\nMuch is made about poverty in the cities. Depressed slums and beggars are everywhere and easy to see if you go down the wrong street. But less noticeable, yet still bad, is the poverty in the more remote and rural areas of Scotland. These communities are often reliant on a single good or industry, and aren't diversified enough to handle a decrease in demand for that good. These communities, due to their size and remoteness, also lach the education and healthcare systems present in the big cities, further hurting them.\n\nWe can try to alleviate some of these problems. Increasing taxes on the rich will help curb inequality and give us more funds to work for the welfare of the people. Job and education programs targeting the English population specifically will help us with the disproportionate poverty they experience. And antipoverty education programs in the country will help the workers there develop necessary skills for a modern economy. This may not solve the problem entirely, but the important thing is that we're trying."

They live in worse housing, eat a worse diet, work worse jobs, and have a worse future than their neighbors. A lot of them are just above the poverty line, and a disproportionate number are below it. Even with the surge in emigration following HMMLR's victory down south, many still remain up north, determined to live in Scotland and continue the lives they have spent twenty years trying to rebuild.\n\nImproving this should be our top priority. The ILP has long believed that nobody should suffer from the ravages of capitalism, especially those that fled from fascism down south. We will give funds to businesses in the English areas, or those set up by the English, to encourage investment and job growth in their areas.

They argue that the seizing of their tracks in England was done unlawfully, and that if the defendents held onto the tracks, it would be "tantamount to punishing them for the Nazi invasion," in the words of their lawyer, Jan Grant.\n\nHowever, the lawyers for the other railroad companies have a different version of events. They contend that when the LMS moved into Scotland, they wrote off their rails in England by becoming Scottish Railways. They did not want the rails to remain unused as they are critical to several communities in the east of England, so they made a deal with the collaborator English government to operate them. "The Scottish Railway abandoned them, and we paid the government for their lease to use them," said Archibald Scott, a lawyer representing Southern Railway, one of the defendants.\n\nLegal experts are watching this case closely, as it is the first case where the new Supreme Court of England will rule on the rights of refugees to claim property seized by the axis during the collaborationist government.

 sco_ilp.31.desc:0 "London (Reuters) - A recent ruling by the English Supreme Court against a railroad company who fled from England during the Second World War was attacked by refugee groups around the world due to its repercussions for English attempting to reclaim property seized by the collaborationists after the war.\n\nThe ruling by the English Supreme Court concerned the seizure of track left behind by the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway when they fled to Scotland during the German advance. The rails had been taken by the occupation forces and handed out to several other railroad companies. The LMS went to court in order to get them back, arguing the seizure and distribution of the lines was unlawful.\n\nHowever, the court, in its majority opinion, said the government had been right to take the property, citing the needs of the communities on the lines. The court also agreed that the licences to operate the lines were purchased by the other railroad companies at a fair price, making the transaction legal under English law.\n\nWhile some in the railroad community praised the ruling, the reaction to it from around the world was resoundingly negative, with protests reported in England, Scotland, and Canada. "The English refugee community fled due to the oppression and persecution of the nazis and the collaborationist government," said head of the English Veterans Society Robert Money, a prominent exile group in Scotland. "This ruling by the supreme court makes the effects of that persecution permanent. It is painful for those who were targeted to see that this new England has no interest in making amends for the crimes of the old.""

 sco_ilp.32.desc:0 ""So that's the proposal," said Scottish diplomat Craig MacLennan, struggling to be heard over the sounds of the Newcastle bar. "We sign a free trade agreement. No more taxes on our goods, and no more waiting around. We just give everyone the once-over to see if they're bringing in prostitutes or hashish, and then the trucks are on the way. No more absurdly priced goods, they'll be offered at the same price in Inverness as in Dover, no matter where they come from."\n\n"And that brings us both together, but more importantly, it makes us both a lot of money," said English diplomat Gabe Shaw as he took a drink. "I see why Edinburgh would want this."\n\n"And there's a second part," said MacLennan. "We both start a program to encourage the other to trade with us. Open the door with the trade deal, and give a little push with the program, and we'll be making money and coming together a lot faster."\n\nShaw thought it over. "That sounds good, but London might have different plans. They might still go for it, though. And it should make this Scotch cheaper, too.""

 sco_ilp.33.desc:0 " "I have to admit that I had a negative opinion of the English for quite a while now," college student Fern Campbell said to her friend Amber McMillan as they sat at the Aberdeen train station. "I mean, while I grew up, all we heard was that the English down south were friends with the Germans. They would also be working with the Nazis to finish the job and take us over as well. I guess that wasn't true, wasn't it? At least enough of the English had it with the fascists and threw them out. They weren't all bad, and I guess they aren't bad anymore."\n\nOdhran Gunn expressed a similar sentiment of forgiveness when he lay with his wife Ruby in bed in their house in Paisley. "I heard all the time from the politicians that the UK was terrible," he said, "but when I think back on that time, I don't have any terrible memories about it. I liked seeing the Union Jack everywhere, I sand 'God Save the King,' I don't recall having any problems with us being together with England. At least back then, we felt safe and unbeatable. And I suppose with how much we fought with each other in the past, we'd end up in some sort of Union anyway."\n\nDown in a pub in Leeds, an Englishman named Conor Murray had a positive view of the Scottish. "Well, you think about it," he said to his co-worker from the hospital Myles Saunders, "and the only reason they wanted to bolt the Union was because the Union already had been taken over by the huns. It wasn't a stab in the back, it was clear that we were going to lose and they tried to salvage freedom for at least part of the island. And can you blame them? A union under fucking Edward? Thousands decided they'd live homeless in Glasgow instead, and they were English! I could only imagine what the Scots were feeling when they heard that shit."\n\nAcross the island, the English and the Scottish are putting away their animosity they held towards each other. They are forgiving each other for the offences that have been committed in the past, and understanding the intentions for why they were committed. In doing so, decades of hostility is now evaporating, and Britain is moving forward toward a future where the people of the isle can stand united."

 uob.1.t:0 "Capital Issues"
 uob.1.desc:0 "With the establishment of the Union of Britain, a nation of true equals rather than a puppet to the interests of the English like the old United Kingdom was, many questions have come up for how the Union is to be organized. A large portion of the Scottish representatives are in favour of Edinburgh being established as the new capital to harken a new era for all the oppressed peoples of the British Isles, and if Scotland happened to benefit it would merely be an added bonus.\n\nThe English participants in the talks are in favour of London remaining the capital of a united Britain, not for any benefit to the English of course, they insist it is merely a matter of continuity of government and fairly representing the largest city in the country. However, a third faction has emerged.\n\nComprised of a mix of all delegates, this new faction insists that Nottingham would be an ideal location for the new Union capital, as a midway point between Scotland and England it would be a compromise worth considering, but there is also the added bonus of a small and insular capital that would not hold too much influence at the expense of the rest of the country. In the end however, a choice must be made."
 uob.1.a:0 "Edinburgh will will do."
 uob.1.d:0 "London has always been at the centre of Britain and shall remain so."

 uob.2.t:0 "The First of Many"
 uob.2.desc:0 "The Collaborationist forces are now dead and gone, Britain is now again whole, if perhaps a little less under the yoke of the English than they might like. But if Britain had one good legacy worth keeping it was the electoral system that it pioneered. And so like beetles from the woodwork political parties have emerged to contest these new elections.\n\nConservatism is an ideology looked at by many with suspicion due to first Tory and then Royal Party collaboration with the German occupier. But the actions of Claude Auchinleck have redeemed the idea in the minds of some, and out of the ashes of the UP and the right faction of HMMLR the New Conservative Party has emerged as one of the principle challengers in the Union elections.\n\nLeftism on the other hand distinguished itself fighting against the fascists from almost the beginning, but the fractured nature of the Left Resistance did not lead them to victory in the English Civil War, and in the aftermath of liberation the United Labour Party has come into being. A grand union of communists, socialists and social democrats of all sorts dedicated to progress and a free Britain.\n\nThe Liberals were a dying force in politics long before the Germans made a point of purging them out of the British political system where they could, and what has come to call itself the Liberal Party bears little connection to that which it was named after, being described by some as the English Branch of the SNP, though undeniably some English elements unsatisfied with the other options have hitched their horses to the Liberal Party train as well. But come one come all, the elections are set to begin and the competition shall be fierce. The Union of Britain shall decide its fate one way or another not by the sword, but by the ballot box."

 uob.3.desc:0 "Elizabeth of Windsor stepped off the Liverpool docks to a swell of cheering supporters, yet she did not return to the land of her birth as Queen or traitor, instead she returned as a simple citizen as per the arrangement with the government of the Union of Britain. A staunch opponent of the collaborationist government, much unlike her not overly lamented Uncle, The Union of Britain recognises her contributions to the freedom of the isles from Fascism and as such was willing to come to terms when she questioned whether the house of Windsor could reemerge from exile.\n\nThe House of Windsor shall retain the Windsor estate and some associated lands for the income and maintenance of said property, all other property and lands that were once attached to the crown would be confiscated in return for a pension to be paid to the house of Windsor. Citizen Elizabeth was reportedly reluctant to take the proffered deal and some elements of the government were reluctant to make it, but the threat of fascism and the scars left on England have overridden the concerns of both parties.\n\nIt is not completely over and done with of course, many English parties do seek the restoration of the monarchy as an institution whilst the more republican elements of the Union dislike the Windsors presence in Britain at all. But the peace is being kept, and should not the former royalty have as much opportunity to be citizens as all the rest?"

They would have incorporated Scotland forcefully if they had their way, and in our victory we have had the opportunity to create a new and more equal Britain, rather than a series of puppets dancing on the strings of England.\n\nYet in the upcoming elections there is little unity to speak of. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party squabble over the mining towns, the English National Party skirts the lines of legality whilst campaigning in the cities. In this election there are but three real contenders. The New Conservatives, descendants of the right wing of the SNP aligned with moderate members of English establishment. The Independent Labour Party, absorbing the right flank of the socialists and what social democrats remain, and the Liberals, not the old Liberals of English fame but a coalition of the SNP core and the less objectionable English politicians.\n\nWhomst shall emerged victorious is unknown, but there can be only one, and the fate of the Union of Britain shall rest upon their shoulders.

Yet the eyes of millions do not deceive them and Scottish troops, for the uniforms of the Union of Britain have yet to be issued in great number, occupy all the major urban centres.\n\nMany perceived this as yet another invasion, the scots and germans being increasingly seen as similar unwanted occupiers, especially in the south near London. Riots have broken out in these regions, not usually the murderous variety but looting has been common along with the vandalism of scottish owned establishments. Some pro English figures have sought to take advantage of these outpourings of emotions but the security forces have been able to step in and detain the majority of those vultures. It looks to be an especially tumultuous time for the Union of Britain, but all great things must crawl before they learn to walk. And once something can walk running is but a few steps away. "

In the case of the Union of Britain whilst the English are not what one might call tinder their anger burns bright just the same.\n\nScotland defeating their old overlords was not supposed to happen. Scotland pushing back into the English heartland was unfathomable to most, and Scotland establishing a new union in which England was not at the fore? To say the least the pride of many an Englishmen was tickled. Many citizens do not want England to be ruled by a foreign power, which Scotland is considered nowadays, and this latent anger combined with the perceived flaws inherent to the Union of Britain has caused the major cities to erupt in a conflagration of riots, vandalism and looting.\n\nThe response of the Union government is undoubtedly going to be to put down these riots, but some ask whether this makes them as bad as the old United Kingdom? Those involved can only pray that is not so."

Whilst one party did emerge, for lack of a better word, victorious in the elections, this did not extend to an outright majority. Thus in order to get anything passed through parliament there must, by necessity, be some degree of compromise. And in a political landscape as riven as that of the Union of Britain this has stoked some unfortunate tensions.\n\nCommunists and nationalists, Scots and Englishmen, indeed Scots and other Scots have all taken to blaming one another on some level for the dysfunction. In most areas this has resolved itself peaceably. But in some regions, especially in England, violence has erupted in the form of politically or nationalisticly motivated mobs taking on one another in the streets. Whilst all sides have taken to the old sport of ganging up on what fascists show their faces, this does represent a worrying token of what future the Union of Britain may have to look forward too."

The party is not truly united by any ideology except nationalism and anti unionist sentiments, so it should come to no surprise that many have taken issue with the authority of the local law enforcement.\n\nClashes are uncommon but vicious, with the beat of truncheons and the yells of angry men echoing into the night like banshees, and in the English south especially mobs of the ENP have engaged police en mass. To little success of course, like every other fringe group they are simply not capable of forming a cohesive enough structure to effect real damage. All the same though, they represent a concerningly large number of the English populace."

From Edinburgh to Inverness the more radical nationalists have been voicing their discontent at the reemergence of Britain, even if Scotland is thought by many to be the leading party.\n\nBut for all the vulgar showings there is a deep rooted fear even amongst many moderates that the whole business with the Union of Britain could backfire very badly if handled wrong. Questions are asked about whether the English were truly voluntary in entering the Union and certainly some question if the English want to stay.\n\nBut even as the flag of blue and white is waved in the streets the Union government is dismissive of these concerns, stating that the Union of Britain is the last and best hope for peace amongst the isles."

Initially reported merely as a formality, the Union government took an interest when a former member of HMMLR, now bereft of a leg following the Civil War, revealed that the pit had been a weapons cache for the local militia, subsequently abandoned at the wars end.\n\nForgotten by most, but it would seem not forgotten by all. Forensic analysis has determined that the cache was only disturbed a week or so before being discovered, but that still leaves many places the diggers could have taken the weapons, especially if they used vehicles to do the moving. An alert is being posted to all nearby villages to be on the alert but the police are not hopeful about the likelihood of finding the cache now.\n\nThe former HMMLR member, when asked on what weapons the cache actually contained, was silent for a time before replying.

The cause of the Union of Britain.\n\nFor the moment however this will have to wait some time whilst we organise the new military structures and fill in the ranks, but the HMMLR will certainly be reliable candidates when we need to look for recruits."

The previous government it would seem was, perhaps not shockingly, hideously unpopular with the average Englishmen and the perceived return of not only a united isles but a democratic state of being to England has given us some good favour with the English everywhere. Even in London our troops have earnt themselves a begrudging respect from the citizenry as thanks for our liberation of their fair city, and the sight of highlanders once more patrolling buckingham palace is a refreshing call back to better times for many. But everywhere we are, even if not greeted with a smile at least with a respectful nod."

In Hyde Park now sit twenty great marble slabs, none taller than the other and all covered with names. The names of soldiers who fought for what they knew was right, the names of civilians who gave shelter to the HMMLR and Left Resistance partisans and paid the price, of men and women, communists and capitalists, Scots, Welsh and English alike, of martyrs to the cause of freedom.\n\nEach slab is covered from end to end, and the government has several additions ready as new names come in by the day. But surrounded by an honour guard, the people of Britain can look for the names of those they lost. Sons who never returned home, and fathers who took up arms to protect their children. Daughters who fought for what they believed in, and mothers who never gave up the struggle.\n\nThe opening ceremony is a somber one, but those who remain do not complain.

Most interviewed citizens seem more concerned that the political establishment may not be capable of compromising to govern effectively than they are concerned about the legitimacy of the elections themselves, suggesting that this new order may be close to cementing its roots in the public consciousness.\n\nOverall, the elections have come and gone with little enough fuss, the question is whether this will stay the case in the long term."

Auchinleck admitted that the United Kingdom of old which he had sought to restore was not without its faults, and that perhaps this new ideal of Britain could succeed where his own fight had failed.\n\nIn the days after the speech, Auchinleck gave another statement announcing his retirement from public life given the toll his years in prison had taken upon him. The Union government in turn made a small public notice that Auchinleck, like all members of the HMMLR and Left Resistance crippled in the fight against the collaborationists, would receive a government pension for the rest of his natural life."

 SCO.7011.t:0 "Off-Site Convention"
 SCO.7011.desc:0 "They're leaving again," said one agent to the other as he snapped a couple photos of the people leaving the headquarters of the Scottish Army and getting into the same car. The men they were trailing were Major-Generals in the Scottish Army, division level commanders just prominent enough to be of interest to the Scottish government.\n\n"I suppose they'll go to that place again," said the other agent. "Third time this week. I mean, it is suspicious enough that we would be assigned to trail them. What are they up to?"\n\n"They could be having lunch, I guess."\n\n"Or, they are actively conspiring against the government in a secret facility. They're leaving a building where they could be overheard. They are meeting up in an area they control. We don't know why they are meeting, or what they are discussing. We need to get more people on this, this could be a prelude to a coup."\n\n"It could be," said the other agent as he thought it over. "But they just as well could be getting lunch."

 SCO.70122.t:0 "Home Improvement"
 SCO.70122.desc:0 "The mansion in Edinburgh had always been concerned about crime in the area. Anyone could break in and steal property, or even worse, spy on the meetings that the owner was having with his fellow generals. Thus, the household was extremely diligent in keeping their alarm system up to date. So when several workers from the alarm company showed up to conduct maintenance, they were allowed in without any questions.\n\nThe workers went around the sides of the house, checking the windows and doorways. They checked the wiring of the burglar alarms, and made sure the systems were working well. Most of the system was in good working order, but some maintenance had to be done. Two window alarms were replaced, and a door alarm was upgraded. The workers were nice and professional, and the affair was over shortly.\n\nUnbeknownst to the homeowners, several other devices were left in the household. These devices would relay what went on inside the building to a nearby van. There, the government of Scotland would hear exactly what went on inside the home. In an ironic twist, the mansion's obsession with secrecy allowed the perfect opportunity to breach it."

We are pleased to say that it has. The bugs are working, undiscovered, and providing information.\n\nSo far, we have confirmed that the generals in question do have regular meetings inside the building. They talk about a wide variety of subjects at the moment, ranging from lunch to politics. We have successfully identified the generals by voice as well. We are able to get recordings of their conversations, and provide transcripts as well.\n\nIt will take a while to gather evidence for this case this way. It is best to wait and let any treachery reveal itself. We will record all of it, and pass on any notefull information from our investigation. In a few days, we will hopefully be able to get back to you with a firm conclusion for Operation Mordecai."

They had flavors like cherry, or vanilla, or orange, it was nice.\n\nGeneral E: I had one of those too! It was pretty good. But it's not an official product, right?\n\nGeneral C: No, it is not.\n\nGeneral A: Those soda companies should put the flavor in the bottle before it leaves the factory. So at the store you could get Coke, or Cherry Coke, or Vanilla Coke. It would be a nice variety of choice.\n\nGeneral C: Perhaps.\n\n(Silence, with sounds of chewing.)\n\nGeneral B: That looks good.

"There's been a security issue with one of our officers. General Miles has the details."\n\n"Thank you, sir," said General Eric Miles. "Yesterday afternoon, one of the division commanders found a bugging device hidden in his toilet. He dutifully informed us, and we had a group of military police search his residence. They found these-" he put a small plastic sandwich bag with several devices on the table, "-and are trying to find more. The general has been moved to a separate location, while our men continue the search."\n\nThe Security Minister recognized the bugs instantly. He tried to play dumb. "That's a horrifying security breach! Who is behind it? The Germans? The English? Possibly even the Burgundians?"\n\n"We did some research of that ourselves," said General Miles, "and found these models of wiretapping devices are used by the Scotland Police."\n\nSilence.\n\n"Now, minister," said Wimberrley, leaning in, "just what the hell is the Scottish government trying to pull?"

 SCO.7016.t:0 "Then, Now, Forever"
 SCO.7016.desc:0 "Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, five generals leave their desks at 11:30 in the morning. They stop their work, put on their coats, inform their secretaries to hold their calls, and go downstairs. The five generals meet up in the lobby of army headquarters, then go to the parking lot. They crowd into a single car, and drive away.\n\nThe generals park in the driveway of a mansion in Edinburgh. They then go inside, with bags of food ordered from a restaurant they visited along the way. Inside, they hold a lunchtime meeting, which lasts an hour. The contents of the meeting are unknown, as is what they are discussing. Then, they go back to the car and drive back to work.\n\nThis has been going on for quite a while now. Initially, it seemed like it would set off alarm bells in the federal government. And it did, causing an investigation. But this investigation has stopped, for one reason or another. The government is now content to just let these meetings continue, with their knowledge of them. Maybe they think they know what's going on. Or they hope what's going on actually is."

 SCO.7017.t:0 "A Successful Raid"
 SCO.7017.desc:0 "Good news! The raid was a success! Edinburgh police raided the mansion this afternoon. There was a brief scuffle at the door, but all five of the generals have been detained at the site. No officers were injured, and plenty of evidence was recovered.\n\nIn the room they were eating lunch in, we caught them with documents related to a coup attempt. There was a manifesto written by one of the generals, as well as a list of grievances. Our investigators believe that had we not acted when we did, we would be dealing with a coup attempt against our government. The evidence is enough to have them charged and convicted.\n\nThe army is denying any involvement, but this is a huge loss of face for them. Wimberley is going to have to behave himself for a while. And any other extremist elements have been put on notice that we are watching and we will put them in jail. All in all, this outcome is the best we could have gotten. The generals go to jail, and Scotland remains a republic for another day."

 SCO.7018.t:0 "A Spirited Afternoon"
 SCO.7018.desc:0 "The five generals had collectively decided to order something new that day. One of the generals was excited that a restaurant in Edinburgh was serving an Italian dish called "pizza." This was available when he had been in New York, he said, and it was good. The generals didn't harbour any love for Italy, mainly stemming from the years some of them served in Africa, but they agreed to be open-minded, and purchased one. And they had to agree, it was tasty.\n\nOne of the generals then said he heard pizza was technically a pie. This started some discussion. Some said it could be a pie, due to its crust, assorted ingredients, and round shape. Others disagreed, saying there was only a small amount of filling, and it was more of a flatbread. But another said they heard of a pizza from chicago served with a large amount of filling. One officer, seeking compromise, proposed the pizza could be considered a savory torte instead. It soon became clear both sides were entrenched.\n\nSuddenly, the door was kicked open by a police officer who proclaimed they were all under arrest for treason like he found Guy Fawkes hiding behind a gunpowder barrel in the House of Commons basement. The protests of the generals were ignored as they were dragged out and occasionally hit by a batton. The police threw the generals into the back of a police van, and then searched the home for evidence of this non-existent treason.\n\nNeedless to say, the Army was tremendously displeased with this course of events."

 SCO.7019.desc:0 "There's a coffee shop opposite the army headquarters. We can put two officers there, and have them do paperwork while they watch. When the generals leave, they can let us know, and we can start the observation. They will not attract suspicion, as plenty of police officers use coffee shops for paperwork and a quick snack.\n\nWhen the suspects leave, we can put a regular police car behind them, with no signal on. They will follow them to the restaurant, where they switch off. When the generals come out, a plainclothes officer in an unmarked vehicle will tail them back to the mansion.\n\nA group of plainclothes officers will be parked outside the mansion, near the room we expect the meetings to take place. There, they will observe with cameras and binoculars. Any notable events are to be reported at once at the end of the observation period. We will gain an accurate record of what went on during the meeting this way.\n\nAnother plainclothes officer will follow the generals back to headquarters. Any changes in routine to and from will be noted. New officers and cars will be put in the tailing to avoid suspicion by the suspects."

We don't really know what they were talking about in the mansion. We just watched them through a window from across the street."\n\n"So you don't know if it's alright or not."\n\n"We lack the evidence to make a firm conclusion, but from what we have seen, it seems the meetings are fine. We don't know what they were talking about, and we don't have much experience with high command meetings. However, we don't have any evidence that things are not well."\n\n"Would you say things are fine if you were in charge of the investigation with this evidence, officer?"\n\n"...That's hard to say."

 SCO.7021.desc:0 "So what have you figured out?"\n\n"Well, the generals meeting up is fine as far as we know."\n\n"So the police observation has found no evidence of any criminal activity?"\n\n"Well, no, but it does seem awfully suspicious that they're doing it, holding secret meetings away from army headquarters."\n\n"I know, that's why we're looking into it. But you say there isn't any evidence to support this assertion?"\n\n"There isn't. It seems normal, and it seems like a thing people would normally do. But something's...off about this. About all of it. I strongly feel there is something here that we are not able to see right now."\n\n"So there is no evidence of wrongdoing, but you feel there is, just because of the circumstances around it, officer?"\n\n"A gut instinct, to be sure. But I'm not convinced everything going on with these generals is on the up and up."

  sco_flavor.1.desc:0 "Alex rubbed his eyes, the salt stung more than usual. It was just another day when the catch was low. As he looked into the North Sea he frowned. The thriving industry had started to drop slowly in Scotland. The once large fleet had started to dwindle down slowly. The other fisherman remarked that the Germans and the Norwegians had overfished the North Sea causing it to decline. Some others blamed it on the overfishing of the current fish stocks.\n\nAs the boat motored into Aberdeen, he saw the much larger trawlers and even some factory ships leave port. He scoffed at the factory ship leaving. If there was anything that was killing the industry, it was those corporations and their ships he said to himself. They fish for days on and end and process the fish inside the ship. He shook his head and sailed into port. Once he arrived at his mooring, he called over a dockhand to help him unload the few crates he had full of fish. Today it was only him and his first mate, Tate. The dockhand looked like he had just woken up a few minutes ago and pulled down the winch for the crates of fish. Only three today, with the third being barely full. Not much cod in the waters of Scotland anymore. As the dockhand left, Alex and Tate began to clean the boat. It was hard, but rewarding to the two men.\n\nAs the boat was finally done an hour and a half after they came into port, they could finally collect their earnings and go home to sleep. Alex walked into the fishmongers office to collect his earning for the day. After getting his check, he shrugged and put it in his pocket. Once he was back by the boat, he split half of it with Tate. After the money had been split, the two men went their separate ways. Once thing that did stand out to Tate once he saw his cut was the amount of fish they hauled. Could the stocks be making a comeback?"

It was hole 18 during the final round and he was eight strokes away from winning against Bob Charles, the kiwi.\n\nThe two men had recently tied with each other in the last round. Arnold Palmer had recently finished in twenty-sixth, after being a heavy favorite due to him winning the past two tournaments. As Phil Rodgers walked to the ball, Bob Charles watched, hoping that he would win his first Scottish Open. As the crowd was quiet, Rodgers hit the ball with a nine iron, hoping to get it just a tad closer to the green. However he had hit it a bit too hard and it ended up landing in one of the many sand bunkers on St. Andrews. He walked over the Swilcan Bridge to his ball, once again the crowd was quiet. As he hit the ball once again, however this time it did go far. Rodgers bit his lip at this revelation while Charles clapped with the rest of the crowd watching with much interest.\n\nAfter twenty more minutes passed, it was apparent that Rodgers was going to go over par. He double-bogeyed in the end. Bob Charles smiled as it was announced he would win. He walked down the Swilken Bridge to thunderous applause and shook his opponents hand and to receive the trophy."

  sco_flavor.5.desc:0 "It is inevitable that two sports organizations in the same city will lead to a rivalry, especially for ones as accomplished as the Celtic and Rangers Football Clubs. Collectively known as the Old Firm, these two Glasgow teams are by far the most popular in the country, and the most successful with many Scottish Championships, Scottish Cups, and Scottish League Cups won between them. Of course, only one can claim to be the top team in Glasgow, so their matches against each other garner a considerable amount of interest.\n\nBut the rivalry is not as simple as mere geographic coincidence. A racial component is also at work in this competition. Celtic F.C. was founded in 1887 as a way to raise money for poor Irish Catholics in Glasgow, and always had a sizable support base from that bloc. Ulster Protestants who arrived in Glasgow to work on the shipyards in the early 1900's adopted the nearby Ranger team. This undercurrent only grew as outside events in Ireland drew a wedge between the groups. Everyone began to see the Rangers against the Celtics not as a game, but as a battle between competing religious, ideological, and racial identities.\n\nThe war only made the situation worse. Many English Protestants arrived in Glasgow, and identified with the team celebrated by the Unionists and the conservatives, who did battle against the hated Irish who stabbed them in the back during the war and joined the Axis. The Celtics supporters began to associate the other team with the right wingers in the Union Party, and too committed to a British identity to comfortably fit in an independent Scotland.\n\nThe teams have many fans, most of which refuse to engage in unsportsmanlike conduct. However, some do, and it overshadows the entire competition. Police have to keep the fans separate on the day of a Glasgow Derby, when the teams compete. Fighting between the two fan bases are common, with serious injuries and sometimes murders resulting. And most neighborhoods only support one side or the other. In many ways, Scotland's political and social issues have manifested themselves on the pitch, and the fans take these issues out of the stadium as well."

  sco_flavor.6.desc:0 "...if the Germans are invading?\n\nThe first rule in all this is preparedness. In the event of warfare, we expect an inevitable air raid against civilian targets and major cities. An alarm will sound if Luftwaffe planes are in the area. Upon hearing this alarm, immediately seek shelter. Most public places have a location marked for people to seek safety in the event of an air raid. You can also build a shelter at home, as discussed in the free booklet "Defense Tips for the Householder".\n\nIn the event of a nuclear attack, we may not always be able to guarantee warning, or that you will have time to seek protection. The first warning for this attack will be a flash of light. IMMEDIATELY, take cover behind a wall, duck down, and cover the back of your neck with your hand. Attempt to cover your face with paper or clothing, to protect against radiation. You will stay in this position, until a policeman or other authority informs you it is safe.\n\nBut the most important thing to do in the event of war is to STAY PUT. The goal of targeting civilians is to have them flee and clog the roads, slowing down our forces from reaching the front. This tactic was used by the Germans all across Europe. We must not fall for the same trick, if we wish to defend ourselves.\n\nAct like a soldier! Say "our lads will deal with them," not "I must get out of here." Do not panic, stay put. Fighting men must have clear roads. Don't clog them with your car or bike. Stay put, no matter if you are at home or at work. No matter what you hear, or what you see, YOU MUST STAY PUT."

  sco_flavor.7.desc:0 "The Scottish borders were well known to be a source of supply for HMMLR forces, and the terrain offered protection for many guerrilla organizations. Thus, it was important for the collaborationists to pacify it. The offensive in one area of the region forced the rebels to retreat and gather in an area where they would make a stand: around a crossing in the Scottish border.\n\nDay and night, artillery pounded the position, and machine gun fire permeated the air. But still, outnumbered and outgunned, the rebels refused to give up. This caught the attention of the Scottish soldiers on the other side of the fence, who dug trenches and watched the soldiers on the other side. Media began to gather on the Scottish side as well to record the situation.\n\nThe fighting got worse and worse. Occasionally, HMMLR rebels would hand off wounded comrades to Scottish troops to receive emergency medical treatment unavailable in their stronghold. These handoffs grew more and more common. Shells started landing closer to the border, setting fires in buildings near the border. A few landed on the other side of the fence, causing those in Scotland to take cover.\n\nFinally, the Scottish commander in charge of the border station had enough. He went over to the HMMLR headquarters and told them to stop fighting. There was no way they could break out, and it was almost a certainty they would be overrun eventually. They would be allowed to retreat into Scotland, and would certainly be treated well. Nobody would blame them, they had performed to the best of their ability in the face of insurmountable odds.\n\nThe rebels politely refused the offer. They were diverting enemy forces, they said. They still had the means to resist. And they need only hold on for a little more time before the collabs collapsed. The commander returned to the border understanding the sentiments, but amazed that a position cut off, surrounded, and without hope would continue to resist in spite of all logic."

That we're going to go to a country burned to ash, with rubble in every street, and fascist hooligans running around in the gutters. They think everyone is just going to leave, and then they can have all their terrible jobs back, and Glasgow is going to turn into a paradise.\n\n"You know how much money I put into my mortgage?

  sco_flavor.9.desc:0 "Scotland has never really been considered an ethnically diverse area, at least not for much of its history. Sure, there have been plenty of people from other areas of the British Isles, but not many from other areas. A few Eastern Europeans have recently settled here, though. The Nazi Empire is entirely reliant on slaves, and several relocated to England took advantage of the same opportunities afforded to other Anglos. But there is a significant and surprising ethnic group that exists within the Scottish borders.\n\nMany in the world believe Poland is a dead nation and culture, a statement which provides many with sadness and some a source of glee. However, one need only take a bus route in Glasgow or Edinburgh to find themselves surrounded by red and white, with signs in Polish script and kielbasa, pierogi, and bigos advertised in the windows of the restaurants. And one, upon seeing this, would probably ask "why?"\n\nThe answer lies in the Second World War. Many people end the history of Poland on October 6, 1939, when the last Polish position at Kock surrendered. However, Poland had never really stopped fighting. Many soldiers had used neutral countries to traverse to England, and so did a sizable number of civilians. Many of them ended up retreating into Scotland, and there were still a few Polish units on the border when the war ended.\n\nThe Poles in Scotland aren't nearly as significant or as large an ethnic group as the Anglos, numbering only in the tens of thousands. However, they are still there, and are just as proud and committed to keeping their new home free of German occupation. Some see the existence of their neighborhoods as a fluke of history. But many see it as proof that a proud people will find a way to survive and prosper in the face of determined genocidal opposition."

Every year was the same, the more religious Scots attended church reluctantly for the saints' day, while the general population hardly remembered the day was attached to a saint at all. Whether they'd gone to church or not, they'd spend the afternoon and evening carousing at the festivals. Before independence, people had at least paid lip service to it as a religious holiday, but since the fall of the United Kingdom, Saint Andrew's Day had become little more than a day of nationalist chest-thumping - a day when the flag was more important than the religion the day was devoted to.\n\n"Pastor?" asked a small voice from one of the pews.\n\n"Ah, Miss Whitney," Renwick said with a smile, his eyes resting on a child who'd stayed behind.\n\n"Well, I was just wondering if ye'd be at th' festival? Ma said you were prayin' and stoof last year, but we jes' really miss you there, is all. The whole combination will be there yeh knoo, and i's not fair fer ya to haf'tae miss it."\n\n"The whole combination, you say?" asked Renwick with a smile.

The water had been relatively calm, spare for a few ripples from the occasional fish or eel. Both had grown up hearing stories of the Loch Ness Monster, affectionately known as Nessie to the inhabitants of the many towns in the surrounding areas of the loch.\n\nHenry had been lying on the boat with his line in the water with his feet dangling over the edge when he had suddenly gotten a bite. He yelped and began reeling it in towards the boat. Unlike most of the other fish they had caught such as carp and pickerel, this thing had seemed to be putting up more of a fight. Andrew stood up on the wobbly craft attempting to get a better look.\n\n"Mate, what do you think it is?" yelled Andrew to Henry who had been battling with the line. The rod looked as if it would snap at any second as the bobber raced across the glassy loch.\n\n"Don't know, and it definitely ain't no pickerel!" replied Henry who had seemed to be putting all of his weight on the line.\n\nThe line then snapped and Henry fell backward, nearly throwing the two boys into the drink with whatever had attacked the line. Henry was helped up by Andrew who asked him a question, panting in the process."

The whole country has been on edge since this has occurred. Now that they have seen that the Collaborators can fight against a force that seemed to be equally matched to them was frightening. The government needed something that could boost morale for the nation. After meetings with Marshal Wimberley, they decided on a military parade to boost their army.\n\n"Today we are in Edinburgh for a military parade to celebrate Scotland's independence and its proud military. Coming down the street right now is Marshal Douglas Wimberley leading his proud 51st Highlanders, the pride of Scotland."\n\nThe camera angle switched to show Wimberley marching down the street in front of the Highlanders with them marching behind him dressed in the traditional unit garb of kilts and tams. Behind the contingent of soldiers marching was a mix of armored cars and tanks. On top of them were soldiers waving to the crowd.\n\nAs Parker watched he was intrigued, he had some friends who had served in the Scottish Army and they seemed to like it. However he couldn't ignore the true reason for the parade. The whole idea of it being for "Scottish Independence" was a smokescreen for the real reason. It was to serve as a morale booster and a warning to England that they are ready. As Parker watched, he couldn't get it out of his head that the threat of an invasion was even more prevalent now.

Most of them had been basic ideas that a junta would set up "No German Influence" "You can only be live during these hours". Parker had read them and shrugged. Easy enough he thought, however as he read the list, the parameters had gotten more totalitarian and enclosing.\n\nAs the light that signified they had been live lit up, Parker began his opening statement, trembling in his speech, making sure he wouldn't anger the soldiers.\n\n"Good evening Scotland. As I'm sure many of you had heard, the former government had been overthrown by Marshal Wimberley. However citizens of Scotland. I would not be worried, the Marshal has promised he will be a fair leader of Scotland during these times. I can assure you he will, as he had come to our offices and had a peaceful discussion with us about this sudden change of power. While it may seem unlawful, the Marshal believes these actions had been just to protect Scottish sentiments and traditions. Evil forces had begun to influence the former government and change had to occur to protect the Scottish way of life that many of us live. While things may seem haywire at first, the Marshal has said things will return to normal as soon as possibly but it will take time to rid Scotland of its evil influences."\n\nIn Parker's head he was starting to crack.

He darted to his window and saw armed men dressed in all black enter the building complete with flak jackets.\n\nParker nearly fell over and ran through the office. People stared at him and soon swarmed to the window. He ran into the head producers office and told him about the men entering the building. The producer looked at him, asking if he was under the influence before hearing the door into the main studio break down and the armed men swarm into it, yelling at everyone to get down.\n\nParker sat to the side of the main set with his hands tied behind his back and sitting looking at the set. In the past thirty minutes he had learned that the UP had been infiltrated by what seemed to be members of David Stirling's rebels from England. Parker had heard of them, but had never seen them in person. Robert Mayne was the leader of the men and was present with this group. He had grabbed the nearest anchor he had and put them on the set with a hastily written script. The anchor had been nervous and on the verge of tears.

She thought that she should have brought better shoes, the conditions here hadn't seemed to be the best in the world if she was going to be honest. However she didn't come to the border to fuss about mud, she came to raise a statement. As her chauffeur closed the door and followed her, she came over the hill and saw the camp.\n\nAs she walked into the camp, Buchan noticed the dingy conditions. Clothes had been strung on ropes that stretched from tent to tent that had been assembled hastily by the Scottish Government. As Buchan walked through the dirt paths that had been turned to mud, she saw faces in the tents. Ones of children and their parents, hoping for a better tomorrow. Buchan walked to the central building that seemed to be erected fast with zero to none care about the weather. As she walked around it to examine it, she noticed the siding falling off and one of the gutters completely missing. She shook her head and opened the door, expecting to be face to face with the "mayor" of the camp. However when she entered, she frowned. There was no mayor to be seen at all, only the desk and some scattered papers. Her brow furrowed and she exited the building to be greeted by a small child with her parents walking past the central building. The child looked to be in high spirits, skipping ahead of her parents. The parents looked to be in a much worse place. The father looked as if he hadn't shaved in one or two weeks and the mother's hair was all over the place.\n\nBuchan walked to the couple and asked for their names before having a discussion. Like most of the refugees, they had been from England and had come to Scotland for a much better life. Buchan then smiled and told them something."

She had done her morning meetings with party officials and meetings with local business owners, pledging to help them. She had also had a visit with some of the high profile refugees who had fled England. As she was flipping through a stack of papers, one of her aides had knocked on the door.\n\n"Priscilla, do you have a minute? I have some information that you should probably know." Said the voice behind the door.\n\n"Yes, you can come in" She was quite puzzled by this. This was quite the unusual time for something to be told to her but she shrugged it off.\n\n"Well if you can believe me, but I think that our party is being influenced by outside forces. A member of our party had found this letter with our seal on it." He handed the letter to Buchan, who opened it and read the contents.\n\n"Who's this 'Phantom', they sure seem to be very popular by the amount of times they are mentioned by the author" Said Priscilla as she rubbed her chin. The nick-name of "Phantom" sounded familiar, but she didn't know who it referred to.\n\n"Well, I don't think it's anything to be worried about." She said to the aide.\n"

They had just finished a meeting with Priscilla Buchan of the Unionist Party to discuss her upcoming election run and to talk about Scottish interests. After some discussion, she reassured the men that she would have their best interests.\n\nAs they got up to leave, the men shook hands and filed out the room. Buchan smiled, she seemed to have secured possible donors for her election run and even for the UP itself. She herself then left the room carrying the folder that she had shown the men with her ideas on trade. As she walked out of her room, she forgot some of the papers however. To Priscilla's eyes, they seemed to be quite innocent and trash. However, with a more in-depth look, they appeared to be a code, one that would be used.\n\nAs the night came and all of the members who worked in the UP headquarters left and went to their houses and flats to sleep. The custodians came in to cleanas they always do. This shift however, a new custodian named Jones had joined them. As they got to the building, they began their cleaning. Jones was assigned to the third floor, where the conference room and Buchan's office had been located. He had been there earlier in the day as one of the businessmen who had met with Buchan. As the men headed in their separate directions, Jones walked to the conference room and broke out the radio and camera he had been hiding in his mop bucket. He snapped photos of the paper that had been lying out and then wandered in Buchan's office. Once he was in there opened her filing cabinet and took more photos before radioing."

For the past few weeks, she and her party had been campaigning to help the English and now a civil war was happening. After meetings with her trusted associates and other members, they had decided to campaign for intervention in the civil war. Then a knock came on her door.\n\n"You can come in, Louis." The door then opened and Louis rushed in, he closed the door behind him in a hurry and sat down.\n\n"You alright Louis? You barged in and are caked in sweat." Priscilla asked this to him as he was sitting down, almost white knuckling the armrests on the chair.\n\n"Well are you going to tell me why you barged in or are you just gonna sit there?" Said Priscilla, slightly agitated but worried. He stuttered a few times before answering.\n\n"Well, remember that letter that I had brought to you? Well after some consideration with other members of the party, we had found a lead to Paddy Mayne of David Stirling's militarists of HMMLR. However before we could submit something to the Scottish Constables, his records had been stricken. We think he may have disappeared and will attempt to influence us further." Louis said this within a few breaths.\n\nBuchan replied to him, hoping to make him less worried. However she could only muster a simple response."

  sco_flavor.37.t:0 "Everyone Loves A Parade"
  sco_flavor.37.desc:0 "Being a parade's Grand Marshal was a job that really did not merit the title, thought Field Marshal Wimberley. It really just meant you took the salute while the troops marched past. Not exactly hard work in most cases, and Glasgow's parade wasn't unusual. Standing at attention for a while in the review stand wasn't entirely pleasant, but then you could sit back when the civilians would march past. And there would always be civilians. Scotland was a democracy, and they still wanted to honor civic institutions as well.\n\nThe units on parade today were a variety of local reserve units, some officer candidates, and the First Scottish Armour. Right now, the IFVs were passing the stand, their commanders standing up in the turrets saluting the review stand. Wimberley was happy to see a proper Scottish division of any type. This was not the army he had taken command of after the war. And this was a division with armour, one that showed the people of Scotland they were not without panzers of their own.\n\nWimberley had seen these IFVs before, many times actually. What was of greater interest was how the civilians reacted. Looking at the people on the other side of the street, he could see many of them were reacting positively. Little boys were excited and amazed. Women and girls applauded the soldiers as they came by, and so did the older men. The teenaged boys were imagining themselves as those commanders, surely. For a brief moment, Wimberley locked eyes with a man, before he quickly turned away. Wimberley thought nothing of it, as the scouting platoon was announced as next.\n\nUnbeknownst to Wimberly, the eye contact had put the man into a momentary panic, before he got hold of himself. He didn't know, the man reminded himself. It was a coincidence, surely. But just to be safe, he would move away from this spot. He shouldn't be compromised, he thought. His mission in Scotland was too important to his handler to risk being caught at this stage."

  sco_flavor.38.t:0 "Dilemma of the Day"
  sco_flavor.38.desc:0 "Effective immediately, the patrols in the North Sea are to be cut back...did he really read that right? Wimberley thought his eyesight must be fading. But sure enough, the letter from Edinburgh was telling him to do what he thought it was telling him to do. And that would pose a conundrum for the Field Marshal.\n\nOrdinarily, it wouldn't. The civilian government was really the one in charge here. They were the ones who were chosen by the people to represent them, not him. If the people wanted it, he would do it. He swore loyalty to the Scottish constitution, and the people elected by it. He wasn't supposed to question it, if that's what the government wanted. To do otherwise would be a challenge to the legitimacy of the civil government.\n\nAnd yet...he abhorred the order on its merits. North Sea patrols were critical to the defense of Scotland. Without them, U-boats would wreak havoc upon the shipping to North America that kept the nation supplied. Even worse, there was always the possibility that while the troops were busy in the south, Germany could land forces at Aberdeen and Moray, pulling a flank attack from the north.\n\nWimberley sighed, and put the memo inside his oak desk, right next to some memorada about fuel reserves. Admiral Anstice would not be notified of this order. North Sea patrolling was at a rate sufficient to protect shipping and the coastline, he decided. It needn't be curtailed. And it's not like the civilian government would notice their order had not been carried out. He closed the desk, and that was the end of the order.\n\nThat was the right move, Wimberley thought. What else do you do with a nonsensical order like that one?"

  sco_flavor.39.t:0 "Inspection of the Military Academy Cadets"
  sco_flavor.39.desc:0 ""So what's your name, cadet?" asked Wimberley.\n\n"Patrick Donnely, sir," said the young man. "From Lerwick."\n\n"Lerwick? I thought most young men there choose the navy for a military career."\n\n"Seasickness, sir."\n\n"Must have been a hell of a trip," remarked the Field Marshal. He moved on before stopping in front of another cadet. "You look familiar," he said. "Was your father in the Fifty-First?"\n\n"Yes he was, sir," said the cadet. "Captain Spencer McGregor of the First Battalion Gordon Highlanders. I was hoping to take his assignment one day."\n\n"If you're half as good as your old man, you won't have to worry about making Captain," assured Wimberley. He then kept inspecting the line, before stopping in front of another Cadet. "And what's your name, soldier?"\n\n"Mateo Beverbrooke, Field Marshal."\n\n"That's not a really Scottish name, isn't it? Are you a refugee?"\n\n"Not really sir. My family has lived in Dumfries as far back as we can trace it."\n\nWimberley smiled and kept up the inspection. These cadets would make fine officers, he could tell. And all of them would do what they must to defend the nation of Scotland."
  sco_flavor.39.a:0 "But will they do the unthinkable?"
  sco_flavor.40.t:0 "The Best Gifts..."
  sco_flavor.40.desc:0 "A million? That seemed like enough, though Wimberley as he filled out the check. That was quite a sum, but he could afford it, with his savings and pay. He would be making this donation eventually, so he might as well do it now. And they needed these funds anyway.\n\nThe receiver of these funds would be the University of Dundee, a research university in the town of the same name. He had always had a sort of soft spot for the university, and was not unsympathetic to their desire to be independent of the University of St. Andrews. He had been trying to help them out from behind the scenes, but there was only so much he could do in his current position. Adopting a more subtle tactic was a better way to make the change. By funding the University, it could expand, and an expanded university could make a better case for being independent. Already, the plan was bearing results, and the university was gaining a greater degree of autonomy. There was talk about becoming an independent operation soon.\n\nWimberley briefly thought of what the money would be used for. The new engineering building, most likely. The civil and mechanical engineering departments were getting a new structure to hold classes and labs in. This money would help them build and outfit the facility. However, the building would not bear his name, he was certain. In fact, outside of a few people in the leadership, nobody would know where the donation had come from.\n\nThat was just as well. The last thing the school needed was controversy. And how would the socialists in the dorms respond to the possibility of attending classes in Wimberley Hall? Maybe not right now. But perhaps after he had gone out of the limelight would Dundee decide to reveal their mysterious benefactor."

  sco_flavor.41.desc:0 "Why was he losing sleep over this, thought Wimberley? This wasn't anything to be ashamed of, he thought. Everyone under him agreed it was the correct decision. And it was for the benefit of Scotland anyway. This is what needed to be done. And yet, he still doubted himself.\n\nOn one hand, what he mostly did was minor, and it would scarcely be noticed by anyone on the outside. But on the other, it was likely to raise concerns with the government. On one hand, these things had been agreed upon by the military as necessary and strategically important. On the other, it went against what the government thought was necessary and strategically important. On one hand, he believed these were the right things to do. But on the other, men of similar convictions and lesser offences had been jailed or expelled from the military.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the civilian government, he thought, it was the people of Scotland he was disobeying. They were the ones who decided what was enough overall, weren't they? And he was acting against their express wishes. What did that make him, the one betraying those he had sworn an oath to protect? Was there any difference between himself and-\n\n"Dear?" asked Elsye Wimberley, who was lying beside him.\n\n"Yes honey?"\n\n"This new Thai restaurant opened up downtown and I'm thinking we should try it tomorrow."\n\n"That sounds lovely. We really should."\n\nWhat did they eat in Thailand, anyway? Probably rice or noodles, much like the Chinese. Loaded with spices and special sauces, surely. And obviously there would be a variety of roasted meats. But would there be special foods or recipes one would only find in Siam? Wait, not Siam, Thailand. Or was it still Siam? Everything had changed to Thailand all of a sudden..."
  sco_flavor.41.a:0 "What was he thinking about, again?"
  sco_flavor.42.t:0 "Shower Thoughts"
  sco_flavor.42.desc:0 "Douglas Wimberley was washing his hair one morning, when the question struck him; was any form of authoritarianism tolerated in a democracy? On the surface, the answer was no. But with more thinking, it became more complicated.\n\nBy its very design, Scotland was not a true democracy, the people didn't vote on every law that was proposed. Rather, it was a republic. The people delegated authority to a group of parliamentarians to make the decisions for them. And sometimes, the decisions were beyond the role of the leader, but excused by the circumstances surrounding it. A local governor might declare a state of emergency to get relief to their population, for example.\n\nThe leaders of the country were also not immune to overstepping their boundaries to get away with it. The supposed world's greatest democracy was a prime example. Jefferson overstepped his authority to buy Louisiana from Napoleon. Lincoln suspended the right of criminals to appear before a court and burned a sizable section of his own country. Those two were carved into the side of a mountain in South Dakota. Woodrow Wilson targeted leftists with the Espionage Act, and they still had a high opinion of him. Why? Because what they accomplished with that power was apparently worth the transaction.\n\nEven the one that started it all, Rome, had dipped it's toes into authoritarianism when there was no other choice. Everyone remembers Cincinatus, who willingly wielded absolute authority in war yet ceded it in peace. But what of the less noble example of Caesar? Or his descendents, Cromwell, Napoleon, or Hitler? They did not give up the power once they had seized it. But they never intended to. No threat was there requiring them to take power, and no circumstances needed them to maintain it. After emergencies in democratic societies, rights were restored, and people were allowed to continue as they had before.\n\nWimberley then came to the conclusion of his thought process. There was plenty of historical precedent for a temporary suspension of democracy. If Scotland required it, democracy should be halted for a time. Once the emergency had passed, power could be ceded back, and nobody would think any lesser of the leadership because of it. They might put them on the side of a mountain as well."

It wasn't like Lang to suddenly rush in. "What's going on?" he asked.\n\n"I just got word from the First Fusiliers," explained General Lang. "One of their men has been missing for a few hours now. Ordinarily, there would be no reason to raise alarms in headquarters, but this is different. They've raised the possibility of the involvement of German intelligence."\n\n"What evidence is there to make such a claim, Derek?"\n\n"Well, it makes sense, sir. The soldier was involved with communications. He's seen the defenses in the south of the country. And he was close to the English border. You have to admit, sir, that's awfully tempting for the Abwehr. He could have run across the border with a few documents, and some other interesting items."\n\nNow Wimberley understood. "Mother of God...what are we doing to respond to this?"\n\n"I'm having all the codes changed, for starters. And we're trying to see if anyone in his unit is also involved. But there's only so much we can do. We need to get the civil authorities on it, so they can start tracking any angles outside of the military."\n\n"Fair enough, Derek.

"...And furthermore, your accusation of enemy involvement in this matter is without merit and entirely baseless..." He paused and looked up, surprised. "They're not going to investigate?"\n\n"They fucking aren't," confirmed Wimberley. "And it isn't much use appealing; I've already raised hell with the Prime Minister about it. You weren't the first person I called after receiving that."\n\n"Shit," said Lang. "And I thought they'd at least help us out on this."\n\n"Bloody useless bureaucrats," Wimberley said.\n\n"Well, we do have to contend with the fact we haven't been able to dig up much on the soldier on our own, sir."\n\n"And is that because the government isn't helping us, or is it because there really is nothing there?"\n\nLang couldn't answer. "We'll try to go as far as we can, sir. Maybe something interesting that would cause a reevaluation comes up."\n\nAnd maybe we'll convince the bastards to actually look at it, Wimberley doubted."

  sco_flavor.45.t:0 "Final Reflections"
  sco_flavor.45.desc:0 "Wimberley set down his pen and looked around his office. He would miss this place, he thought, the room from where he managed the Scottish Military since the formation of the country. The room where he kept the watch on the Tweed. And the room from where his successor would take his place. It was sad, but he was getting old, and he was just happy he could leave the Army after a long career, and on his own terms.\n\nHe wondered how everyone else would see his career. Surely, his place in the history of Scotland was secured. His deal with John MacCormick made the country, hadn't it? And after that, he had been the main figure in Sotlnad's Army for many years, organizing it, and keeping it ready to respond to a German incursion. And one could not discount his deeds before then in the World War. No, his position was secure, and nobody could bury it or wipe it away.\n\nBut would it be a flattering position? Wimberley was not a fool, not everything he did was popular, well received, or even legal in some cases. There was an entire segment of the political spectrum demanding more than his retirement. And they all regarded him as a paranoid madman who could have ended democracy if he felt like it. They hadn't seen what he had seen, there was no way for them to understand what he felt. Would that last after he had gone? Would the schoolbooks regard him as a danger to the public, propped up only by past deeds?\n\nIt was a terrifying thought, but Wimberley then considered another angle. He was not without his supporters, both in the Army and in the political sphere. Many in the military felt the same way that he did. And at the end of the day, he had achieved his goal of keeping Scotland free, atop his other achievements. He would be guaranteed a level of sympathy at least, and many would see him as a Scottish hero like those of the middle ages. Wimberley would have to be content with that.\n\nAnd he could still tell his side of the story anyway."

They tried to tell him to stay when the fighting started, but how could he? His home needed him. He had a duty, as his grandfather had before him, and his father before him. England had begun to throw off the yolk of the fascist oppressors, and he would rather be dead than abandon his duty.\n\nEven before he reached the border he could hear the ringing peals of gunfire further south.

Nothing of much significance really happens in a rural town such as this. But a recent sporting event has drawn considerable interest in both Scotland and England.\n\nAfter the HMMLR victory in the English Civil War, many people have been interested in the normalization of relations with Scotland. Nowhere has this been more anticipated than in the border region. For the longest time, the line was widely considered to be the boundary between the free world and the slave. As such, it was heavily fortified, and home to many military drills. Now, the tension has stopped, and what soldiers there are on the border are in a more relaxed mood.\n\nOn the opposite border, the Scottish town of Gretna proposed a football match between their local team and Longtown in order to celebrate this relaxed atmosphere. Permission was granted by the English and Scottish governments, who felt the idea was sound. Today, a bus full of Scottish football players went over the River Sark, and into England, bringing a group of local fans in tow. A similar attendance in England made their way to the town park in Longtown to watch the match.\n\nThe game opened with a short ceremony where the mayors of Gretna and Longtown declared their hope that England and Scotland would be at peace forevermore, and that the bonds between the countries would heal and grow stronger. Unfortunately, that seemed to be the most interesting part of the match. The teams were made up of local amateurs, and it showed on the pitch. The game was eventually called with a score of 1-1. The teams then shook hands and left for home, with the possibility of a match to really determine the victor still up in the air."

Ever since their first trip, they had come up with traces, but no big wells. Their outlook was getting more and more grim as time went on, with little to look forward to besides steaming into port to see their families for a day or two before heading back out into the North Sea.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes from the sting of the salt water before walking into the main hull of the ship. While the vessel had been a former fishing boat used by one of the many seafood companies, they had since gone under due to declining stocks. The ship itself had been saved from the scrapyards by the Scottish Government, who bought it as a survey vessel. While the general goal of surveying remains the same, more specialized equipment had to be brought from the United States to Scotland to be put inside the ship. Most of the equipment took lots of modifications to be fit into the ship. As time went on, the budget of the survey program had gone up exponentially. Due to this, some cuts had to be made such as living quarters and the galley.\n\nAs he walked into the hull, he hoped that a pot of coffee was made. Instead, Scott had turned their small galley into a makeshift lab, complete with a screen. The other men had crowded around the small little table as they looked at the screen. While small and seeming to be useless, it could be the lynchpin that sets off the Scottish oil industry, something that the men could only dream of. Then Scott yelled, surprised at what had come out of the screen. It was hooked up to the gravimeter they had on the boat. He hit the screen, thinking it was a visual glitch. However the lines didn't go away. The other men soon realized the same thing. Oil was truly in the North Sea. Callum threw his hands in the air, amazed that something was found. Now, he thought, this trip was exciting."
