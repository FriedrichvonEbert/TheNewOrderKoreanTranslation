 goering.1.t:0 "갑작스러운 군사 쿠데타!"
 goering.1.d:0 "놀랍거나, 혹은 놀랍지 않을 수도 있는 소식이 전해졌습니다. 참담한 상황이 되어 군대가 우리에게 등을 돌려버린 것 같습니다! 독일군은 현재 처해 있는 무정부 상태 상황 때문에 헤르만 괴링의 통치를 달가워하지 않았으며, 현 정부에게 쿠데타를 시도해 권력을 직접 행사하기로 시도한 것 같습니다.\n\n괴링은 군 내부 뿐만이 아니라 많은 사람들에게 무능한 지도자로 가뜩이나 불안한 라이히의 지배권을 주장하면서 끊임없이 변화하는 독일의 정치 현장을 관리하지 못한 사람으로 알려져 있었습니다.\n\n국제적인 소식통들은 라이히를 집어삼킨 혼란스러운 사건들에 놀라 숨을 죽이며 아직 어떤 일이 닥칠 지 알 수 없는 상황에 지켜보기만 하고 있습니다..."

 goering.2.t:0 "괴링이 승리하다"
 goering.2.desc:0 "전 세계의 신문과 방송사는 오늘 괴링이 승리를 환호하는 군중들과, 호르스트 베셀의 노래를 연주하는 군악대, 온 건물과 창문에 펄럭거리는 괴링 군대에 대한 현수막과 함께 게르마니아 전역을 순회하는 모습이 방송되었습니다. 무장한 젊은이들과 충성스러운 독일 육군에 둘러싸인 괴링은 수천 명의 군중들 앞에서 "라이히의 새로운 여명"을 선포하는 불꽃튀는 연설을 하였습니다.\n\n등뒤의 배경으로 웅장하면서 금이 간 국민대회당을 둔 괴링은 연설문에서 "독일 국민의 영광을 위해 세계에 다시 한 번 불을 지르는" 독일이 되겠다고 약속하였고, 그의 적들에게 "라이히의 철발굽 아래 신속하게 파괴될 것"이라고 위협하였습니다.\n\n국제적인 반응도 격렬했습니다. 미국과 일본운 군사 자산 동원을 발표하면서 세 강대국은 다가올 또 다른 세계대전에 대비하기 시작한 것으로 보입니다."

 goering.3.t:0 "마지막 움직임"
 goering.3.desc:0 "독일의 괴롭혔던 끝없는 전투는 더 이상 없습니다. 어리석게도 완강하게 버티며 그들은 달콤한 최후 통첩을 시도하는 동안에도 우리는 조국을 위해 승리를 부르짖을 것입니다. 타락한 반역자의 군대들은 베여졌으며 독일의 전쟁정신은 활기를 띄기 시작했습니다. 이제 괴링은 라이히의 통일까지 마지막 장애물인 슈파이델, 그의 전 사령관인 에르빈 롬멜과 그들이 이끄는 게르마니아 방어 전담부대만을 남겨두고 있습니다. 어찌되었건 우리의 세계수도는 내전에서 비교적 무사했으며 슈파이델 영토의 시민들은 도시를 구한 군인을 영웅으로 추켜세웠습니다.\n\n이 갈등을 끝내고 새로운 질서를 세우기 위해서는 슈파이델과 그의 부하들에게 이제 그만 물러나 우리를 들여보내 달라고 요청해야 합니다. 하지만 결정권은 그들에게 있고, 우리는 그들의 대답을 기다려야 합니다."

 goering.4.t:0 "괴링에게 항복한 게르마니아"
 goering.4.desc:0 "우리가 슈파이델에게 요청서를 보낸 순간부터 통일된 독일 국민은 슈파이델의 반응에 염려하고 있었습니다. 하지만 이 긴장감은 롬멜이 국제 언론사 앞에서 슈파이델은 게르마니아가 괴링의 군대에게 평화적으로 항복할 것이며, 모든 군대는 괴링에게 무기를 내려놓으라고 지시했다고 발표를 하면서 게르마니아의 지친 방위병들에겐 큰 환영을 받았습니다. 이날 발표에 독일은 전국의 맥주홀과 술집 등 술자리를 찾는 시민들과 비번 병사들이 몰리는 가운데 기쁨과 안도감 속에 빠졌습니다. 게르마니아를 제외한 전역이 보급이 부족했지만, 평화가 필요한 피폐한 라이히에 드디어 평화가 닿은 것으로 보입니다. 지금은 말이죠."

 goering.5.t:0 "게르마니아가 복종을 거부하다!"
 goering.5.desc:0 "자신의 피에 상처입고 자기 땅 때문에 혹사당하던 독일 국민은 슈파이델에게 보낸 병력 철수 요구에 대한 답변을 긴장을 늦추지 않고 기다려왔습니다. 하지만 이 바보가 망할 무기를 내려놓지 않는다고 선언하고 대신 독일인에게 우리 군대와 맞서 싸워야 한다고 촉구하면서 독일은 아직 평화 상태에는 이르지 못한 것 같습니다. 이 발표는 우리 국민을 골치 아프게 만들고 있으며, 우리는 이 중대한 실수를 가능한 한 빨리 시정하기 위한 조치를 취해야 합니다. 이 전투에서 우리가 이기더라도 비용이 많이 들 것이며 우리가 열심히 만든 세계수도는 파괴될 것입니다."

 goering.13.d:0 "괴링이 총통에 즉위하던 날 게르마니아에는 아직도 여기저기 북해에서 불어오는 바람과 함께 수천 채의 집, 차량, 들판, 그리고 불에 붙을 수 있는 모든 것이 불에 타 잔해가 되며 나오는 연기가 피어올랐습니다. 하지만 이것이 새 총통을 보기 위해 거리로 몰려든 수천 명의 독일인을 막지는 못했습니다.\n\n수천 명의 군인들이 당당하게 거리를 행진하고, 트럭이 도로를 질주하며 수백대의 전차가 이를 뒤따르며 끝이 없는 행진이 계속되었습니다. 마지막으로, 전 부대에게 둘러싸인 메르세데스 컨버터블 차량을 통해 총통이 그의 대관식장으로 이동했습니다. 지구상에서 가장 위대한 도시에서 새로운 정복자를 환영하는 꽃들이 마구 흩날렸습니다.\n\n폴크스할레의 계단에서 괴링들이 군중들의 굉음에 맞춰 차에 내렸습니다. 건물 쪽으로 들어가던 괴링은 잠시 걸음을 멈추고 군중들로 몸을 돌린 뒤 손을 흔들자, 거리의 모든 사람들이 환호하며 광분한 소리를 내질렀습니다. 의심의 여지 없이 독일은 다시 강해질 것이고 그걸 전 세계가 알게 될 것입니다."
 goering.13.a:0 "새 시대가 도래했다."
 
 goering.15.t:0 "야수에 대항하는 집회"
 goering.15.d:0 "독일의 폐허 속에서 반대파와 학생의 구호가 한 때 내전 당시 들렸던 총폭탄 소리처럼 크게 울렀습니다. 대학과 학교에서 잔존한 학생 조직은 새 조국의 승리자인 총통에게 있어 새로운 도전으로 다가왔습니다.\n\n그들이 아직 살아있다는 것은 놀라운 일이긴 합니다. 아무도 그들이 괴링의 군국주의 세력에 대항하는 세력으로 계속해서 남아있을 것이라 생각하진 않았습니다. 하지만 아직 그들은 그러고 있죠.\n\n그들의 숫자는 늘어났꼬 시위는 점점 늘어났습니다. 군인과 경찰들이 시위대가 원하는 것을 이루지 못하게 막기 위해 마구 달려나갔습니다. 일부는 성공했지만 더러 일부는 성공하지 못했습니다. 곤봉이나 소총으로 진압한 시위가 한두 개 있을 때마다 화염병이나 돌로 물러난 시위가 한두 개 생겨났습니다.\n\n꺼저가는 불씨가 공기와 연료로 되살아나듯, 죽은 자나 도망친 보안군에게서 무기를 뺏은 학생들도 마찬가지였습니다. 떠오르는 불사조처럼 새로운 활력으로 끌어모인 분노에 가득 찬 학생들은 승리자를 비난하고 돌아오는 평화를 위협했습니다.\n\n이 모든 것이 독일 국민을 다시 한번 뒤흔들었습니다. 그들은 깨진 창문이나 더러워진 일터에서 젊은 남녀들이 자신이 지지하는 것을 위해 다시 싸우려 하는 것을 지켜보았습니다. 그들 중 대부분은 승리자가 슈페어, 보어만, 하이드리히가 아닌 괴링에게서 온 것일지라도 마침내 찾아 온 평화를 원했습니다.\n\n"이미 포기했어!"라고 하며, 더러는 학생들에게 "전쟁은 끝났어! 앞으로 싸울 일이 뭐가 남았지?"라고 말하기도 했습니다. 그렇지만 돌아오는 대답은 이미 정해진 것에 거역하는 경멸적인 침묵이나 우레같은 선언들이 줄창 이어질 뿐이었습니다. 학생들은 계속해서 시위하고, 행진하고, 맞서 싸우기만 할 뿐이었습니다. 그들이 결국에는 죽거나 비참한 운명 앞에 놓이게 되더라도 학생들은 다른 선택의 여지가 없어 보였습니다. 항복이란 그들에게 저주였습니다. 반대하지 않는다는 것은 패배했을지라도 어떤 일어난 일에 맞서는 것보다도 터무니없는 것이라고 생각했습니다."

 goering.16.d:0 "위대한 사자와 거대한 늑대가 승리했습니다. 그들의 가장 강력했던 적은 죽어서 피가 독일 땅으로 스며들고 있고, 그들에게 감히 맞섰던 수많은 철없고 어리석은 학생들, 그들을 격분시킨 반체제 인사들, 그들 모두에게 자금을 대준 은행가들은 이제 사자와 늑대의 자비에 달려 있습니다. 이들과 또한 그들의 앞길을 가로막았거나 가로막고자 하는 헛된 일을 하는 자들은 모두 숙청될 것입니다.\n\n승리한 총통 헤르만 괴링과 그의 냉혹한 부관인 페르디난트 쇠르너의 명령에 따라 이들에게 대항하는 데 실패한 모든 사람들은 이전 전쟁에서 몰살당한 사람들과 비슷한 운명을 맞을 것입니다.\n\n많은 학생들이 독일 국방군의 기준에 따라 잔인한 훈련을 받는 수용소로 끌려갔습니다. 그들이 누구이며 어디서 왔으며 무엇을 믿는지간에 그들 모두가 매를 안 맞을 수는 없습니다. 죽음의 고통 속에 그들은 복종할 것입니다.\n\n조국의 정치적인 행복을 방해하는 자들은 모두 체포될 것입니다. 사회주의, 민주주의, 개혁주의, 또는 그러한 것들을 지지한 영혼들의 미덕은 군사의 도를 중요시하는 사람들의 군홧발에 짓밟힐 것입니다. 그들을 감옥에 보내 썩게 만들거나 표시도 없는 거대한 공동묘지에 묻혀 다시는 평화를 어지럽게 만들지 못하도록 해야 합니다.\n\n마지막으로 돈을 훔치기 위한 기생충들은 전부 배제될 것입니다. 그들의 탐욕은 총통이 작성하는 회계장부에서 더 이상 구할 수 없을 것입니다. 그들의 가련한 손은 다른 동전이나 지폐도 만질 수 없을 것입니다. 아뇨. 그들도 다른 사람들처럼 사자의 밡톱과 늑대의 이빨에 목이 전부 할퀼 것입니다."

 goering.17.t:0 "계엄령이 선포되다"
 goering.17.d:0 "사자는 한숨을 내쉬었고 그 늙은 얼굴은 피곤한 미소를 지었습니다. He walked down the empty and fairly lit hall, the one the late Adolf Hitler walked down himself, with his fellow victor, Field Marshal Schörner, by his side. They paused short of the doors that kept them out of the office from where the father of the great Reich once worked, leading the German people.\n\nThe successor turned. "Field Marshal, I have immense confidence in your abilities. I'd like to ask you a significant favor for our victory. Take care of the cleanup. Keep your hand in the details of the martial law we have just declared. I think you can do that by-"\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Schörner quickly interrupted with a nod, "and those students and their arrogant allies in the banks, along with those dissident bastards from the camps will be dealt with. Strongly. I'll personally see to it."\n\nThe former pilot with grizzled hair blinked at him. Then he chuckled, shrugged, and said, "Really. Very well then. I give you the liberty of doing what must be done. Just don't take too long, all right?"\n\n"Of course not." Schörner thought his new Führer a little too histrionic. Well, not a big deal. It's natural for a flyboy like him to play with army officers for favors. "I'll see to the-"\n\n"Just make sure that nobody breaks the curfews and pisses us off with any tricks. The sooner those pests and their supporters are taken care of, the sooner our country can lick its wounds and get to work," the Führer said, all too quickly. The field marshal looked up. Then he gave a nod. Schörner saluted him. He turned away and marched off, Göring watching him disappear.\n\nThe old, great lion who won the war for Germany's conquests to be added to now twisted the knob of the door and stepped in. The door closed. And the ruthless wolf who fought that war for him, so he may spill the blood of more of the Fatherlands enemies, looked back, whispering..."

 goering.18.t:0 "체포된 학생들"
 goering.18.d:0 "They were the future of the Fatherland, yet all they did was ruin it with their dreams; all too lofty and all too degenerate. Too bad for their families, and too shameful for those who believed their disgusting promises for a grand future.\n\nThey all have to pay for their stupidity as soon as they arrive in the camps. There, their virgin hands shall labor; there, their big brains shall wonder about the measure of their rations and the weight of their loads; and there, they shall learn all about the rewards of placing their hopes in a cowardly old man who has never served the Fatherland except to save himself and his wretched thralls.\n\nIf they do figure out what is right for them, then they better work hard and stop complaining about the fucking slaves and the stupid natives. Until they accept what's good for them and their peers, they don't deserve to be restored into the Fatherland's tent again. If they don't get that into their thick skulls, there won't be any escape from the mouths of the lions and wolves who are certainly better than them.\n\nThe roundup of these annoying students and their leaders shall be a simple thing to carry out. If they resist, they're to be shot. If they give in, they're guilty enough to be sent to the camps.\n\nYet, it just isn't enough to discipline these upstarts of that bloody architect. There is no excuse for the youth who failed to persuade their naive classmates from rebellion. They too are guilty for their reluctance.\n\nAt least we won't worry about funding those fancy universities now. Their beloved professors can sit on their desks and spin on their chalks. They too shall be arrested and sent out of sight. All of the Fatherland has no need and no love for people too educated and too intelligent for their own good.\n\nUltimately, this is only the beginning of the end for anyone too stubborn to see that the only right way is the mighty way."
 goering.18.a:0 "Take those fucking kids out of here!"

 goering.19.t:0 "은행가들을 쥐어짜다"
 goering.19.d:0 "Greed is not good. And anyone who thinks they can leech off the good, strong, and bold German people shall be left with nothing, banished beyond the Fatherlands comforts and markets.\n\nThe new Führer had his eyes upon these rich parasites since the waning days of Hitlers reign. Now he reigned the Fatherland in his wake. Even if they do whatever spineless things they are perfectly capable of doing, they won't get the chance, not when he starts pressing his black boot against their necks. And that is despite his own dream of reshaping the economy of the Reich. Without them, he shall be master of the Reich's wealth, free to use it for his own purposes and the greater needs of the people.\n\nFor now, it was important to really sink the teeth of the state into their assets and their very persons. He ordered no mercy in his pronunciations against the hoard rats. He denounced them for their "crimes against the personal wealth of each and every German citizen." And he insulted them as economists and monetarists who are as corrupt as the Jews. He even went so far as to accuse them of serving themselves; of being under the dirty paws of Jews - if they were not Jewish themselves.\n\nAnd naturally, they were swiftly dealt with in any manner available. From simply refusing to do business with them up to crafting unfortunate accidents that befell them, the good Führer would let these slide. As long as they help him throw those rapacious financiers out of society, he would not need to apply Germany's justice against them.\n\nAfter all, the natural enemy of the Fatherland was not those who served the Führer's interests but those who sought to be opportunistic; to squeeze them out like the thieves they are, returning their booty to those who rightfully possess it. That is how Göring and the Fatherland made new shall prevail in the absence of those goblins."

 goering.20.t:0 "총에 대한 믿음"
 goering.20.d:0 "A man in his field uniform stepped into the classroom, his eyes drawn towards the students waiting in their seats, as their professor stood by his desk. The soldier didn't let his sight linger in one place, always bringing it from left to right. Entrances, exits, pathways, and obstacles; he stopped to look forward and walked to the front, then turned sharply, facing the center.\n\nHe let his left hand reach down, groping at an empty belt. The man bit his lower lip, remembering that he was not in a place that allowed for weapons. This was a school, the thought came across his mind. You'll get it back.\n\nThe professor spoke to his students, who either seemed intimidated by this visitor or, perhaps, excited. A few showed no emotion, only curiosity.\n\nThe man waited for his own chance to speak. Patiently, of course. But the way the man spoke, with its awe; its naivety; its ignorance - his voice annoyed him. His left hand groped for the empty space by his belt once more. Nothing to hold; nothing to bring up and shoulder; nothing to give him some measure of control, of safety. Just as sweat dropped down his neck.\n\nWhen the older man stopped speaking and returned to his seat, the soldier - an experienced rifleman who had served as the Fatherland saw fit for him to serve in whatever place, then serving once more to win the Fatherland for the new Führer - stiffened.\n\nThoughts raced through his head, as bullets once did by his ears. A nervousness rang as ruined bells inside his equally ruined mind. And the full measure of the past rose back up to the surface, tormenting him with the truths of war as these students seemed not to really comprehend anything at all.\n\nThis war of mine, he said to himself, reminding his conscience, is not theirs to thoroughly appreciate. He wished himself to will through and speak about his experiences as they were to him; raw, brutal, and traumatic. But the state would not permit it; war was a glorious thing, as the new Führer declared for a new Germany.\n\nHis left hand pressed against his thigh. And he began to speak, choosing to lie to them - to lull them into the dream of conquest and of power they wanted to believe. At least, in his brand new attire, he would look good as he got this over with; yet, within, his heart seemed to tug at the seams."

 goering.21.d:0 "Hermann Wilhelm Göring, the former president of the Reichstag; former minister president of Prussia; and above all, the man who, from its birth up to its greatest victories over the Allies and the vanquished Soviets, created the vast Luftwaffe. Now, he is the Führer of the Reich. Now, he is the man who has saved Germany from all their enemies, both within and without.\n\nNo longer shall the likes of Speer dare to corrupt the youth with delusions of freedom; no longer shall the ilk of Heydrich seek to bring the Reich under the influence of the traitor Himmler; and no longer shall the bastard Bormann hope to trap the people in the false bliss of the status quo. Unlike these men the great hero of a new Germany, lifting it by the dirtied hand out of the ashes of a terrible civil war launched by these jealous men.\n\nNever again shall Germany be without a hero as mighty, as bold, and as single-minded as the Führer! Therefore, it is declared that each and every building possessed by the government, that each and every structure owned by the public, shall bear his portrait. Though he may not always be with us in person, he shall always watch over us in spirit.\n\nThe radios and the televisions too shall declare what a wondrous leader he is. They shall proclaim his victories and speak of his men, who are brave enough to meet the challenge of protecting this new Germany for the people who believed that the best way forward into the future, through the drudgery of time, through the difficulties of war and the decay of peace, is only in the never-ending confidence in the strength of our armies, our fleets, and our soaring wings. Just like in the wars fought so long ago to reclaim the glory lost in the First World War, so shall our future conquests be for the good of Germany's happiness!\n\nOur faith is in our dear Führer Göring.

Germany became strong by bayonet and bullet!

They will complete the orders for their own weapons and then march into battle bearing their own creations and thus will be extra motivated. After all what is finer than going to war with a weapon you yourself created with your own two hands!\n\nThis surge in manpower will surely overcome the brief, only temporary shortfalls in production as new crews (Comprised of the elderly, the sick, the infirm and women.) are trained to replace them.

These men shoulder a burden for the Reich and if they wish to have a drink, then they should be able to have one!\n\nAlthough we should probably look into the morphine shortage affecting many frontline medical units. Clearly this means not enough morphia is reaching the men! We shall redouble the rations of it, and increase the supply of Pervitin! Doubling the men's Pervitin ration shall help us ensure final victory over the SS, liberals, and conservatives!\n\nSome enterprising units have even begun to supply themselves with combat stimulants.

Führer Göring was appointed by Hitler himself to lead the nation after his death, his oldest, most trusted companion! Soldiers are inclined to grumble and complain, it is their lot after all, but sedition must be torn out root and stem.\n\nTo this end the Führer has enacted Führer Decree 267, the expansion of the Feldgendarmerie into the ungentlemanly aspect of political officer. The Feldgendarmerie will now directly attach teams to frontline units, monitoring the men's morale and ensuring that the threat of sedition is held at bay. \nNightly lectures on Mein Kampf!

 goering.29.d:0 "The Volkspanzer initiative was unveiled today before a select group of industrialists, generals and prominent dignitaries. Field Marshal Schörner spoke about the need for such panzers to replace the ones already lost at the front, noting that with such tanks, final victory would be within the Führer's grasp soon. \nThe concept of the Volkspanzer is that the armoured shells of the panzers would be distributed to sites likely to be attacked by the enemy, where local crews could easily attach the hulls to standard farm tractors without complicated tools, presenting an iron wall to the enemy where ever he attacks! \nThe Volkspanzers are built of recycled steel normally unsuited for armour plating.

Farms are entirely given over to nothing, abandoned by all workers and now lost to infestations of weeds. The Baltic fishing industry has ground to a complete standstill, their sailors and fishermen gone to the Kriegsmarine. Their vessels rusting at anchor or pressed into service as minesweepers.

His room was a black box in all meanings of the word, with only his small reading lamp providing a bare minimum of illumination. Satisfied that he was as safe as he could make himself, he opened his desk drawer and slowly pulled out the small book buried underneath the mess of papers within.\n\n"All Quiet On The Western Front" it was called, by Erich Maria Remarque. It was about the life of a soldier in the first World War, the one Grandpa had fought in. Only, where all his other favorite books about that conflict had spoken of noble it was to fight, the glory of battle, and as always the shame of being stabbed in the back, this one told quite a different story. The soldiers lived horrible, filthy lives in the trenches. The rats alone were enough to make him queasy and all the horrible death. It didn't sound anything like what he had been taught in school. No wonder he wasn't supposed to be reading it. When Professor Herren had handed him the book some time ago, he had made Hans promise not to tell anybody about the gift. Of course, Hans had seen the title on the lists of banned books before, but it wasn't until he had actually read it did he realize why he had been forbidden to.\n\nA knock on the door made him freeze in fear.\n\n"Hans, are you asleep?"\n\nHe turned the lamp off, hid the novel, and darted into his bed.

In a terrifying case, a Battalion was issued Second World War era Kar98s that had somehow been assembled with the bolts from Russian Mosin-Nagants, leading to six deaths as the rifles catastrophically failed. This specific case is just one of many considering the deluge of reports about anti-tank rockets failing to launch and exploding a foot away from the launcher; hand grenades with faulty fuses exploding in our grenadiers hands; or panzer engines self-immolating the second they are moved from their railway wagons.\n\nMany generals are now pointing fingers at the Führer's removal of skilled personnel from the factories to form scratch battalions as a cause for these problems.

Further reports point fingers to what appear to be a conspiracy of war profiteering with many employers failing to pay out wages or ration cards.\n\nField Marshal Schörner issued a damning statement today an hour ahead of the scheduled Führer address.

Following the Field Marshal, Germany's loyal Generals took their place either side of a red carpet leading to a great podium erected in the Großer Platz.\n\nThe Germania philharmonic orchestra struck up Wagner's 'Die Walküre' as 100 spotlights illuminated the gathering darkness in pillars of light, recalling the 1935 party rally. At this signal, a flight of helicopters swooped over the Avenue of Splendours, with the Führer's own helicopter landing gracefully in the Großer Platz. To cries of "Heil Göring" the Führer made his way to the podium, receiving the salute of the assembled Generals. Retiring General Rommel then presented the Führer with the keys to Germania, formally welcoming the Führer to his rightful place in the capital.\n\nThe Führer then made his first official address to the nation.

In some of the largest gatherings of non-military persons in several years, the Humboldt University Students' Union has gathered near and around the Kleiner Tiergarten. According to local reports the gathering is largely peaceful with the exception of loud chanting and terrible youth music.\n\nThe Führer's office has surprisingly declined to issue a statement on the student protests.

Göring had not had the chance to indulge himself in such a manner since before the Civil War, and this occasion was the perfect opportunity to present his grandeur as the new master of Germany to the people, and more importantly, to the military.\n\nNormally, the promotion of an officer, even an exceptional one as was the case here, would not call for such pageantry. Or at least that would be the state of affairs under Hitler, but Göring was not Hitler, and that was no secret. His passion for opulence and appearance was a critical factor in all that he did and now that he was free to do as he pleased, public events would become much more frequent and much more grandiose. Besides, the Führer wished to celebrate those officers who had served him so well against the traitors.\n\nHans Speidel called from a roll, "Johannes Steinhoff, step forward." Speidel's presence was supremely important. These were the officers that were selected to counterbalance Schörner's clique, whether for their support for Göring or Speidel didn't matter as long as they were not lackeys of the Chief of the OKW. The man that had just called up was one of those handpicked by the Führer himself. Steinhoff, like himself, had the blood of a pilot through and through, and Göring had already marked him as one to keep close by his side. This promotion would allow the much-deserving man to lead the Luftwaffe to glory as now that Göring was above personally directing its actions. More importantly, it would give Göring a much-needed reprieve from the duties of the office.\n\nThe Führer smiled as he placed the shoulder straps of a General der Luftwaffe on Steinhoff's uniform and gave him an almost paternal pat on the back as the newly-minted general moved to retake his seat. Göring would make the Wehrmacht his own, officer by officer. Speidel checked Steinhoff's name, and moved to the next one down."

When Adolf was alive he had envied the position of the leader of all the Reich, but now that he had it? Well he certainly didn't begrudge the authority, but he was not a fan of all the work.\n\nThe lisping voice of a man brought him out of his task. It was Steinhoff. Anyone else and Göring would have thrown them out, but if the head of his Luftwaffe wanted a meeting, then he could overlook the interruption.\n\nGöring gave one more look over of the baton before addressing the waiting general, "Yes, Herr Steinhoff? What brings you to my office this fine day? Does the Luftwaffe need more funding again? I told you, you don't need to come to me for anything else. All you have to do is take what you want."\n\nSteinhoff shook his head, pushed his sunglasses back up to fully cover his eyes, "Err, no my Führer, it's a matter of foreign affairs actually. Herr Axmann agreed that you would probably want to know that we've reestablished contact with Feldmarschall Milch in Madagaskar." That got Göring's attention.\n\n"Hmmm... I see.

Still, I had the utmost faith in your skills as a commander and was not surprised to hear that you triumphed over the rat Maurice and the upstart natives and Jews.\n\nI understand that you must be very weary of being trapped in such a precarious situation and I am here to offer all the support of the Reich and reestablishing German order in Madagaskar. You and your garrison will be allowed back into the Pakt and granted full reprieve and rest after your great service to the Reich and its people.\n\nPlease accept Erhard, I would be delighted to host you for a time at Carinhall. Of course, should you refuse, I am afraid I cannot guarantee your safety at that point. The Reich requires the island, and it will have it one way or another. I would prefer it to be on friendly terms.\n\nYour old friend,\nHermann Göring, Reichsmarschall and Führer of the Greater German Reich"\n\nMilch read through the letter once more, hardly believing it. He had half convinced himself that he would never be free of this damned island but here it was, a way out at long last. Sure, it had been Göring who had gotten him stuck here in the first place, but at the time that had seemed like a mercy compared to what the racial purists had wanted.

His old friend had been quiet for most of the tour, only giving the courtesy-required greetings but nothing more. He looked quite tired and frankly malnourished, although Göring had decided not to bring it up for politeness' sake.\n\nThe reestablishment of Reichskommissariat Madagaskar had not gone entirely as smoothly as he had hoped to be honest. The XVI. Armeekorps had been dispatched to relieve the skeleton garrison and had immediately been set upon by rebel bands still active across the island. At least with the island's airfields retaken they could launch air raids against known hideouts but still, it was shaping up to be a long and difficult slog.\n\nMilch clearly had needed some time to rest, and so Göring had relieved him of his duties and placed his second-in-command Werner Goldberg in charge for the time being. Officially it was only going to be a temporary vacation but seeing Milch in person had made Göring doubt if the man would ever willingly return to the island. Ah well, that was a hassle for another day."

Schörner's words might have been a humorous quip from the mouth of anyone else, but the man did not even crack a smirk. Göring was mentally comparing his top general to an iceberg when Steinhoff jumped into the conversation.\n\n"I'm afraid I must side with Marshal Speidel here; we simply don't have the ability to support ground operations in Madagaskar. The closest airfields are on the African mainland and we haven't had access to those since the South African War. Our forces would be easily pinned down and left to die."\n\nSchörner scowled, and Göring was sure he heard the word "coward" muttered. If anyone else had heard they were keeping it to themselves for the moment.\n\nAll eyes turned to Puttkamer, who had not uttered a word the entire meeting. He did not appreciate the looks, and quickly moved to shift responsibility, "I will support whatever plan the Führer goes with, it's not my place to judge when he is present."\n\nBoth Schörner and Speidel groaned, but the admiral did have a point. None of their arguments with each other mattered so long as Göring had the final say. They didn't need to ask the question obviously in their minds. There was no point in drawing this out any further, he had made his choice anyways."

A fine organization indeed, but then again I hardly need to tell you that of all people." Axmann chuckled politely, wondering where this was headed.\n\n"Well anyhow," Göring picked up his place again, "the HJ was all well in good but it was made to serve Adolf you understand.

They weren't the Führer, they weren't in charge, and they weren't being promoted. Let them sulk, Göring thought to himself as he watched his uncle ascend to the dais where he had presided as president under the late Hitler. He would show them that he too could lead armies across Europe and beyond. What could they do but sit and watch. Sure, they might play tough and kings of the hill but at the end of the day it was his uncle whose word was law of the land and it was Heinrich who could sway his uncle.\n\nHe tried not to let his smile show as his uncle invited him to stand beside him, to bask in the glory of the occasion as the assembled delegates of the party cheered and cheered.

While most of the army's upper echelons are divided bitterly between rival cliques, most notably those of Schorner and Speidel, the "New Guard" as they have been nicknamed are much less factional. That is not to say they are apolitical, but it cannot be denied that most of the newcomers have chosen not to favor any one side too heavily.\n\nWhile this has been a blow to the clique leaders, always in need of more allies, it is hopefully a sign that the age of militarists leveraging immense political power may be coming to an end.

However such a landing would lead to our main forces pushing through difficult terrain in Florida and it taking some time before we capture meaningful territory.\n\nAnother proposal which has fewer supporters is that a daring invasion be made in Connecticut, with the aim of launching a blitzkrieg down to capture New York and then cutting off Boston in the north. Organized from Greenland and Iceland, this would get us into the meat of the US faster, but would undoubtedly be more difficult both on the ground and on the ocean.

As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler.

In fact, I thought that would be what you would say there- it's what you highlighted in your speech."\n\n"Oh, yes, of course. Centralizing the research body. Yes, that's a big reason, too." Göring stuttered out. Osenberg eyed him suspiciously for a moment before shrugging it off. "A toast to the new future of German science?" Göring stood.\n\nOsenberg smiled and rose from his chair, and the two glasses clinked together merrily."

Nobody was really surprised by this development, but for it to have happened this quickly? Not a good sign for the future.\n\n"Generalleutnant Remer, I don't see why the Feltgrau we currently used must have such a sweeping overhaul. It has proven capable in the field. Such a motion seems like a simple waste of time to me." Mumbles of agreement rippled through the civilian side of the table, as Osenberg leaned back in his chair. Remer scowled and leaned into the table.\n\n"Do you not understand that we must advance in all fields, Herr Osenberg? The Reich must lead the world on all fronts, not just weaponry. If our men are not hidden, what use is their weaponry, or their machinery? No, we must forge ahead, no matter the cost. You look too much at the Reichsmarks and not enough at the materials, Osenberg. I know many of our highest ranking military men would approve of such a change, and they know the art of war more than you, if I may say so." Chuckles and clapping from the generals. Osenberg did not move.\n\n"Generalleutnant, I just don't see the point of it. Nobody except for the OKH and yourself is clamoring for a change. This will cost millions to research."\n\n"Well, why don't we put it to a vote then? See what this committee thinks. That is the point of it, is it not?" Remer smiled."

However, there were two letters in particular that Göring was waiting on- a letter from the OKH, located in Germania, and a letter from the Kriegsmarine, located in Theoderichshafen . When the two came in one day, Göring sidelined all other priorities to read them.\n\nIt had been quite the pain to wrestle the two high commands into handing over their R&D departments. While Schörner's followers seemed more than eager to get started on their projects, Schörner himself was uncharacteristically cautious on the matter, attempting to convince his followers to not dive headlong into their projects. Göring sighed at the thought of it- it seemed Schörner had at least seen that there was something going on behind the scenes. Hopefully, thought Göring, his heart will win out over his brain.\n\nSimilarly, much of the Speidelite faction seemed happy enough to gain more control over research efforts, but Speidel seemed to be suspicious of such a blatant move to placate the military. Göring had to give credit where credit was due- Speidel was no slouch when it came to brains, and he could tell that Göring was not showing his full hand.\n\nIn any case, both branches had been quite evenly split on their support or opposition to the GRWI. Perhaps it was why these letters had taken so long to arrive. In any case, Göring hoped for the best as he tore the first one open.

Finally, his dream for the Reich's science was coming together. "I'd like you all to give a similar welcome to my co-chair and colleague, Generalleutnant Otto Remer." Remer stood to a similar level of applause, though it was clearly concentrated more on the general's side of the table. Osenberg smiled, but one could tell it was a bit forced if they looked hard enough- Remer was Schörner's way of keeping his thumb on research, and was certainly going to be a pain to deal with. Nothing is perfect, Osenberg thought.\n\nWhen Remer's applause died down, Osenberg began to speak. "Our first topic will be on the subject of the standard infantry rifle. This is less on the quality of our current rifle and more on our quantity of them. Many of our frontline soldiers are still equipped with older models of rifle- I've even heard reports that some are carrying G43's. This is unacceptable, but the question is how we go about fixing it. My suggestion is that we transfer guns from the garrisons to make up the deficit, build some new ones, and replace the oldest guns with newer models to make up the gap. It won't fully solve our issues, but it will be economically sound. All in favor?"\n\nMumbling and debate rumbled across the table. Osenberg watched- he never expected such a suggestion to be a unanimous agreement- but he let out a small sigh when Remer got to his feet.\n\n"I must respectfully disagree, Herr Osenberg." Remer said with a grin. "We can't let our armies, the prides of the Reich, be equipped with suboptimal equipment any longer, in my opinion. We must be better armed than our opponents, shouldn't we? I propose that we devote as many resources as possible to rearming our soldiers with the best the Reich has, no matter the cost. No soldier should die because he must carry a bolt-action into battle!"\n\nMore applause.

Brilliant agility, great speed, and the firepower to destroy anything the Americans and Japanese can muster. If the project goes ahead, I can guarantee that this will only bolster our armies." The scientist stuttered. Göring did not address these remarks, instead turning to Osenberg, who had still not moved.\n\n"Herr Osenberg, what do you make of this design?" Göring asked.\n\n"It's terrible." Osenberg grunted.\n\n"What about it?" Göring replied.\n\n"Shit, Hermann, look at the fucking thing. Two guns? The terrible armor? The weight? It's as big as a than a Tiger and half as useful. There's nothing good in it."\n\nThe scientist began to defend himself, but Göring cut him off with a wave of his hand. "No, no, Werner, I don't think you see the potential here. It's a blueprint- a prototype, isn't it?" Göring kept going before the man could answer. "Sure, there are flaws, but I see a lot of potential in this. Can you imagine the American reaction to getting run over by twin-gunned heavy tanks at 70 kilometers an hour?" He turned to the engineer, addressing him directly for the first time this meeting. "Tell your men to get to work on this Liger. I'm confident in your success.

He asked.\n\n"Our efforts to improve upon the original Liger design have hit a small snag. We've improved upon the engine- it's got more power, more speed, and can push the tank along at a quicker pace."\n\n"So what's the catch?" Osenberg asked. He had a feeling he could already guess, but he wanted to hear it from the man himself.\n\n"To produce this new engine, we'll need more time and more money. If you refuse, we'll do what we can to streamline the production of the old engine, but the speed of the tank may be a bit. . .less."\n\nOsenberg sighed again. He could already see it now- the Liger, an expensive money sink, a complete waste of time, and he'd catch all the blame for it. No matter that he was against the project from the start- Göring sure as hell wouldn't take the fall for him, friendly as the two were. Of course, perhaps the fundamental issues of the Liger could be fixed- or at least mitigated- with enough money and development. Who knows, perhaps it could become something workable. Asking for more time and more money would be a pain, but if it saved the project, maybe it was worth it.\n\nOsenberg turned back to the man, his mind made up.

His gaze lingered on the guns the longest, as if he could already imagine the cannons obliterating American tanks. The three men crewing the prototype watched closely as the Führer continued his loop around the tank, taking in every last bit of it. Finally, he motioned to his aides, and the party of officials departed for a nearby hill, from which they would observe the tests.\n\nIn a moment, the tank revved its engine and sped down the course. Göring watched intensely, gazing through the pair of binoculars he had been provided with. Occasionally, he'd make a side comment to one of the engineers, praising the speed of the tank or commenting on its majestic appearance. However, as the test went on, the praise began to fade.\n\nThe Liger, despite its beginning appearance, seemed to struggle as the test continued. The tank was only able to complete its shooting at a pace that barely trailed the Leopard, despite the twin guns' supposed strength. The engine, which once launched the Liger around the trials in a flash, began to pour black smoke. In a final coup de grâce, the Liger turned to fire upon its final targets, only for the first gun to be blown out of its mounting, flipping backward and tearing through the roof of the tank before slamming to a halt in the soft mud. The ensuing explosion obliterated the crew cabin and all the unlucky men inside.\n\nThe lead engineer instinctively looked over for the Führer's reaction.

Inwardly, however, his mind was shot through and through with panic.\n\nThe plan that he and Göring had hammered out seemed to be going accordingly so far, but so many things could go wrong. If Schörner found out, the result could be catastrophic. If the plan was leaked, it would prove a massive embarrassment to Göring's administration. Even if the plan went correctly, what if Schörner and Remer managed to pass the blame themselves? It would eventually find its way back to the GRWI, if not Osenberg himself, and then he would have another mess to deal with. Besides, how much had keeping the Liger's poor performance secret from the military already cost the Reich? Bribing that many people paid a hefty price, and there was no guarantee that one hadn't snitched.\n\nOsenberg realized that the people around his chair were now looking at him, and he snapped out of his thoughts.

There was a silence between the two- something becoming all too common these days. Finally, Göring spoke up, still facing the window. "Is there a correlation between the drugs and the attacks?"\n\nOsenberg rolled his eyes. "No, it's within the normal ups and downs of attacks. The issue is that the numbers haven't dropped. There's been no effect. We've spent millions on this for no reason, and now we just look like fools. I've heard some worries from the military about our spending habits.

Soon enough, these circles began to run into each other, and the theories only grew wilder from there as each realized that, no, they weren't alone. The whispers tore through divisions like wildfire, the theories as to what the drugs were doing growing more and more outlandish by the day. Suddenly, it was thought that Göring was trying to poison his enemies, that Osenberg was setting up for a coup, that Schörner was planning an execution of those who disliked him, that the Jews had infiltrated the highest ranks of the Reich and were planning a mass mind control campaign to destroy Nazism. All of these theories ran almost purely on conjecture and hypothesis, but that was all it took to buffett the conspiracy to even higher levels.\n\nWhen the first reports of the controversy hit Göring's desk, it was already far too late to stop the rumors. Nothing he could say would end the spiraling theories- if anything, they would only make them worse. Worst of all, Schörner undoubtedly had gotten wind of this as well, and had certainly made a plan to blow it all up in the Führer's face.

Göring said nothing- he knew Speidel already knew the answer. "Not only that, Hermann, but Schörner contacted me with the same concerns! You made me work with Schörner, Hermann. Schörner! I hate the son of a bitch and he hates me! Do you have any idea how rare it is for Schörner and I to cooperate on something?"\n\n"Yes, I'm quite aware." Hermann muttered, his eyes cast low, fixated on a suddenly intriguing piece of paper on his desk. Speidel continued, but Göring no longer listened- he was too busy contemplating just how greatly he had erred. This had not blown up in his face- it had undergone nuclear fusion. With Speidel's clique now aligned against him along with Schörner's clique, was there anyone left in the army who trusted him?\n\nSpeidel left with a slam of the door, leaving Göring alone to ponder Osenberg's words of caution- and curse himself for not listening to them."

It is unknown what the overall strategic goals of the mission was, in regards to the plans of the Partisans. It has been suggested that it was some variant of a suicide mission, where a commando unit was to disable or damage the safety system in order to cause a chain reaction within the power plant. This would cause a type of reaction that would expel enormous amounts of radioactive energy into the atmosphere, leaving the surrounding area virtually uninhabitable. In the worst case scenario, these irradiated particles could reach Germania, in less than three months.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that the commando units were simply trying to disable the Power Plant as a whole, to cripple the energy supply of the Reichskommissariat. Whatever the case, the workers of the power plant managed to activate the safety systems, before a critical error could occur. The partisan group did not manage to defeat the reinforcements to the Plant's security, however they could not be captured for interrogation. The current casualty count is six partisan commandos, three security units and fourteen workers. No men from the reinforcements were hurt in the fighting.\n\nWorkers of the Power Plant have reported that the safety systems did not perform to their recommended timescale, and were significantly behind the expected time schedule. Workers have previously  complained of the outdated equipment to their superiors, however nothing was done.

In his assignment to Afrika Schörner had been able to act unopposed in his schemes at taking control of the Reich for himself. Speidel didn't understand why he needed to gain this much control.

A bloodless battle has broken out amongst the officer corps as the various factions begin to maneuver in the wake of this disgrace.

While the militarists' faith in the Führer didn't grow stronger as we hoped, they are not very unhappy about it neither, which is at least acceptable for our current situation. Indeed, there is still someone murmuring about our performance during the war in darkness, but most soldiers aren't buying it.\n\nEventually, in the everywhere of the Reich, life continues as usual.

While such an victory cannot be compared with those great victories we achieved before, the first victory against the western powers after the civil war has still made people passionate about what we're going to achieve in the future.

His face was a dusky red, bordering on an unhealthy purple as every vein in his forehead protruded grotesquely. It was, however, the man's eyes that most stood out to witnesses. They were orbs, cracked with deep red lines and filled with an unnatural fire, some kind of primordial fury that threatened to burn the man who bore them inside out. Hüttig was not facing his approaching demise with anything close to dignity, but perhaps that was only fair.\n\nHe had been pulled after all, half conscious, from a makeshift brig in one of the Reich's ships that had fled the lost continent Africa. The continent that had been lost by him, or so the Reich had claimed, thus explaining his treatment. Still, if they had hoped to pacify the former colonial governor, they had made a massive mistake. The confinement had only given the man more time to reflect inward into his own dark, distrubed mind. For the days and nights he had spent at sea, only eating the meager rations his former allies had allowed him, he drifted further and further into a black abyss of madness. Every layer of mental safeguard, every justification for serving the Reich, every ideal he had devoted his brutish life to, each was stripped away in painful turn.\n\nAnd so at last when he found himself once more under the white hot light of the yellow sun, it was as a malignant husk of his former self. Capable only of hatred for his betrayers and the degenerates he imagined were surrounding him even now, coherent conversation was nearly impossible. Only the rantings and ravings of a man who had stared deep into the abyss, and had seen the abyss stare back."

It was not one of those marvelous and expensive machines the Luftwaffe had been toying with nor was it even as sleek as any of the private crafts the corporate big-wigs were so fond of. No, this was an older, but also far more durable model that had been built for use in the African Reichskommisars. This was the personal vehicle of Siegfried Müller.\n\nThe craft's landing was... not graceful by any stretch, bumping twice and skidding half a foot. Göring fleetingly wondered if the pilot was drunk. He hoped the former Reichskommisar was unharmed. Still, he reminded himself, if the man could survive the South African War and a run from the OFN for the past several months, a little jostling wouldn't be the end of him. He was brought out from his thoughts by the sound of the 330 Puma's cockpit door opening. From the pilot's seat hopped a man in the dress of a common mercenary, a Sturmgewehr 45 slung over one shoulder; it was Siegfried Müller himself! Only moments before the Führer had been annoyed by the mediocre landing, but that was all forgotten now. The Führer gave a non-formal salute that Müller did not even bother returning, but Göring didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n"Herr Müller, it is so good to finally see you in person again! I had no idea you had taught yourself to fly helicopters during your time in Africa. It was most impressive to watch you in the sky if I may say."\n\nMüller flashed the smile that had won him adoring fans all across the Reich, "Why thank you my Führer. Yes, I did pick up some skills in my time, mostly for the purpose of getting to hunting spots you see, but I am thrilled to have impressed the great Reichsmarschall himself."\n\n"Hunting, yes I did know you were quite an exceptional marksman. We ought to hunt together at Schorfheide. You will come to Carinhall and stay a while to rest won't you?"\n\n"If it's you asking me then I would be delighted sir.""

Such a move will serve both as a reminder for the three mainland Reichskommissars that they have an ultimate loyalty to the Führer even if that position may have changed hands, but at the same time will make an excellent snub to those pathetic nations that were utterly embarrassed in their efforts to back South Africa.\n\nThe question now is where Führer Göring should head. Siegfried Müller in Zentralafrika would no doubt be able to regale the leader of the Reich with tales of exotic hunts and daring mercenary adventures. Schenck's shared experience in the sky with Göring will surely make for many enjoyable evenings spent in nostalgia. Hans Hüttig of Ostafrika may not be much of a conversationalist or host, but he did do the most to achieve this latest victory for the German people and deserves proper congratulations.

The Führer reflected upon the fact that his host, who had been quite sullen and quiet up until this point, had almost seemed to come back alive when the topic of flying was mentioned. Göring had never considered himself a clairvoyant in matters of the heart, but even he was adept enough to recognize that the man was clearly more at home amongst the clouds than in an office. Perhaps, the Führer thought inwardly, he could have been such a man if things had gone differently.\n\n"So I've been told you were born here in South West Africa under the old Imperial colony?"\n\n"Yes my Führer, in Windhoek."\n\n"I see, I see. Did you know that my late father was the first colonial commissioner here? I suppose we both have our connections to one another, both in the lands we are tied to and the professions we have chosen."\n\n"You are no doubt right my Führer, but I must confess I believe I share nothing of your ability to lead others, much less a nation."\n\n"Perhaps," Göring mused, clearly appreciating the flattery, "but we cannot all be Führer material can we? We all must have our part to play in the hierarchy of life just and just as there is an apex predator in every food chain, I was simply destined to serve the German people as their leader." Schenck said nothing to the self-adulation billowing forth from his leader's mouth in a cloak of faux-modesty.\n\n"Er, my Führer," Schecnk seemed somewhat reluctant to speak, "perhaps some time soon we could discuss a possible change in my position? I must admit that I do not truly feel up to this most important of tasks any longer..."\n\nGöring nodded, but his attention was fixed on the trays of food being brought in by the native servants."

Yes, he was in charge of the Imperial colony of Sudwestafrika and much like you he had the burden of bringing civilization to this poor excuse for a continent."\n\nNothing. Not even an acknowledgement that he had heard Göring speak. If the man had not been responsible for the recent victory in the war the Führer would seriously consider having him removed and sent to wallow behind a desk deep in the Wolfsschanze. So far, Göring thought, the only thing that had made this visit even semi-bearable was the excellent cognac that Hüttig had provided. It was frankly astonishing to the former Reichsmarschall that a man with such an unpleasantly austere personality would keep such a collection. He made a mental note to carry off as much as he could upon his return to Germania.\n\nJust as the Führer was beginning to lose all hope of ever getting his "companion" to engage in any sort of discussion, the Ostafrikan Reichskommissar seemed to burst into a frenzy of animated movement and speech like a jack-in-the-box springing out.\n\n"My Führer! My Führer it is good to finally be able to talk to you in person!" Göring was about to return the compliment but Hüttig did not let up, "We must talk about the others... I have very important information regarding them... very important information!" His words came in staccato bursts like the fire from a sturmgewehr. Göring was completely taken aback.\n\n"Herr Hüttig, please, settle down. If you have something so serious to discuss, I am sure we can talk it over at some other time in a more official capacity."\n\nThe words seemed to snap Hüttig back to reality, or so Göring believed when the man stopped his infernal shouting. As the Führer handed his host a glass of the cognac and began to attempt to entertain him with old war stories, he did not notice the dark, almost glassy look that had now settled on the disturbed zealot. He similarly failed to notice the twitching of the man's eyes, or the curling of the man's fists."

While the two bon-vivants were carousing, General Wilhelm von Thoma took the chance to converse with his former superior, the now retired Generalfeldmarschall Rommel.\n\n"You know," von Thoma offered, his voice noticeably charged with emotion, "I never forgot what you taught us in North Africa sir, and I never let my men forget it either."\n\nThe words of praise clearly affected the old warrior. "Herr Thoma, it means more to me than you could guess to hear that I had some value to the future soldiers of my Fatherland. It brings me some comfort in my twilight years."\n\n"Herr Rommel!

Inspect the tanks again? No, he had done that too many times since the Civil War had ended and it was getting stale. Head to the opera? He liked that one but Schörner would be too furious to make it worth it. Design a new wing for Carinhall? Now that sounded enjoyable but what if...?\n\nHe sprang from his seat in a flash of inspiration and snatched up one of the many phones for the numerous important connections he had to call into on a daily basis.

Good, good, put him on quick."\n\nQuiet blanketed the room for a few minutes while the heavyset dictator waited with barely contained excitement. Then, a new voice came through the other end of the line.\n\n"My Führer," Rommel's voice was still professional as ever, even in retirement, "how can I be of assistance to you?"\n\nGöring's face pulled into an almost impish grin, "Herr Rommel, pack your things, I'm going on a tour of our African lands and I want you to join me."\n\n"I - I suppose I couldn't refuse such a request from my Führer, now could I?"\n\nGöring's mask of geniality collapsed for a moment.

Moving to the center of activity, occasionally giving a hurried "Heil Göring!" to a passing officer, Steinhoff advanced to where he knew the Führer would be.\n\nHe found him, his face a dark red, in a state more furious and terrible than he had observed since the close of the Civil War. He was on the phone, and he was shouting, almost screaming down the line.\n\n"Tell Puttkamer I want a cordon established around their ports by the end of the week! Nothing gets in and nothing comes out without our approval and knowledge, do you understand me?" Without waiting for a reply, the dictator slammed the receiver down, hanging up.\n\nSteinhoff adjusted his sunglasses back to position nervously, "So, I take it that the rumors are true then?"\n\nGöring almost snarled at his air chief, "They are!

What's important is that we destroy him, we turn his ridiculous fucking 'Reichsstaat' into dust and ashes.

I wish that I could stand before you today and say that the war ended with all of our noble aims fulfilled.\n\nI cannot say that however, because that would be false, and I have vowed to never speak an untrue word to the German people so long as I remain Führer. It is true, our battle has ended indecisively, without clear victory for our people. However, this does not mean we can simply give up now! Quite the opposite, we must redouble our efforts to the spread and preservation of our people and National Socialism across the world. Our outposts in Africa have been battered, but they still remain intact, our dreams shall not die until the last Aryan has perished from the earth.\n\nRest assured that those who have failed the Reich will be given their just deserts, and let this serve as an example to all those who serve the German nation: this is what happens when you fail! Even in failure however, we gain strength, just as we gained inner strength from the travesty of Versailles to embrace the truth of National Socialism, it is my belief that this momentary setback will be looked back upon in similar fashion. When future historians chronicle us, they will write of this as the moment a reborn German people, still scarred from the flames of civil strife, recommitted themselves to taking their rightful place.

Göring was taken aback by this sudden statement. "You can't just do that!"\n\n"I can, and I'm doing it right now."\n\n"Speidel, think this through. Do you know-" Göring looked around his office, half-expecting Schörner to be hiding behind a potted plant. "What that crazy bastard will do with you gone? I know that you're more... professional than him and won't make a massive fuss out of this. Come on, Speidel." Speidel hadn't thought of that. He swallowed his pride and spoke again."

The event was reported to have been massive, blocking most of the roads of the city in an extravagant display of military strength. Führer Göring has reportedly been very impressed with the Schild's troops, commenting that "they might have to train ours instead of us training them". After the parade, Göring congratulated multiple politicians from the victorious countries on their military strength, especially Ostafrika. The small number of Ostafrikan officials present received these comments well before hurrying off. While praise was primarily directed at Ostafrika, the other nations seemed to like the Führer's comments as well, and many speculate that the colonies and the Reich proper may grow closer soon."

As per your orders, a band of our Werewolves was deployed to arrest their garrison at Hitlerstadt. Unfortunately, something or someone must have tipped them off, because they were ready for the attempt. Without even giving our soldiers a warning, they opened fire and killed three of our men in the first volley. I am told that they then commenced a running gun battle to Lake Viktoria where they captured some of our transports and made west for the coast.\n\nAfter tending to the wounded and taking some time to receive nearby reinforcements, the Werewolf unit attempted to head the fleeing Wehrmacht soldiers off at locations around the Dam, Brazzaville, and Leopoldville. Unfortunately, the unit proved unsuccessful at sinking any of the transports and inflicting more than superficial casualties while losing several men in the process. It seems that a major, fatal blow to the effort was struck when the Werewolf unit leader Hauptmann Friedrich von Tannenburg was killed in a skirmish at the Dam.\n\nUpon reaching the coast the small river transports headed north and we may yet catch them at one of the docks as they search for ocean-going vessels but I fear they have eluded us. I am aware of my failure in this important mission and greatly regret it.\n\n\nHEIL HÜTTIG!\n-KOLONIALWALVERWALTER OTTO FÖRSCHNER"

Patrol the African coast and prevent anyone from leaving or entering the Grossafrikaner Reichsstaat? Who would want to get into that hellhole? It wasn't like anyone was trying to do business with the madman in Quelimane. That much at least was certain; the crew of U-3122 hadn't seen even the outline of a foreign convoy yet.\n\nSchultz had gone to the captain with his questions, but the skipper hadn't been any more in the know than his crew. He had told Friedrich that the order had come directly from Grossadmiral Puttkammer himself. Well, Schultz wasn't an officer, but he wasn't stupid either. If the order was coming from that high up on the chain then it must have originated with the Führer. That still didn't get him any closer to the truth unfortunately, and it seemed like the mystery was going to remain as such.\n\nSchultz wiped the sweat from his brow again.

Instead of the company of his needle, however, he found himself with the less pleasant company of Reinhard Gehlen, who eagerly awaited the Führer's commands. "Huttig's gone mad." Göring began, sharply, though he was certain Gehlen already knew of the situation. "If he believes his 'Greater African Reich' can keep the savages in line without our help, he's more than welcome to try. Though he'll have a difficult time at it, if I have anything to say about it. This insult to National Socialism should not be permitted to stand, not for a moment longer than it has to." Göring continued. When he had first heard the news, Göring's mind had immediately flown to ousting the upstart and overtaking the dark continent with German boots. Surely, that was the route some of the militarists would have preferred, but Göring knew that at this stage, it was impractical. "Make the phone calls and payments you must, Gehlen. I wish to be sure that Hüttig knows what it means to make an enemy in Germania." Though he spoke calmly, it was easy to see the rage behind Göring's eyes.\n\nIn contrast, one could see nothing behind Gehlen's sunglasses as he curtly nodded towards the most powerful man in Europe. "Right away, my Führer." It would be a simple task, to capitalize on the many problems that already existed in German Africa. It would not be difficult for a man of Gehlen's talents to bring Hüttig's abomination to the ground. After making sure Göring had nothing else to share with him, Gehlen turned, moving to leave the room. Before the door closed, the Führer gave one last order to the man."

Is your mother in today?"\n\nThe man, in a quiet and non-committal manner, responded flatly. "No, she is away tending her poppy garden." The agent watched as Von Hassel deflated a bit, now more at ease now that the man's identity was confirmed. The Abwehr agent continued, undeterred. "Let us not mince words, Herr. What precisely do you require from my employer? Guns? Bombs?"\n\nVon Hassel paused for a moment. He had spoken with several Zentralafrikan generals, most unhappy with the SS's coup over Africa. Few had been willing to commit to anything solid, however. Von Hassel's career in the Abwehr meant little to soldiers, who were committed to following the orders of their fellows. The Belgian industrialists in the area, however, would prove much more tractable as an ally. Hüttig's authoritarian, strictly national style of rule had chafed them and hurt their bottom line.

He supposed he could endure the utter humiliation of it for a few months more, if it meant that the empire Hüttig had stolen was razed entirely to the ground.\n\nHis thoughts gathered, Göring listened as Gehlen spoke. "A group of men loyal to Germania, led by a particular Herr von Hessel, will work to subvert Hüttig at every moment." Gehlen did not smile, but the Führer imagined he was very satisfied with his own work. "Eventually, they will make a move against the government. Either we will have Africa in our hands once more, or the resulting chaos will lead to a total collapse of Hüttig's regime in the area."\n\nGöring was keen enough to pick up the implication that it would likely be the latter of the two possibilities. "Let him keep the ruins of his hell-state, if he's so damn attached to it." The Führer declared, though he was not so happy about the potential loss as he attempted to seem.

Something was certainly up, although the Luftwaffe staff officer couldn't begin to fathom what would cause the Führer to appear as such. It hadn't even been a few months since the last meeting when he had been red with rage, his eyes burning with venom for the traitor Hüttig and the loss of Africa.\n\nIt was only when Gerhard moved in close enough to see the map halfway between the Führer and Feldmarschall Schorner that he understood what was going on. It was a battleplan map, with lines crossing every which way but all ending in bloody arrows stabbing into the heart of the continent. Gerhard suppressed a gasp. This was impossible, insanity. He wished he had possessed his superior's dark sunglasses to hide the doubt in his eyes, but with any luck he would just be ignored as usual as long as he kept silent.\n\nSteinhoff unfortunately had no such luxury. The air chief meandered over to his leader and with his usual slight rasp questioned, "My Führer, do my eyes deceive me, or is that a plan of attack against the so called Reichsstaat sitting on the table? I was under the impression that we had decided against any such effort."\n\nHe spoke to the Führer, but Gerhard could just make out the shadows of his lidless eyes turn towards the OKW chief.\n\n"That's just the thing Steinhoff!" Goring almost bellowed, exuberant, "After discussing the matter with Schorner, I have decided to put any attempts at reclamation on hold, for now. In return, the Generalfeldmarcshall has so considerately drawn up these plans for me. Aren't they grand?"\n\nGerhard attempted to feign disinterest, but he had the uncomfortable feeling that Remer could sense the deception from across the table.

This would've been the perfect opportunity to showcase a renewed German might following the pain of the Bürgerkrieg, and that idiot had Hüttig botched it. He had thrown thousands of German soldiers, precious resources in their own right, into the meat grinder. And this was what he had to show for it? Unacceptable! Göring paced around his office.\n\nThis was an international relations disaster. Thanks to Hüttig, would the OFN simply strike at the weakened Reich? Would it extend its Judeo-Bolshevik tendrils further into Europe? Africa had been lost; what was next: Italy? Sweden? Finland? His mind raced with nightmares of a surrounded Reich unable to reassert its power.\n\nWith slow, deliberate breaths, the Führer calmed himself. This was a temporary setback, nothing more. The OFN had won the battle, but not the Cold War. This was all explainable by the Reich's still fragile position thanks to the traitors, no need to overthink it.

And yet, for all that, his eyes still burned with the same disturbing light that they always had.\n\n"What was that?" came from one of the prisoner's guards, his rifle to the ground but always angled so that in an instant he could put a round into Hüttig if needed.\n\n"I said," Hüttig began, his voice icy with contempt, "that you are all degenerates. Every last one of you who would treat a man who has devoted his entire life to the cause of the Aryan people like this."\n\nThe guard looked inquiringly at Goring, asking for permission to simply end the madman's ravings. The Führer shook his head, "Let him say what he wants Franz. It's not like he can do anything anyways." A slight smile crept across the Führer's face as he spoke the last line, sure of his absolute power.\n\nHüttig continued to rant as he was led towards the courtyard's wall, "You are the traitors here, not me. I served the Reich, the ideals of National Socialism, what do you serve Herr Goring? Whatever the generals want? Whatever fills your pockets? How can the Aryan people have fallen so low as to follow such scum? The Reich does not deserve to survive with you degenerates at its head!"\n\nGoring grunted, the man simply would not shut up. "Franz," he motioned lazily to the guard, "finish this embarrassment off please."\n\nWith an enthusiastic nod, Franz raised his rifle and fired off a quick series of shots. Hüttig groaned and started to sway, but managed to right himself from falling. The holes in his chest pulsed angry and red, fatal shots, but the man's sheer rage pushed him on.\n\n"Incompetent degenerates! The Reich is doomed to die with you and your masters in the Wehrmacht at the helm! It deserves whatever end you bring it, I'd rather see it burn then with such degeneracy in control. I would've...

goering.707.desc:0 "Göring sat alone in his chambers, with but a tumbler of whiskey in his hand, silently contemplating the latest fiasco which Iberia once again revealed to the world. With the Italians out of Algeria and the government in Algiers at tatters, the Caudillos thought they could finallyclaim this land as theirs- and who better to govern this new fiefdom than their long-time lackey, Yves-Guerin Seraç, as leader of a French-minority military government? Göring smirked- this arrangement could go wrong in so many ways. And go wrong it did: Seraç didn't even bother to get comfortable in his new post before he denounced his overlords and established the State of Algeria as an independent entity on world politics. The idiots- they really need to learn to pick their subordinates.\n\nNot that he was in too enviable a position either. His own "subordinates" were already encircling the young warlord like hawks, fighting amongst themselves as to how to deal with him. Some believed that Seraç's clique would prove a valuable lapdog for the Reich, safeguarding the region's oil deposits and providing fresh untermenschen to throw in the front lines that would otherwise have been pure blooded Germans; others yet are disgusted at the idea of once again allowing collaborators to partake in Germany's moment of greatness, and insist on crushing all resistance and setting a new Reichskommisariat that will ensure all affairs are handled by proper German hands.\n\nSo Göring was left with a decision to make; a luxury he didn't get too often anymore. Personally he had way more important things to tend to right now than another shithole in Africa- and in a way, that made the prospect of just collaborating with Seraç and letting him do the dirty work very tempting. And if the man has an ounce of self preservation he'll surely cooperate. On the other hand, self preservation didn't stop him from betraying the very people who put him in power. And no matter how disillusioned he had grown through the decades, even old Hermann had to admit that asking an arrogant asshole in Africa for help like they needed him was just plain wrong."

The voice belonged to a uniformed Pied-Noir, who then proceeded to bow and show the way to him and the disgruntled ministers besides him. But Scheller was calm; he knew by now why people like Seraç had to show they were "too busy" for people like him.\n\nIndeed, as they stepped into the grandiosely decorated room, one would think they were in a palace; just like one would think, as they looked towards the Lion of Algeria, Yves-Guerin Seraç, sitting in his designer suit with the air of a man who had won every battle of his life, warmly welcoming them with a sardonic smile, that this man had no doubts about this day. A lot of work and money was poured into this illusion, surely. But these men hadn't come all the way from Germania to stare at gold candelabras and fine paintings; and as the pleasantries faded away and the negotiations began, it soon became very clear to all involved that Seraç's deck was empty.\n\n...which makes it not only desirable, but integral, that the Ministry of Economy shall retain complete autonomy to dictate and direct its own budget, with the Dinar as its default currency, which shall remain pegged to the French Franc and not to the Reichsmark" was how the longly worded but in reality fairly short list of Algerian demands concluded, which included the retention of the established French-styled government and all French ministers within it, the sovereignty of the armed forces, with German garrisons in Algeria supplementing instead of guiding the Algerian command, as well as direct state control of at least 50% of the exploration perimeters of the national oil fields. The carefully crafted and practiced document that constituted another piece to Seraç's masterful bluff, described in the most intrepid light what his true goal -or pledge- was: to please be left alone and retain whatever authority he could over his small fiefdom. All this futile act confirmed Scheller's suspicion: Seraç had no way out, and had nothing to resort to but to beg. With the tiniest and rarest of smiles creeping up on his lips, he opened his own briefcase with calm, precise movements."

"I understand that the remaining deposits might fall short of your 50% goal, Herr Seraç, but Herr Göring is willing to offer subsidies upwards of 10 million Reichsmarks per year as reparation. As for the lands occupied by foreign investors, we are willing to aid you in their immediate eviction. After all, the Einheitspakt should offer you much greater return in investment regarding all your exports." What he failed to mention was that the trading policies of the Einheitspakt towards Reichsprotektorats mandated that any and all exports shall be controlled through Germania, from where they will be sold as German goods.\n\nAnd that's only a small footnote in the book of things that were not explicitly mentioned in the contracts. Like how the part about national-controlled oil fields did not mention endless nights of drinking with the President and major shareholders of Sonatrach, who had agreed to set the groundwork for a merger with IG Farben. Or how the part autonomy of the government did not mention the heavy handed deals that were scheduled after their arrival of German observers, or the unexpected... empty seats that would arise during their stay. Or how the support role of the German garrisons did not mention the astronomical bribes to several high-ranking officers. For Kirchmann and his business associates, this was what one would call a hostile takeover; for Seraç, this was the loss of whatever control he managed over his state, and the transformation of his perceived role as ruthless dictator into that of a powerless scapegoat for the colony's misfortunes.\n\n"I believe that will be all for now, Monsieur Seraç" interceded Scheller, standing up from the table as Kirchmann was packing his papers. "It is getting late. In the following week you will have plentiful opportunities to converse with us on the details." He gave a tiny smirk, a rare occurence.

"GERMAN SHIPS SPOTTED -STOP- TWO BTLSHIPS EIGHT DSTRERS FOUR CRUISERS -STOP- THREE FIFTY KM FROM ORAN AS OF DAWN -STOP-" As of dawn? This was 11 in the morning! Why was he only hearing of this now? He was about to call his secretary and demand an audience with the Chief when he was received a call from her first. "What is it Marion? And it better be about this sack of shit that calls himself an ad-" "Excuse me General but, you might want to check the TV. Now." The TV? Seraç quickly opened his TV to the Télévision Algérienne channel. "...got away with their boats unscathed, but their lines cut, and able to do little but hurl obscenities at the German ships." announced the reporter as the screen shifted to an unkempt bearded man. "Those bastards think they can just barge in as if this is their damn playground! How has the General allowed this?" The news ticker read: "Kriegsmarine violates Algerian sea zone, harasses local fishermen".\n\nSeraç closed the TV, and violently broke the remote on his desk. Useless! Useless! All of them! How could he, after all the pain and sacrifice he had gone through, have surrounded himself with such useless people? People that could only inform him of an impending invasion AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWS! Or was it not stupidity? Was his staff intentionally withholding this information from him until it could no longer be held secret? He could not know- he had lost too many friends to tell anymore- and did not care. All he cared about was that the Germans were coming. And if he could not get the damn news on time, how could he hold his line?"

We can now officially proclaim the creation of Reichskommissariat Nordafrika, the first German foothold in the southern Mediterranean, and commence the process of actually exploiting the rich untapped resources and the crucial strategic location of the region.\n\nFriedrich von der Heydte already departed by plane from Germania this morning to assume his new post as Reichskommissar, along with seven Generalkommissars and several replacements for the recently vacated general secretariat. Within the following week they will be followed by the appropriate Garrisons and border divisions, three military engineer detachments, equipment and representatives from IG Farben, among others.\n\nWhile the scheduled reinforcement of the colony is fairly heavier than typical of other RKs, especially ones of this size, and their absence from the Fatherland will be noticeable for some time, this will hopefully allow Nordafrika to serve as the coordinative and administrative center for all our future ambitions in Egypt and the Maghreb."

"Please do not resist." Scheller looked outside the doorway to see the rest of his mission on the same situation as him. One of them was being unceremoniously dragged out, presumably unconscious. "Just let me light up a cigarette first" he announced, stoically reaching into his coat pocket.\n\n"What the hell is happening? I demand answers!" came a voice belonging to the youngest of the group, in handcuffs and short of temper. "I already gave you one, sir" responded the guard accompanying him. "The General decided that he no longer required your presence here." This only served to further infuriate the minister. "This is bullshit! Who does he think he is, bossing diplomatic envoys around like that?" He was now screaming right in front of the guard. "And the only one who gets to tell me when my work is done is my Führer, not a random negro lac-" his rant was interrupted by a loud bang, followed by the envoy screaming on the floor, blood gushing from his foot. "My name is Pierre" said his guard unfazed, as if he wasn't holding a smoking handgun. "My father lived his entire life in Bourgogne before your Führer came." He then turned to his shocked crowd. "Is any other of you distinguished gentlemen planning to pose a security threat? Non? I figured so."\n\nAs the mission walked their way to their exit, Scheller briefly eyed his guard, cigarette still in mouth. "You allowed your subordinate to discharge a firearm at an envoy of the Reich. But you didn't actually care about the slur. Not enough to stage a crisis over it." He looked forward again, waiting briefly for a response that never came. "Neither did he; his demeanor was too calm." He puffed a ring of smoke. "It was Seraç himself who ordered this. He wanted you to be violent and ruthless. He wants to show he fears no one. And you still didn't have the balls to do it without being provoked."\n\n"And what difference does it make to you?" growled Julien through his teeth, as his captive nonchalantly spit out his cigarette and stomped it on the hallway carpet."

They run the factories and offices of our empire, and the eruption of strikes recently has put a spanner in the works. Naturally, the first reaction is to send in the Orpo to have their way with the strikers and put the fear of the Führer into them, but perhaps a more diplomatic solution can be reached. Some token concessions should be enough to placate them before we tighten the reins once more.\n\nWhile we may not like to admit it, in many cases other hands can perform their jobs just as well as German ones do. Outsourcing their jobs to foreign workers would put the strikers in their place and ensure the work gets done. Alternatively the tasks could be delegated to the slaves - though we have no guarantee of how well they will perform them."

Naturally the massacre of innocent citizens of the Reich demands a response in force, the slaves once again shackled and reprisals taken, but there exist options on how this is to be achieved.\n\nThe Heer are always champing at the bit for their next fight and they are better equipped than anyone to deal with an armed uprising, but allowing them to take credit for another victory may do more harm than good, and set a dangerous precedent for the future. The Orpo have an opportunity to intervene and maintain their authority against the Heer, but this in turn would snub our glory-seeking generals.\n\nNaturally the local workers are enraged at the murder of their comrades, and in turn fear their own slaves will turn against them. They could be encouraged to take up arms and drive the rioters back to their camps."

 goering.803.desc:0 "The advantage of slaves is they don't require much training, just a firm hand. They don't cost much to keep, and you don't have to be nice to them. The disadvantage is they have little interest in mastering their craft - only avoiding beatings. This reliance on slaves is beginning to show - the quality of German goods has experienced a noticeable drop, and while unemployment and early retirement remains high there is an increasing drought of skilled workers.\n\nThis quality drop is a symptom of a problem that we are unable to directly address. We must patch as best we can, forcing a diversification of the economy by subsidising technical educations and discouraging our workers from resting on their laurels. Otherwise, this reliance could become a crutch."

The Wehrmacht have the right to secure their own contracts in times of need, which they take to mean they can buy an arms factory and give it to a retired officer. They are vital in procuring the Reich's resources, and use this leverage to acquire shares in mines and steel mills and positions on the boards of every company that goes east to the Reichskomissariats. These same companies extend down and down, allowed their influence to extend throughout the economic sphere.\n\nWhile the Wehrmacht is ostensibly loyal, their influence should be checked. Granting loans to smaller businesses outside the military's influence would give them a fighting chance against the oligopolies that dominate our industry. Alternatively we could grant the same contracts that the Heer and Kriegsmarine throw about so carelessly to a foreign company, and attempt to starve the Wehrmacht of their child-businesses."

Investment from Iberia, Scandinavia and Britain makes up a considerable portion of the same war machine that feeds the Wehrmacht, but they insist that foreign influences be driven out, and German businesses be left to German businessmen.\n\nBowing to the whims of our generals will no doubt deter any future investors, but their support is far too valuable to us."

Given the military's power, the possibility of actual economic reform is out of the question. We can either bandage the wound with affordable loans to the population, or ride it out and hope for the best. "

President Abs warns of the dire economic consequences if the banks are unable to raise the interest rates, complaining that narrow-minded men like Schörner have no mind for economics or the financial system.\n\nThough we are benefitting from the new interest rates, the growing control of the militarists is concerning, and perhaps President Abs' warnings of doom and gloom have some validity..."

Not one of the futile untermenschen causes that have plagued the Reich, but a heroic German Resistance. A resistance of heroes, relegated to the shadows. The Mähren-based resistance is led by one Rudolf Toussaint; a veteran of the First Great War who has since dutifully served his country during the Second World War, and this loyalty was unfazed by the succession of Führer Göring. He is the perfect candidate to lead our operations on the inside.\n\n"Herr Schörner. It is good to hear from you". Toussaint grimaced his peers in the room upon hearing the gravelly Bavarian accent on the other end of the line. Unsurprisingly. he found himself on the receiving end of a barrage of orders which his assistant hastily wrote down, whilst Toussaint could do nothing but agree. Eventually Schörner was done, and the call ended, without the resistance giving a single point of note back to the commander.\n\nThe room awoke in a calm, but passionate, debate. Toussaint's old guard emphasised caution in the face of Germany and wanted to toe Schörner's line, whilst the newer officers promoted after the fall of the garrison wanted to try and make contact with a general who would actually listen to the resistance. Nothing came of the debate. Everyone stuck to their positions, and Toussaint eventually dismissed the entire room. No good would ever come of divisions.\n\nQuietly sitting at his desk, Toussaint looked over his plans, then over Schörner's plans. Not much use in his own plans now.

The soldier's anger was extinguished, and his sternness disappeared as he slumped back over the bed, dead.\n\nSlinging his rifle over his shoulder, Rudolf surveyed the barracks. About twenty beds. Besides each of them, a small drawer, presumably the only possessions the SS soldiers owned. A swastika on one end of the room, and the Black Sun on the other. No windows. There had to be something of worth in here, since there was nothing in the rest of the village; surely the SS couldn't have sent it all back to Prag?\n\nFor the next hour, he searched every drawer and found little. A few pictures; siblings? Loved ones? Could the SS even feel love anymore? He found one pocket watch, presumably an heirloom. Might as well keep that one, he supposed. There were a few books, mostly filled with the ravings of that lunatic Himmler. Rudolf put them to one side, so it would be easier to burn them later. These men lived with next to nothing; no cards, no memories of home, just their uniforms and their hatred. He was beginning to feel frustrated by the time he reached the last drawer, before tugging it and realising it was locked. A grin spread over his face as he took the butt of his rifle and slammed it into the drawer, which promptly burst open.\n\nInside the drawer was a wealth of jewellery, gold, gemstones, rings, every precious thing that man could create. Rudolf smiled. He had found what he came for."

Now he was dead, and for all his boasting over the strength of his SS, they had proven weak. Truthfully, Schörner loved being on the offensive like this. Petty despots like Daleuge would scatter before him as he swept through Europe, crushing all those who dared resist his might.\n\n'Herr Schörner'. His assistant's voice was firm. Schörner was always sure to pick out assistants that wouldn't fear him; fear was inevitably followed by incompetence. 'We've had a series of reports about SS partisans who refuse to give up the fight. Our divisions across Böhmen-Mähren are waiting for orders. Should we hunt them down?'\n\nThe wind on the balcony picked up slightly, rippling through the swastika that now hung above the headquarters. Schörner's face did not stir. Finally, he spoke.\n\n'Hunt them to the last man. Spare no one. Keep three of our divisions stationed here, assisting the garrison. Delegate them to another commander.' A slight trace of a smile crept over Schörner's face; it wouldn't be perceptible to most, but this was a significant display of emotion for the orthodox general. 'The rest of the divisions will leave the day after tomorrow, along with ourselves. We're moving onto the next target.' Schörner hesitated. 'If they find Daleuge, tell me. I'd like to see him. I think he might be able to tell us something about our friends in Burgundy.' The assistant nodded, and left."

 goering.904.d:0 "The despot of Ostland. The aspiring German. An unknown quantity through and through, Michel Vituska is not a man we ever wanted to deal with. But the reality is that he rules Ostland, and instead of simply agitating for a war, he has completely shocked our diplomats by coming cap in hand to the Reich offering to be our vassal.\n\nThe nerve! An untermenschen under the Reich? That would be a stain that cannot be wiped from our nation! The reaction from the hardcore militarists are one and the same. We cannot trust him, and the only way we should be even considering dealing with Vituska is with a bullet! With the new focus of the Reich being conquest to make us great again, it seems as though this would be in keeping with the policy we promised Germany.\n\nBut another band of less hardline officers has suggested the unthinkable; accept the proposal, undermine Vituska's authority, then eventually integrate Ostland again. While this seems a wild breach of the militarist belief that won us the civil war, there is an element of reason in their plan; we can spare Ostland from a second wave of destruction that would no doubt leave the colony far behind the rest of the Reich in industrial strength and Germanisation.\n\nThe final decision rests on the shoulders of the Führer. Will we take Vituska's offer, or is war the only way of dealing with such arrogance?"

Of course, this exchange will be far more useful for us than for Vituska, and his army is as much of an unknown quantity as he is so any information on their weaknesses will bevital for keeping him trustworthy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to undermine the militarists, the Führer's closest allies and his backers in the civil war. But Herr Schörner is beginning to believe he holds the keys to the Reich. If we were to reduce his officers to mere diplomats to Vituska's regime, it would reduce his power in the metropole and send a message that the Führer still holds the reins. Schörner himself does not seem shaken by rumours of this proposal; perhaps he has finally learned his place!\n\nAlternatively, we could simply send neutral officers to take part in the exchange. Vituska would possibly hand over better information if this were the case, as it certainly helps to negotiate with men who aren't openly calling for your blood; but Vituska is utterly unpredictable, so who can say what he truly wants. This would leave more power in the hands of the militarists, but isn't that what we fought for?"

This situation cannot continue.\n\nWe may not trust Vituska entirely, but he is working with us now. Ostland is his realm, and so he is the man who must protect it. If we sent his desperately under equipped forces weapons then we may be able to achieve true lasting stability in Ostland and root out the partisans once and for all.\n\nOf course, it isn't that simple. If we were to send Vituska as many arms as we can spare, his forces would likely be more effective and could even defend themselves against threats from Moskowien; it would also help build Vituska's trust for us. However, this is putting our arms in the hands of a dangerously unpredictable man, and perhaps it would be best if we only send enough arms to put down the partisan menace, not enough to defy our will."

Furthermore evidence suggests a conversion of the industrial base to both shipping equipment and equipment geared towards partisan warfare.\n\nFurther reprisals and massacres are expected and called for in the few pamphlets distributed.

While Germany had been busy tearing itself apart, the jackals in the SS had leapt onto the similarly stricken corpse of Ostland, and now a black tumor grew on the side of the Reich. Invasion was a no brainer- it had always been the plan to integrate Ostland into the Reich one day- but it pained Göring to need to waste German lives on a territory that was once an easy landgrab. He needed to make it easier- the less lives lost, the better.\n\nAn idea came to mind. Certainly not all Germans in Ostland were fans of Jeckeln's maniacal regime. After all, were they not just fighting him? They may not have much in common, but something that could generally unite Germans of all walks of life was their distaste for the SS. Certainly, Göring and his men could find some veterans brave enough to rally themselves for the return of order and the purge of the madness that the SS brought.\n\nThe idea crystallized in his head, and Göring smiled. Remer and his men would infiltrate the Ostland border, searching for militarist contacts. Once there, they would form their own units, ready to sew chaos behind enemy lines. These infiltrations would not only make the war a thousand times more manageable, but would shorten it drastically. Besides, Göring reasoned, even if the plan did not fully pan out, it would rid him of Remer for at least some time."

Should he ever turn against us, there is no doubt we can put him down. Along with undermining Vituska, the exchange has also been successful in cutting down militarist power, with Schörner's hardline influence notably diminished.\n\nDespite the success of our plan in undermining them both, neither Schörner nor Vituska seem to see through our plot. In fact, they are both enthusiastic about continuing the exchange, and Vituska has sent a request to keep Schörner's officers remaining in Ostland longer to supervise a new training program. This arrangement benefits us the most; but the wholehearted embracing of our plan by the people it should impact the worst has aroused suspicion amongst a few in the government."

The trade has also been mutually beneficial on the surface, with each of our armies now better prepared to fight together against outside threats.\n\nOur officers are returning home right now. Despite the fact we appeased them by sending neutral officers, Schörner's militarists are protesting the recall and stating that they could've retrieved more vital information and made Vituska even more vulnerable. It seems no matter what we do, they're going to protest. Perhaps it is time to stop feeding Schörner's beast, and instead start defying it?"

Whatever we thought, we were wrong. Today Schörner's officers launched a coup in Ostland, attempting to seize power from Vituska and hand it over to the hardline militarists.\n\nPerhaps it was fortunate for us that Vituska was already a few steps ahead. He was able to put down the coup with remarkable efficiency, and now all the officers we sent are dead. Of course, Schörner quickly went to cover up the coup failure, so we have little information about the planning of the coup; but this has weakened him severely, despite also showing the flaws in the intelligence of the central government."

A perfunctory arm raise, and the feldmarschall is already in front of the desk.\n\n"Mein Führer!" he begins with his usual boisterous countenance, "the time has come to reclaim our rightful lands to the South!

As the general, now visibly incensed at being contradicted by his superior, opens his mouth to reply, the Führer closes the discussion: "Von Krosigk has always been a loyal servant of the Reich. By proclaiming his neutrality he has saved the Bohemian industrial core from being captured by the degenerate SS, don't you agree?"\n\n"Yes, but-"\n\n"Then, if you understand, there is no need for an invasion. I won't send Aryans to die fighting other Aryans while we can achieve the same result in a civilized manner.

Göring's voice was almost nostalgic, "you were still Finanzminister, weren't you?"\n\n"It must have been at least ten years, before I became Reichsprotektor" von Krosigk had the same tinge in his tone, thinking about different times, when political enemies were still that, and didn't try to have you shot for treason, or begin a civil war.\n\n"Indeed! How much time has passed, my friend... things have been tough, though I'm sure you too had your own enemies to fight in Bohemia... pesky SS, always trying to snivel their way in. You have been extremely competent, just as you have always been, a great resource for our even greater Reich!"\n\nHis guest nods politely, part sincere and part calculating, as he has learned to be. He knows, however, that reminiscing isn't the only reason for his presence at Carinhall, and he isn't disappointed.\n\n"This is why, despite Schörner's opinions, I've decided that you'll be appointed gauleiter when Bohemia is reintegrated into the Vaterland"\n\nOf course. That was the reason for the invitation: von Krosigk has known, ever since the end of the civil war, that the Bohemian industries would be highly coveted by the resurgent Reich.

Führer Göring announced today that order had once again been restored to Ostland, and that German soldiers and officers assisting the garrison would soon be returning to Germania to assist with the next conflict the Reich will be involved in as our quest to pacify the world, as we have finally done in Ostland, continues.\n\nBut with every victory comes a consequence. The men we had posted in Ostland were bloodthirsty militarists; they do not wish for a reasonable approach to conquest, merely a thrilling ransacking of countries that brings them fame and glory. We must now keep them in check once again, and ensure their anger remains pointed at the enemies of the Reich."

############# GERMAN INTEGRATION OF OSTLAND

goering.908.t:0 "Baltic Germans Integrated"
goering.908.d:0 "Naturally, the first and easiest of Ostland's territories to integrate have been those which were majority-German before we even arrived. The Baltic Germans were the most immediate and grateful beneficiaries of our rule and quickly adapted to life under the Reich. Natalist programs and family unifications, encouraged in the years following the liberation, helped greatly to expand their numbers to the point where they now comprise the majority of the population in Lithuania. With Balts reduced to a minority, the Führer has proclaimed these areas to be pacified and ready for complete integration into the Reich, further expanding the formal borders of the Reich proper into the former Reichskommissariat. "The legacy of the Teutonic Order," the Führer stated in a press release, "Has finally been fulfilled""

goering.909.d:0 "Further afield from the coast of Ostland lies Belarus, once packed to the gills with Balts and Slavs. Though we managed to find decent support against the Soviets there, along with a sizeable number of racially acceptable natives suitable for Germanization, the east called and our colonists answered. What followed the conquest of Belarus was the emergence of a distinctly colonial German culture: fierce, strong and hardy. The Ost-Germans have brought the virility of the Aryan race to this backwater, sowing the fertile seeds of the German people in the rich farmlands and verdant forests. With plenty of colonists present, the racially acceptable natives being rapidly assimilated and the remainder pushed to the fringes of society, the Führer has seen fit to formally integrate these parts of Ostland into the Reich. "The Ost-Germans are the truest children of the Aryan race in the east," he explained to a crowd of eager reporters today. "It is long past time that their efforts in bringing the light of civilization to the frontier are recognised.""

goering.910.t:0 "Non-German Regions of Ostland Integrated"
goering.910.d:0 "The question of how far the current efforts to integrate Ostland should go has been a matter of great contention within the colonial authorities. Today, the Führer finally stepped in, declaring that with the majority Baltic- and Ost-German lands integrated, the Reich's grip on these formerly troublesome lands is secure enough that there is no further need to worry about the possibility of further resistance from the Balts, Slavs and Estonians who remain in the colony. Accordingly, the aggressive pursuit of Germanization can slow down to a more measured pace. The Führer's reasoning is simple: with their will to fight repeatedly broken and a strong German presence established, the natives pose no threat at this point and their assimilation or displacement is so certain that the Reich can finally afford to ease up, redirecting resources to more pressing matters. The integration of the remaining parts of Ostland, be they majority-German or native, is to commence immediately and without hesitation. Our race will win out in these areas soon enough."

############# GOERING DRECHSLER INTERACTIONS

goering.911.t:0 "The Truth About Drechsler"
goering.911.desc:0 ""Speak," said Göring, eyeing his secretary over the great oaken desk in the Führer's office. Noticing the young man's trembling hands, he chuckled. "Erich, you aren't addressing me in front of the Field Marshal. I won't take offence from speaking your mind if you have my permission to do so."\n\nErich took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. "Yes, my Führer." He steadied his hands and adjusted his glasses, looking down at the mock-up headlines proposed to run in 'Der Sturmer' and 'Volkischë Beobachter'. "OTTO DRECHSLER - LANDRUT'S FINAL SURPRISE?" read one. "WHO BOUGHT THE GARRISON?" said another.\n\n"Good enough for the proles, my Führer," Erich said, scratching at a scab on his poorly-shaven chin. "But if you... uh, if you don't mind my saying, I'm not sure that the enlisted men will believe it." He shifted his gaze to the floor, awaiting Göring's violent castigation, but it never came.\n\nInstead, he heard the Führer's leather-backed chair creak as its occupant leaned back and tapped an idle finger on the desk. "Hmph. True enough," he muttered after a pause. The chair groaned as Göring sat upright with a sigh. "I didn't think it was much good myself, personally. Burn it, then arrange a meeting with the head of the Gestapo as soon as possible. Perhaps he has some ideas for how to deal with this nuisance of a man."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," said Erich, hastily turning and making his way out of the spacious office, heading straight for the small incinerator kept in the back of the archive room. The Gestapo would probably be a better bet, he thought. They were tremendously skilled when it came to finding dirt on people, real or imagined..."

goering.912.t:0 "Future Investments"
goering.912.desc:0 "Hermann Göring has never been a financially astute man, but any of his friends could tell you how good he is at spending money. Jewelry, ancient artifacts, tailor-made uniforms, gold-plated firearms, ceremonial weapons... and that's just the stuff that he can't eat or drink. An evening at the Führer's private residence, Carinhall, is a seemingly endless parade of the finest gourmet meats, pastries and desserts prepared by the Reich's most talented chefs. Should the Führer deign to bring up anything from his wine cellar, he could choose from thousands of bottles of the rarest vintages that Europe has to offer.\n\nToday, however, the Führer is taking less personal economic matters into consideration. Reichskommissariat Ostland has returned to the fold and its economy is recovering well, but many prominent Ostlanders have been petitioning Berlin for additional investment. A dose of cash delivered on the Führer's order would certainly help create more jobs and send a positive message to private investors, but there is another matter to consider: the loyalty of Drechsler's officer corps. A fair number have been brought on-side while nobody was watching following the civil war, but perhaps it's worth attempting to secure the loyalty of a few more. Many of them are contemptuous of Drechsler, a known coward. The more men personally loyal to Göring rather than Schörner, the more secure the current government will be against any future coup attempts.\n\nOf course, we might need those Reichsmarks for a rainy day, right?"

goering.913.desc:0 "A minor scandal broke in militarist-aligned state media today, as several senior officers of the Ostland garrison were demoted to the lowest rank possible following evidence-based accusations of bribery. Though the media has no inkling of where the money came from, the people who leaked it - namely, a number of Schörner's underlings who apparently caught wind of the Führer's attempts to buy Drechsler's men - the Wehrmacht undoubtedly does. Gestapo surveillance personnel have reported that the Reichskommissar and Field Marshal met this morning, likely to discuss a punitive response to Göring's failed attempt at turning their men against them.\n\nGöring's blunder has deeply impacted his standing with his powerful allies. This minor incident might not come to much, but it has revealed the Führer's vulnerability and lack of political acumen. He has no need to fear the possibility of a coup over something so minor as bribery, but now the Wehrmacht will be on full alert for further attempts to corrupt its men."

goering.967.desc:0 "FROM THE OFFICE OF THE FÜHRER, TO ALL LOYAL OFFICERS OF THE REICH:\n\nThe recent military action against the renegades in Reichskommissariat Ostland continues to trouble the morale of the Wehrmacht. This, your Führer is more than aware of. However, he is also certain that anyone reading this memorandum is equally aware of the reasons behind the decision to invade and depose the pretender Reichskommissar. It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Otto-Heinrich Drechsler was corrupt and in the employ of the same nefarious forces who reduced Ostland to a state of civil war. The fact that this man was a long-serving member of our great establishment does not excuse his betrayal of the Reich and the German race. Loyalty and trust is measured by one's dedication to the Führer and the willingness to obey unquestioningly. That Drechsler refused the Führer's direct order to stand down from his unlawfully claimed post should be reason enough for all to join in condemnation of his actions and purge his memory from the rolls of the NSDAP.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that nobody expected treason from such a widely-known and well-respected man - an ex-Gauleiter and veteran of the Sturmabteilung, no less. The Führer recognises the reality of Drechsler's popularity and wishes to ameliorate your concerns by assuring each and every one of you that he acted only out of necessity, not for any petty political gain. The Führer is above such temptations and has only the greater good of the Reich in mind when acting in his capacity as father to the nation. It is his sincerest wish that harmony and concord should reign amongst the armed forces - a wish that we can all work together to fulfil now that the dark days of civil conflict are past.\n\nHeil Göring!"

############# GOERING STAHLECKER INTERACTIONS

goering.921.t:0 "The Stahlecker Issue"
goering.921.desc:0 ""You haven't met Stahlecker, have you?" The question was muffled, with Erich, Göring's secretary, rummaging through a filing cabinet for the celebratory brandy. "The man's a dyed-in-the-wool National Socialist, loyal as they come." Göring didn't respond. He simply sat and stared ahead with hands folded, clearly lost in thought and oblivious to the one-sided conversation taking place. "I'm sure you wouldn't get along with him," Erich continued, "But that wouldn't matter. If you told him to jump off a cliff, he'd do it solely out of respect for your office."\n\nAfter a minute more of awkward silence, Erich returned to Göring's desk, grinning and holding up the 25-year-old brandy that the Führer had pocketed during a visit to Paris in 1940. Göring didn't seem to notice, continuing to stare past his secretary even as the bright-eyed young clerk poured out a glass for his boss. "My Führer?" he asked, noticing Göring's blank expression.\n\n"Hmm? Oh, thank you, Erich," Göring muttered, closing his worn fingers around the cool, hard glass. "No... no, I haven't met Stahlecker. He was an SS man during the war, so I never had the pleasure." A twinge of worry shot across his face, and he raised the glass to down his drink in a single go, savouring the memories of less complicated times that it brought up. Minutes passed, during which Erich could only stand in place, awkwardly fiddling with the bottle's cap. "Give me another, boy," he finally grunted. "The Field Marshal is coming to dispense some 'advice' soon. Let's make sure we're properly fortified for it, eh?""

Too stressed to celebrate, he can only lean back into his creaking chair and relax as the stress of the past 24 hours evaporates. Stahlecker, ever the loyalist, had accepted his offer to negotiate and allow aid into Ostland. The Führer's feelings - and the subsequent celebratory drinking - are mirrored throughout the Reich. The state media, still a muddled mess after the civil war, had been pushing contradictory headlines regarding the Ostland situation for weeks, but by the afternoon of the day in which the Führer put out a statement to the press, every paper, TV news show and radio broadcast delivered the same message: No More Civil War.\n\nHowever, far from the temporary warmth and peace to be found in Carinhall that night, OKW headquarters seethes with treasonous spite. Peace? Peace, with the great Otto-Heinrich Drechsler murdered and Ostland in the feeble grip of a Bormannite? Peace, with a man who would rather laze about and lord over idle subhumans? Peace, with a man who was by all accounts a coward, a traitor and an indolent old conservative?\n\nNot on the Field Marshal's watch."

There would, many realised, be a lot more shouting later in the day if that outburst was any indication.\n\nHours later, Field Marshal Schörner downed the phone, hooked directly to the Chancellery, with a satisfied smile. He had known, of course, about Göring's peaceful overtures towards Stahlecker. For a time, he had been concerned - it was an open secret that Göring had no interest in so-called 'pointless' wars or anything beyond enriching himself and enjoying the perks of his office. This, however, was the first step towards changing that. It would take some time, yes - but if he were to be pulled deep enough into the Field Marshal's machinations, he would soon find himself too bogged down to even think about defying the will of the armed forces again. Then, and only then, would the Reich's invincibility be ensured."

goering.924.desc:0 "Nobody attempted to stop the pair of Panzergrenadier officers, their dress uniforms glittering with medals, as they barged past the Führer's secretary and straight into his office. The few brave enough to attempt to eavesdrop in the thirty seconds that the men spent with the Führer heard no exchange of words; no indignant shouts or threats of arrest, nor snide, practiced military snobbery. When the officers left, the only apparent change was the absence of an envelope, stamped with the mark of OKW, that had previously been carried in a worn and scarred hand.\n\nGöring had been expecting such an outrageous move in response to his decision to pursue peace with Stahlecker, however. There had been no exchange of words for precisely that reason; the Panzergrenadiers had their orders, and Göring had been informed of their arrival hours in advance. With all the pieces so clearly laid out, there was no need for words - only a silent understanding.\n\nThe letter was clear in its wording. Cold, uncaring and professional - straight from the desk of Field Marshal Schörner. "Army High Command," it read, "Is deeply concerned by recent decisions made by the Führer. As the unquestionable defenders of the Greater Germanic Reich, we wish to express our hesitance to endorse the Führer's refusal to employ a practical solution to the renegade colony of Ostland. We recommend the immediate issue of an ultimatum demanding total submission and compliance to the self-proclaimed authority therein, under threat of military intervention. We expect that the Führer will wholeheartedly endorse this measure and carry it out post-haste.\n\nSieg heil!"

goering.925.desc:0 "Surprising everyone, Stahlecker has rejected our ultimatum demanding submission. That such an ardently loyal National Socialist would defy a direct order from the Führer - any Führer - is an unexpected setback, but now a line has been drawn in the sand between the Reich and its rogue colony. Any action taken against Ostland, military or otherwise, will now be legally justified and much more palatable to the Reich's citizens. Now, Göring is under pressure not just from OKW, but from many civilians in his administration and cabinet. A self-proclaimed Reichskommissar has refused his orders and set his men on a belligerent stance against us - how can we possibly react with anything but swift and bloody retribution?\n\nWith rather pointed words, apparently. So claims Göring, at least. Still set on avoiding bloodshed despite Stahlecker's insult, the Führer has expressed his belief that the renegade can be brought to heel. His logic is sound, at least: Stahlecker, as a Bormannite, values Germanic unity above all else. The shedding of Aryan blood is anathema to him and it was a wonder that he even found the willpower to push through the Ostland civil war in the first place. Yet, deep down, he is no true soldier; he lacks a military awareness of war's realities. Demonstrate to him in no uncertain terms what war with the Reich would entail, and he will fold. The Führer has received a certain amount of support for this idea, even from elements of the Wehrmacht, but wonders aloud if it's worth the effort."

Concerns have been expressed by certain ill-educated economists that the demand for Ostland's economy to be placed in the hands of Germania's bureaucrats was a step too far and that it will have disastrous consequences for the colony, but the Führer is happy to be done with the whole messy affair. The Wehrmacht, too, has stated their gratitude to Stahlecker and the Führer for their admirable effort in overcoming ideological differences to ensure a better future for the Reich's favorite colony.\n\nAnd yet, there's a sense that we could have done better."

Would you truly put your life on the line for a civil servant who has overstepped his legal authority?\n\nThe Führer wishes for peace, but must enforce the unity of the Greater German Reich. All he does, he does in the name of security, peace and brotherhood. If he must unleash the armed forces of the Reich upon Ostland, then he will not hesitate to do so, even if the burden weighs heavily upon his heart. You all know what this entails: the Reich's own weapons will strike you down; its war machines will grind you under its treads; its mighty guns will bring the very sky crashing down upon you.\n\nIf you would stand for anything, stand for peace and unity!

goering.928.desc:0 "It would appear that our saber-rattling has had unintended consequences. During breakfast, the Führer was interrupted by the arrival of a report from one of the staging grounds near the border with Ostland. Apparently, an entire Panzer battalion decided to conduct some 'reconnaissance' on their own initiative. They didn't report anything unusual upon returning to base, but one of our infantry patrols reported seeing smoke rising from a Lithuanian village just over the border. Recon aircraft quickly confirmed that the village of approximately 400 civilians had been razed to the ground, with no signs of life remaining besides some wandering cattle. This particular village had not previously been of any interest to us due to its lack of defenses - Schörner claims provocation by partisans and the Ostland garrison, however, stating that his men were defending themselves.\n\nThe Führer is outraged by this impropriety, but that may well have been the intended result. There is little publicly available evidence of our forces' involvement in the attack, so certain elements of the militarist cabinet are urging him to turn the incident into a propaganda offensive to aid a coup against Stahlecker which is currently in the works (which is the first that the Führer has heard of such a thing). The Führer, for his part, would rather just pretend the incident didn't happen at all, to avoid any disruption to his war of words with Stahlecker - he is certain that his plan will still bear fruit.\n\nThe army, however, makes no secret of the fact that they bear responsibility, and is pushing for the Führer to authorize a second raid to undermine Stahlecker further. Why Schörner would advocate for two different solutions at the same time is anyone's guess."

Our pilots fought bravely and with great skill, but were outnumbered by ten to two. A loss was inevitable, with Lieutenant Wilhelm Kurtz being shot down over hostile territory. Thankfully his wingman made it back to base, but the damage is done. Even as the Luftwaffe mourns this loss, their allies in the Heer are baying for blood, now that there is proof of Stahlecker's hostile intentions.\n\nThe Führer is now under immense pressure to issue the invasion order, as continuing with attempts to intimidate Stahlecker will now infuriate the Luftwaffe as well as the Heer.

How the Führer learned of the plot is unknown, but the assumption is that Stahlecker himself was involved.\n\nYet there has been no move on the Führer's part, nor a counterattack by the militarists. The officers were permitted to leave the building, thoroughly shaken but unharmed. Whatever they said to the Führer, it was enough to give him momentary pause. Could it be that he has resolved not to take action against the plotters, despite their gross insubordination and betrayal of one of their own? Or is he merely considering the options laid out before him?\n\nThe Führer alone knows the true stakes of his situation. The militarists are dangerous, yes, but their most recent plot may have gone too far even for their ambition. Should action be taken against the plotters using the Abwehr, there are unlikely to be serious consequences, and Stahlecker has proven that he acts in good faith and is deserving of fair treatment.

Stahlecker has promised that mutual recognition of legitimacy is all he ever sought, and that he will serve the Reich "...faithfully, for life, and unto death."

The recent disagreements between the Reich and her colony are the result of unfortunate circumstances and the realities of the day. It is tragic that loss of life occurred as a consequence, but with this agreement a great deal more bloodshed has been avoided.

Piles of weapons, vacated bunkers and abandoned motor pools line every highway and no small number of garrison troops have simply vanished into the woods, either heading for home or abandoning their cause altogether. Their fate makes no difference now.\n\nStahlecker and his staff are now heading by plane for Germania, no longer employees of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Indeed, the Reichskommissariat no longer exists as of this moment; now formally dissolved as a separate entity, all Aryan Ostlanders are now full citizens of the Reich and the colony's treasury has been snatched up by the Führer's financiers. A number of economists have expressed concern at this seizure of the colony, claiming that it is 'unprepared for integration'. This is nonsense, of course - the Führer has great expertise in economic matters. There may be some teething issues, true, but give it a few days and the colony will be more prosperous than ever."

After weeks of dragging his heels, Göring has achieved little more than lose the respect of conservatives for treating Stahlecker so harshly and infuriate the Wehrmacht with his preference for words over action. The invasion can no longer be stopped, despite Göring's best efforts. Any order to hold fast would likely fall on deaf ears, as Schörner is past tolerating attempts at 'peace' and 'unity' for the time being.\n\nWar returns to Ostland; it will be swift, brutal and merciless. Anyone who knows the lay of the land and the disposition of the Wehrmacht could accurately predict that tens of thousands are likely to die, innocent or otherwise.

While no doubt amusing to the rank and file, he has a surprising amount of sway; not over Stahlecker, who remains as stoic as ever, but over the people of Ostland. The last thing we want in the event of successful negotiations is for the Ostlanders to rise up against our rule and render the whole peace process completely moot.\n\nThe Abwehr has pointed out that with the chaotic situation in Ostland, it would be child's play to remove this obnoxious individual from the equation. Even better, we have a man in Riga - a survivor of Drechsler's cabinet - who has spent the past few months schmoozing with his former enemies, who are unaware of his past loyalties. By pulling a few strings, passing fistfuls of marks to the right people and disposing of the troublesome individual in question, the Abwehr is confident that we can get our man into Stahlecker's confidence and start chipping away at the resistance from within.\n\n"

Of course, it was apparently too little too late for the Wehrmacht, who have once again called for an invasion of Ostland.

Those few are now vindicated, as barring the reconstruction work going on throughout the city, Riga is more or less indistinguishable from how it was in those blissful days of peace. The same is true for the entirety of Ostland - everywhere, the garrison and Orpo are back on their routine patrols (though with fresh faces among them), farmers tend their crops and factories begin to churn out goods for sale back in the Reich. Even the non-Aryan natives seem mildly appreciative of the situation; they might be on the fringes of society, but at least they aren't being shot at by the SS or murdered by partisans for not being anti-German enough.\n\nIn his office, refurbished with new furniture from Germania befitting his now-official status, Stahlecker allowed himself to recline with a satisfied smile. This is what it was for - all the unpleasant things he did in the SS, the civil war, the tense negotiations with a Führer he had little in common with. This vision of peace and stability, so thoroughly devalued in recent years, made it all worthwhile. Perhaps Göring would drag the Reich through years of war and pointless attempts and conquest, but the Ostland Stahlecker had fought so hard for would endure. Of this, he was certain."

Things escalated substantially this week as he went on a long-winded and exceptionally crass rant while being interviewed by a Swedish journalist, with a number of choice insults, vile epithets and insinuations about the sexual proclivities of the Reich's leadership all being printed word-for-word in the Stockholm evening newspapers. He has apparently escaped any kind of discipline for this.\n\nThe Führer's response to this story was little more than a world-weary sigh. He had expected a phone call from Schörner demanding retribution to avenge the insult, but it was several hours before such a call came through. On the other end of the line was Schörner's aide, who hesitantly stated that the Field Marshal "...favors immediate military action to, uh... to avenge this insult and - what was it, sir? - uh, and the sullying of the image of the Reich's glorious leaders."\n\nEveryone is a little confused at this point. Schörner has called for war yet again, but with uncharacteristic hesitation. Perhaps even he recognises the inanity of going to war over some foul language?"

A large but inefficient gunpowder charge packed with shrapnel and nails, it had done just enough damage to the unfortunate mailmen that both would be crippled for life. The van was mostly intact, but several passers-by were hit by flying projectiles and left screaming and writhing on the pavement. Ambulances arrived promptly, but despite the relatively low number of casualties the attack has shaken the people of Riga. At this point, natives and Germans alike yearn for peace - why strike now? Who would wish for more bloodshed at this point?\n\nGöring is concerned that Stahlecker does not have the resources to handle the threat of an active terrorist cell. Allowing him to try and handle it independently might have disastrous consequences for peace, especially if key figures in the Ostdeal become the targets of assassins. To this end, the Führer has attempted to dispatch the Abwehr, only to be rebuffed. Stahlecker claims that the Orpo and the garrison can handle the situation, and that an Abwehr presence in Riga would constitute a violation of the Ostdeal. He's obviously just being stubborn, but might this be a sign of more trouble to come?"

A young Latvian, he refused to state whether he acted alone, how he acquired the bomb or who, if anyone, put him up to it. His stoicism endured even through enhanced interrogation techniques. With little more to do, the terrorist was turned over to the Ostland Orpo. The Abwehr wished to simply shoot him out of hand, but records show that he is an Aryan native, entitling him to a proper trial not too dissimilar from those enjoyed by full-blooded German citizens. A minor loss for us, but at least justice will be served.\n\nGöring is happy to have avoided conflict with Stahlecker over this, and the Abwehr is very pleased to have done their job well and without interference from the Ostland authorities, but every successful negotiation sets off another round of grousing from the Wehrmacht. The Ostdeal must conclude, and quickly."

Göring's response was simply to sigh, rub his temples and dismiss his secretary before taking a long, long swig of brandy. At this point, he has to wonder: does Stahlecker enjoy this? Beneath the neat spectacles and the stone-faced expression of a model Bormannite, is there some manner of Judeo-Bolshevik devil, seeking to torment and subvert the Reich at every turn? Why string the Führer along? Why make him sit through all these negotiations only to turn around and become a stick-in-the-mud over THIS of all things? Why not just let the people with the best of intentions do their jobs? Wouldn't that be better than just jerking them around and... and...\n\nGöring sighed again, downed the rest of the bottle, and awaited the angry phone call from Schörner."

This is by far one of the most confounding letters to ever cross Göring's desk- if we thought that nations like Poland had no chance, a nation as small and weak as Slovakia will fall within a matter of days to the German war machine.\n\nIn any case, such a response, though unexpected, was planned for. A Heer army lines the border, waiting on our word to invade and crush these rebellious upstarts for good. With the comical difference in size, training, and equipment between our army and theirs, this operation should take no longer than a week to complete. Before long, German boots will march through Bratislava, and Slovakia will learn its place- as our inferiors, nothing more."

The steps into the Führer's office were torture, as were the pleasantries before the meeting began. Slowly, however, the sense of dread was replaced with confusion as Hermann continued to dance around the point, asking questions about his combat record, his experience, his education- it began to dawn on Foertsch that this may not be a punishment, but a job interview.\n\n"Well, Foertsch, I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you in here." Göring said, taking a drink from his glass. Foertsch silently nodded. "You know of our recent operation in Slovakia, yes? It's clear to me that the Slovaks are still too untrustworthy to entrust with running their own country. After all, that's what we did for years, and they split from us the first chance they got. I'm planning on setting up a new Reichskommissariat there, and you seem like a good man for the job."\n\nFoertsch sat silently. This was not what he expected.

It made no sense- decades of subservience, quiet obedience, and then suddenly they had jumped ship from Germany as fast as they could. All the way up to the Bürgerkrieg, the few reports that ever came from Slovakia were mundane- peaceful, quiet, boring reports nobody gave much mind to. Why would they?\n\nIt struck Göring like a lightning bolt. The reports were so incredibly wrong because the Slovakians had been hiding their intentions. While they had paid lip service to the Reich, they had been secretly planning their betrayal for years! It all fell into place- the sudden change in heart, the resistance to German control, all of it. As Göring figured it out, the plan began to fall into place.\n\nThe collaborationist government would be restored, as expected, but they would never again get so much autonomy. The Reich had taken its eye off the ball, and Slovakia had exploited it to the fullest. Now, the Reich's eyes would be glued to Slovakia, and the army would be ready to sweep in the instant a single piece of the puzzle tried to fall out of place. This embarrassment would never happen again- not under Göring, not under anyone after Göring, not for a thousand years."

It wasn't like they were any real threat to the Reich, but this festering sore on Germany's underside was taking a hundred German lives a month. What was wrong with the Slovaks? When God made them, clearly he had forgotten to put in the quit.\n\nThere was an easy way to solve this, of course- expanding ORPO operations to the Slovakian region. After all, could local forces be trusted with occupying their own nation? No, such an arrangement was begging for disaster. The ORPO would control Slovakia, and it would learn to be obedient, calm, and placid. Slovakia would learn order. Whether they learned it through gunfire or diplomacy would be up to them."

Then, the German soldiers left, and the people of the city managed to take one final breath before the next wave came.\n\nThe Waffen-HG- the HG standing for Hlinka Garde- was oppressive in its actions, brutal in its punishment. On what seemed like every corner and every square, a German soldier watched over the crowds with rifle in hand. The people quickly learned to fear them, and soon the streets were quiet- no more demonstrations or furious speeches, only the sounds of cars and footsteps, all watched over by the Germans.\n\nThe people hated the Waffen-HG, but what could they do about it? They had been disarmed, destroyed, and overwhelmingly crushed by a monster far, far greater than any of them. Even if, by some miracle, they succeeded in expelling the German beast, they'd just come back with their tanks again, and this time Slovakia would never get another chance.\n\nSo the Slovakian people, by and large, gave up.

The quintessential academic, and one that Germany would not- could not- tolerate.\n\nThe headlights lit up a solitary man, dressed in a trenchcoat, and the men inside readied their pistols. He turned towards the car, and for a moment, all four men could see the sudden fear flashing through his eyes as he burst into a run. The driver slammed on the brakes, and the three men leapt out of their seats, chasing him into a dark alley.\n\nAs the man ran for the next road, he realized his mistake- the alley had nowhere to take cover, nothing to hide behind. The point was punctuated with three sharp cracks of gunfire lighting up the walls like a camera flash, and the man collapsed with a thud.

Surely you would know him by reputation, at least; the man is famously infatuated with the subhumans of eastern Europe in a manner that goes beyond mere academic fascination. His loyalty has been suspect for years, but the Gestapo were never able to find conclusive evidence to bring charges of treason against him. It is likely that his significant personal fortune was the means by which he evaded the law - were we to conduct a thorough investigation, we would likely turn up many a Gestapo officer with greasy palms.\n\nMeyer-Landrut is no military man, but his betrayal of Aryan ideals has wooed many Balts and Slavs, who now fight for him along with our traitor kin. More significantly, of course, he represents a serious ideological threat as the last holdout of Speerism. My Führer, it is this agency's concern that as long as this traitor to the Fatherland and National Socialism remains active, the legitimacy of the Reich is threatened. It is Field Marshal Schörner's view that immediate action against this final pocket of resistance within the Reich proper is necessary, before the poison of liberalism finds root within our society again."

Those who survived the war were all too easy to find. Often accompanied by their staff - no doubt indoctrinated into obedience - many were caught and arrested in their own homes or officers, desperately burning one document after another to try and protect themselves.\n\nWith the owners of some of Germany's biggest banks and businesses apprehended, it was a simple matter to rubber-stamp the paperwork necessary to seize their assets and transfer them to the Führer's personal control. The agents who brought in the snakes each received a commendation and a hefty bonus, cut from the wealth of their quarries. Doubtless we shall need such keen minds when the time comes to pursue such foes of the Reich once more.

Shortly after the news broke in the morning papers, the Wehrmacht's press office released a statement confirming that two squads of Pioneers from the 44th Grenadier Division stormed the empty factory at approximately 5:00 AM with orders to carry out the demolition of the entire structure. The factory was, according to 'reliable sources', being used as a hideout for a large SS cell. More importantly, it allegedly produced weapons for the traitors, with the entire workforce being implicated by the Wehrmacht's informants. Accordingly, the Pioneer units placed demolition charges around the factory in the hours before the first workers arrived, only detonating them once a majority of the workforce was confirmed to be on the clock. An attempt to dig for survivors in the rubble was repelled by the timely arrival of a large Feldgendarmerie contingent, who sealed off the site and declared that more Pioneers would soon be arriving to apply further explosives in order to 'collapse any subterranean construction'.\n\n"I don't understand," said a passing civilian when asked for comment. "That place was a brick factory. There aren't even any armaments factories in the whole of Riga. I've worked in both kinds of factories and I can tell you that there's no confusing brick-making equipment for gunsmithing tools."

"Your boy got back to you quickly, didn't he?" Despite their differing cultures, Dietrich and his family had been accepted with relative warmth. So far out from the major centres of civilisation and its tracts of arable land, there had been little objection to a lone colonial family moving into an abandoned woodland home. Someone had to keep the deer in check, after all.\n\n"He did." Dietrich motioned to the blasted tangle of steel and wood half-buried in the mud right in the middle of the road, where there had previously been a minor railway running through the forest. "He couldn't say what it was you wanted me to see, but it certainly speaks for itself."\n\n"Yes. I wondered, given your time in service, if you would know how this happened?" There was a pause as the German scratched at the graying stubble on his chin and went rummaging through memories of 20 years prior. Given the thoroughly wrecked state of the rails and three-foot-deep crater, it could only have been done with military-grade demolition charges.\n\n"Small but strong railbusting charges," he finally said. "Only Pioneer units are equipped with those. The soldiers who passed through yesterday must have been scouting for vulnerable points in the railway like this crossing." With a sigh, he walked over and began picking up bits of planks littering the road. "Come on, Simas. Let's get this as clear as we can so people can bring their trucks through.

His eyes were shrouded in shadow by the pillar of flame, and its wicked light glimmered on the brass buttons of the other soldiers as they turned to look at Armin. He was panting and exhausted already, the strain of middle age and his recent cold making it difficult to inhale lungfuls of the frigid nighttime air. "What... Christ, what have you done?

A boot smashed into his nose, and found itself caked in blood. A man yelled something in German, but Josep's ears were pounding too hard to hear it.\n\nAnd yet, Joseph did not let go. Perhaps, like his father before him, he was truly willing to fight for the Polish people. Perhaps he was simply tired of allowing these men to push him around. And perhaps, he was simply too beaten and too tired to open his fingers, even if it may yet save his life. Yet it could not last forever.\n\nAs he felt the cloth rip, Josep knew his cause was lost. That last memento that he had fought so hard for was torn away. The fire crackled and the Germans began to laugh. He could picture his father's red and white brassard amongst the shriveled ashen flags, burning amongst those other symbols of resistance.\n\nAnd yet, lying prone and broken on the ground, splattered with blood, mud, and his own vomit, Josep felt more a Pole than ever."

Facing the same enemies, an alliance was once built up between us during our last invasion. And now, as the European situation quickly changes, it seems the alliance need to be rekindled for our mutual benefits.\n\nLucky for us, their organization aren't difficult to find, and our spies were easily able to make contact with them. They showed little trust toward us at first, claiming that we had betrayed them when the Italians invaded their motherland and set up their own puppet government. regime. But after a few minutes, our agents successfully showed them that Italians are also our enemies and for now we indeed need each other to overthrow the Communist regime in their land and have their revenge against the Italians in the future. So, the proposal of an alliance finally got approved by the leader of the Ustase Organization at the end of the meeting.\n\nHowever, for Germany, there is still one fatal decision to be made. Of course, we can keep our words about an independent Croatian nation in the future and send them supplies they need in the upcoming uprising, for that will definitely make them loyal to us. But on the other hand, if they're so easy to trust us again, maybe some sweet talk and vague promises will be enough to get them on another side. Though it sounds dishonest, we can save a lot of materials for our own Aryan troopers for the invasion and get more freedom to deal the lands we're going to conquer according to our own wish should we betray the Ustase."

However, as we're preparing a invasion against the newly established Yugoslavian state, the Bosnian nation is a potential ally that we cannot ignore anymore. Thus, a special delegate has been order to get on to them and persuade them to join our side in the upcoming war.\n\nAs our Führer wisely expected, the negotiation went even more smoothly than our generals' imagination. The Bosnians quickly accept our offer, for the Yugoslavian communist regime is not only the enemy of the German Reich, as they said, but also an enemy of all Bosnian patriots. In order to win the independence of the long-oppressed Bosnian nation, they are willing to join our forces and take our orders in our invasion, as long as we can protect them from their evil neighbors.\n\nThe orders, however, haven't be given to them yet. The easiest choice is to just give them supplies and help them organize a great national uprising once our panzers start to march into the Yugoslavian lands, since it can greatly distract the Yugoslavian armies and make our invasion much easier. But some generals hold different opinion, saying the Bosnian nationalists will be quickly wiped out if they just declare a rebellion, and they can cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian government if they can keep underground and do some sabotage works. Regardless of which option our order will be, the Bosnian resistance organization is eagerly waiting for it, and we have to make our decision as soon as possible."

Originally a Yugoslavian resistance movement, their attitude towards us is always changing according to the Balkans international relations. And in recent days the situation in Yugoslavia has changed rapidly as the Croatian communists had seized power and incorporated the Serbian lands into their territories, which makes an alliance between us become possible once again. As a result, a meeting is arranged to discuss the details about the cooperation between us.\n\nThe beginning the negotiation was not easy. The Chetniks speak aggressively, claiming that they'll agree on nothing if we don't help them restore a totally independent Kingdom of Yugoslavia ruled by Serbs and provide them assistance much more than what we can accept. However, our delegates pointed it out that the entire Serbian land is dominated by the communists now and they don't stand a chance on their own. Finally, they had to admit that we are the only forces that can help them fulfill their dream and agreed on our terms, as long as we grant their restoration after the war.\n\nNow, it is time for us to decide whether should we keep words about assistance. It is true that providing them what they need and allow them have their monarchy will make them appreciated and loyal to us. But some suggest that what we need is only to have them distract the communist government, and since the Chetniks cannot even drive the commies out from their own land, they don't really deserve to have a role in our Balkan post-war order.

Since we are also in need of someone who can help us launch our invasion against Yugoslavia, the old friendship seems to be about to be rekindled.\n\nOur terms are very simple: they take orders from us and do what we command, in exchange for our military intervention in the Yugoslavian politics. Because the communists are hunting them down at any cost, they currently have no other choices but to entrust their fate to us. Therefore, they easily accept our proposal, saying that they're more than honored to get the second chance to work with the Reich. At the end of our meeting, they told us that they had already organized some political dissents and ready to take our orders.\n\nNow, as we've successfully made connection with them, it's time for us to decide which role they will play in our invasion plan. The first choice is to let them organize a national uprising, which will greatly reduce the resistance on the front. However, we can also let them do some underground activities and sabotages.

And according to the reports from military commanders, what we've reclaimed is even more than the stability of Balkans.\n\nPrior to our reconquest of Yugoslavia, we have made a temporary alliance with the Chetniks, since the communists were our mutual enemies at that time. Though we never considered them to be our real allies, we still provided some assistance to them, hoping to make them trust in us and cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian governments. It's hard to say how much use they're during the campaign, since the Chetniks seem to be more skilled at burning and pillaging rather than actual battles. But now, all the weapons, ammos and medicine have finally returned to the right hands.\n\nThe materials have been checked and distributed into local garrisons to keep order and maybe even used to kill the remnants of Chetniks themselves.

Indeed, all of our current Reichskommissariats were ordered to follow our lead and root out the worst offenders in terms of corruption, allowing their troops to get the equipment they deserve. Though most of our Kommissars have followed our orders, as they are supposed to, one in particular has the gall to defy us.\n\nDreschler, the militarist buffoon and staunch Schörnerite of Ostland, has presumably taken a single look at our request, panicked, and immediately ignored it. In fact, he has all but ignored every form of communication we have sent him in relation to the anti-corruption drive.\n\nThis complex situation would normally resolve in our government immediately dismissing the man from his post. However, nothing is normal in Göring Reich, and Schörner has personally stepped in to defend the man from any attacks on his job. This ridiculous scenario, which once would have been inconceivable, now leaves us in a serious bind. We are unable to remove the insubordinate Dreschler from his post, now that Schörner has stepped in behind him, but we are also unable to simply ignore this grievance from a Reichskommissar to his superiors. For now, the relations between Ostland and Germany reach a new low, as both sides uneasily watch each other from across the border."

Clearly, war was inevitable, and so the armies of the Reich prepared.\n\nEvidenltly, the Finns did not see it the same way.\n\nUnbelievably, the Finns have done the one thing we did not expect- they have given in, and offer now to join us with no questions or conditions. A stunned silence overtakes the Oberkommando, and permeates to the Führer's office. Out of all the things expected of the Finns, surrendering to us was not one of them.\n\nNow, there is an unfortunate problem on our hands. Though the Finns have, in all effect, joined us, the cost of readying for this war has been some of the highest so far. Tens of thousands of men had to be retrained, thousands of tanks had to be retrofitted, thousands of planes and ships brought north. For this to have all been for nothing is unacceptable to the militarist branch, who demands we invade anyway and take over directly.\n\nThis demand is complicated by the fact that we promised multiple benefits for the Schörnerites that would be obtained from Finland's resources, lands, and riches- all of which are now unobtainable. On the other hand, to invade a surrendering nation would undoubtedly look horrific to the outside world, and would severely hurt our odds on ever allying with anyone outside the Reich again. "

Of course, if he knew where that path would lead him, he never would have taken it.\n\nAnother place he could have changed was when the Nazi's left Norway. In the chaos, nobody would have noticed just another suddenly missing man from the rosters. But he stayed with the division he had based his career around, all the way up to when they needed a driver for a mission in the north, on a promise from the Führer himself.

It seems that Generalfeldmarschall Schörner has been using an elaborate system of fronts and patsies, along with a few well placed bribes, to siphon off large quantities of IG Farben's most potent pesticides. These pesticides could prove as deadly as other chemical weapons when used on humans, and this combined with the great lengths the man kept to keep his transactions hidden to not bode well for his intentions. While Josef Abs was initially suspected of aiding Schörner, further investigation has proven that he was not involved with any of the smaller-scale orders Schörner had his agents employ.

Losing him would be a shame but the man had through negligence allowed Schörner to procure chemical weapons-grade material. In any other situation Göring would likely have simply had the man shot like a dog, but he didn't need to alienate any more potential sectors of the government.

It was only when they entered into the supposedly empty depot that they realized how badly they had been mistaken.\n\nSchörner's men had been waiting for them, and a brief but fierce firefight ensued that left several of our men dead and over half wounded. Schörner's men were considerably better off, although their exact casualties are unknown. Of course Schörner denied ordering his men to fire on ours, claiming they had believed it was a partisan raid and only retaliated in believed self-defense.

They had been sent, deliberately into battle based on this association, and had died for it.

As the forces make ready, the officers commit to memory their objectives; drive an iron wedge between the core of Onega and its outlying territories in Finland and, once the first phase is completed, storm the encircled outlying regions before an effective counter-offensive can be organized. Helicopter reconnaissance elements have already identified priority targets during the blitz - barracks and makeshift forts - and close air support has been tasked with the destruction of these secondary elements to expedite the skirmish.\n\nThe rousing of the goliath is not something that goes unnoticed, and even with the element of surprise it is reported that our flyovers have set the enemy on edge.

Hundreds of bodies coat the cold ground, and as their empty eyes stare into the smoking horizon the only sight that looks back at them are the shocked survivors, themselves being rounded up by Heer reinforcements.\n\nWith the first strategic objective secured, we stand able to make ready for the total seizure of Onega. Enemy battalions at the periphery were able to withdraw beyond our operational range and regroup with what remains of their armed forces, though it will not help them. Now that they well and truly know that we are coming for them, they have no defense outside the calculus of war.

Debriefing - or interrogation - of surviving infantrymen describes a military folly of a magnitude painful to even consider. Enemy grenadiers and saboteurs disabled or destroyed dozens of vehicles, to say nothing of the now-smoking corpses inside of them, and were obscured from retaliatory airstrikes by trees and terrain. Further, past Luftwaffe bombings destroyed all roads and ingresses to vital areas, and intelligence did not consider this when creating the tactical plans causing entire armored columns to become stuck and having to abandon their vehicles for fear of enemy capture. The vehicles could not be secured by their leaving crews, so one officer ordered a bombing run on the valley to deny their use to the Russians, but poor communication resulted in targeting a separate - occupied - convoy instead.\n\nThe shame of being defeated at the hands of an untrained, ill-equipped, degenerate enemy in a backwater unlisted on maps is too much to bear.

As many troops as we could spare were thrown into defensive positions on the perimeter, and as the sun rose low in the east the battle began in earnest.

Oddly enough, this dream felt nearly lifelike, and he could not convince his mind to wake. He realized that he would once again have to endure this nightmare until it's end.\n\nThe roar of the engines quickly grew louder as seconds went by, until the roar became nearly deafening. Until the auditory assault felt as if it were coming from right inside his modest home. Seconds later, the ground shook violently as the earth rumbled with apocalyptic force. This is where the nightmares usually ended. With a mighty explosion. Yegor frightfully awaited his startling jolt back into reality. Another explosion sounded off, and yet another that made his head ring like an impossibly loud bell. Finally it came, a mighty explosion that swept him away with impossible force.\n\nHowever only this time, it wasn't a dream."

Secondly, we may send them to infiltrate the Russian army. This should allow us to sabotage their operational capabilities and may allow us to stir disobedience amongst their unruly troops.

Thus, we thought of f the Russian Liberation Army, or commonly known as ROA, who help us during the World War II and West Russian War. While the old ROA have betrayed us, a new unit was formed under that name, with the same duty to help us maintain stability in the occupied zone and suppress the local resistance. But now, we realized that it may be a mistake.\n\nReading the reports from the frontline, the Führer's face is dark with worries. It says that some agents found that many officers in the new ROA was just former members of the old one under Vlasov, who betrayed our trust and committed treason not too long ago. The Führer understands that those one cannot be totally trusted, for they've been working with that traitor for too long, and may have some not so welcome opinions about the Reich. And any risk in Russia could leads to a total failure there, which is the last thing he want right now.\n\nSo what should he do right now? Of course he can purge those officers, but is that enough? What if there are more suspect ones in the ROA than what we've found, and what if the entire ROA have been already poisoned by them? But on the other hand, if we just purge the ROA, where can we find other locals who can assist our war cause?

There's only one question in his mind: how the hell could this happen?\n\nThe report from Russia states that, after arresting and executing those officers who are former members of Vlasov's old ROA which betrayed the Reich, the entire ROA was in great shock. No one could be sure about why did we purge those who came to our side during the war, and neither could they be sure about their own fates. Fearing they could be our next targets, a bunch more officers fled from our barracks. And the worst part is, most of them just went to the Russian States and joined our enemies' side with all equipment and information they hold. In one word, we screwed everything up.\n\nBut the Führer understands that there is not enough time for him to regret. He must find a proper solution for current situation as soon as possible. Those who defected to the Russians are just some officers, and the left soldiers are still in our sides, waiting for our more orders. And more importantly, the war is still going on, and if we can win this war in the end, no one will remember some defecting officers, right?\n\n"

The map was of course hopelessly outdated, but Göring thought he could see the direction the conversation was being steered.\n\n"-and the conclusion of the whole operation, uncompleted until now, the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line, to complete the separation of Russia from Europe and ensure Germany has enough Lebensraum for centuries to come."\n\n"And let me guess, you want to refortify the A-A Line." Göring maintained a neutral expression, lacing his fingers together." He tried to quantify the manpower and resources required to finish the project but gave up rapidly. Schörner was unfazed by his plan's predictability, and ploughed on.\n\n"Indeed, my Führer, the plan is self-evident in it's value. Had we completed the fortifications rather than resting on our laurels prematurely, the Soviets would never have been able to regroup and push us back, and Himmler's failed coup would have never even begun. Late as we are, completing the line is the only way to ensure the Russians never have a chance to retake Moskow."\n\nThe Führer thought that Schörner's concern had little to do with the ideology or national security, and much more to do with the influence he would gain with the troops on the eastern frontier. The line may have some strategic value, but it would likely be outweighed by the colossal cost of building a wall across a whole continent. Not to mention the cost of refusal - he could see the spiteful look in Schörner's eye even on the best of days, and had no desire to annoy him further."

Stuckart's folder flopped to his side, limply.\n\n"He is nothing of the sort, and you would be a fool to let him hear you say that." Göring's glance turned into a glare. Stuckart held up his hands in resignation.\n\n"All I am saying is, we could stand to save a great deal on materials. Do we really need to waste high quality concrete and steel on a wall the Russians will never reach? We could stand to dilute what Schörner's boys get, they'll never be in a position to notice the difference."\n\nPerhaps Stuckart did have a point - while Schörner himself would almost certainly make note of the change in the supply situation, and he'd have to have that conversation with the bastard, the chances of the Russians pulling together enough to pose a true threat to the A-A Line, pure concrete or aggregated, were miniscule.

The icy Russian soil refused to give in easily - the constant movement of cart wheels and caterpillar tracks had churned up thick, wet mud, that over repeated cycles of freezing and thawing had created half a dozen layers of frozen ground that was closer to rock than dirt. A little extra strength would be appreciated, preferably that of a jackhammer or one of those excavators he'd seen on the back of the German trucks, but those were too valuable to be risked in the unskilled hands of a conscript such as himself.\n\nVadim allowed himself a brief moment to catch his breath and wipe the sweat from his brow, which had gathered there despite the cloud his breath produced in the cold. As he breathed, he surveyed the horizon. From his section of the would-be trench, half sunk into the earth, he could see but a small segment of the fortifications extent. He had never seen anything like it. He'd heard tales of distant China, where a great wall separated the civilised world from the barbarians to the north. This was the only comparison he could even consider relevant. For as far as the eye could see, and from what he'd heard a thousand times further and yet more, Russians like him laboured digging trenches, cutting down forests, draining swamps, hanging barbed wire, installing bunkers, fortifying choke points - building a wall the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\n"What's the holdup, Russkie?" His reverie was interrupted by a bark in German - outside the trench, the soldier supervising his group was looking down at him and idly playing with the action of his rifle.\n\n"Just catching my breath, sir," he replied in rudimentary German. Vadim swallowed as the soldier walked to the lip of the trench. Seeing his discomfort, the German chuckled and spat into the trench, narrowly missing Vadim.\n\n"Back to work. No unsanctioned breaks."

Well, it was mostly mud - the digging of latrines had been deemed a secondary priority compared to the main fortifications, and there were few Russians willing to leave the trench at night, when a trigger-happy German might take a simple toilet break for an escape attempt. If Vadim poked his head out from under their tarpaulin, he could see the corpse pile. He could smell it no matter where he was.\n\nThe Germans kept separate from the Russians in their tents, but Vadim had been able to overhear a few words while on duty - most of the soldiers assumed the Russians were incapable of understanding their language, despite the fact around half the conscripts were Muscovite, and many of the others had picked up smatterings of the trade language that had built up around what used to be the border between Moskowien and Russia. Despite the brutal punishments that were being dealt with increasing regularity to the "lazy" workers, work was apparently proceeding according to schedule. Once the work was done, Russia would be split in two, with a border not nearly so porous as that that preceded it. What would become of him then? Shipped out to another conflict, to dig holes and live in his own shit, or just disposed of, another face in the corpse pile? There must be some way out, some path between the sentries that would take him away. They wouldn't bother searching for him once he was out, he was all but worthless - that much was clear. But which way? Back west into Moskowien, and hope to remain unnoticed by the authorities? Or east into Russia, where who knows what awaited him? He'd heard the Soviet Union was restored in the far east, but then he'd also heard of bandits masquerading as Germans who would slaughter anyone they deemed too Russian.\n\nThe crack of a distant gunshot reached the trench, and a few of the others shifted in their sleep.

He and his Russian comrades, for all their hard work, had been awarded respite, a chance to lean on their shovels and gaze at the miles of trenches they had dug by hand. Vadim could have done with one of the beers the soldiers were passing round, but for now he was just grateful to have good, clean water. The radio was blaring out some patriotic German song, immediately following a speech by Führer Göring congratulating the troops and labourers - the German labourers, of course - on the completion of what he referred to as "Eighth Wonder of the World", the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line.\n\nThe division of Germany and Russia was now a sharp line on the map rather than the blur it had once been, in what many other young Russians considered a small golden age of enterprise compared to the Union and Reich that sandwiched them. The only enterprise getting done these days certainly wasn't sending the profits his way. He sipped his water, for the moment content. His shoulders no longer ached. He surveyed the wilderness expanse to the east, nothing but fields as far as the eye could see - no cover. Nothing but easy shooting should some young asshole look up from his drinking and back to his duties. But still, there was no time left, they'd be moving out soon. The best thing he could see was a gully, a few hundred metres away leading southeast. If he could reach there in a couple of hours, when drinking and darkness had dulled their senses, he might be able to crawl out of sight.\n\nThe rumble of a truck interrupted his thoughts, and he turned. The truck was backing up to the trench, where his comrades were enjoying their rest. Soldiers, their rifles shouldered and looking much more sober than their drunken friends were accompanying it.\n\n"Russkies, in the truck! Next project."

The first issue plaguing our newly-established Reichskommissariate is logistics: months of bombings and fighting have left the Iberian infrastructure - not the most developed one to begin with - in a pitiful state. Roads and railroads are filled with holes and craters, bridges were demolished by the retreating Iberian forces, and the docking facilities were abandoned after we enacted our embargo.\n\nWith this sorry state of affairs, our garrisons lament delays in supplies, while partisans and rebels strike from forests and hills to steal weapons from our convoys. Should this keep going, we might face worse problems than a couple terrorist attacks, therefore a comprehensive initiative must be taken in order to improve the state of Iberian infrastructure.\n\nWe have several choices, each with its caveats. On one hand, we can concentrate on Reichskommissariat Kastilien and make it the infrastructural hub of Iberia: with its central position, encompassing the former capital of Madrid, it would be a cheap solution with great potential results, but Reichskommissar Hitzfeld is known for supporting Speidel, which could further aggravate the infighting among the Iberian subdivisions. On the other, we can equally spread the development efforts between all administrative units: this would be more costly and less efficient, but no one would complain about lack of funds. Finally, we can simply forego land infrastructure and have everything delivered from Germany by ship, by improving the Northern Iberian port facilities: this would be the safest choice, but also the most expensive, and our finances aren't exactly looking good at the moment..."

Another choice could be to split the costs between all the Iberian Reichskommissariate, just the way it was when Iberia was united: this would be less controversial, but all Reichskommissars would complain at least some.\n\nFinally, we can simply take responsibility for Hitler's dreams and shoulder the cost on our own.

Glancing at the dam for the last time, no one feels upset because they know that this is only a small chapter in our long struggle against the Germans, and they'd written it well.\n\nNow, as our soldiers have done their duties, it's we politician's responsibility to decide what we should do next. The radicals suggest that we should immediately mobilize our navy to escalate the current crisis, since it took us a lot to get the Dam and it has important strategic values. And we all know that what they really want to say is the time to openly confront with the Germans has come. However, others say that it is still too early to start a total conflict with them and any rash act may lead to some disastrous consequences that no one would like to see.

And then came the Germans. After sweeping over the whole peninsula, they came to our Gibraltar. Though almost no one believes they can hold their positions, they did complete a mission impossible in the end.\n\nAt the very beginning, the Germans were confident that they will easily break our defense since their force was several times bigger than ours in Gibraltar. But then, our boys broke their ignorance with leads and bombs when they walked into our sights carelessly. After hours of fighting, the battlefield was filled of our enemies' corpses. At the shinning sunset of the great ocean, our soldiers returned to their barracks with joyful song, talking about what the history books in the future will records such a epic of great heroism.\n\nHowever, in our capital, there's not too much time for us to celebrate. The conflict is only a little interlude in our international political strategy, and we must decide what we're going to do next. While some suggested that we can take this chance to further weaken the Germans, and smuggle important materials to destabilize the different RKs in Europe. Others, however, believe such a move is too risky that may anger the Germans and even lead to the third World War. They suggested that we should work on strengthen what we've achieved.

Obviously the SS was never going to share their own weaknesses, given what they seem to have been planning for years now. The Ordensstaat is considered an impenetrable "secret state" for a reason, even at the height of our power we were never able to maintain the level of communications blackout that they have achieved. To me, this does not bode well for finding any active resistance cells. Of course, hard to find does not mean nonexistent, and the Abwehr will search every nook and cranny in order to further the goals of the Reich. We have two leads currently on French and Belgian contacts but we will need further time to verify their authenticity lest we fall into a Burgundian counterintelligence.\n\nAs for potential informants within the regime, we do at least know the names of some, but the list is from before the Burgerkrieg and given the high rate of turnover amongst the Burgundian officials coupled with possible changes in willingness to cooperate, we cannot rely heavily on this information. We have agents in the field conducting check-ins on the names to confirm or not the status of these potential assets. As of this report, only - REDACTED - has been located and has been confirmed as deceased since 1965 during one of the apparently infamous purges carried out on Reichsführer-SS Himmler's direct orders. Our best guess is that - REDACTED - and - REDACTED - have also been terminated in the meanwhile but this cannot be confirmed at this moment.\n\nAs always my Führer, you will be updated when any new information has been discovered.\nGeneralmajor Reinhard Gehlen, Abwehr"

Burgundian purges successfully eliminated dissident movements from within the Waffen-SS several years ago, and since then has maintained an extensive suppression campaign.

 goering.1491.desc:0 "Apparently no one in the entire government or armed forces are content to let Goering govern himself, and the Kriegsmarine is following in the Heer's footsteps and beginning to apply pressure to the already tightly-squeezed Führer.\n Our "ringhorn" style naval doctrine of using a smaller number of large ships as opposed to a larger fleet of smaller ships is causing the Kriegsmarine fleet to be clogging up our ports. High ranking admirals are insisting that we need to either downsize our fleet or find new ports to dock our ships in.\n Neither option is at all enticing, as we are forced to either greatly reduce the Reich's power projection (essentially a non-option) or invade other countries to use their ports. Voices from the Kriegsmarine are "requesting" (which, if we ignore, may lead to things getting ugly) that we take over Britain and Norway in order to make use of their facilities.\nIt seems that there is actually no choice at all; launch those invasions or face the ever-growing power and wrath of the militarists."

We must act quick if we are to maintain control of the navy.\n\nHowever, we must carefully choose who we are going to remove, as time is running thin and we cannot hope to antagonize the entirety of the Kriegsmarine.

According to special intelligence, areas of Germany heavily under the control of Speidel and Schörner have very limited air support loyal to them, and as such has provided us a unique opportunity to scout on our opposition. By using our aerial superiority to discover and locate the bases of the enemy, we would obtain a strategic advantage which would provide our Luftwaffe with a tactical advantage should any conflict break out within the Reich.\n\nThe plan, while sound, does come with a few flaws. If one of our scouting missions were to somehow be discovered by the enemy, it could potentially lead to an early unforeseen conflict and the loss of any strategic advantage we may have had.

However, the sheer number of new guard generals within the navy poses a problem, as it will be quite difficult to bring all of them to our side.\n\nFocusing on securing a majority of the generals would provide us with a large array of support within the navy, preventing a widespread mutiny. While this method would in theory be the most effective, it would be difficult to carry this out in actuality. On the other hand, focusing on a few key generals could prove to be more beneficial.

None of this made sense to him.\n\nYet, the pieces began to come together. Seemingly within moments of Müller's resignation and flight, Feldmarschall Speidel began to pick up the pieces that were hurriedly left behind, almost as if he expected this series of events to occur.

Ever since Speidel delayed what Göring sees as his rightful ascension into Germania in 1963, the Führer has severely distrusted the veteran Field Marshal. Yet, as the crisis began to unfold throughout the reich as the military sat without a central commander, Göring knew that he must set aside the distrust he held in order to preserve his own increasingly fragile reign.\n\nSpeidel's re-ascension to commandership over the Wehrmacht comes at an ever increasingly trying time for the Reich, reminiscent of the opening days of the Bürgerkrieg years ago.

Could the Führer really have been so bold as to appoint his family into the highest post achievable by a member of the German military?\n\nThe eyes of the nation did not deceive them. Heinrich Theodore Göring has been appointed by the Führer as the head of the Wehrmacht in this time of crisis. A former second world war luftwaffe pilot turned career officer, he has had a long career in the armed forces, but not as fruitful a career as many other candidates that stood in line for the military's top job.

For being a militarist, as he so claimed, Göring was taking quite the turn towards Bolshevism- at least, that's what the protestors claimed.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Speidelites applauded Schörner's removal. However, this approval has quickly turned into fear of their own. Whispers of Schörner attempting another coup rippled through Speidel's supporters, and soon they became as paranoid as the Schörnerites. If Schörner truly was trying a second coup, would Göring stop him? What would happen to Speidel? What would happen to them?\n\nFrom this moment on, perhaps the consequences of such an earthshaking push was inevitable. Divisions reported to headquarters more and more infrequently, strange new "exercises'' were scheduled and rescheduled- most importantly, Herr Schörner headed east to give a "speaking tour", and Feldmarschall Speidel headed north for "administrative duties." All of these actions were viewed with suspicion, but nothing could be done about them- nothing would rock the boat harder than arresting Schörner and Speidel.\n\nAs it turns out, one doesn't need to rock the boat when it's already sinking.\n\nAs of now, Schörner and thousands of soldiers march on Germania, determined to right the wrongs that Göring has pushed onto them. Their intentions, while not outright stated, are beyond clear. To the north, Speidel marches south on Germania, presumably in a coup attempt of his own, or perhaps solely to stop Schörner from completing his own. Germania itself is in a state of chaos, as thousands flee into the countryside from the impending battle. The Führer's only hope now is that his new Feldmarschall remains loyal to his side..."

The secretary, standing as upright as he could, replied.\n\n"Oh, I know that. I'm just incredulous at these fucking Russians. They really are the cockroaches of Europe. We crush them once, they come back. We crush them again, harder than before, and they come back. We literally invade and occupy their lands and they come back. They're the most fucking stubborn people on Earth, I swear to you. The Americans never gave us this much trouble."\n\nThe secretary waited for Göring to finish before continuing. "Would you like to send troops to aid our forces, my Führer?"\n\nGöring scoffed. "What, to Siberia? Through where? For what purpose, even? The Russians will go home, we'll pretend like we've beaten them again, and then two years later, they'll be back. There's no point in it."\n\n"Understood, my Führer.""

Finally, when he was sure he had gleaned all the important parts from the letter, he began his report.\n\n"Reichskommissar Afheldt reported from his Kommissariat. The troops there are demoralized, undersupplied, underfed, and totally unmotivated. Native resistance has skyrocketed to almost unprecedented levels. He reports that his situation is untenable, and he has made the choice to withdraw-"\n\n"Which Kommissariat is this?" Göring cut in, smoke swirling from the tip of his cigarette. The secretary looked back down at the letter for a moment.\n\n"RK Turkestan, my Führer."\n\n"Turkestan, huh? Where is this?" Göring responded, a hint of confusion in his voice.\n\n"Central Asia, my Führer." The secretary responded. Göring sat quietly for a moment, as if he was trying to remember something. Finally, he chuckled softly. "I swear, I had almost forgotten we'd ever gotten out to Central Asia. Must have slipped through the cracks of my memory at some time, with all of the recent events."\n\nThere was another silence. Finally, Göring looked directly at the secretary.\n\n"We really got far out there, didn't we, secretary?"\n\n"Yes, my Führer, we did."

Even when he was a high-ranking official during the Second World War, he usually delegated the tasks of his position off to his other, quieter subordinates, leaving them to do the paperwork while he enjoyed the benefits of his position. Finally, while as Führer, the most numbers that Göring ever saw at once were the numbers of casualties from the army's campaigns against the enemy.\n\nThe numbers today, though, were for the Führer's eyes only. Not because he had any specific knowledge about them, but because the result of their leaking would be a catastrophe.\n\nThroughout the Ukraine, thousands of partisan rebels had taken their opportunity and revolted against the regime. Ukraine burns as their natives leave the farms to join the fighting and the Garrison retreats, barely holding it together as is. Other, more pressing numbers and graphs detail food production and grain storage in Germany. With the revolt tearing through the breadbasket of Europe, the food that the Reichskommissariat provides burns with the rest of it. Without the production that the Ukraine provides, there's no way that Göring- or any of the contenders- will be able to feed every German. Grain storages provide some leeway for now, but sooner or later, those will run out, and what then?\n\nGöring slides the paper to his right, out of sight.

Strict food rationing and quick and decisive victory in the east meant that never again would Germany feel the pain of hunger.\n\nOr so we thought.\n\nFamine, the likes which has never been seen in modern Germany is sweeping through our holdings. Millions of our citizens are going hungry, and thousands have already died from starvation. The war has destroyed our domestic agricultural sector, and foreign shipping refuses to dock in our ports until the war is concluded, one way or another. If this goes on for much longer, we will certainly have a disaster on our hands."

But today, when reading the reply from Hans Speidel, he finally felt that fortune starts to stand on his side.\n\n"Considering the great dangers that Schörner has brought to our fatherland", in that reply Speidel says, "I agree that he is our common enemy for now, and to eliminate this threat, I'll immediately allied with you, just like what we did in the last stage of the First German Civil War. And I hope, with the combination of our forces, we can end this war as soon as possible."\n\nWhile for now, the future of this war is still too hard to predict, with Speidel's support on his side, Göring's faith is strengthened a lot. For now, he can focus all his troops on the fight against Schörner while Schörner must divide his forces to deal with two enemies. But more importantly, as a revered war hero, Speidel's support will be a perfect example for the people which makes them believe that Hermann Göring is the rightful Führer of the German Reich and the one who will win this war in the end.

But the worst part is, it seems that everything he attempts turned to useless in the end and his bad luck won't have an end forever.\n\nYes, today in Speidel's reply, he rejected Göring's request for an alliance against Schörner and declared that he will not trust Göring, at least for now. Such a result means that, while Schörner is the common enemy for Speidel and Göring, any kind of military cooperation between their two factions is impossible and Göring has to deploy some of his division to guard against Speidel, making his strategic situation even more dangerous.\n\nAnd more terribly. Speidel's rejection will have a very bad influence over Göring's reputation in Germany. Many people are already hating Göring since it has been proved that he is not able to maintain peace and stability, which is what they need most at present. And since Speidel, the old hero who helped Göring and restored peace in the last war, has turned against him, it seems that Göring has already lost his quality and legitimacy to rule Germany in future.\n\nFor now, while the future of this war is still too hard to predict, Göring feels that his prospect is becoming darker and darker each day. But how could all this happen? Did he do anything wrong?

 goering.2062.desc:0 "Labour camps have, for decades now, been the punitive norm in the German Reich. What is unprecedented, however, are the reports that have been flowing in from our men who have been fighting alongside Göring's forces.\n\nReports indicate that, rather than holding prisoners of war from this conflict in conventional holding camps, as would be befitting of fellow German combatants, those captured are rather being forced into intensive labour camps under horrific conditions. One camp was reportedly so overfull following the surrender of an enemy division, that the conditions described within the camp beckon to the treatment of captured Soviets in the 1940s. The prisoners in these camps were described as being made to do industrial labour, being forced to meet quotas. Most in the camps wear the tattered uniforms of Heer conscripts. The occasional officer is also scattered about the prisoner populace, bearing his old uniform, but none of the dignity that once came with it. Some prisoners, oddly, suspiciously brandish no uniforms at all, and drag about in seemingly civilian clothing.\n\nYet, most concerning to us, is that one battalion of ours that was passing by one of Görings camps was recognized by the prisoners inside the camp, who began frantically calling out the names of the soldiers in our passing battalion. For those prisoners were of the same battalion, captured weeks ago by Schörners forces. Demanding to know the meaning of the imprisonment of his soldiers, the battalion commander and his men forced their way into the camp, liberating all those who belonged to their forces. It appeared that those men were placed into a prisoner of war camp when captured by Schörners forces, only to be liberated by Görings armies days later. But rather than liberation, they were hushed and placed into another camp. The Führer's labour camp.\n\nSuch criminal treatment of our soldiers is intolerable, and all those in our general staff agree. Outraged, many are calling for us to sever our ties with Hermann Göring entirely, citing that he has gone too far and treated our men as if they were Jewry. On the other hand, we may not be able to afford the loss of such an alliance, and simply placing an ultimatum that the Führer halt these actions may suffice."

That was, until a furious Hans Speidel was on the telephone.\n\nThe hot headed Field Marshal wasted no time with pleasantries, and paid no respects to the Führer. He was clearly not interested in such. He had an ultimatum to give.\n\nApparently, a battalion underneath his command managed to force their way into one of our prisoner of war camps. Within, they claim to have found several of their men among the prisoners, and proceeded to break those men out of our camp. Dumbfounded after being confronted by a friendly force, our guards did little to prevent the chaos.\n\nThe fact does remain, however, that prisoners are not vetted to determine who they fight for. All prisoners of war encountered are simply determined to be hostile, and are rounded along into the labour programmes. Such programmes are essential to the war effort, and it may not be advisable to set a precedent of granting freedom to any prisoner that some unruly commander decides to bring into his ranks. Furthermore, allowing factionalists to make demands of the Führer would be an unacceptable degradation of the Führerprinzip. However, Speidel is a valuable ally. A collection of cool headed generals suggest that we allow the release of these prisoners back to Speidel's custody as a gesture of goodwill and the continued alliance between our forces."

Not only has he refused our reasonable demands that allied soldiery be freed from his labour camps, yet he has also demanded that we subdue ourselves beneath him.\n\nIt has become apparent that the Führer sees Generalfeldmarschall Speidel as little more than pawns upon his chessboard. Speidel finds himself now torn. Should he prove to the overweight Reichsmarschall that he is no mere pawn, and strike now whilst the iron is hot? Or shall he swallow his pride and ambition, and fall in line under the Führer, perhaps this time for good?"

Behind him stood his most loyal advisors: the bespectacled Ferdinand Schörner, the sneering Otto Ernst Remer, the smartly suited Wilhelm Stuckart.\n\n"Members of the Reichstag," Göring spoke after a few moments of silence, gripping the podium tightly with his jewelled fingers. "I have humbly accepted the Führer's offer to become his official successor. Many of you will know that such a proposition has been enshrined in our law since 1938. I am proud to say that the strength of our relationship has only grown in this time." His eyes, blue and narrow, dragged themselves across the brown masses of the Reichstag. "The Reich, however, has only weakened! As your Führer, I promise to drag us from the marshy swamp of our own making and into a glorious new era!" His voice grew slightly strained as he continued the speech. "I shall deliver us into an age of absolute military domination over our foes. Make no mistake. The Führer's vision for Europe must be completed!"\n\nA sporadic wave of applause swept through the crowd, emanating largely from the militarists and Wehrmacht officers, but also from a few conservatives. Göring gave an uneasy smile and glanced behind him, where Schörner was watching on eagerly.\n\n"To strengthen our beautiful Vaterland," Göring continued, "we must save our economy from the clutches of those who wish to exploit it for their own selfish purposes. You know who I'm talking about!" Göring's voice grew more energetic, and he puffed out his chest in excitement. "I'm talking about the parasitic German bankers! I'm talking about the Swiss!

I must look my best."\n\nSchörner arrived in the doorway with a small document tucked under his arm. Göring beckoned him over and examined the papers. The Feldmarschall had drafted a plan to violently suppress the student protests that had broken out since his appointment as successor. Bertold was prowling around the room, experimenting with different angles and muttering to himself. The young photographer had probably been a student himself, not so long ago. Göring gave a heavy sigh. He handed the document back and nodded his approval. Oh well. The students had been growing more and more unruly. It was time they were taught a lesson.\n\n"Reichsmarschall Göring," the photographer whispered in a shaking voice, drawing Göring from his thoughts. "I took a photograph of your plan. The one ordering Heer troops to use brutal force against the peaceful student protests. I will leak this photo unless you cancel this order immediately.

"Do you have anything to report?"\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Schörner responded smugly. He joined Remer and von Kielmansegg at the map. "Many of the Waffen-SS troops we bribed have followed through on their promises. They have arrived at our territory, and are ready to fight, as per your commands."\n\n"Excellent!" Göring slapped the table in excitement. "Heydrich will be furious! I want you to officially add this new unit into our army. Their skill set will be useful for very specific operations."\n\n"I shall begin planning immediately, my Führer," Schörner responded curtly, giving another salute and marching towards the door.\n\n"One more thing, Feldmarschal!"

That was, until this morning. Residents and soldiers alike of Reichsmarschall Göring's territory looked up to the sky just in time to see a bolt of lighting arc through the skies and towards the enemy lines.\n\nThe pilot of this craft? Johannes 'Macky' Steinhoff, top ace of the loyal Luftwaffe and a veteran of both the Second World War and the West Russian War. Steinhoff distinguished himself as the first operational pilot of the Luftwaffe's crowning joy during the Second World War, Me 262 jet. Tragically, Steinhoff was significantly burned across much of his body in a horrific crash during one of his take offs. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Steinhoff was one of the leading Luftwaffe instructors, but his desire to support his beloved Luftwaffe was so great that he immediately resigned his position and volunteered to fly once more.\n\nGöring, former Reichsmarschall des Luftwaffe of the German Reich, has personally congratulated Steinhoff, and offered him a promotion once the war for Germany has been won."

Still, even for the often ludicrous chaos that was now all too common across the globe, this was something else. Hermann Göring watched as the small military transport plane came in for a landing at the Kiel airport. Fighters and interceptors circled lazily in the sky, keeping the way safe for the small craft even in the capital of the provisional government that Göring had proclaimed following the death of Adolf Hitler. This VIP was too valuable to take any chances with.\n\nIt was Bormann. Not Martin of course; the conniving bastard was no doubt in Wien right now, hearing news of what Göring had pulled, shaking his fist impotently. No, this was Albert Bormann, the brother, who apparently had gotten any sense the family line had ever possessed. He had always displayed far more sense than Martin in supporting Göring's economic and military ambitions, and when Hitler had named Göring as his rightful successor, Albert had offered his services.\n\nHaving the brother of the man who was the biggest threat to his rule firmly within his camp was an utter coup, and the propaganda value was not lost on the would-be dictator. Even as he stood expectantly as the plane came to a smooth halt, the printers in every loyal city were churning out posters of Albert endorsing the rightful leader of the German people by the thousands. Göring smiled as he played out dozens of scenes of Martin's rage and consternation over and over again in his mind."

Already, Panzer divisions stream across [GGR_Defender.GetName], and fighting has broken out rapidly as [GGR_Defender.GetName] makes its stand against German aggression.\n\nHope for [GGR_Defender.GetName] seems scant. No matter how powerful its military, they stand against what is perhaps the world's mightiest.

It is doubtful that the war drums will go silent even after [GGR_Defender.GetName] falls. With that in mind, we should prepare for the inevitable onslaught, but others argue our efforts should instead go towards preventing it from ever coming here.

Now, it came as a surprise to absolutely none when the Italian government succeeding in ousting the fascist coup perpetrators and reinstating the French government.\n\nThere was little resistance to the army's entrance to the important cities of the French State. The Nazi collaborationists were no proper army, barely even a militia, and they were cut down like wheat by a scythe when a proper trained military marched in. Bordeaux, Marseille, and the rest of the important cities were under the control of the Italian-backed government, and the Italian hegemony has returned to the French.\n\nThe police are now sweeping from door to door, searching for the traitors to the Italian state. This attempt at Nazi hegemony, while incredibly flimsy and doomed from the start, was an absolute terror to most of the inhabitants of France. Many were refugees from territory brutally occupied from the Reich, and everybody remembers the horrors of Burgundian-controlled France.\n\nFor once in their lives, police officers were cheered on as they dragged people out of apartments and put bullets in their heads. Such a strange change of pace, but there were no measures too light for those who tried to destroy France once again."

All were dead, riddled with Italian-made bullets.\n\nThe French police swept street to street, rooting out the traitors. Dens were found, raided, and those within were sometimes arrested, sometimes shot, but never escaped. News channels reported of the great success in the French state in resisting the German imperialism. Politicians spoke out against the coup, praising the success of the armed forces in keeping France free. The traitors were despised, their names spat on, their memory to become forgotten.\n\nThere were but a few scattered cells left. Marcel Droit sat in a dank basement, water dripping from the mold-covered walls. He was one of the last left, those who were dedicated to ridding France of the Italians, dedicated to the glorious French State. He kept on writing letters to the Germans, begging for guns, begging for support, saying that the cause was not lost. The requests were never answered, because, knowing it or not, Marcel was lying. His cause was lost, and the Germans knew it, and they would never pay him any mind ever again.\n\nTo his last day, he would get no reply, until two weeks later, when the police knocked on his door, and gunned him down."

He started, and Mohammed chuckled as he jumped. His face soon turned stern, however.\n\n"Herr Axmann, I regret to say the King cannot agree to the terms we have discussed. It has been a great pleasure to host you, but I am afraid our time must come to an end."\n\nAxmann cursed to himself. An end to negotiations meant an end to his stay, and an explanation for his failure to reach terms. Of course, there always remained the possibility of badmouthing his hosts - more like than not an invasion had been inevitable, he had always said so.\n\n"I thank you and King Faisal deeply for your hospitality, Mohammed Abdullah. I hope one day we can meet once more under better circumstances."\n\nMohammed Abdulah ibn-Saud inclined his head and turned to leave, as Axmann began to pack.\n\nWhat an insufferable man, he thought.

This is it, it's over." this was Kohlner, the youngest of them. A harsher officer would have reprimanded him for uttering the words. But Krull knew that the boy had been through much at only 16 years.\n\n"Yeah, this was only a matter of time. Skirmishes everywhere, a tension you can almost cut. Really, with the fat man this was only a matter of time" This was Bellner a German-Hungarian, who had only recently been 'volunteered' into the Wehrmacht. "Istvaan..."

Finally however, he sat in Göring's office, though the man had drunk far too much wine for his preference.\n\nHe chose his words carefully. "Mein Führer, the Ringhorn plan is proceeding well, though there are some complications. To effectively maintain a cordon about Burgundy, a more effective network of bases is required. To rely solely on ports in Germany increases our ships' transit times to unacceptable levels. The ports of the Jade Bight and Denmark, while excellent, are simply too few, and many of our vessels must return to the Baltic to resupply. This creates gaps in our blockade, that -"\n\nGöring leaned forward in his chair, putting down his glass. "Gaps? My God man, this is unacceptable! You must rectify this at once!"\n\nThe Oberbefehlshaber was momentarily taken aback, but recovered quickly. "Indeed mein Führer. I believe that by requisitioning the ports of southern England and Norway, we could half the amount of time ships spend outside the cordon."\n\n"Then do so immediately. Damnation, it's like I have to decide everything here. Whatever it takes to bring down Burgundy, do it!" He excused him with a flick of his hand, and returned to his glass.\n\nNonplussed, he rose and left the room. He wasn't sure whether to be pleased or not."

The constant conquests of the Reich will inevitably reach the Co-Prosperity Sphere in a matter of months, and Russia will be the front line.\n\nThe Russians however are no more eager to take part in this conquest than we are to attempt to repel it. Whilst the All Russian Military League is nominally a collaborationist state, control over this vast area is weak and true collaborators are few and far between given Germany's reputation. The Reich considers them little more than cannon fodder at best and unworthy of life at worst. Messages have travelled across the steppe, carried by Russian and Mongolian horsemen, that suggest the League would be much happier working with Japan than Germany.\n\nTo steal Russia from under the Reich's nose would no doubt be considered an act of war, but war is all but inevitable. With Russian aid the front line would be much further from our own border, slowing the Reich's relentless advance and hopefully bogging them down in the Russian Hell once more."

 goering.1703.d:0 "Johannes Steinhoff entered the office to the drum of soft flesh on wood. It was the Führer of course, his thick fingers restlessly bouncing against the surface of the table over and over in an erratic rhythm. The veteran pilot noted that each digit was crowned with at least one jeweled ring. The value of the man's hands must have been worth more than an ME262. The 262; thinking about the jet had been a mistake. He felt himself once again in the cockpit, the sickening drop, the blinding flash. Then the fire, the awful flames that he could feel even now.\n\nIt took a supreme effort to regain his bearings. That was the past he reminded himself. That was the past and this is the present that must be focused on. If the corpuscular despot noticed the inner monologue, he didn't announce it. Instead, he gestured to a chair. Once the ace had seated himself comfortably, he plunged into the question that had been hanging above them this whole time.\n\n"My Fuhrer, while I deeply appreciate the trust you seem to place in me, I am still unsure as to why you want me specifically to lead your Luftwaffe."\n\nTo his surprise, Fuhrer Goring smiled, "Ah straight down to business, eh? I like that in a subordinate you know. Always good to get right to the important parts and leave small talk for later, yes that's just what I require."\n\nHe began to say something else, but stopped himself, looking to Steinhoff as if he might be nervous about something.\n\n"The truth is General Steinhoff..." he was quieter now, almost conspiratorial, "the truth is that I need someone who isn't beholden to either the butcher or the pissant by my side."\n\nSchorner and Speidel - the realization dawned on Johannes, the Fuhrer was apparently not fond of his top officers it seemed.\n\n"It will be a tall task no doubt, but I offer to spare no expense for my Luftwaffe you understand. Anything you want, you'll have no questions asked. Nominally of course you'll have to report to Generalfeldmarschall Schorner at OKW really you'll be answerable to me and me alone. Just send him some paperwork every now and again and I'll keep him off you. So, what do you say?""
 goering.1703.a:0 ""I suppose I don't have much of a choice.""

 goering.1704.t:0 "The Pencil Pushing Admiral"
 goering.1704.d:0 ""So, what do you think, Admiral Puttkamer?" The Führer studied the face of his guest, looking for a hint of the demanded decision. As usual, Puttkamer kept his poker face. Or maybe it was just indifference? In all their years together the old Reichsmarschall had never been able to parse out how much of the inscrutability Adolf's old adjutant exuded was a matter of personal policy or as simple disinterest. He briefly wondered if he had born a similar expression in those days when he had taken to the morphine needle. No, he decided after a little thought, even in the worst of his stupor he had always had the flame of ambition and the will to carry it forward. Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer was nothing like him.\n\nSo why then was he giving such a man the reins of the Kriegsmarine? Rather, what was left of the Kriegsmarine following the defections and the blow of Dönitz's mutiny anyhow. Göring could have given a dozen public-ready answers at that moment: the man had served Adolf impeccably, he had a long and distinguished career, on and on. The truth however was far simpler. The man had no ambition whatsoever. Even the humblest of clerks in the Reich's government knew that the new Führer was, to put it politely, not very interested in the functioning of the navy. That meant it was best left to someone else to manage, and better a man with little desire to abuse his authority than one hungry for more power. Never another Dönitz, that was Göring's sole criteria when he began his search, and it was the criteria he followed when he landed on Puttkamer.\n\n"I just want to remind you," the heavy-set dictator said softly, noticing the lack of response to the ultimate question, "that I do not intend to bother you on your duties. Nor will General Schörner be given free reign either. You will of course report to him, but that doesn't mean he has any more desire to manage your affairs than I do. Frankly, I'd consider it a great favor for you to remove the navy from all this factional bickering once and for all."\n\nPuttkamer nodded slowly, almost... thoughtfully.\n\nThat was all Göring needed, an acceptance, whether Puttkamer had realized it or not. With profuse thanks he escorted his new Grossadmiral to the door. For his part, Puttkamer put up no resistance, seemingly consigned to his new role. Good, Göring thought as he closed the door to his office, he hated when things were made difficult."
 goering.1704.a:0 "Who even needs Dönitz?"

 goering.1705.t:0 "The Hard Sell"
 goering.1705.d:0 ""My Führer, I must again insist that I do not feel as though I would be the best candidate to assume the position, especially in light of who my superior would be."\n\nGöring glared at the old war hero. Hours of this damnable stalemate was making him frustrated and irritable. Not for the first time he considered directly ordering Speidel to assume control of OKH, but then that would have to be an absolute last resort. He needed the general to agree to take the position and needed him to, if not enjoy his place in the new regime, be a check against Schörner.\n\nSpeidel must have thought that ended it, he began to rise from his chair. That made Göring snap, "Damnit general, do you not understand the stakes at play here? Do you think this is all about personal pride and pleasure? It isn't!"\n\nSpeidel's annoyance was written across his face. He clearly resented this lecture. Göring knew he had to make an all or nothing attempt if he wanted to salvage the situation.\n\n"Listen general, if you wish to serve the Reich and its people in the most effective way, then you must accept. Do you wish to see the entire Wehrmacht in the hands of Schörner? I certainly don't but it seems you do, if you'd simply walk away at this opportunity to limit his influence. Accept, and we can work together to make sure he isn't the only voice in my ear."\n\nThat got Speidel to stop. He responded slowly, thoughtfully, "If I were to accept, and that's only an if at this point, I would need some guarantees of non-interference from Schörner if the goal is to actually be effective in my position-. Would that be possible?"\n\nThe Führer smiled; he had Speidel hooked. "I can't guarantee a miracle but I should be able to wring out some concessions for your autonomy."\n\nSpeidel sighed, nodded, "The things we do for the Reich...""

 goering.1706.t:0 "A Proposal at Carinhall"
 goering.1706.d:0 "Gaspard had delivered a meal as splendid as always. The Führer made a mental note to reward Carinhall's resident chef, maybe he would even give the slaves who assisted him a day or two off. He was feeling magnanimous after such a lovely dinner. But enjoying his meal, even an excellent one, was not the purpose of the night. No, the purpose was the two men who flanked Göring on either side of the table. On his right sat Albert Bormann, the loyal brother, and to his left was seated his nephew Heinz Theodore. The pair also seemed to be savoring the experience.\n\n"Uncle, the roast beef is exquisite, I've never had it served so well before. Your cook will have to give mine the recipe one of these days."\n\nGoring smiled, "Thank you Theodore, but the food can be discussed later, I think. Right now I need to ask both of you," he motioned for Albert to join the conversation, "to prove your loyalty to me."\n\nAlbert, always trying to make up for his familial shame, was predictably quick to respond, "Of course my, Führer, whatever it is you need we will provide. I swear we are both your devoted servants."\n\nTheodore lamely nodded along, never one for having much in the way of independent thought. That would actually help in this case however.\n\n"My friends, the Reich is at a crossroads. We may have triumphed in the civil war but I must still contend with the Wehrmacht. They believe I owe my position to their efforts alone! Knowing that tenacious bastard Schorner, they will never let me forget it. That's where you two come in. I need men I can absolutely trust within the high command, men willing to keep me updated on everything the generals do. Gentlemen, can I count on your service?""

 goering.1707.d:0 "As he strutted into Hermann Göring's office, Reinhard Gehlen noticed the Führer seemed somewhat nervous. It was a rare state to see him in, and Gehlen wondered what had occurred to induce it. He would have his men look into it. Before he could further ponder it, however, the Führer addressed him. "Herr Gehlen. Welcome. I trust you mean to accept my offer? The Abwehr is in need of a new chief soon, and if you do not intend to take the position, I will need to begin searching for a suitable alternative immediately."\n\n"There is no need for that." Gehlen responded, curtly. "I intend to take the position, of course." He noticed the Führer's eyes wandering towards the door, so he glanced over his shoulder. There was no one there. His attention turned back to Göring, who had begun to focus rather intently on Gehlen instead. "However, if I may ask... is there a reason this promotion was not offered to me by Feldmarschall Schörner? The Abwehr is within his purview, is it not?"\n\nGöring looked as if Gehlen had slapped him. "I am the goddamn fucking Führer, and I appoint who I please." His voice was a quiet hiss, as if he did not want any outburst to be overheard. The Führer glanced at the door once again, before continuing, more calmly. "Schörner may cut your checks and take credit for your work, but as long as I am Führer, you report to me first. Is that understood?" Göring's eyes bored into the spymaster, a mix of domineering and desperate. Gehlen, suddenly having gained a much clearer understanding of what was occurring, quickly nodded."

 goering.1708.t:0 "From the Homefront"
 goering.1708.d:0 "The air screamed with the sounds of the machinery as production line upon production line produced the weapons of conquest and death. Jon hadn't heard the Dresden factory shriek out this much for almost a decade now. Even during the civil war, the factory had been quieter. What that meant for the future, the slave shuddered to imagine. He had seen the horrors of war firsthand, as his beloved Poland was crushed under the Nazi boot all those years ago. No one deserved such a fate.\n\nThe conveyor belt sent more half-assembled grenades his way, waiting for final assembly. It was then that the idea came to him. It was a foolish, brazen idea. But Jon had always been a daredevil in his youth. It was the memories of those days in the streets of Lublin, getting into mischief with tinkering with the watches in his father's shop that drove him forward. A modification here, an adjustment there, and the grenades would detonate much sooner. WIth any luck, they'd take whatever Nazi bastard was throwing them to Hell.\n\nThey had made the factories to be as efficiently possible, producing as much material as they could wring out through slave labor. For the first time since being sent to the damned place, Jon was happy about that fact. He was producing the defective explosives at a truly prodigious rate. Even the foreman seemed impressed, granting him an extra hour of rest for his efforts. Jon almost laughed out loud, but kept his composure and facade of submission.\n\nJon had long ago abandoned his faith, but he prayed to God now, for the nations of the world. He prayed his contribution to their defence would be felt; one life saved was all he asked for."
