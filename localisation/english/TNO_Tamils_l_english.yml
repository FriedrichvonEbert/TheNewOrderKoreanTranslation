 POLITICS_SJV_CHELVANAYAKAM_DESC:0 "Samuel James Veluppillai Chelvanayakam is a controversial figure. His supporters praise him as Thanthai Chelva, leading non-violent opposition for the unity of the Tamils and Sinhala. His critics deride him as a dangerously left-wing nationalist, wishing to make an ethnostate among people with only the slightest of differences from the Sinhala. However, nobody can deny that he is motivated.\n\nBorn in Malaya, Chelvanayakam's family moved to Ceylon when he was young. Working as a teacher, he soon became a lawyer, and it was all upwards from there. He served as counsel to King George VI of the British Empire, and was offered a position on Ceylon's Supreme Court, which he rejected. Representing Tamil interests during the Soulbury Commission, he was in good contact with the British Empire. And then it all came tumbling down.\n\nDisagreeing with Gopallawa's decision to join the Republic of India, Chelvanayakam continued to advocate for increased autonomy of Sri Lanka, even as the Sinhala Only Act was passed and the Tamils once again were betrayed. However, as others turned to violence, Chelvanayakam continued to hold strong to peace. And while violence has only worsened the global opinion of the Tamil, Chelvanayakam's efforts have been successful, quite evident with his new position as the first Prime Minister of [TIG.GetName]. However, with violent irredentism becoming more popular, and with Chelvanayakam getting older, time is running out for the Tamils, and Chelvanayakam must act soon if he wishes for a free Tamil nation to last."
