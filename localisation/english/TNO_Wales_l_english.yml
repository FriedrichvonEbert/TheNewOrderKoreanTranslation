The Y Mab Darogan has through his wisdom and will managed to achieve what every government prior has failed, and solidified the Welsh production centre solidly. The factories might not provide work for all the people of Wales but they will help us keep the loyalty of the urban majority, quite possibly our greatest potential threat at the moment with the welsh speaking populace being confined mostly to the north and interior."
 WAL_RTP:0 "강화된 경찰"
 WAL_RTP_desc:0 "The police are well capable of handling ordinary dissent, but the Anglo populace are a terrifyingly devious band of ruffians. Protests will be large as they fool honest Welshmen into acting against their own interests, the solution to this is rather simple. Expand the police, fill their ranks with the loyal, or those who are at least competent, and crack down on the malicious. We can search for foreign infiltrators whilst we are at it, round up the more influential Anglo leaders with our loyalists in the police and imprison them for as long we need."
 WAL_StrictControl:0 "경제 감독"
 WAL_StrictControl_desc:0 "The economy is a machine, it ticks onwards constantly and with incredibly delicate instruments. A single spanner in the works could well leave the entire machine in jeopardy, a spanner like the Anglo population for instance. The government will have advisors in every factory, every business above a certain size, there will be no opportunity whatsoever for saboteurs or incompetence to deviate the machine of the economy away from its dedicated course. Naturally we will try to not be too intrusive, but omelettes and eggs and so on."
 WAL_CLA:0 "Celtic Liberation Army Member"
 WAL_CLA_desc:0 "The Celtic Liberation Army is despite being established in Wales a force for all the Celtic peoples of the world. Bretons, Scots, Manx, Irishmen and Welshmen all serve in one united force dedicated to the preservation of the unique Celtic cultures and their ways of life. Ironically despite many attempts the disparate nature of the organisation requires much of the communication to be done in English, something which is said to annoy the higher ranking members of the CLA to no end. "
 WAL_WelshNatRevSupa:0 "웨일스 민족 혁명"
 WAL_WelshNatRevSupa_desc:0 "The Welsh National Revolution is one the finest brainchilds of Julian Cayo-Evans, the Y Mab Darogan. Based to some extent upon the socialist theories albeit purified for use in Wales, Cayo-Evans in his National Revolution has postulated that a constant revolution which evolves to face the challenges as they come is better than a defined period after which Anglo influences might creep back into society. Naturally this renders Wales somewhat unstable but it also makes them an oddly flexible power on matters of ideology."
 WAL_DeportAnglos:0 "앵글로 추방"
 WAL_DeportAnglos_desc:0 "The deportation of the Anglo populace that once resided in Wales is one of the final pieces of the Free Wales Army's National Revolution. The Anglo populations which were accounted for are rounded up and trucked enmasse to English border towns, usually with some of their belongings but not often a great number of them. The loot seized is granted to the state or, depending upon the nature of the confiscating officer in question, himself. Naturally there is a not insignificant amount of resistance to the deportations."
 WAL_ExpandFWA:0 "자유 웨일스군 확대"
 WAL_ExpandFWA_desc:0 "The FWA is the backbone of the Welsh State under Julian Cayo-Evans, an ideological force equally as much as a purely security one. With a heavy degree of emphasis on superior soldiery to their likely English foes, the recent expansion of the FWA has only made it an even deadlier force. The new fighters in the FWA might not be as well trained or disciplined as those which came before but they more than make up for their deficiency in training with utter fanaticism."
 WAL_TWNA:0 "웨일스 국민 의회"
 WAL_TWNA_desc:0 "The Welsh National Assembly is to be the cornerstone of the new legislative process, taking a great deal of weight off of the position of Y Mab Darogan and transferring some of the formative legislative responsibilities to the Assembly as a whole. Naturally the Y Mab Darogan holds both veto and significant influence in the process of deciding the fine print of any passed laws but this is the closest to a representative organ that the Welsh people have had in some time. Even if Cayo-Evans does choose who sits in it."

 WAL_CayoCentralize_desc:0 "The position of Y Mab Darogan is one of great responsibility, which is why only Julian Cayo-Evans can be allowed to have it. He has freed Wales from its shackles of Unionism and the Anglo traitors that use it as a shield, he has strengthened Wales by pruning away from it the weak links, the deceitful and the cowards. Some may call him a despot, but he is our despot if so. A man utterly dedicated to the future of his nation and the success of his people.

 POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "함께 두면 어울리지 않을 것들이 많습니다. 그러면 점점 권위주의적으로 변해가는 국가에서 권력에 매달리는 극작가이자 시적인 정치인은 어떨까요? 이 모순적인 말에서 아이러니를 찾을 수 있을지도 모릅니다. 그렇지만 어린 웨일스인 국가의 지도자 손더스 루이스가 바로 그런 사람입니다.\n\n제1차 세계 대전 때 벌어진 전투에서 부상을 입었던 루이스는 스완지에서 대학생들을 가르쳤습니다. 웨일스 독립 문제는 이 웨일스인과 동료 몇 명이 훗날 플라이드 컴리라고 알려지게 될 민족주의 정당을 창설하게 만들었습니다. 초대 당 대표인 루이스는 자신이 재발명한 웨일스 민족주의에 대해 별로 큰 지지를 받지 못했습니다. 새 문학 작품을 발표할 때나 약간의 성공을 거두었죠. 그렇지만 제2차 세계 대전이 결정적인 전환점이 되었습니다. 플라이드 컴리가 "영국인이 아닌 웨일스 민족을 위해 일할 것"을 촉구하자 독일인들은 웨일스 점령을 하지 않고 스코틀랜드 전역에 집중할 수 있는 편리한 방법을 생각해냈습니다. 그리하여 웨일스는 독립을 얻어냈습니다. 독일인들의 편의만을 위해서 말입니다. 한편 플라이드 컴리는 이 새 국가의 여당으로 지명되며 하늘 높이 승천했습니다.\n\n그렇지만 손더스 루이스가 취임한지 오랜 세월이 지났습니다. 이 노인은 열정과 활력을 전부 잃고 시골로 내려가 문학 작품을 계속 쓰고 있습니다. 이 때문에 루이스 파벌은 절박하게 권력에 매달릴 수 밖에 없습니다. 권력을 붙잡기 위해 점점 더 권위주의적인 수단이 쓰이고 있습니다. 루이스 파벌이 얼마나 오래 버틸 수 있을지 궁금할 수도 있습니다. 루이스의 고립이 만들어낸 빈 자리를 메우기 위해 수많은 파벌이 나타났습니다."
 POLITICS_WELSH_ASSEMBLY_DESC:0 "라이히가 웨일스를 독립시켰을 때 정부를 조직할 곳이 필요했습니다. 당연하게도 구 카디프 시청이 채택되었죠. 인상 깊은 위상과 훨씬 더 인상 깊은 건축 양식을지닌 이 건물은 1905년 에드워디안 바로크풍으로 지어졌으며 웨일스와 영국의 전설에서 기인한 다양한 조각상들에 둘러싸여 있습니다. 시청을 의사당으로 만드는 것은 그리 어려운 일이 아니었습니다. 방이 꽤 확장되어 있어서 의회를 꾸리기 위한 의자를 더 넣을 수 있었거든요. 그리고 여기 카디프의 다섯번째 시청에 미래를 알 수 없는 걱정스러운 정부가 앉아 있습니다.\n\n석탄 재고량이 떨어지기 시작했을 때 루이스 총리와 그의 플라이드 컴리 내 파벌은 재앙이 벌어진다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 하지만 성공하고자 싶었던 루이스는 대중이 이 작은 비밀을 알지 못하도록 온갖 수를 다 썼지요. 플라이드는 할 수 있는 만큼 날조하고, 할 수 있는 만큼 기록을 소각하고, 할 수 있는 만큼 파괴했습니다. 결국에는 걸리고 말았지만요. 불신임 결의가 루이스 총리를 실각시키며 정부는 자멸했습니다. 이 순간 두 플라이드 당원들 간의 싸움이 벌어졌고 결국에는 갈라서게 되었죠.\n\n이제 파벌들이 대결을 벌입니다. 웨일스 정부의 미래는 논쟁 거리가 되었습니다. 웨일스는 그토록 필요한 경제적 연료를 다 빨아들인 바로 그 불길에 불탑니다."
 POLITICS_JULIAN_CAYO-EVANS_DESC:0 "어떤 이들은 아버지가 세상을 바꾸는 사람으로 만듭니다. 어떤 이들은 어머니가 연민을 가진 전사로 만듭니다. 어떤 경우에는 고용인이 과격 민족주의를 불어넣기도 합니다. 영국의 포기에 쓰라림을 느낀 폴란드 망명 군인 야니츠크 헬크즈만은 줄리언에게 민족이 의존할 수 있는 것은 같은 민족으로 된 군인들 뿐이라고 가르쳤습니다. 바로 그런 군인 중 한명이 되기로 마음먹은 카요는 자유 웨일스를 위한 승리의 투쟁을 벌일 준비가 되어있었습니다. 유감스럽게도 카요는 이 독립이 대답해야할 수많은 질문 중 첫번째라는 것을 깨달았습니다.\n\n카요가 자유 웨일스군 창립을 돕기 전에 이베리아 과르디아 시빌에서 1년 동안 복무했으며 독립과 프랑코에게서 본 완고한 민족주의에 홀딱 빠져들었다는 소문이 돕니다. 자유 웨일스군의 창립자인 카요가 공산주의뿐만 아니라 의회 민주주의도 증오하며 훨신 공격적인 행보를 보인다는 것은 의심할 여지가 없습니다. 이런 관점은 자유 웨일스군의 보편적인 견해는 아니지만 든든한 권력 기반이 되어줬습니다. 손더스가 이 자를 무시하는건 위험하다고 봤을 정도로 든든했지요. 아마 그때도 루이스는 카요를 굴복시킬 수 있을거라고, 플라이드 의회의 보수파로 끌어들일 수 있을거라고 생각했을 겁니다. 카요를 임명할 때 쩌렁쩌렁 들린 비판들이 확실히 맞았습니다. 사람들이 걱정했던대로 (아니면 몇몇 당파에서 바랬던대로) 카요는 이 첫 기회를 이용해 정부에게 총을 들이밀었습니다. 이제 영국화와 자유주의의 제일 강경한 반대자가 용의 땅의 권력을 잡았습니다. 수천 명의 단련된 전사들이 그의 말을 충실하게 따릅니다."
 POLITICS_JOHN_MORRIS_DESC:0 "존 모리스는 언제나 실용적이고 비정치적인 사람이라고 주장해왔습니다. 해방된 땅 전역에 웨일스 국기가 휘날릴 때 모리스는 법률 시험 공부를 하고 있었습니다. 고향 에버리스트위스에서 북부 석탄 광부와의 연대를 보이기 위한 파업이 일어났을 때, 모리스는 그냥 커튼을 치고는 음반을 틀었습니다. 놀라운 일도 아니지만 이 남자를 정계 입문시킨건 집합행위가 아니라 자신이 맡은 사건 때문이었습니다.\n\n이 사건에서 살인 혐의로 체포된 잉글랜드인 이민자를 성공적으로 변호한 일은 전국 뉴스 1면에 올랐습니다. 그 결과 모리스는 소규모 친영파 정치인들에게 환심을 얻게 되었습니다. 이 "비정치적"인 이에게 자유 무역, 규제 철폐, 국제주의 사상을 담당하게 한 이 독립 집단은 모리스가 애버라본 의원이 되도록 선거 운동을 벌였습니다. 하지만 의회에 입성한 모리스는 미래 웨일스의 미래는 공허한 자유주의가 아니라 과거의 강력한 사회민주주의에 있다고 깨닫게 되었습니다. 이 전략은 성공을 거두었습니다. 유의미한 수의 컴리 고흐 당원을 끌어들여 토머스가 경악하게 만들었죠. 신생 연합당의 대표가 된 모리스는 총리직을 노리고 루이스 행정부에 대한 다양한 외침과 스캔들을 조종했습니다. 고흐가 연합당에 흡수되며 확고하게 주도권을 쥔 모리스는 승리로 당을 이끌었습니다. 한때 "비정치적"이었던 이 남자는 통일된 사회민주주의 영국을 향한 탄탄한 길을 기대하고 있습니다."
 POLITICS_EMRYS_THOMAS_DESC:0 "엠리스 토머스가 노동 운동을 하는 사람이라고 말하는건 절제된 표현입니다.\n\n그는 노동 운동을 하고자 태어났고 노동 운동으로 만들어진 사람입니다. 지금 생각해보면 활동적인 독립노동당원 부모님이 웨일스의 석탄 산업 중심지에서 기른 아이가 웨일스의 노동자를 위해 싸우는 사회주의 정치인이 되는건 당연한 일이었죠.\n\n이 학교 교사는 제2차 세계 대전 당시 남웨일스 당 대표로서 양심적 병역거부자를 변호하면서 정치 인생 첫번째 순간을 보냈습니다. 종전은 토머스가 마침내 잉글랜드의 멍에에서 벗어난 고향을 보개 해줬지요.\n\n런던이 독일군의 군화에 짓밟히는 와중에, 토머스는 광부들의 이권을 대변하고 연방주의자들을 막고자 손더스의 대연정에 참가했습니다. 언어법이 모든걸 박살내기 전까지는요.\n\n이제 플라이드 컴리의 프랑켄슈타인 정부는 옛날 이야기입니다. 토머스의 승리는 마침내 웨일스를 그가 언제나 바래오던 민주사회주의 국가로 개혁할 수 있게 해주었습니다."

WAL_Free_Wales:0 "자유 웨일스"
WAL_Free_Wales_desc:0 "Wales is a young nation, but it is also an old country. As such, it has the privilege of dealing with problems that commonly afflict nations both young and old, such as the wild and often misguided actions of our political fringe and extremist youths. But there are also those with an unfairly nostalgic view of the past- they call themselves Unionists, others call them traitors- and would see Wales return to a union with England and the rest of the Isles.\n\nThere is no man better equipped to handle this precarious situation than our own Saunders Lewis, and ever since he became our Prime Minister he has handled the problems with dignity and grace. But the wear and the tear is starting to show, and whether his patience or his health catches up with him first is yet to be seen. God willing, we should be able to resolve the looming crisis before then, because there's no telling if whoever comes next will have the ability to."
WAL_Open_The_Floor:0 "개회"
WAL_Open_The_Floor_desc:0 "Parliament will soon be in session, though this time it's a good deal more controversial than it has been in the past. Aside from a number of significant pieces of legislature that will be presented to the Parliament when it opens, there's also the Annual Economic Assessment to consider. The Assessments manage to strike a delicate balance between incendiary and painfully dry, with the Plaid Cymru receiving a great deal of the frustration from years of middling-to-weak economic growth.\n\nRegardless, the show must go on, and a show this is expected to be. It seems like the parliament grows ever more stratified and less cooperative with every time it goes into session, and some are wondering if there's any hope that the parties emerge from this next one with national unity and cooperation in mind."
WAL_Annual_Economic_Assessment:0 "연례 경제평가"
WAL_Annual_Economic_Assessment_desc:0 "The time has come for the Annual Economic Assessment. Gywnfor Evans- presumably after not finding anyone willing to pass it onto- has the dubious honor of presenting the Assessment to all of the Parliament, and how they receive the news will determine the party's economic platform moving into the year coming up.\n\nThere are already whispers that the report carries a message that is far from positive. While there hasn't been any outright decline in overall prosperity, imports have increased dramatically while exports have fallen in kind. Inflation is also a looming threat over the country, as the drive to create a distinctly Welsh currency to replace the Pound may have been somewhat overzealous for as small a nation as Wales. The job of telling the increasingly dysfunctional parliament this is as unenviable as any."
WAL_Welfare_qn:0 "복지 논쟁"
WAL_Welfare_qn_desc:0 "One of the most controversial topics emerging from the Assessment comes in the form of the welfare debate. Wales has a reasonably strong system of financial safety nets and government welfare, primarily supported by the social democrats within Plaid Cymru. After seeing the stagnation of the national budget, hardlining right-wingers with the Plaid Cymru have taken to roundly criticizing the programs and calling for austerity- or even abolishing the welfare state altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, the left wing of the party insists that when times get tough, it's the poor and the working class that bear the brunt of the weight. With solutions ranging from maintaining it to increasing their budgets, there has been a solid and cohesive defense of Welsh welfare in the face of this call against it."
WAL_Coal_qn:0 "석탄 문제"
WAL_Coal_qn_desc:0 "After the strained silence that the parliament held all throughout the Assessment, the time has come to develop a plan that can get the Welsh economy back on track. Something that the report stressed was that Wales as a nation is incredibly dependent on its coal exports. While this reliance doesn't seem to be a cause of the recent slowing of Welsh economic growth, there are those who think that this reliance makes the economy entirely too fragile. After all, should something happen to either disrupt Wales' ability to acquire its coal, or should coal fall even further out of international favor than it has already, the results would be devastating.\n\nThere are those who argue otherwise though. The fact that Wales lives and dies by its coal exports is not new information, and that there is nothing to fear from relying on coal. The argument goes that leaning so heavily on the export of coal gives Wales a kind of strength, not fragility, and ensures that they won't be investing in any overly optimistic or ambitious investments that could ruin them in turn..."
WAL_Workers_rights_qn:0 "노동자의 권리"
WAL_Workers_rights_qn_desc:0 "Normally, when the rights of the working man comes to the attention of governments and legislatures, it comes from the working men themselves demanding better pay, shorter hours, or better working conditions. This time however, it's different. Wales' industry and market is relatively new- at least as its own rather than a subsidiary of a larger economy- and many small, new businesses are struggling to get on their feet.\n\nThey blame labour laws and regulations that were instated upon the founding of the Welsh nation. They argue that they won't be able to keep up with much larger and wealthy foreign nations, and that Welsh finance could perish in its infancy if there isn't action taken, and soon. They want a general rolling back of some regulations- primarily in terms of labor rights and safety regulations- in order to give Welsh companies a leg up. This of course, is a controversial suggestion in Parliament- unspeakable to the left faction of Plaid Cymru..."
WAL_off_with_the_chaff:0 "규모 축소"
WAL_off_with_the_chaff_desc:0 "After what practically amounted to a small war in the parliament, the bruised egos and sullied prides finally gave way to a narrow victory in favor of austerity. While the resistance was spirited and prevented any sort of truly drastic measures from being taken, there are now plans to reduce government spending on its social programs.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to narrow their scope and availability. This will allow Wales to take of those truly in need while not wasting precious resources on those who can probably get by without it. The people will grumble if they must, but they'll have forgotten all about it in a few months' time, and we will reap the benefits."
WAL_Poverty_your_end_is_nye:0 "가난과의 전쟁"
WAL_Poverty_your_end_is_nye_desc:0 "Parliament has, after a great deal of infighting and arguing, finally come to an agreement that leaves everyone in the building perfectly dissatisfied. The social democrats within the parliament managed to get their way, much to the chagrin of the hardliners within Plaid Cymru. Their victory resulted in a resolution to increase spending in order to expand the budget for Wales' various social programs and welfare benefits across the board. These programs have thus far been exceptionally popular, and the people themselves are more than happy to see their tax dollars going to projects like these.\n\nIt doesn't fix the problems previously stated though, and the increased spending still has its critics in parliament- they aren't exactly going to just lie down and shut up now that the battle was lost. It will be worth it to keep an eye on the nation's income and its debt in the coming years to see whether or not the resolution, as popular as it may be, is worth it."
WAL_All_in_on_coal:0 "석탄에 올인"
WAL_All_in_on_coal_desc:0 "After fiery debate in parliament, a narrow victory has been achieved, adopting an official policy of going "all in" on the coal industry has won out. While there are concerns about the long-term benefits of this policy, they were largely dismissed when compared to the immediate and tangible benefits that Wales will reap with this policy. In the short term Wales will be able to meet ever-increasing demands for coal exports, allowing Wales to shore up its trade deficit and solve the problems that may arise as they come.\n\nThere's no point in planning for the future if your immediate present isn't secured, after all. Wales will show those naysayers that she is more resilient, as much in financial as she is in military and political strength. Coal is power!"
WAL_diversify_economy:0 "경제 다변화"
WAL_diversify_economy_desc:0 "After a long and drawn out debate, the faction of parliament in favor of diversification managed to win out and adopt their stance into official national policy. While it's clear that there's going to need to be some momentary sacrifices as government subsidization and sponsorship of coal mining is reduced to make way for other industries, it's pretty clear that the long term benefits will be worth the cost.\n\nThe math is simple, for while coal might work as the pillar of Welsh industry now, what might the situation look like in five years' time? Ten years? Twenty? Diversification will allow us to remain flexible and adjust as needed in order to keep pace with the world at large. Wales needs to keep with the times if she's to avoid becoming a total economic backwater."
WAL_expand_workers_rights:0 "노동자 권리 헌장"
WAL_expand_workers_rights_desc:0 "When the businessmen approached Parliament to beg for the rolling back of regulations, they most certainly did not expect the Emyrs Thomas and his faction in the party to use it the way that they did. Rather than allowing doom and gloom of the hypothetical fate of these poor, poor businessmen and capitalists, the social democrats within the party controlled the flow of discussion, and turned it to pointing out the areas in which the current rights and regulations had blind spots or were not strictly defined enough.\n\nThe resulting resolution was the formation of a new Workers' Rights Charter, the exact opposite of the original intent. The charter contains a comprehensive and modernized set of legal and regulatory codes that will make the rights of the Welsh worker clear and easily understood."
WAL_deregulation:0 "족쇄 제거"
WAL_deregulation_desc:0 "As unfortunate as it might be, the men of commerce do have a point. How can any Welsh business keep up with an American or even an Irish business when they've had decades to establish themselves, whereas the Welsh business only had a matter of years? They have the advantage in resources, in established wealth, and in simple momentum, while the Welsh have nothing in comparison. Welsh businesses need an edge if they're going to be able to compete.\n\nWhen Wales has had a long and successful history of commerce and trade, and our companies and corporations are sitting upon an established, we can think about reinstating those protections. But for now, the unrestrained and unregulated growth will allow those small companies that head start they need, and while the unions may rattle sabers and bang pots together in protest, but they will just need to adjust to the reality of things until such a time that we'll be able to accommodate their desires again."
WAL_address_the_unions:0 "Address the Unions"
WAL_address_the_unions_desc:0 "Being such a small nation with such a large portion of our citizens in heavy labor work, it only makes sense that the local unions wield a much greater deal of power here than it does in other nations. This has been to the benefit of their workers, but it makes half of the parliament nervous, especially when we pass- or even consider- legislation that the unions may not be in favor of. As such, it's common practice to hold a meeting with the unions following a session of parliament, just to be sure.\n\nThis time, the address will be pretty important, given that we passed multiple, very significant pieces of legislation one after the other. It's time to see if the unions are happy with the changes we've made, or if we have earned their ire and will need to find a way to make it up to them, someway, somehow."
WAL_will_our_finances_be_okay:0 "장기적 경제"
WAL_will_our_finances_be_okay_desc:0 "Even as the fate of Wales seems more and more incumbent on rancorous parliamentary debates, a good deal of Lewis' policies are still prepped in back rooms. And as he grows older by the day, he may have less and less of a say in what said policies are. Roderic Bowen and Gwynfor Evans, two chief architects of the Welsh economy, have been drafting up discussions to have with PM Lewis. Beyond the public, short-term view of the Assessment, the two men seem to be aiming for a "pragmatic" and stable road to economic growth, the kind that can last for decades. Should the present problems be transcended, these talks will hopefully be remembered as key to a continuously stable Wales."
WAL_military_funding:0 "군사 투자"
WAL_military_funding_desc:0 "While largely undiscussed in the Annual Assessment, the question of military spending deserves to be examined, if not for budgetary concerns than simply to appease Julian Cayo-Evans, always loudly using apocalyptic rhetoric to demand a stronger army. The facts must come before this charged rhetoric, for our brave men are not to be used as pawns in some political game.\n\nLoyal, well-armed, and well-trained, our military nevertheless has gaps. Corruption is rife, and could be solved (depending on who you ask) with more money for better pay, or cuts and investigations to reduce public money in their hands. Such is the general theme of this debate all problems related to the military will be solved by either cutting or boosting its budget, but what are the problems our military exists to solve? To defeat the English? To be a last line of defense in worst-case scenarios? Or perhaps they are the problem, as some leftists and Unionists argue."
WAL_talks_with_the_FWA:0 "Hold Talks with the Free Wales Army"
WAL_talks_with_the_FWA_desc:0 "It's time for a talk. The Free Wales Army seems to grow ever more brazen by the day, and innocents are both their targets and are getting caught in the crossfire. This is not just horrific in its own right, but it's an affront to the rule of law and our own ability to keep the peace in Wales. Their constant targeting of Englishmen within our borders and without threatens our peace with our neighbors, and it will forever hold back Wales if we don't do something about it.\n\nTo just attack them would lead to open rebellion, and we can hardly afford that when our nation's existence is as of yet, so new. We are unfortunately in no position to make demands either, so we're going to need to negotiate with them. Underneath a banner of truce, we will find out what they want, and what we can offer to get them to stop their military buildup, and to stop their attacks. Evidently, Cayo's appointment wasn't enough, what more could these ingrates want?"
WAL_talks_with_soc_militias:0 "Hold Talks with the Militant Socialists"
WAL_talks_with_soc_militias_desc:0 "It would seem as though our problems with unruly paramilitaries doesn't end with the Free Wales Army. Recently, there has been an increasingly radicalizing group within our labor force who have adopted various tenets of socialism and are growing increasingly violent as time goes on. If we don't step down to their level and have a conversation, this could get very bloody, very fast.\n\nThe groups are scattered, unorganized, and the movement itself is so intensely grassroots that it's difficult to even find central leaders with whom to talk with. Thankfully, through the cooperation of the unions, we've been able to identify some useful surrogates who have a pretty good pulse on the overall hopes and feelings of this rising militant population. Let's just hope that they can be reasonable and we can come to an accord without any outbreak of violence."
WAL_do_jack:0 "이 모든 것이 끝나기를 기다려라"
WAL_do_jack_desc:0 "The presence of both Emrys Thomas and Julian Cayo-Evans in our cabinet means that any direct action taken against their preferred radicals will alienate them, leading our government to divide and collapse. Party advisors are saying that continuing on a tightrope will only embolden extremists on the ground, but they clearly have never had to sit in a cabinet meeting with both a leftist and a staunch nationalist.\n\nIt is disheartening to hear of things like militant strike waves, aggressive demonstrations, or lynchings in Northern villages. But anger and hatred is like a stick of dynamite, burning and causing damage only temporarily before burning out for good. The efforts of Saunders Lewis and his cabinet to help the Welsh nation are self-evident. A sensible middle ground exists in the vast majority of our citizens, and radical tactics will only further alienate the FWA and the socialists from these moderates. We are a democracy, after all. There is no place for petty score-settling directed by our government. Whatever happens, our brave law enforcement are surely competent enough to deal with the situation. The center will hold, we just won't be enforcing it by the barrel of a gun."
WAL_crackdown_on_FWA:0 "카요의 부하들을 체포해라"
WAL_crackdown_on_FWA_desc:0 "More than anything, the Free Wales Army is a nationalistic, militaristic blight on our new nation. So as long as we have to tolerate them in our borders, we cannot pretend to be the arbiters of peace and security in our own nation. It's clear that the simple appointment of Julian Cayo-Evans was not enough to keep them in line, so we're going to need to take more drastic measures to curb these terrorists' influence.\n\nSaunders Lewis has prepared an order to police forces all over Wales, complete with a list of suspected and confirmed Free Welsh hideouts, strongholds, and supply depots. A long string of arrests will follow, and after gutting both their ability to organize and crippling their manpower, the Free Welsh will fade into the margins of history books.\n\nWith this order, we can, in one evening, all at once, break the strength of the Free Welsh and secure ourselves as the sole authority in Wales. No doubt, Cayo-Evans will rant and rage about this action, but without the force of an army at his back, what could he do to us?"
WAL_crackdown_on_soc_militias:0 "토머스의 폭도들을 해산해라"
WAL_crackdown_on_soc_militias_desc:0 "The radical socialists from within the working class of Wales are a different kind of beast entirely, as compared to the Free Wales Army. While the Free Welsh might be rabid dogs, they are chained rabid dogs, so as long as Julian Cayo-Evans is in our cabinet to make sure that the leash is in fact, held. The socialists on the other hand, are entirely unfettered, unbound, and free to cause havoc, should they gain the strength to do so. This cannot stand.\n\nDealing with this issue should also help keep the Free Welsh in line, as Julian Cayo-Evans was the first to suggest using police forces to disperse the socialists' rioting. Emrys Thomas is threatening drastic political action if we go through with this plan, but Cayo-Evans in turn assures us that such threats are simple bluster, and that he can do little and less if his precious rioters were to be scattered to the wind. We hope he's right."

But now we have established ourselves, and we need to revisit our scattered, inconsistent national education system.\n\nSome localities and provinces are simply handling education themselves, with a smattering of private schools in some of the richer regions of Wales complicating the picture even more. The simple disorganization has caused problems, with educational standards in one part of Wales exceeding or being drastically beneath that of another part of Wales. We need to start coralling these local public schools and private institutions and start installing some kind of regulations, or even state control of these institutions, if necessary."
WAL_next_gen_teachers:0 "차세대 교사들"
WAL_next_gen_teachers_desc:0 "We have something of a unique problem. While we are in the midst of reforming and organizing our education system, we have run into the issue of our educators. The vast majority of them are English- many of whom are exiles from the collaborationist regime in England- and they are often very old besides. Most of them are set in their ways, and if we are going to breathe new life into Welsh education, we need to first inject fresh blood into the educational staff.\n\nThey need to be Welsh-born, or at least well-assimilated, and similarly need to be well-versed in the Welsh tongue. We can start up a training and teaching program, recruiting many of those old English professors and teachers to pass on the torch to the next generation of Welsh educators, and in turn, be integral in the birth of a new educational tradition in the nation of Wales itself, one that should guarantee the lasting impact and strength of our culture."
WAL_lessons_from_chubut:0 "추부트에서의 교훈"
WAL_lessons_from_chubut_desc:0 "Welsh, as a language, is going stronger than it has since the High Middle Ages. However, the language isn't really the same language that we spoke back then either, as centuries of English domination has introduced a lot of English into the language that would otherwise not be there. But this isn't the case for everywhere Welsh is spoken, because it has come to our attention that in the most unlikely of places... Argentina.\n\nGaiman, Trelew and Trevelin are Welsh-descended villages in the Chubut Province of Argentina and the last remnants of Y Wladychfa Gymreig. Unlike Wales, they have not experienced centuries of English control, and they have not been under as firm supervision of the Spanish-speaking Argentine government as we were underneath the English. We should send some scholars to Argentina to study the language, how it differs from our own, and figure out how they managed to preserve the tongue so effectively in spite of the intervening centuries."
WAL_standardized_testing:0 "전국적인 등급 부여"
WAL_standardized_testing_desc:0 "With our control over the public education system and our influence in the private schools secured, the last remaining incoherency in the Welsh educational system is how we grade students. There are a few different ideas that different provinces and schools have introduced, but it seems as though everyone agrees that we just need to stick with one, as the confusion has brought region and time of education into question for colleges and employers alike.\n\nThe process is simple, we'll just take the different ideas, everything from percentile grading, to grading on a 20, to grading on a 100, to pass and fail versus letter grading, and determine which serves Wales the best. Every version has its supporters, but is surprisingly non-partisan in who supports which."
WAL_A_Bright_Future:0 "빛나는 미래"
WAL_A_Bright_Future_desc:0 "Wales was not a nation born in glorious revolution or mighty conquest, but by accident for all intents and purposes. The nation that Saunders Lewis inherited was factitious, with violent revolution and aggrieved paramilitaries threatening her very existence. It was a nation with a fragile, small, and weak economy, a suspect military, a fractured parliament, and no international standing. By all accounts, Wales should not stand today, and yet here we are. By all accounts, the Welsh tongue and culture should be dead, and yet here we are. By all accounts, Wales should be a puppet of a foreign power, or a rump state otherwise, and yet here we stand.\n\nSaunders Lewis was not the kind of man that would normally have statues made of him, but he has proven to be exactly the unifying figure that this young nation needed. Through his leadership and decisive action, Wales has weathered the storm and defied all expectations. Though we do not know what the future will bring, the citizens of the newly reformed and rejuvenated Wales can rest easy knowing that we have proven our ability to stand tall and proud amidst tribulation."

 ##COAL CRISIS##
 ######################

WAL_Mine_Rumors:0 "광산에서의 소문"
WAL_Mine_Rumors_desc:0 "From the depths of the coal mines, several worrying rumors have surfaced. The miners claim that the coal in some mines is starting to run out after years of intensive mining. If these reports turn out to be true they will forecast an end of the coal industry and a greater impending disaster.\n\nA collapse of coal could cause a chain reaction which would have devastating consequences, including the collapse of the Welsh economy. We must hope for the sake of our government and the people of Wales that this can be avoided."
WAL_Coal_Investigation:0 "광산 조사"
WAL_Coal_Investigation_desc:0 "With the rise of the recent news from the mines, we must investigate for ourselves. Put simply the government just wishes not to believe the miners. These rumors are preposterous, but, if true, the situation that would follow would be very serious indeed.\n\nSo we shall see for ourselves the validity of their claims, we will suspend our disbelief and start an investigation. Soon these fears will be put to an end and we can move on with more important matters. Surely the miners cannot be right."
WAL_Cover_Up:0 "조사 결과를 덮어라"
WAL_Cover_Up_desc:0 "Plaid cymru has many opponents, who would be keen to destabilize our government through any way they can. If they were to learn of the findings of our investigation they would publish it in every paper, broadcast to every radio and sow discontent throughout Wales. Which would lead to considerable hostility towards our party amongst the people.\n\nA large scale cover up will have to be undertaken to prevent this. The media must not find out. They will not undermine us."
WAL_Burn_The_Report:0 "보고서를 태워라"
WAL_Burn_The_Report_desc:0 "We were wrong.\n\nThe situation is worse than we could have possibly imagined. The investigation has started to send back reports that confirm all of the miners' suspicions, we are running out of coal. If the reports were to spread, confidence in the government would dissolve, guaranteeing the end of our leadership of Wales. We must not and will not allow this.\n\nEvery single report from the mines will be disposed of promptly. Reduced to ashes, never to be brought to the public."
WAL_Falsify_The_Statistics:0 "통계를 조작해라"
WAL_Falsify_The_Statistics_desc:0 "Having learned of our misunderstanding of the circumstances we will have to prevent too many people learning of the extent of this disastrous situation. The numbers themselves are damning enough to endanger our position in parliament. They will have to be changed.\n\nOrders will be given to start altering the statistics coming from the mines. Perhaps we can keep Plaid in power and end this before it spreads too far."
WAL_Buy_Silence:0 "침묵을 사라"
WAL_Buy_Silence_desc:0 "To avoid the chance that the discovery in the coal mines might spread, we will have to contain the knowledge of its existence. Bonuses are to be offered to the miners who uncovered the shortage, so long as they keep their mouths shut. The bosses of the mines will also receive an incentive to stay silent. Every single one of them, miner and owners alike, will have their silence bought.\n\nThey must understand why they ought to stay quiet. We will have to trust them or else face our ruin."
WAL_its_all_Coming_Together:0 "미국식으로"
WAL_its_all_Coming_Together_desc:0 "Our situation has started to mirror the events that took place in the United States of America. After the realisation of the potential consequences of a coal shortage we did what was necessary. The threat of the media and our other opponents forced us to take matters into our own hands. We will deny everything and hide what we can from them.\n\nIf it is good enough for President Nixon it is good enough for us. We did nothing wrong and nothing will go wrong."
WAL_Keep_Calm_and_Carry_on:0 "조용히 하던 일 하세요"
WAL_Keep_Calm_and_Carry_on_desc:0 "After all our efforts it seems the worst of our fears have passed. Finally we can start to turn our attention away from coal and onto more ordinary matters.\n\nElsewhere others carry on free of the knowledge we have kept from them. Miners have returned to the depths, journalists remain unaware and the rest of the public is none the wiser of the catastrophe that we have avoided.\n\nLife has continued and all is calm."

WAL_Out_of_the_frying_pan_and_in_to_the_fire_desc:0 "Having to receive the news of the dwindling production of coal was bad, the ensuing cover up was rough as well. Chaos took hold over the government, as smoke rose from fires that were fueled by the reports, whose number had already been overstated. Silence was bought, every miner was eyed with suspicion.\n\nYet it has still gotten worse.\n\nSomehow the reports have been leaked, soon all of Wales will know of the impending coal catastrophe and, more worryingly, the extent of our cover up. Our efforts have failed, may we be spared and allowed to survive what is to come."
WAL_Whitewash_Saunders:0 "손더스는 잘못한 거 없어"
WAL_Whitewash_Saunders_desc:0 "Our party has already started to be embroiled in the political disaster that has followed the leak of one of our documents. If we are to find a way to survive we must find a way to downplay Saunders' role in the coverup. It is the only conceivable way to restore any form of public trust in Plaid.\n\nThe Prime Minister will be put through a blitz of talks with the press in order to gloss over any part that he may or may not have played in the crisis. With Saunders out of the turmoil we can start to hope that one day the people of Wales will forgive the rest of the party."
WAL_Accuse_Thomas:0 "토머스가 한 일이야"
WAL_Accuse_Thomas_desc:0 "Emrys Thomas has long been an accomplished minister of our party, he has been an ever greater friend to many of our members. But for the sake of the party that he has loved and helped build he will have to lower his head.\n\nThis is a sacrifice no one in the government wishes to force Thomas to make, yet it will be necessary to prevent pinning the blame on any other faction and causing more political turmoil. So we will regrettably have to accuse Thomas of the cover up to try and save the parties chances of clinging on to power."
WAL_Implicate_Evans:0 "에반스가 원인이야"
WAL_Implicate_Evans_desc:0 "Evans and the other socialist in the government are to blame for the crisis which they have exacerbated. We will reveal to the people that it was in fact Evans and his lackeys within the trade unions that tried to cover up the fact that the coal mines of Wales were depleted.\n\nImplicating Evans into the cover up will help clear the other members of our party that were involved. We risk exacerbating the crisis with more political infighting, but it is a risk we will have to take to survive."
WAL_blame_the_Cayo_Clique:0 "카요 파벌 때문이야"
WAL_blame_the_Cayo_Clique_desc:0 "A crisis as severe as this could have only been aggravated by a band of destructive agitators. Cayo and the rest of his clique would make the perfect culprits for the scandal. They are already known to be potential troublemakers, trying to weaken the government through creating such an emergency would not seem too far fetched.\n\nCayo will have the blame affixed to him, thus preserving what remains of the public's confidence in our party."
WAL_Answer_to_the_assembly:0 "의회에 답을"
WAL_Answer_to_the_assembly_desc:0 "As the crisis has gone on our position within the assembly has deteriorated, all of our former allies have stabbed us in the back, leaving us politically isolated. It will soon be impossible for us to continue leading Wales.\n\nWe are obliged to answer to the Assembly and its ministers. They will be told of the situation and the events that followed. The fate of our government will soon be decided by the rest of the Assembly."
WAL_Answer_to_the_Public:0 "대중에게 답을"
WAL_Answer_to_the_Public_desc:0 "No matter how hard we might try we will simply never be able shift all of the blame from our party. As this crisis and its subsequent cover up happened on our watch we will be the ones that will have to answer to the public.\n\nIt will not be easy. Much embarrassment is certain to be caused as a result of the questioning but we must try to make up for the faults of the past, in the hopes of satisfying the people. Maybe there is a chance that we can still claw back some credibility."
WAL_Vote_Of_No_Confidence:0 "불신임 투표"
WAL_Vote_Of_No_Confidence_desc:0 "We have failed Wales.\n\nOur efforts to appease the public have seen limited success at best and the assembly has united against us. There is only so long that we can carry on in this position, soon we will have to swallow our pride and face a vote of no confidence. A vote few expect us to survive. Nevertheless we will have to allow ourselves to be held accountable.\n\nWe will have to hope that the people of Wales will be more forgiving."
WAL_Back_To_Business:0 "우리 정상 영업 합니다"
WAL_Back_To_Business_desc:0 "Plaid has done it again! We have yet again managed to overcome what seemed to be an unimaginable obstacle. Many days and weeks have passed since we found out about the shortage of coal and still there are no reports to be seen.\n\nTo the public the coal crisis simply does not exist.\n\nNow that everything is dealt with, Wales is back. We can return to business as usual and continue leading Wales towards its future."

 WAL_Goch1_Goch_Victory:0 "고흐의 승리!"
 WAL_Goch1_Goch_Victory_desc:0 "The workers of Wales have spoken, and their wish is clear - idealism, socialism, democracy! The uncaring and distant capitalists of Plaid Cymru and the unionist Tory traitors have lost their sway, their lies and corruption exposed for all to see. Cymru Goch, once but a splinter faction of the Plaid, has now been entrusted with a goal most noble - restoration of the Welshmen's faith in their own government and the establishment of democratic socialism in Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_Political_Reform:0 "정치 개혁"
 WAL_Goch1_Political_Reform_desc:0 "The previous government's administration has left behind a legacy of authoritarianism and repression - things we cannot, and will not, tolerate. Sweeping reforms in the political sphere are required in order to ensure the stability and prosperity of our Republic."
 WAL_Goch1_Promote_Welsh_Democracy:0 "타당한 민주주의"
 WAL_Goch1_Promote_Welsh_Democracy_desc:0 "Our young nation was built on the virtues of democracy and political plurality, virtues that are worth protecting. While we do not agree with the capitalists, reactionaries and unionists that exist in our society, they are still citizens of Wales, members of our democratic society. Our common values must be promoted and protected."
 WAL_Goch1_Keep_The_Scum_Out:0 "인간 쓰레기 접근 금지"
 WAL_Goch1_Keep_The_Scum_Out_desc:0 "There are some, however, who do not respect our democratic way of governance, and would seek to destroy and replace it with a dictatorship. These dangerous organizations and people, however fringe in their beliefs, cannot be tolerated. While some will cry and moan about the supposed "breach of free speech and assembly laws" they will, in time, understand our decision."
 WAL_Goch1_Endorse_Leftist_Parties:0 "좌익 정당 지지"
 WAL_Goch1_Endorse_Leftist_Parties_desc:0 "Great injustices were made in previous years concerning the treatment of our fellow socialists and other leftists, all in the name of "ensuring stability" and "fighting the red menace". These explanations are ridiculous, of course, and are simply excuses for the power-hungry oligarchs to silence their enemies. Now, as the tables have turned, so has the government's stance towards leftism. Our comrades must be supported and endorsed, so that the workers have their representation in politics!"
 WAL_Goch1_Deal_With_Julians_Fanatics:0 "줄리언의 광신자 처리"
 WAL_Goch1_Deal_With_Julians_Fanatics_desc:0 "Cayo-Evans and his band of fanatic terrorists are the greatest internal danger to our democracy, eclipsed only by the accursed fascists surrounding us. They must be dealt with quickly and decisively lest they try to oppose us directly."
 WAL_Goch1_Media_Representation:0 "언론의 묘사"
 WAL_Goch1_Media_Representation_desc:0 "The media in our country were always loyal to the establishment, protecting and downplaying the failures of Plaid Cymru. This cannot continue. Pluralism in the media must be guaranteed and other parties must be allowed to be in the spotlight. The old guard won't be too keen on this idea, however, and problems are almost guaranteed to arise."
 WAL_Goch1_Civic_Nationalism:0 "시민들의 민족주의"
 WAL_Goch1_Civic_Nationalism_desc:0 "The newly-achieved independence of our country has led to a drastic increase of ethnic nationalism, most visibly expressed in the form of the Free Wales Army. While we love our land and treasure its independence, we believe that it belongs to all of our countrymen, not just those who are ethnically and linguistically Welsh. Love for Wales must be based on a set of shared values and loyalty to our democratic institutions, not blind ethnonationalism."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Democracy:0 "웨일스 민주주의"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Democracy_desc:0 "Our political reforms have paid off! Welsh democracy is stronger and healthier than ever before, pluralism and freedom are legally guaranteed and defended, and political discourse is remarkably and surprisingly civil. Our work is not done yet, however! The questions of the economy and society remain."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Gears_Of_Change:0 "변화의 톱니바퀴"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Gears_Of_Change_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Wales was a relative backwater in the economical sphere. Great progress was made during the industrial revolution, but the cost of said progress was great - the common worker was left mostly destitute, and although the situation improved near the turn of the century, Plaid Cymru's capitalist ways have kept the people of Wales from achieving true prosperity. Not anymore. The workers will be protected, and Wales will prosper."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Resources:0 "웨일스의 자원"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Resources_desc:0 "Our land is blessed with bountiful quantities of various resources, many of which are the mainstays of an industrialized economy. Extraction of these resources gives our nation a position otherwise impossible to achieve for a country of our size, but there are many deposits which have not been touched by human hands. Finally extracting these riches will help our economy immensely."
 WAL_Goch1_Heavy_Industry:0 "중공업"
 WAL_Goch1_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization in the 19th and early 20th centuries led to a population boom and a staggering increase in wealth, but it was distributed unequally, and many regions of Wales, especially in the northern and eastern reaches of the country are predominantly rural and poor. Establishing new industrial centers will help realize our true potential."
 WAL_Goch1_Digging_Out_More_Coal:0 "석탄 더 파내"
 WAL_Goch1_Digging_Out_More_Coal_desc:0 "Coal is Wales's life and death, a source of employment for many, and a cause of death for many others, be it from the pollution it produces or calamities like the Aberfan Disaster. As much as we would prefer to use cleaner and more efficient resources, it is the most economically viable right now, and if we wish to expand the economy, we have to expand the coal mines as well. Proper health and safety regulation should take care of most of the risks, shouldn't it? Who knows, maybe someday we'll have better alternatives..."
 WAL_Goch1_Bigger_Steelmills:0 "더 큰 제철소"
 WAL_Goch1_Bigger_Steelmills_desc:0 "Steel is arguably the most important resource in the world, used for everything from kitchen utensils through buildings up to tanks, cars and airplanes. Thankfully, our rich coal and iron reserves allow us to produce great quantities of it. All we need now is an expansion of our existing and the building of new steel mills."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Welsh_Stamp_Of_Approval:0 "웨일스의 승인 도장"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Welsh_Stamp_Of_Approval_desc:0 "Since we lack the cheap workforce and sheer size of countries such as Germany or the USA, we cannot prioritize quantity over quality. Instead, we must focus on producing only the finest of goods and materials in order to secure a spot in the international market - and for that, we need strict quality assurance."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Welfare:0 "웨일스의 복지"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Welfare_desc:0 "The trap which many capitalist economies fall into is one of growth for the sake of growth, economic progress benefiting only the strong and rich while leaving behind the toilers who make said progress possible. This happened in Wales too, but it will continue no longer. Better wages, regulations and improved working conditions will make for just recompense for the hard work of our people."
 WAL_Goch1_Reverse_Previous_Restrictions:0 "과거의 제한 복귀"
 WAL_Goch1_Reverse_Previous_Restrictions_desc:0 "The Plaid Cymru was founded on the noble ideas of democracy and freedom for the people of Wales, but they failed to uphold them after we regained our long-awaited independence. Their ways became more and more authoritarian, and plain disregard for the will and desires of the people could be seen. Restrictions were placed upon Welsh political life, ones that spit in the face of the ideals upon which our nation was founded. They must be reversed, so that freedom, true freedom, may return to Wales."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Broadcasting_Channel:0 "웨일스 방송 채널"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Broadcasting_Channel_desc:0 "The modern inventions of television and radio have a relatively small community of users in our country, with newspapers being the primary source of news for the common Welshman. Many people, however, have no *good* source of news, relying on sensationalized tabloid-like publications. To remedy this, we need to create a state-owned, free-to-air broadcasting channel, filled with only the freshest news and best entertainment."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Workers_Protection_Bill:0 "웨일스 노동자 보호법"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Workers_Protection_Bill_desc:0 "Our government has, after many discussions, consultations and opinion surveys drafted the Welsh Worker's Protection Bill, which will guarantee and expand the rights and privileges of the working class of Wales. While an official proposition of the WWPB is sure to start a lively debate in the Assembly and attract criticism from the Plaid Cymru, it simply must be done, for it will serve as a major step-stone in the struggle for workers' rights in Wales."
 WAL_Goch1_Ending_Working_Toil:0 "노역 중단"
 WAL_Goch1_Ending_Working_Toil_desc:0 "Previous Labour Commission reports, especially during the Plaid Cymru's period of dominance, have painted a grim picture of Welsh working conditions. Labourers were found to be suffering from back pain, light and heavy injuries and other physical ailments caused by overworking and insufficient safety regulations, not to mention the psychological effects of toxic and unsafe working environments. This year will see another report being submitted to the government - may it be the best one yet."
 WAL_Goch1_Wonder_Working_Wales:0 "멋지게 일하는 웨일스"
 WAL_Goch1_Wonder_Working_Wales_desc:0 "Our economy is stronger than ever! Production is skyrocketing, new businesses are opening everywhere, our population is increasing... and all without any crony capitalism! The people are wealthy and happy, slowly forgetting about the tribulations of years past. Already, a new nickname has stuck to our country, and is gaining more and more popularity around the world - Wonder Working Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_A_New_Face_To_The_World:0 "세계의 보일 새 얼굴"
 WAL_Goch1_A_New_Face_To_The_World_desc:0 "Wales, for nearly all of its history, has been a politically insignificant nation. Subjugated by the Romans and later by the Britons, our standing in politics has been one of a vassal, always at a disadvantage. Even after the restoration of our independence following the Second World War, our status was low, and no measures were taken to change that. Now, however, with the situation at home getting better and better every single day, we can turn our gaze outwards and use our domestic successes to achieve our goals in the field of international politics."
 WAL_Goch1_Keeping_Halder_Content:0 "할더 계속 만족 시키기"
 WAL_Goch1_Keeping_Halder_Content_desc:0 "After the shameful defeat Great Britain suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany, the accursed fascists installed a military garrison in Cornwall in order to better oversee the situation in their rotting puppet, the Kingdom of England. While we hold nothing but contempt for the fascist murderers and oppressors and would like to see their complete removal from the Isles, considering the circumstances, we must abide by the principles of Realpolitik. A diplomatic mission must be sent to the garrison commander, Franz Halder, to ensure him of our good intentions towards Germany. A lie, of course, but a necessary one."
 WAL_Goch1_Ignore_Scottish_Complaints:0 "스코틀랜드의 불평 무시"
 WAL_Goch1_Ignore_Scottish_Complaints_desc:0 "As expected, the Scots aren't too thrilled about us reaffirming our relations with Germany. Their government has issued an official diplomatic protest against our actions, barely stopping short of calling us fascist collaborators. As much as we regret having to make that decision, we stand by it, and for that, the protest must be ignored. Sometimes, silence is the better option."
 WAL_Goch1_Throw_Out_Local_Complaints:0 "현지의 불평 묵살"
 WAL_Goch1_Throw_Out_Local_Complaints_desc:0 "An even worse situation has arisen. Although we could simply ignore the Scots, we cannot ignore the cries and criticisms of our people, especially if they are morally justified. Sadly, there is no place for morals in dealing with the Germans, and our citizens must accept that fact.\n\nKeep the repression minimal."
 WAL_Goch1_Antagonize_The_English:0 "잉글랜드인 적대화"
 WAL_Goch1_Antagonize_The_English_desc:0 "The English to the East have long oppressed our nation, conquering and exploiting it for their own imperialist gains. Their mismanagement and ill will have cost us much and kept us behind in development - in all spheres. There can be no friendship between us."
 WAL_Goch1_Across_The_Irish_Sea:0 "아일랜드해 너머"
 WAL_Goch1_Across_The_Irish_Sea_desc:0 "Ireland, our Celtic brother-nation, has experienced a story much like our own - one of subjugation, mistreatment and oppression at the hands of the dastardly English. Now, it presents a golden opportunity - trade and cooperation across the sea! International friendship and cold, hard capital await!"
 WAL_Goch1_Our_Trade_Partner:0 "우리 무역 파트너"
 WAL_Goch1_Our_Trade_Partner_desc:0 "Germany is a monster devouring Europe and leaving it to rot in its innards, the antithesis to all we hold dear and sacred... and yet, we find ourselves at its mercy. The German economy, however weakened, is a behemoth towering over us, one which could squash us beneath its feet if it wanted to. The only reasonable course of action at the moment is economical cooperation and appeasement, lest we find ourselves fighting a financial war we cannot win."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Dragon_Emerges:0 "용이 일어나다"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Dragon_Emerges_desc:0 "With renewing, improving and strengthening our international relations in the region we have secured a safe, solid place for Wales on the political scene. New friends were made, threats neutralized and attitudes clarified. We no longer have to fear for what tomorrow may bring, for only an unprecedented cataclysm could shake up the accords and treaties signed!"
 WAL_Goch1_Cymru_Am_Byth:0 "Cymru Am Byth"
 WAL_Goch1_Cymru_Am_Byth_desc:0 "Our time as the government of Wales will be forever remembered as one of the bright points in our nation's history! The people are wealthier, happier and safer than ever, our economy is booming, our international position is safe and secure, and our democracy serves as a beacon of hope on a continent strangleheld by fascism! The proud people of Cymru have shown their mettle once again and proven that nothing can break the spirits of Welshmen!\n\nCymru am Byth!"
 WAL_Goch1_Look_At_Coal:0 "A Second Look At Coal"
 WAL_Goch1_Look_At_Coal_desc:0 "Our coal reserve is the most important feature of our economy and one of the few reasons for our economic significance. In past years, its extraction was performed without regard for the health and wellbeing of our workers and environment. Now, however, we must take a second look at the issue in order to guarantee ethical and sustainable coal extraction."
 WAL_Goch1_Above_the_Hills:0 "Above the Hills"
 WAL_Goch1_Above_the_Hills_desc:0 "The working conditions of miners have gone a long way from the frequent cave-ins, explosions, overworking and injuries characteristic of the XIXth Century, but they are still quite poor. As part of the Coal Plan, we have drafted a massive campaign of reform across the mining sector, improving safety, pay, efficiency and access to medical care. Implementing these ideas will not be cheap, quick or easy, but the long-term benefits will be immense."
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_the_Unions:0 "Convincing the Unions"
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_the_Unions_desc:0 "Our government has long supported the trade unions of our country, increasing their rights and privileges in accordance to our sincerest beliefs. Through these efforts, we have built up significant goodwill with them, and now is the time to capitalize on it. What good is our Coal Plan if the workers do not consent?"
 WAL_Goch1_Offer_More_Steel:0 "Offering more Steelworks"
 WAL_Goch1_Offer_More_Steel_desc:0 "Despite our radical improvement of safety in the mining sector, coal mines continue to be dangerous (mostly due to coalbed methane) and taxing working environments, both physically and mentally. In order to provide employment for workers unsuitable for mining and increase steel production, the Ministry of Economy has prepared a steelworks expansion plan, the main objective of which is the building of new steel mills and the modernization and expansion of existing ones. All we need now is a green light from the Prime Minister."
 WAL_Goch1_No_Worker_Suffer:0 "No Worker Will Suffer"
 WAL_Goch1_No_Worker_Suffer_desc:0 "The struggle for better working conditions never ends. Great strides have been made during our term, but there is still a lot of room for improvement, namely - the expansion of welfare and improved safety regulations. We progress more and more towards the establishment of a Welsh Safety Net!"
 WAL_Goch1_Increasing_Taxes:0 "Increasing Taxes"
 WAL_Goch1_Increasing_Taxes_desc:0 "As expected, our reforms have put a strain on our budget, and we are getting dangerously close to insolvency. This situation has laid bare the insufficiency of our current tax rates and shown us the necessity of increasing them. Such an action will hurt our people, especially those of the upper class, but in time they will understand that a society of solidarity requires sacrifices."
 WAL_Goch1_Sheep:0 "Sheep in the Valleys"
 WAL_Goch1_Sheep_desc:0 "As a party of urban workers, we have focused our platform on the betterment of their situation. The attention we gave to the industrialized and mining-dependent regions of our country has sadly marginalized our agricultural sector and alienated many farmers. Such a move was a terrible mistake, one we must - and will - remedy."
 WAL_Goch1_Forgotten_Regions:0 "Focus on Forgotten Regions"

 WAL_Goch1_Sustainable_Economy_desc:0 "No longer are we at the mercy of mining! While far from total autarky, our economy is now strong enough to stand at its own feet, with exports steadily increasing and imports of basic goods dropping dramatically.

 WAL_Goch1_Assuage_Union_Fears_desc:0 "The Aberfan disaster traumatized our nation and prejudiced it against coal mining, and the unions are no exception.

 WAL_Goch1_Threaten_Nonbelievers_desc:0 "It seems the task at hand is too difficult to complete through diplomacy alone, for some of our party members have broken ranks and are planning to vote against our Plan. They have their reasons, no doubt, but we cannot tolerate such dissident behavior in the Cymru Goch, not when so much is at stake. We will give them a simple choice - vote in accordance with party lines, or say goodbye to their posts."

 WAL_Goch1_No_Voice_Behind_desc:0 "While we could threaten the dissidents to bring them back behind party lines by force, such a solution would be undemocratic and counterproductive. Instead, we should start a unity campaign, calling for all Welsh patriots in the Assembly to support the Plan.

 WAL_Goch1_A_United_Left_desc:0 "For the first time in Welsh history, the parliamentary left is strong and united! Our representatives, supported by smaller leftist groups, have achieved a majority strong enough to pass the Coal Plan and secure a future of safe, sustainable coal mining in Wales!"

 WAL_Goch1_Looking_Overseas_desc:0 "The lands overseas house some of the last holdouts of freedom and democracy in the world. Waiting, gathering their strength, they look for opportunities to strike against fascism. That is how they're portrayed in OFN propaganda, at least.

 WAL_Union1_Focus_On_Factories_desc:0 "As part of our early efforts to reinvigorate the Welsh economy, it has been decided that a greater capacity of heavy industry will be needed to manufacture bigger and better products. More factories are to be constructed in certain towns and cities to reinforce what little exists of our current industrial base.\n\nThere is no limit to the amount of labor that will be on offer to these factories.

These disputes are unlikely to cause a serious split in the party but a consensus will still have to be reached within the government.\n\nOn one end, the Labourists want most of what remains of the coal industry running, in spite of the cost, to reassure the miners.

It funded expensive new cultural institutes that brought Welsh culture to the forefront of people's lives. Of course this is not in keeping with our own ambitions and so something will have to be done about them.\n\nCutting of their funding will force them to limit their operations and allow us to take their place and guide the Welsh people away from nationalism."

Its roots have burrowed deeper into the minds of the Welsh people, now that we have taken control we can start to persuade them that such ideas are unfounded and are likely harmful.\n\nIf the protests that have raged outside the assembly have told us one thing it is that nationalism will have to be permanently discredited before we can truly move safely onwards.\n\nNew articles will be printed and more broadcast will be aired, publicizing the benefits of a closer relationship with England."

 WAL_Union1_A_Compromise_desc:0 "Although the nationalists are still a danger to our government, we could not possibly risk a purge. There would be too high a chance of greater tension between the army and the government. Some form of a compromise will have to be found instead of letting any nationalist officers remain a threat.\n\nIdeas to appease them have been thought of from pay rises to allowing the Welsh language to be spoken, but most unionists want any agreement to be more beneficial to us than them.

 WAL_Union1_Pardon_Nationalist_Soldiers_desc:0 "The government knows of the large number of nationalists that exist within the armies ranks, having determined to not to have them removed we will have to excuse them of their role in the nationlist movements. Allowing these officers to stay may be a risk, as they could influence other soldiers if they retain their posts.

 WAL_Union1_Loyalty_Earned_desc:0 "Loyalty to the government has not been imposed, instead we have earned it. Coming to terms with the army has enabled us to settle the differences we had with some of the more headstrong nationalists.\n\nWhat we have achieved is much more stable than the purge that could have been. We knew that we could never have completely removed all of the nationalists from the army.

Because of past laws implemented by the nationalists, studies of Welsh history and literature have remained mandatory in many schools.

 WAL_Union1_Minimize_Welsh_History_desc:0 "A major part of the nationalist education system was the Welsh academy that educated many of Wales' most talented students.

 WAL_Union1_Focus_On_Academics_desc:0 "The government is to commission a new set of history textbooks, textbooks that will be significantly different to the ones issued by the nationalist government. As we are the ones printing them now, we will have to decide the contents of the books.\n\nInstead of concentrating on the time when Wales was independent of England, as the nationalists did, we will make an effort to portray Wales as an integral part of Britain.

 WAL_Union1_Students_Of_England:0 "영국의 학생들"
 WAL_Union1_Students_Of_England_desc:0 "If we are to effectively teach the new history program we ought to increase the budget of our education system as a whole. Many services were underfunded by the nationalists, with education being one of the institutions worst affected.

 WAL_Union1_Limited_Integration:0 "A Common Enemy"
 WAL_Union1_Limited_Integration_desc:0 "With unification right around the corner, there is no need for Wales to have such a large and unsustainable army.

 WAL_Union1_Two_Systems_One_Country_desc:0 "England is the best ally that Wales could possibly have.\n\nTheir military might and cultural likeness make them the ideal friend to the Welsh people.

Those fools thought they could simply go teetering along as "their" nation burned. They thought they could remove their leader and chop off any semblance of direction remaining. In short, those Anglophiles and Communists thought there would be no consequences for their dereliction of duty. All they ended up doing was waking the dragon.\n\nWith the politicians rounded up and the FWA awaiting orders from Prime Minister Cayo, the ground is prepared for a cultural offensive against Anglicization in all its nefarious forms. All that's left is for our new leader to notify all people, from the ports of Cardiff to the quietest northern villages, that they all have a role in this historic battle for the very fabric of the Welsh nation."

Cymru Goch and their false religion of socialism must be burnt away if we are to develop a culture of nation above all, which they clearly stand against. The once-might unity of Plaid Cymru was forever shattered by their self-righteous breakaway, dividing them right at this nation's most critical juncture. Undoubtedly, their arrogance was key to the damage wrought by the Coal Crisis, as they damaged not just the government but sowed chaos through their support of strikers.

From the pubs of Cardiff to the smallest dance halls in the northern villages, we must ensure that any suspected Unionist is reported to the authorities, so that we may reinstill within them the true values of Wales. For the few foolish enough to continue resistance against this surging tide, our most loyal soldiers await within newly established detention centers.\n\nIn decades, when our freedom is untouchable and we stand as a shining beacon of what a truly proud nation can achieve, the poisonous beliefs of the Unionists will be historical footnotes.

Their day of judgement, finally, has come.\n\nEven the lowliest field offices of Plaid find themselves occupied by weak-willed traitors to the cause of national sovereignty. These party members do not have to be purged, if they immediately swear themselves to carrying out Cayo's program. Those still clinging to English liberal thought, of course, have no place in a proud society, let alone its guiding party. Various leaders of these sects with Plaid have already been...marked.\n\nWhile some fifth-columnists are rumored to have called our plan a way of weakening a precarious position, they are simply fearful of what is coming their way. Yes, Plaid will be disorganized in some areas for a brief period, but this will simply mean that truer defenders of Wales, ones not incumbent on suited bureaucrats to carry out their will, can implement Cayo's program.

If they desire to live separately from us, so be it. They will have no right to complain if they suddenly find the desire to move over to the prosperous Welsh regions once declared beneath them.\n\nBuilding on this, our advisors also point to evidence of increased criminality among the Anglos, along with less desire to work, and more support for communism. This is all scientifically proven, and makes one ask why the backwards Lewis government ever believed these two groups could function side-by-side.

Others may need a bit more convincing, either through a few nice promises or the examples made of traitors. Finally, there are the traitors who hold posts from the top on down.

The MPs have arrived, the speeches have been given and, behind closed doors, the battle for the future of Wales is about to begin. As battles go, this one isn't that much more civil than most.\n\nWales' internal political situation is... complicated to say the least. The current ruling party is Plaid Cymru leading a coalition of left and right wing nationalists, including Cymru Goch, democratic socialists and the second largest party in the nation. The coalition is only barely held together with many elements holding opposing views.\n\nTheir ranks are bolstered by the Unionists, the numerous English refugees that fled during Operation Sealion, who are named after and characterised by their desire to return to a United Kingdom with England as well as their wish to suppress Welsh culture in favour of English language and culture. They are also well known for their general disinterest in any government issues that do not affect them or England, preferring to stay on the sidelines in the Welsh National Assembly.\n\nThen there is the Free Wales Army. Led by Julian Cayo-Evans, this right-wing nationalistic paramilitary organisation vehemently opposes the Unionists and any idea of a union with England, viewing the English as the "true enemies of the Welsh people". Part of the coalition, they are notorious for their violent methods and clashes with Unionists and for their willingness to go to any lengths to achieve their goals. Despite being publicly perceived as merely a young, inexperienced and quite unstable leader, Cayo-Evans is determined to keep Wales Welsh and his charismatic personality and the fantical devotion and military might of the FWA mean he is not to be trifled with or dismissed without consequence."

The agricultural sector is shrinking but the growth in the coal mining industry well makes up for that. As you well know, coal mining is by far the largest industry in the economy, providing the vast majority of the jobs in the country. There have been calls to decrease our economy's reliance on coal and to open up the economy for new industries."\n\n"And what do the mining firms think of that idea?"\n\n"Well unsurprisingly, they are much more in favor of upholding the status quo. However, it may be prudent to hear out those who are calling to diversify the economy since, well, if anything were to happen to the coal deposits the result would be...well...catastrophic for the economy and Wales as a whole.""

Many in the government believe that the Welsh economy's reliance on coal is a critical weak point and that the economy needs to be opened up for other industries to sprout up. On the other side are those that believe otherwise, seeing the reliance on coal as an indication that coal is still the way forward for Wales.\n\nThe Plaid MP rises to the podium to begin his rebuttal.\n\n"With respect to the honourable Mr Davies, this is a ridiculous notion! There is no evidence that anything will happen that could cause the coal industry to weaken at all. In fact there is abundant evidence to the contrary, the coal industry has never been stronger! Any sort of changes would simply affect the whole economy adversely.""

The Goch, praising the decision, also stated, "The workers are the backbone of the economy. The workers, the people are what matter. Not the big business, not the rich, the people." The bill, which implements higher minimum wages and limits maximum working hours, has been declared by members of Plaid Cymru to be "wasteful". One Plaid member said the following: "Any increase in so-called worker rights and regulations will just cause the productivity of businesses to fall. The increased funding to government agencies to ensure these misguided regulations are enforced is a waste of money in a time where no money can be afforded to be wasted."\n\nGael Dawson smiles to himself, finally the importance of him and his fellow workers was being recognised and appropriately rewarded by the government.

Rather, by removing the shackles that hold businesses back from prosperity, deregulation will open up the way towards a better future for all in Wales. While admittedly some workers' rights have been lost, the amount those same workers and Wales as a whole stand to gain from the economic benefit of deregulation is well worth the loss." Protests have broken out in several cities including Cardiff as workers take to the streets. Some of these have resulted in violent clashes with police with many workers being taken into custody. Many Goch MPs have denounced the controversial decision with one going so far as to calling it an "obscenity" and a "threat to workers' rights everywhere".\n\nGael Dawson frowns, putting down the paper firmly.

Only time can tell whether or not these promises will be fulfilled."\n\n"Oh thank God," Gael breathes, relieved.

Morris, popular amongst the English post-war refugees, has already begun to outline his plans to bring about a peaceful unification of England and Wales. Emrys Thomas of the Cymru Goch has declined to comment on the result but the outspoken, controversial leader of the Free Wales Army, Julian Cayo-Evans made it extremely clear the FWA's position regarding the result declaring his intention to "oppose any attempts to replace the tyrannical English boot upon Wales." Only time can tell whether the Unionists' plan will come to fruition."\n\nGael sighs, it wasn't the increased labour benefits he had been hoping for when he voted for the Goch, but maybe a reunion with England wouldn't be so bad.

The gigantic landslide careened down the mountain and engulfed a significant portion of the village, destroying dozens of homes and, most distressingly of all, the local school.\n\nDesperate rescue teams have been attempting to look for survivors, but scores of bodies have already been recovered from the ruins, the vast majority of them being children. Over a hundred pupils and several dozen teachers were in the school at the time of the disaster, so the ultimate death toll is expected to be very grim indeed. A few older residents were also recovered from collapsed houses, though most people were thankfully away at work at the time.\n\nOutrage has quickly spread across Wales, with many blaming the government's exploitative coal mining policies and lax regulations for the disaster. Questions have been raised as to how the spoil tip was allowed to grow so large in so precarious a place, and particular criticism has been levelled at economic minister Gwynfor Evans and his secretary Roderic Bowen for creating such a loose regulatory environment that would allow a thing like this to happen.

Those who are part of the Goch also wish that the government will continue to increase its scale to better protect Welsh workers from poverty."\n\nThis was a poor display of feigned unity over the government's welfare policy. In reality, the divisions on the issue are deep and neither side is keen to fold to the other. This was made clear to all inside the Assembly as a member of the Plaid stood up to address the point made by the Goch.\n\n"Whilst the view of the Goch is admirable, it is infeasible within our current economy. Put simply, the country does not have the money for such an irresponsible expansion, in fact it does not even have the money to support the current system."\n\nBarely stifled outrage came from the Goch as they realised what the Plaid was pushing for.

His hands trembled slightly as he desperately started to count it again in the hope that it was in fact who had faltered, but he soon realised that he was right. Life kept getting worse for him.\n\nThings have not always been this way for Roberts, since being sacked from his last job he, like the rest of his coworkers, had expected that he would not be on the dole for long. He planned to find a job after a few weeks of recovery. Once he had sorted his life out he could return to work, whether it be in an office, production line or a pit.\n\nHowever, over time no such opportunity arose; he began to get used to the meager life that his benefits allowed. To save what patience he had was not an option. Despite the fact he desperately needed some savings in case his financial situation somehow deteriorated further.\n\nNow is the time he needs the money, money that he never had. Now he feels as if he has been left behind to slowly be bled dry of his remaining wealth, until he gets lucky and finds a way out. Though he does not know how he could escape."

They had a job for life in the council, a warm office to work in and a reasonable house to return to. They had everything he wanted. All they did was stay inside and force him to spend another wasted day waiting.\n\nThis time he was not going to wait. He would go in and get his money back himself.\n\nRoberts turned the corner of the council and realised his situation was not unique. A mob was slowly forming outside the council. It pounded on the doors, shouted and howled; demanding to be let in and paid what was owed to them in full.\n\nBut the people inside the locked doors did not care, they carried on doing their jobs.

The estimated costs were astronomical, he dreaded to think how they would be covered, if indeed they could be covered at all.\n\nUndoubtedly, they could not. A fellow member of the government had even made clear in the prior debate that the old system was already too expensive. The increases were unaffordable and his party knew it. Yet, he thought, the government would sooner capitulate to the demands of the workers than take a stand and accept reality.\n\nBut, it was his job to make the expansion of the welfare program a reality, irrespective of his own convictions on the matter.\n\nSo he continued to work on implementing the new benefits, occasionally taking nervous glances at the cost, knowing full well that they would make him vastly unpopular with a certain group of people."

He recognised a couple of the return addresses as he sifted through them. The letters had been sent from offices that he had visited many times before; offices owned by some of the most prominent and wealthy businessmen in all of Wales.\n\nThe minister assumed they would not be all too supportive of the government's rise in welfare spending; regardless, curiosity got the better of him and he sat down to open them. Grabbing a blunt letter opener that was close to hand, he began to struggle with the seal, carefully trying not to damage the message inside.\n\nOnce he had freed the contents of the envelope he scanned the page and, to his dismay, confirmed his previous thoughts. The influential industrial giant who had sent it had made his feelings clear. The man was enraged at the rise in welfare, he believed it would cripple his company as more workers would prefer the dole.\n\nSetting the letter down, he continued to work his way down the pile. Each of the letters were filled with outrage at his actions and accusations of betrayal, claims which seemed greatly exaggerated to him, but the fact remained that the wealthy were immensely upset.\n\nTheir message was clear, the industrial giants no longer felt like they could support the government the chancellor was a part of."

With the Goch pushing for greater protections and the Plaid willing to denounce such ideas as out right communism, the government awaits a fiery debate. To introduce the issue of the protection of workers, a member of the Goch stood up and started to challenge the Plaid directly:\n\n"I stand here today to express the grave concerns of the Goch regarding the Plaids inability to sufficiently protect those most vulnerable to the perverse actions often taken by cost cutting industries. To not extend the rights of our workers is to leave them exposed to unlawful reductions in wages and working conditions. Reductions me and my fellow members of the Goch will not allow."\n\nApproving noises came from the Goch members as he returned to his seat. Though it was not long before a member of the Plaid came back with an equally impassioned response:\n\n"I recognise the fears of the Goch, but if we were to enact these so called 'protections' we would all too soon find ourselves sliding down a slippery slope toward communism. On the grounds that this risks outright tyranny, I must call those loyal to the National Front to reject this Bill!"

The long suffering workers of Wales have always had issues with their rotten bosses, cutting them short wherever they could. But no more. The government have finally intervened and suspect their lives to greatly improve.\n\nYet those in the government do not share the joy of the people. The bosses will not be as pleased as the people on the streets; they are not likely to lend much of their support in future.\n\nHowever, for those on the streets, the celebrations are expected to continue long into the night, it might only be a small victory, but, at long last, the workers of Wales are winning."

So they quickly learnt to accept the changes, and carry on with their lives.\n\nThough such somber feelings were not shared with the men who owned the factories they worked in. They revelled in the news, knowing full well that the reforms would make them richer than ever before.

The cabinet would arrive in a drab office where the PM would inevitably be waiting for them, making last minute preparations before they entered into the business of the day.\n\nThis meeting however was to be different. Government ministers were not the only ones who would attend. Some of them were quietly shocked when the Prime Minister told them that he had invited a group of representatives from several of the country's more powerful unions.\n\nShortly after the ministers had been told of the imminent arrival of the unions, the representatives had begun to file in and quickly took their seats opposite the government. After they had all entered, the PM welcomed them and began to outline what the purpose of the talks would be. They were to discuss the actions of the government over the past few months. The Prime Minister made sure to remind all those present of the legislation his government had passed, sometimes going into painful amounts of detail.\n\nUltimately his lengthy address boiled down to one simple question:\n\nWhat did the unions think of the government?"

Keeping them satisfied would leave one less issue for the government to deal with in the coming months.\n\nHowever, the cost of the unions' support has been immense.\n\nThe Prime Minister had forced his economy minister to make great sacrifices in the budget, in order to expand the welfare programs, as well as forcing huge amounts of strain upon the government to push through reforms to workers' rights. The cabinet could only hope that all their efforts would pay off.\n\nAt least, for the time being, the unions were at ease."

If this is all you've brought us here for, I don't see any point in saying."\n\nThe meeting did not continue for very long after that.\n\nIt had not gone the way the Prime Minister had intended, he had at least hoped that they would remain neutral toward him. However, the union representatives had made it abundantly clear to the government that they were not just disappointed, they were angry.\n\nWith relations with the unions in tatters, governing will become a much harder task. Those in the government hope that they will not seek some form of vengeance.\n\nThough most have accepted that this is incredibly unlikely."

wal.30.t:0 "A Mixed Response"
wal.30.desc:0 ""Starting the work may be two thirds of it, though I doubt whether you ever wanted the other third to be complete." Came the brief reply from the union representative.\n\nThis was not the level of support the Prime Minister, and indeed the rest of his cabinet, had been hoping for.\n\nThough the ministers were disappointed, the unions scepticism was not unjustified, the government had never completely committed itself to following the wishes of the unions in the first place. The legislation it had passed simply had not gone far enough. And in some worrying cases, it had even reversed some of the progress from the past.\n\nThe talks continued for a little while longer, with the union members urging the government to do more for the workers in the future. However, the ministers opposed them did not pay much attention. So long as the unions were appeased they would not care what they had to say.\n\nEach side left the talks a little more despondent than they had arrived, with nothing of worth to show for their efforts."

We should start to see the positive effects of this on the rest of the economy soon. We predict that this will cause employment in the coal industry to rise by between seven and nine percent.

Once again the military is requesting more funding in order to protect against "English aggression". There definitely is some merit to their requests, a stronger military would deter any aggressive acts from neighbouring England. However, the budget is rather high as it is and that money could be spent well in other ways, namely reinvesting into the country by improving state services such as better quality schooling.\n\nThen there is the third, almost unspeakable, option, slash the military budget. Europe has been at peace for nearly 20 years and there are many in the country who are of the belief that too much of the government's limited resources are allocated towards a military that serves little purpose."

After the discussion, the meeting spot was chosen in a pub in Cardiff. The FWA asked the representatives from the Plaid to dress in normal clothes and not the clothes they would wear to a government procedure.\n\nOnce they had arrived, an armed FWA member was standing on the inside of the pub. One of the representatives remarked that the whole pub seemed to be owned by the FWA in which one of the FWA members replied to this and said that this pub a few others are used as safe houses by the FWA if they are on the run from the Left Militias that roam Wales. After an hour of negotiations between the two parties, the FWA agreed to stop shooting up Welsh police barracks and stop the firefights with the Left Militias. The FWA agreed on this as long as the government coalition agreed to move forward with the idea of Welsh nationalism and begun to start to get rid of influence from the Anglos. The representatives from the government agreed to this proposition and the two parties left from the pub a few minutes after an agreement was reached.\n\nThe next day, a small group of members from the government met to discuss the development with the FWA. After heated discussion from the more left-leaning members of the government, they decided they would honor their agreement and start to include more nationalist elements in the government. After the left-leaning members left in protest, the conversation switched to the raids on the Left Militias. An argument broke out in the group but this had been quelled and the decision was reached, raids would start on the Left."

They wondered about the more radical members of the Plaid and the Free Wales Army's reaction to this development but they went with it.\n\nAfter contacting the militias that would roam across Wales, a meeting place was decided where the two parties could talk and discuss the current situation of Wales. The place would be the very capital of Wales, Cardiff. Once the two parties arrived in the city, they had begun talks about the situation. The government had sent representatives from all groups of the coalition, but most representatives had been in the social democrats. As the talks had gone on, things had been discussed such as the FWA who had been attacking the left militias on occasion while the government couldn't respond in a timely manner. Then the main topic of the discussion came up. This was a possible agreement for the left militias to support the Plaid Cymru. The militias had been told that they would start to receive some small amounts of support from the government. However, they would need to stop fighting the FWA if this agreement would pass.\n\nThankfully, the representatives from the left militias agreed on these terms and would agree to stop attacks on the FWA. As the members of the Left had left the city, the members of the government who had been sent to the meeting wondered if this was the best choice for Wales and its future."

If he remembered correctly, there hadn't been an attack on any of them yet for the past week by the FWA, so he was happy.\n\nAs he walked into the building where he had been told to meet the union leader there was no one there. Isaac was confused. He dropped his umbrella and opened his briefcase. Inside were many pamphlets about unions and leftism in general. However, below those papers was a pistol for protection against the thugs of the FWA. He thought about getting the pistol out just in case but decided against it. There are no armed FWA members all the way here in Cardiff, he thought. As he briskly walked through the building he found it abandoned. He was disappointed that the union leader had bailed on him so he decided to walk back outside and continue on his walk through Cardiff.\n\nOnce he got outside, a light was shone in his face immediately. He stumbled around the outside before a forceful arm grabbed his arm and pinned it behind his back. It was those pigs he thought..\n\n"I have rights to be doing this currently, you have no reason to arrest me!" He yelled this at the officers who had been arresting him.

The goal was to get info on Julian Cayo-Evans, the ringleader of the group.\n\nAt the very break of dawn, the raid had begun, the doors had been kicked down and Welsh soldiers flooded into the house barking orders in both Welsh and English to the members of the FWA on the inside. There were many shouts from the FWA members who had dropped to the ground in shock and fear. A ripple of fear seemed to go through all of them. Who sold them out to the army? Was there a rat within their ranks? This would need to be answered later as they had been put in handcuffs and lead out to awaiting vans. After the FWA members had been lead to the vans and driven off to the prison, one of the constables and a partner walked through the house.\n\nOnce inside they had found all sorts of materials for bombs and improvised weapons. There was what seemed to be a homemade mortar that could have been used to launch attacks on left militia groups or even the local government. The two officers decided to leave it for the following investigative crew to arrive and then dissect the mortar and the rest of the house. As they had begun to walk up the stairs, something caught the eye of the lead constable. There was a map hidden beneath the stairs.

However within one of these rooms, one of the more heated conversations was taking place. Representatives from both sides of the political frankenstein that was the Plaid Cymru discussed the very actions that they would take. The more right-leaning side was very much for contacting the Free Wales Army to begun negotiations between the government and the FWA. The left however was very much against this as it would lead to a dangerous rise in Welsh Nationalism and possibly strain the fragile coalition even more. The groups worked for a solution for hours before the phone call had been made to Prime Minister Lewis. Solutions had been brought up and then promptly cut after more consideration. Ideas ranged from pitting the two groups against each other to nationalizing one and marking the other as an enemy to the state.\n\nOn both sides of the political spectrum, the MPs wondered if this debate would ever end. Then, one final idea had been proposed. The solution of letting the two groups had been brought up at the start but tossed to the side as it felt "to hands-off".

The people believed they were more exposed to such acts of violence now than they had been for the past two decades.\n\nLittle was known about the perpetrators until a forbidding statement emerged from a group that called itself the Free Wales Army. The group claimed responsibility for the bombing and made clear its disdain for the failure of the government to pass the Welsh Language Bill.\n\nDespite the scale of the attacks, the group itself remains elusive to the government. Wild theories have emerged as to who may be a part of the obscure organization. Each claim is unsubstantiated, but each reveals how trust between the Welsh has deteriorated.\n\nAmongst all the uncertainty, one thing is clear. Life in Wales will never be as it was before."

The largely Unionist parts of the country were practically up in arms over the fact that the government was willing to remove english from the national curriculum.\n\nHowever this was not the concern of the Prime Minister, his job was to get this bill passed, some bitter Unionists were not going to stop him.\n\nBut even the PM was still nervous about what the result might be, as he could not be sure of the true intentions of each of the members of his government. And if the bill failed his whole government would be endangered. Knowing this, he only became more anxious as the vote drew nearer. His anxiousness continued as he reentered the chamber and sat down and began to await the result.\n\nIt did not take long for the result to be declared and much to the Prime Minister's relief, the bill had passed and by the narrowest of margins.

They want the language act removed. The act that nationalists had fought so hard to pass . The government is now at odds with its people and the Prime Minister will not be able to turn a blind eye much longer.\n\nHe will have to address the situation, though he has not yet made up his mind on how he will do this. Removing the act would alleviate the pressure from the protesters, but to the detriment of the unity of the National Front.\n\nThe government will have to make a decision on the act, though they fear that now there is no correct option."

The miners were right, it was true all of it. Years of intensive excavation have depleted the coal fields of Wales. The country is about to run out of coal and when it does an enormous crisis will follow, the extent of which will almost surely bring down our government..\n\nAction must be taken to try to avoid the looming disaster the government now faces, by any means the crisis must be hidden.

He opened it with a hasty suspicion and was awash with relief as he saw what was inside.\n\nMoney, bundles upon bundles of thin paper notes tied loosely with string. A message fell out, it threateningly requested that he stayed silent about the situation of the mine.

The plan that they decided on was an attempt to conceal Saunders' role in the cover up and presenting him as a trusted leader, who was independent from the dirty work that others had carried out.\n\nThe best way to present this had already been decided by the party, an interview between the Prime Minister and interviewer from one of the few media outlets that had remained indifferent to Plaid Cymru. An interview had already been scheduled as soon as possible. All that remains to be done is to inform Saunders himself.\n\nUpon being told of the plan Saunders was quietly startled, he had not been expecting to have to be put back into the public eye so soon, especially after such a crisis had unfurled. After hearing the date of the broadcast he only felt more anxious. For once Saunders appeared to dread having to talk to the people of Wales."

When the government reports investigation returned they sent men disguised in suits to remove whatever evidence they could find. Fortunately a forward thinking member of the government was able to release the truth.\n\nIn fact it has been such an influential theory that it has reached government offices. Pinning the blame on the Goch and trade unionists would cause enough confusion to clear our own name. A government statement was produced indicating Gwynfor Evans and every other influential socialist in the government.\n\nFollowing the release of the statement, the Goch is expected to remove themselves from their position in our government, greatly weakening our authority.

Shocked was replaced by anger as the Welsh demanded to know how Evans was allowed to operate such a scheme. How could a split this bad have emerged in the party in the first place? Did he act alone or does he still have subordinates working in the government?\n\nThey demanded answers.\n\nAnswers the government did not have.\n\nThose who remained in the government hoped it had not all been in vain.

So the government went ahead with the plan to accuse the FWA.\n\nWhat took place after the accusation only made things worse for Plaid Cymru.\n\nThe people were alarmed by how far the FWA got and how they were almost allowed to get away with what they did. The government failed to clear its role in the cover up and was only able to make the FWA appear far more competent than was previously thought.\n\nAfter consistently failing to find a way out of the crisis, few reckon that the government will last much longer.

Now that he has been proven right, he has to sit still whilst all that he helped to build up crumbles around him.\n\nWith the socialists out of the picture, it was unlikely that any of the other members of the National Front Saunders had worked so hard to form were going to stay.

He has become tired of having to repeat the same denials again and again, every time he does so it only seems to make them angrier and more intent on bringing him down.\n\nOne day he supposed he would be the only one left denying what had happened.\n\nUntil that imagined day came he would have to continue wading through the mess he created.

He'd only been involved in the local Peace Club for a few months, but already knew he was committed to their goals. A union with England made the most sense to him, child of a London-born mother who fled during Sealion. Even if he could not officially call himself a Unionist, it was not yet a crime to support their aims. But the upcoming March had left him sleepless and sweating the past few nights, and he wanted to do whatever he could if it meant Cayo and his thugs backed down. Right now, that meant following Jerry's orders, and giving flyers out to anyone who needed them.\n\nAs the stack wore thin, Harry was prepared to report back to the Club, maybe head over to the Lion's Den after. As he saw three young, clean-cut men approach, he prepared to finally empty his hands. He walked towards them, letting loose the same pitch he'd been repeating all day. "You lads interested in--"\n\nBefore he could finish, the three men charged, shoving him down onto the pavement, calling him a traitor, a communist. Harry tried to feebly defend himself as the boots landed upon his head, as the fists laid into his gut, as the men lifted him up just to slam him on the concrete once more. Was this it? Would he already be a martyr for the cause?\n\nAs it turned out, this was not Harry's final day. Multiple passers-by tried to break up the group, who managed to scramble away before anything else could happen. The next day, Harry would be celebrated for his commitment at the Peace Club meeting, alongside four other young members who faced similar attacks. More than ever, he knew that standing up to the nationalists was a matter of life and death."

Despite rhetoric by Unionists and leftists, the march so far went off without interruptions. Cheers drowned out boos as the disciplined mass made its way to the city, who rattled the morning with a cry of "They will not replace us."\n\nAs the narrow streets fill with the protesters, many in full militia fatigues, fears of violence are high. Some are said to be armed, although Cayo maintains that the protest is strictly a peaceful one.

On intersections across Cardiff, barricades have been thrown up by counter-protesters of many stripes, staying true to earlier promises of "protecting the streets". Ostensibly organized by pro-Union "Peace Clubs", the counter-demonstrators are far from just gentle liberals. Various radical unions have come down to join in the struggle, alongside militants waving communist flags and the black-clad members of the recently established Cardiff Anti-Fascist Club. Even erstwhile socialist MP Raymond Williams is said to be among their ranks. The confrontations at these barricades have so far been relegated to aggressive shouting matches, but with passions being sky-high all it will take is one spark to blow up. We can't preside over a bloodbath on our streets.\n\nTypically, our response to confrontations like these is a strong police presence. They are generally expected to show up, and are skilled in non-violent tactics, so using them as peacekeepers seems like it can only deescalate things. However, some of our advisors have pointed out that there are credible reports of some demonstrators carrying projectiles and firearms, and the police may not be enough to keep order. Following this logic, they argue for a military presence to have these demonstrators back down. Clearly demonstrating our firepower seems like it would make anyone think twice about violence.

Bricks and stones are being hurled towards both sides, sending dozens crashing onto asphalt covered in blood. The first gunshots have been heard, likely signalling the first deaths. We are on a precipice right now, a complete explosion being just a projectile away. Commissioner Carwyn of the South Wales Police has rushed to us in desperation, demanding the authority to work with the army and arrest any and all "rioters". Unprecedented in our history, this would certainly not help critiques of Plaid's authoritarianism, but could bring things to a decisive end.

As families tried to rest their children in total darkness, avoiding even the slightest give-away of human life, nearby homes were torn through so that gunmen could set up sniper nests in attics. As pub owners rushed to barricade their business, sheltering civilians if they're brave, long-standing corner stones saw themselves burnt away by Zhdanov cocktails, proxies for the malfeasance of the Welsh state.\n\nRegardless of these nightmarish travails, a broader survey would reveal a bend towards deescalation. Ramping up of violence also meant potentially thousands of protesters fleeing for their lives, with even some of the most aggressive partisans preferring to shelter far from the city center rather than risk dying on Cardiff's streets. But this hardly mattered to those in the presence of such conflict.

And as one of them, busy with helping a woman up, was struck with a bullet in his chest, did the Firefighters realize they were fighting a losing fight.\n\nWith a heart weightened by guilt and desperation, they returned to the trucks and moved away from the inferno, the pleas of anger and desperation fading in the background, but echoing in their heads, the glazed stare of their fallen one haunting them now, and possibly for years to come.\n\nThey've done their best, haven't they?

Getting the people of Wales onboard should be easy, a mass propaganda campaign would do the trick. Getting the Coal Industry Unions to support the government however, is nowhere near as simple. Afterall, the men these unions represent depend on the coal industry for their livelihoods. A man who has mined his whole life cannot easily find another occupation. The IRC must tread lightly around the unions. This meeting with the biggest players and most influential unions is the first move.\n\n"Well that wasn't so bad," Davies remarks as he leaves the meeting with the Union leaders, his fellow committee members filing out after him. "I think we've convinced a few of them."\n\n"Convinced? They were walking out halfway through!"\n\n"Yes but those were radicals, extremists. They would never have agreed to anything we had to say anyway. It's better that they left now so we know who we can actually work with. I'm certain that the rest will support our plan, either immediately or with some concessions and a little persuasion.""
goch.21.a:0 ""I sure hope you're right.""
goch.22.t:0 "Banning harsh quotas"
goch.22.desc:0 "Life in Wales is by no means easy, not for the miners. Not for those men who spend hours in the darkest depths of the earth, performing back breaking labour to fulfill the quotas and orders of the mine's overseers only to line the pockets of the owners and investors. The quotas ordered are, more often than not, unreasonable and exploitive of the miners.\n\nBut no longer. For from this day the government, at the behest of the IRC, has banned any and all harsh quotas. No longer can the mine owners exploit their workers by giving them outrageous, unreachable goals.\n\nThe miners are celebrating in the streets, in the pubs in their homes. For today their burdens have lessened ever so slightly. The quotas may still be extreme, but less so. Their mine owners may be furious at this drop in productivity, but that isn't their problem. They may still live difficult lives, they may still struggle to provide for their families, to put food on their tables, but for this brief moment they are joyous, grateful to the government for looking out for them. No matter what the future brings, today is a good day."
goch.22.a:0 "Today, life is good."
goch.23.t:0 "Not the result we hoped for"
goch.23.desc:0 "A poster on every street. A speech on every radio. A newsreel on every theatre show. The tried and tested methods of propaganda, both consciously and unconsciously swaying public opinion towards a certain direction. In this case, that direction is simple. The government needs popular support amongst the people. On paper, these methods would gather that support by bombarding the populace with pro-government messages so that wherever they go there will always be some form of propaganda.\n\nIn practice however, is a completely different question.\n\nEmrys Thomas sighs heavily, looking over the reports delivered to gos desk. It would seem the Welsh psyche is much more resistant than his advisors first thought. Rather than convincing the people to lend their support to the government, it appears that this massive propaganda effort has expended itself to no avail."
goch.23.a:0 "Perhaps a different approach."
goch.24.t:0 "Ready for the Election"
goch.24.desc:0 ""Well gentlemen, the moment is almost upon us."\n\nIt has been a rough couple months, the party has faced hardships, toil and trouble. If ever the party would have been shattered and fallen it would've been then. But the Cymru Goch party has pulled through, passing reform after reform in the hopes and dreams of a better Wales. They have rode through the coal crisis, and improved the lives of Welsh workers to levels previously unheard of. It is now time for the elections, where the party will find out whether or not their actions have been appreciated by the Welsh people."

goch.25.t:0 "Open for business"
goch.25.desc:0 "It's been many months. The IRC, and the Welsh government as a whole, has been working tirelessly day and night. Working towards this moment. Finally, the economy is ready. Reforms and regulations, laws and legislation all to open up the economy, and through that, the country. Now, Emrys Thomas must address the nation.\n\n"To the people of Wales, I must thank you for all your support through this process. It has not been easy. But now, we stand amidst a great achievement. Wales is now ready to be a part of the world economy, to be open to all the world for greater prosperity for all both at home and abroad! Once again, to the people of Wales, this could not have been done without you. And to the people of the world, be you immigrants seeking jobs here or corporations seeking investment options, I say to you on behalf of this nation and its people:"

goch.26.t:0 "Wales Wants to Buy Weapons"
goch.26.desc:0 "Well this is a new one. It would seem that the Welsh government feels insecure militarily about its position. A completely fair feeling in this world, especially given Wales' dangerously close proximity to Germany and all the safety concerns that come with that. They have approached us with an interesting request: weapons. Arms and ammunition are arguably the most important and valuable goods in the current world situation. Wales wants them, we have them and Wales is willing to pay for them. Wales has proven to be no close friend of the Germans and supporting a European democracy may help to further our influence in Europe. However, it must be taken into consideration that these weapons could be used in direct opposition to our goals. Not to mention that any meddling in European affairs like this runs the risk of bringing German attention to it, and we can't be having that."
goch.26.a:0 "Sell them the weapons, they need them more than us."

goch.2600.t:0 "The Americans accept"
goch.2600.desc:0 "Well, the Americans have responded to our purchasing request. It's turned out a lot better than we expected, maybe as good as we hoped. The Americans have agreed to the deal we proposed to them, and the weapons we have purchased are well on the way to our armories. We should hope that they never are needed, but hope alone is no defense. Especially not in this uncaring world order. Much better to have hope and a large arsenal."
goch.2600.a:0 "Speak softly, and carry a big stick."
goch.2601.t:0 "The Americans refuse"
goch.2601.desc:0 "Well, the Americans have responded to our purchasing request. The response is... disappointing to say the least. They have refused us any sort of deal regarding these weapons. If we are to defend ourselves we will need to search elsewhere for the means to do so. With the chaos engulfing this harsh world, weapons may become even more of a necessity. We will need to look for other opportunities to acquire the means to protect our nation and now, it becomes even more important that we practice intelligent diplomacy to ward off any attacks."
goch.2601.a:0 "Without a big stick, we will need to walk softly."
goch.27.t:0 "Friends on the British Isles"
goch.27.desc:0 "Near the center of Dublin stands a building. A building that seems like any other government building: large and modern. A passerby may not remark on or even notice any sort of difference between this building and the many building surrounding it were it not for a few rather major differences: heightened security with guards bearing the obvious look and bearing of wary foreigners in a strange land, barred windows and reinforced doors and, most prominent and obvious of all the signs, a flag: the Welsh dragon flying high and proud above the building.\n\nThis building is none other than the Welsh embassy in Dublin, part of the Welsh government's program of outreach in the Isles in an attempt to foster cooperation towards the peripheral countries of the British Isles."
goch.27.a:0 "To Celtic solidarity."
goch.28.t:0 "A matter of military importance"
goch.28.desc:0 ""....and as you well know, the Welsh military is inadequate to defend properly against any threats that we face, especially the English menace. As such, it would be within the best interests of the Welsh nation to fund and arm two more divisions for the army in order to ensure security and sovereignty in light of the recent events in England."\n\nEmrys Thomas has had quite enough of the military's convoluted requests for increased funding, increased weapons, increased manpower. But maybe this time his generals have a point. Europe is a chaotic and dangerous place and these are uncertain times. Any sort of extra defence would be very welcome. However, such defences are by no means free and the money and other resources required could most definitely find good use elsewhere."

walunion.1.t:0 "John Morris Assumes Office"
walunion.1.desc:0 ""It is with great gratitude for the voters of Wales that I take the position of Prime Minister today." began John Morris, in the midst of an excitable fervor.\n\n"Like my honorable friend Emrys Thomas, I endeavour at all times to do whatever i can to benefit all the people within Wales. As some of the more astute among you may have noticed, me and Mr Thomas do indeed differ considerably in our prefered methods of bringing about such improvements. But there is not a shadow of a doubt in my mind when I say that I do believe Thomas will provide an excellent opposition on the benches across from my own" he announced as he gestured to the leader of the Goch opposite him.\n\n"I start my term as I mean to continue, spreading unity and leading Wales back towards a partnership with England, in any form that it may take. We can not go it alone, we will have to cooperate." The dramatic culmination of his speech received raucous cheers from his parties members behind him. Morris chuckled to himself, pleased with his first impression as Prime Minister.\n\nAfterwards, Morris returned to his residence, where he began to prepare for the challenges he faced as Prime Minister. He knew they would be numerous, but he was prepared."
walunion.1.a:0 "Hurrah for Prime Minister Morris!"
 
walunion.2.t:0 "A Painful Withdrawal"
walunion.2.desc:0 "It is surprising that the coal crisis was not noticed sooner than it was. Even with the attempted cover up, the effects could have been seen a long time before any official statement was leaked.\n\nMine owners had been scrambling for weeks to find a way to balance their books, miners had grown increasingly bored from days sat in the dark, scratching at the stone that had long ago been exhausted of any value. But the government does not have the time to dwell on past misconceptions, the crisis is far too great to do such a thing.\n\nCoal has been the cornerstone of the Welsh economy and now that it has been eroded away, the rest of the structure is likely to crumble along with it. If it does it will take much more effort to clear the rubble and rebuild the foundations than if a new support can be put in its place.\n\nHowever one looks at it, one thing is clear. If the workers of Wales are forced on to the dole much longer the government will face a similar fate to its already infamous predecessor."
walunion.2.a:0 "Best get moving quickly"
 
walunion.3.t:0 "The Fate of the Mines"
walunion.3.desc:0 "Coal has been such a central part of life in Wales that few can even begin to imagine what a time without it would be like. Uncertainty has started to emerge as many of the people who have grown up around coal mining, and the culture that has grown with it, begin to fear what will come next. Will they lose their centuries old communities, how will the miners who may be layed of provide for their families; what future will there be for their children?\n\nThe Conservatives believe that propping up the mines will only amount to a drain on public finances. It would be better to allow Wales to decide the fate of the coal mines free from the unnecessary intervention of the government.\n\nLabourists within the government are strictly opposed to such measures. They would much rather that the government step in to support what remains of the old mining communities by bailing them out. Else where will the mining societies go next, what future will there be for their people.\n\nMorris and his closest ministers are yet to finalize their decision and all of them know of its critical importance to the future of Wales."
walunion.3.a:0 ""Bail them out.""

walunion.4.t:0 "Protesters Back on the Streets"
walunion.4.desc:0 "The streets of Cardiff were once again awash with protestors. Similar chants could be heard denouncing the actions of the government, denouncing its actions as tyrannical. Many of the shouts came from the mouths of students who had begun to benefit so much from enriching themselves in their history. The institutes that they had studied had been forced to shut due to a sudden stop to its government funding.\n\nThis was a step too far for the generation of students who had grown up in the time of the Welsh cultural revitalization. They had been riled up and they began to march towards the Assembly itself, the place where the government they opposed so profoundly had passed the budget cuts.\n\nHowls from the streets could be heard from within the chamber. If it was not for the heavily guarded perimeter, the government may have feared a break in. The guards did not deter the protestors however, who persisted in their vocal protest.\n\nYet from within the Assembly the Unionist members did not seem to care much at all."
walunion.4.a:0 "What did they expect?"
 
walunion.5.t:0 "A New Language Bill"
walunion.5.desc:0 "After the disaster that was the old language bill, the Unionists have tried to make an effort towards bringing English back as the official language of Wales. That is exactly what they planned to do as they entered the Assembly that morning. The new bill had already been drafted and was ready to be introduced into the Assembly as soon as they entered it.\n\nEdwards, instead of Morris this time, stood up before the members of the crowded Assembly to introduce the bill himself. Most of its contents seemed reasonable and the majority of the introductory speech passed without interruption, with the exception of a couple wayward nationalist outbursts. But that was changed when Edwards closing sentence entered the chamber:\n\n"English will always be the language of Wales."\n\nRoars of indignation came from the opposition who had fought so hard to bring Welsh out of obscurity. Yet the bill remained popular and after a short debate it was passed.\n\nAs was to be expected, the worst of the fanatical nationalists found the result to be unacceptable and were enraged at the fact that they had lost. But there is much that the government can do about their inability to accept the will of the Welsh people."
walunion.5.a:0 "It's all Welsh to them."
 
walunion.6.t:0 "Rallying the Unionists"
walunion.6.desc:0 "Not since the days of his electoral campaign had Morris seen such a crowd awaiting his arrival, if anything it was twice as large a crowd as he was used to. Yet this did not deter him, and served only to invigorate him further, such a show of support would only propel the Unionist cause further forward. It was the cause that he had championed these past few weeks and the cause he intends to see through till it's inevitable end.\n\nWhat began as a fairly minor emphasis of his Unionist principles suddenly became unacceptable to Nationalists after he made stated his belief that:\n\n"The Acts of Union were the single greatest part of Welsh history!"\n\nA great response followed from the supportive crowd he had already riled up, but, intentional or not, there was a very serious response. The nationalist parties of Wales were fuming, to no one's surprise.\n\nBut their anger remained as they asked each other: how could Morris undermine the Welsh nation that they had spent years reviving?"
walunion.6.a:0 "Wales is as divided as ever."

walunion.7.t:0 "Gradual Acceptance"
walunion.7.desc:0 "Since the fallout of Morris' controversial speech at his Unionist rally, Wales has had plenty of time to adjust to the official change in language. Unrest remains below the surface as the nationalists begin to accept it. But above the low grumbles of the nationalists, English can be heard being spoken throughout the country.\n\nIn fact, Welsh was only ever spoken by a minority of isolated locals and a set of far removed intellectuals. Neither of these groups truly reflect the large portion of the population that has preferred the use of the English language all along. Amongst these groups English has quickly replaced the little Welsh they spoke, if they spoke any of it at all.\n\nAnd with the language several other parts of English culture has arrived into Welsh life, strangely no longer practiced in Wales' repressive and chaotic neighbour. Nevertheless, the old ways endure in Wales, awaiting for when England will finally come back to its senses."
walunion.7.a:0 " A very English revival."

walunion.7000.t:0 "Getting Used"
walunion.7000.desc:0 ""How about you try this one instead of the one you always buy? Just a thought."\n\nOwen was dumbfounded at the proposition of the old seller. His family bought religiously the same newspaper every week, but the seller was recommending him to buy a different one. This one was in English, as the majority of magazines displayed on the newsstand was. "Your dad was in the British Army, and you are probably learning English in school. You shouldn't have any trouble reading it."\n\n"But Mr. Roberts, why we can't buy the usual newspaper?" the teenager asked, confused. Mr. Roberts put the newspaper down, sighing with a mix of sorrow and resignation. By his depressed and almost paternal tone, Owen could feel that he was very conflicted about something.\n\n"Look, son. I'm gonna be honest. People are starting to use English more and not just because the government is telling them to. It seems everyone is getting used to the idea that our nation may not exist soon."\n\nThe young teenager thought that Mr. Roberts had a point. His friends were starting to drop the Welsh for the English, especially because their parents were recommending them to do it. Almost every business in the town was accomodating to the new (technically old) language, with signs in English appearing more often than its Welsh counterpart. Owen put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of coins. Maybe his family shouldn't be left behind.\n\n"Fine. I'll buy this one.""
walunion.7000.a:0 "Times change."

walunion.23.t:0 "Welsh Terror"
walunion.23.desc:0 "Chaos returns to the streets of Cardiff.\n\nThe blast shook the walls of every shop, factory and home. Its dreadful noise veberbarated throughout Wales. It would continue to echo as scenes like this became frighteningly more commonplace.\n\nImmediately after the attack occurred it was clear who was targeted, several Unionist Welsh men who were headed towards the Assembly. Most were doomed to never complete their journey. The bomb wiped the majority of them out instantly. Those poor enough to survive it initially were left limbless, bleeding, battered and bruised.\n\nModerate Unionists and nationalists alike have been incensed by the barbaric attack. However that has not stopped some calling for retaliation and escalation.\n\nThe perpetrator is unlikely to ever be caught. Worse than that is the fact that they have succeeded."

walunion.24.t:0 "Raid Successful"
walunion.24.desc:0 "Reports have returned from the army concerning the raid against a FWA stronghold. It appears that the operation was a success and all those found inside have been neutralized.\n\nThe report goes into further detail, recording the minimal casualties that were taken during the short firefight before our soldiers stormed the compound. Several pieces of radio equipment were captured along with some weapons that had been stored there. Vital intelligence was also found, which named some members of the FWA, along with information on their potential whereabouts.\n\nLosing these resources will cripple the capabilities of the FWA for the time being. Though it is expected that there are plenty more of these strongholds left across Wales.\n\nOur struggle against the FWA is not yet over."

The situation then deteriorated further and additional support had to be called to help them with the assault. Once reinforcements had arrived, it was already too late, those inside had left without trace, destroying any evidence of their presence there.\n\nThe failure to capture the stronghold has reinforced the moral of the FWA and left our own men unnerved. We will have to hope that we can rally the military and bring the fight back to the nationalists rebels.\n\nWe may have lost to the FWA this time, but the Unionist government has not finished its fight just yet."
walunion.25.a:0 "Better luck next time."

walunion.26.t:0 "Silence Falls"
walunion.26.desc:0 "Following a tip off from an informant buried deep within the FWA, the last of the terrorist compounds were successfully stormed. Those inside were barely given a chance to fight back before bullets ripped through the air. Bodies fell and screams of dread left their lungs.\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, the leader of the whole bloody campaign was wrestled to the floor, squirming and wriggling as he cried out. Chaos continued around him as the last of his allies fell around him. His cries were left unanswered before he silenced himself.\n\nHe realised his fight was over. He had lost.\n\nThe rest of the despised terrorists have been captured or killed. Their actions have only stiffened the resolve of the Unionists, any thoughts of an independent Wales are as good as dead and buried. Unification is assured, Cayo, his murderous clique and the Wales they fought for have all truly been defeated."
walunion.26.a:0 "The FWA is defeated"

walunion.27.t:0 "Planning a Purge"
walunion.27.desc:0 "In the centre of the poorly lit room, the Minister of Defence Bruce draughts his plans to the rest of the cabinet. What he envisioned was a fundamentally different military, reborn from the ashes of what was left over from the nationalists. An army that was cleansed of any nationalist influence, one that would be unwavering to the Unionist government.\n\nHe produced a document full of the names of many officers who he believed to hold sympathies for even the most moderate nationalist cause. What he wanted was to have every single one of them removed.\n\nThis would, without doubt, leave the army in a state of ruin. Repairing the damage would take almost a year, argued Bruce, as if that fact would redeem his proposal in any way.\n\nSeveral cabinet members were appalled that such action should even be suggested. They also questioned whether the army could truly recover from the loss of so many officers. But in the end they had allowed themselves to be convinced that it was the only way to deal with the nationalist threat that loomed over them."
walunion.27.a:0 "Too late to stop now."

walunion.28.t:0 "Disappearances in the Armed Forces"
walunion.28.desc:0 "Before the unit had even been called out to the morning role, their ranks had been noticeably thinned. Only the day before, a group of them had been separated from the barracks; to be driven off to some undisclosed location from where they had not yet returned. A minor panic gripped some of the soldiers as they realised that their comrades were now missing, they were the ones who feared the worst.\n\nWas it an accident? Were they coming back? Who would replace them if they were not?\n\nPerhaps it could be something more sinister. Maybe they had been die-hard nationalist all along and had fled to join the FWA. Or could it have been the government that they served, getting rid of them before they could desert the barracks. If this was the case, how could they be sure of the true beliefs of those who they targeted.\n\nCould they be next?\n\nThese incesent doubts hung over every unit as yet more men disappeared from their ranks. They began to wonder if they could ever fight effectively again if it came to it. Too many good men had gone."
walunion.28.a:0 "At least the government felt safe"

walunion.2800.t:0 "The Wounds Heal"
walunion.2800.desc:0 "Almost a year has passed since the first soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army. Not much has been said since about the matter, any passing comment has been met with silence. A grim reminder of the impact from the heavy handed action the government took.\n\nBy now it was now generally believed that the government were the perpetrators of the disappearances. But by now that had been accepted, not resented. It was the action the government had decided to take. And it had succeeded in permanently preventing nationalist influence spreading throughout the army.\n\nIndeed there was not even a hint of Welsh spoken in the ranks of the army any more. Nationalism had all but disappeared from their lives. Those who had survived the clean up made sure that they avoided the subject entirely, in order to not be relieved of their positions.\n\nBut the gaps had been filled, the army had been replenished and after such a long time the military had recovered. But the damage to the soldiers had already been done, not that they spoke out against it."
walunion.2800.a:0 "There's not to reason why"

walunion.29.t:0 "An End to the Purge"
walunion.29.desc:0 "Over the course of the past few days a great deal of uncertainty and panic had gripped those lower down the ranks of the military. The events that had followed the decision to purge the military have scarred it deeply. Those who remain are nervous to speak out against what happened. All nationalist sentiment has been wiped away completely.\n\nIn a way the whole purge has been a success. It has achieved all of the aims that the government set out to. There is no nationalism to be found and loyalty has been obtained.\n\nThis is a hollow victory.\n\nNo joy can be taken from causing the army to be as badly weakened as it has become. If it is called upon to protect Wales now there would not be any hope, it has become far too weak.\n\nThe soldiers are aware of this and they now look to the future not with hope but with fear."
walunion.29.a:0 "At least the government feels secure"

walunion.30.t:0 "The Army's Demands"
walunion.30.desc:0 "John Morris appraised the small group of men opposite his desk. Several days of negotiations had already passed, and he'd received scant updates, outside of the fact the army was still talking. Now he was expecting answers. "What do they want?"\n\nThe frontmost one cleared his throat, and stepped forward. "The good news is that the army is willing to negotiate, and more importantly, compromise. I believe that we have a path forward, the problem is..."\n\n"Yes, yes, I know they're willing to negotiate," Morris motioned with his hand for them to speed it up. "What I want to know, again, is what they want."\n\n"There are two main demands," the man continued with a cough. "For Welsh speaking to be allowed in the ranks, and for their pay to be increased. I'm aware of the ramifications for both, and while I don't believe we could - or should - give them all they want, I believe that we could concede one of these demands, and the army would agree."\n\nMorris leaned back, considering the news. No ideal options, no matter which way he looked at it. There was something, but it was going to cost something. "There isn't a chance we can hold out?"\n\nStrong shakes of the head from around the room. "I'm afraid not, Prime Minister," the man said. "At least, that's not something we should risk. It's one thing to not give the army what they want, but walking away completely? That is...inadvisable."\n\nWhich was polite talk for 'stupid'. Still, Morris didn't like being held hostage by the army like this, but there needed to be a decision made, and he was going to have to be the one to make it. After taking a few seconds to consider it, he gave his answer."

But those classes did not have to cope with the confusion that had been caused a few months ago when the history curricula shifted suddenly.\n\nMonths scrambling to get to grips with the new English oriented test have however paid off. Despite the confusion, they have learnt in months what future students will have years to study and they have prevailed.\n\nThey are expected to be the first generation of many students to pass from this new English oriented system. As the Wales they have graduated in is not the same one they began their studies in."

A feat that was nearly impossible, this book was the only one at his disposal. Putting in an order for a replacement would inevitably result in silence, no new books had been made since the new government had come into power.\n\nSoon, he thought, he would have to deliver the whole of the course from memory. If he was still allowed to teach it at all.\n\nWelsh history was no longer as popular as it has been. The size of his class has noticeably shrunk, the classroom itself was barely half fall. He hoped that won day students would flock back to his classrooms to hear what he had learnt.\n\nBut with Unionism on the rise there would be no place in Wales for what the subject he had loved to teach."

The course described within the book was no longer on offer in any of the schools in Wales, all of the old Welsh history had been replaced.\n\nBut nothing could completely remove the past. The students still remained interested in their history and no government intervention could change that. Even if all that remained of the old books were old and battered by time.\n\nAn unblemished and freshly printed book was left unread beside them.\n\nIn spite of the government's efforts to alter their history, the students remained as intrigued about Welsh history as the students who had studied the book before them. The history of the Welsh endured in utter defiance of what the government believed should be taught."

It patrolled the seas of the world protecting Britain and her empire across the globe. At least it was before it ended up submerged below the channel.\n\nUnionists within the government look back upon the times when the English fleet could defend against any threat. They believe that the government should build new war ships to replace the navy that was lost all those years ago.\n\nNevertheless building a new navy from scratch will be extremely expensive. Going ahead with these plans would be risky especially as public support for them is expected to be low. They would much rather that the money be spent elsewhere.\n\nBut the unionist party still wants the ships to be built, nevermind what the people think."

It was a moment of calm in the constant eddies of government, something to be valued.\n\nThe man who was supposed to riddle the car with bullets found himself unable to do so as his ancient semi-automatic rifle failed to fire, which allowed the driver just enough time to put his foot on the pedal and dodge the first volley of gunfire. But the second series of shots took out the wheels, flipping the car over as the driver attempted to compensate in a cacophony of metal striking road.\n\nJulian Cayo-Evans emerged from the wreckage with his pistol raised, but with his eyes blocked by blood and smoke he didn't manage to hit anything. This allowed the assassins, all twenty three of them, to open up on the exposed dictator in one deafening volley. The force of the bullets was such that for a brief moment Cayo-Evans was pinned to his car despite have no chance of survival after the first hit his windpipe, this caused several of the more insecure assassins to assume he remained alive and the gunfire would not alight for almost three minutes.\n\nForensic analysis would determine that over fifteen hundred shots had been fired, of which only seventy three hit Cayo-Evans."

He did not fight for the freedom of his country, he fought for the freedom of its workers. The rise of the SLP in England had made him quite the Unionist, he anticipated a socialist reckoning to arrive with it.

This was far from the joyous reuniting of friends that had been promised; this was the death of a once hopeful and independent Welsh Republic.\n\nSeveral members of the Welsh Assembly did not listen to, nor care for, what the king had to say. All they could do was stand silently and stifle their sadness and tears as the Republic they had always supported was torn down before them.\n\nMorris stood toward the back, no longer feeling the need to stand center stage.

Even if half the men doing so were interim operators from the FWA, it was still a marvellous feeling. He had won.\n\nNow, he walked into the station's studio, accompanied by the new head of the formerly toothless and liberal institution. Sitting in the tall, comfortable leather seat, he took one breath and started to work through his words. The first time was not confident enough, the second time sounded almost sympathetic to the Unionists, the third was too quick and messy.

True, I am a cunning commander, a friend to my allies and ruthless in dealing with foes, but there is much more to me, and my brothers-in-arms, than just that. Through my leadership, the FWA has proven to be made of effective administrators, compassionate family men, and hard workers. These are the virtues that we aim to bring in every aspect of our government and society. But that, my countrymen, is just the beginning!"\n\n"Under my leadership, the genocidal practices leftover from English domination shall be destroyed. No longer must we feel ashamed of our culture, of our language! In every schoolhouse, in every business, in every theater and bookshop, the heroic history of our nation and people will be celebrated. A true independence can begin from this, one where all Welshmen are truly free from all the forces that dog him. The snide gaze of the Anglo, the callous abandonment of the villages, the feminization of our military, these are all shameful facets of our young nation that we shall absolutely combat. We are in a land surrounded by wolves, and if we do not act as if we are already engaged in a vicious battle of survival, then we shall perish as a free nation. Today is just the beginning of the great Welsh century. Our tasks are many, our foes are mighty, but as a people we shall tear them all down on the road to sovereignty!"

Dylan's voice was unmistakable, the way too gruff tone that cuts through you like a razor blade.\n\n"Yeah, they just never wanna be your friends, no matter how nice you are." Adam, the classic imitator. Andrew couldn't recall one time where his insults weren't just copied off of Dylan.\n\n"Heh, heh. Maybe he was gonna blow something up, yeah Anglo?" Maxwell always squealed like a pig. "I say we dump him in the sea."\n\n"Ooh, I like that. He can swim all the way back to England," said Dylan. "Then we don't need to see your shit-butt haircut anymore."\n\n"Yeah. It is a shit-butt haircut," remarked Adam.\n\n"Well, Anglo, it is early. We're gonna leave for now, but just thought you should be reminded who's boss. Keep looking at the sea, pretend we're not here. And don't you dare tell, or what just happened is gonna look like we were playing nice," Dylan rasped. With that, the Welsh Warriors let Andrew go, and ran back off to torment some other poor soul. Andrew tried swallowing his tears to no avail, and once again looked to the sea."

Captain Powell is leading us through basic drills, but he's not like the major. We've all turned to him like he's the damn teacher: what's Cayo gonna do, what do you think happened to the Colonel and Major, where do you think they are? He doesn't know, of course, but we really can't complain. They were both real assholes, and everyone loves Powell.\n\n16 August: Finally. Today, we were introduced to our new black-clad commanders. Replacing the old guard are Colonel Saer and Major Gruffud, neither of which looked to have broken 30. Hell, the Major looks like he could be Powell's younger brother. Thankfully, they immediately operated like real leaders. We got split up into various small groups, 'cells', I think they called them. Said they were modelling unit structure on how the FWA did it. While we were dividing up into these newly assigned groups, we all wondered if Jones and Rice would mouth off, them typically being quite open to boisterous talks of politics. Nothing happened thankfully, though I don't recall seeing them as we split off.\n\n1 September: This one will be short. New drills are exhausting. Ten miles we ran today, full gear in a rainstorm, which isn't too much worse than what we once did. But then our daily guerilla training started. For the English devils they said, the ones who will inevitably try to destroy us. We had to shed some gear as we began to fan out into the (abandoned) neighboring village, and were instructed to spend the next hour moving from house to house, collecting some kind of token from each to show we did it. Gruelling shit. FWA boys are crazy.\n\n16 September: Tonight, one month into the new leadership, we receive our first 'political education course'. Nobody really knows what to expect, at least not the average guys like me. A few new recruits from the FWA are saying it's just a more interesting version of history, mixed with some important lessons for the self. Me and my cell would drink heavy under normal circumstances before something like this, but unfortunately Saer and Gruffud are much stricter on the flow of booze. It doesn't help that something like thirty of our guys got discharged, a few that I liked a lot. Oh well. I'm here for the country, not for myself."

Early inquiries show officer-led political education to be effective among servicemen. Majority of appointees approved of by subordinates based on same inquiry, along with empirical evidence pointing to greater consistency and decisiveness regarding disciplinary actions.\n\nDozens of barracks already host to successful purging of ranks, current figures estimate over 200 Unionist and communist operatives have been identified by such actions. Necessary to universally implement (REDACTED) protocols.\n\nExperience of new officers in FWA leads to greater flexibility of tactics, cursory observation shows many unique tactics such as (REDACTED). Imperative to build and spread most effective tactics to ensure effective combat against numerically superior foes.\n\nIn final analysis, officers drawn from FWA bring new initiative, discipline, and ideological coherence to armed forces. Further inquiries into troop loyalty necessary, standardized methods for discipline and tactics to be implemented as soon as possible.

National subsidies proven to be hugely successful in ignored Northern regions, greatest increase in industrial production and starting of new businesses in region's history. Business owners report period to be greatest time for business in nation's history, citing our commitment to fighting communist unions. Work stoppages at all time low. Tax rate reductions for all Welsh citizens also proving to be a boon. Unemployment and poverty among Welsh down to near-zero.\n\nSocial: Crime rate plummets to all time low, owing to better equipment for police, more vigorous campaigns against terrorist groups. Use of (REDACTED) tactics against radicalized villages has wholly removed problems of 'radical bases'. Pride in Welsh culture and language at nearly 100 percent. Academia has been wholly cleansed of any anti-patriotic propaganda. All children now set to be fluent in Welsh. Furthermore, all media and literature on track to be Welsh-only within one decade. Creation of Anglo zones already removing destitution, radicalism from Welsh population centers.\n\nFurther steps necessary to implement: Drafts of laws regarding miscegenation, cohabitation, etc. American model is exemplary, and early talks with Mr. (REDACTED) on guidance in separating cultures proving to be fruitful. Closer integration of military and police, for purposes of civic respect and efficiency. Further investigations into unionist and communist sentiments among so-called Welshman also necessary, garb of culture can not be allowed to mask hateful ideas.

cayo.10.desc:0 "The document is not an overly long invitation, oh it's just a few pages, but considering the scope of what it proposes Julian Cayo-Evans is surprised that he managed to condense it as much as he has. He'd always dreamed of a free brotherhood of Celtic nations, he'd seen them be freed from England by the German invasion yet to Cayo's own consternation no one had proposed the obvious next step.\n\nWell, if the other free Celtic nations of the world would not do it then it fell to the oldest sibling to give them a push. The Celtic Liberation Army was the first step of his plan, and Cayo-Evans felt that it was also the most important. Before the Celtic nations could begin working against England in a united front they would have an army capable of defeating them. A unified army under one command, and with one vision. Only then could the matter of England be settled properly.\n\nYet as he sat at his desk the Y Mab Darogan couldn't help but check over the text once more, he thought it eloquent enough but there was no shame in having it looked over once again to make sure. Calling his secretary, Julian Cayo-Evans took the first step into a new world."

Delivered live to an audience of only a few hundred but broadcast by radio and television to all of Wales Julian Cayo-Evans actually managed to make the economy seem interesting for a little while.\n\nDenouncing the efforts of traitorous Unionists and their inability to fix the woes of the nation, Cayo-Evans promised a new and expanded economy that relied upon more than mere coal. He promised factories in the cities and an expanded agricultural base, he promised jobs and pay for every Welshmen who could work and pensions for those who could not. Even when it came to the often discussed subject of reform the Y Mab Darogan made clear his intentions to never harm the rights of the Welsh people, and that he would turn the cesspit of political intrigue into something that served everyone and not the privileged and English few.\n\nCapped off with a denunciation of England, the speech was the most popular one by Cayo-Evans yet. Though some doubt his sincerity on the subject of political reform, none could deny that from a distance it didn't seem to be a half bad plan. Well, none denied it openly anyway. In the new Wales people know better."

cayo.12.desc:0 "The Free Wales Army had always been a diverse organisation politically, that had been part of the attraction after all with the goal of Welsh freedom taking precedence over economic or organisational concerns. Yet as the Free Wales Army became a party of government there had been increasing clashes between the assorted wings, between social democrats, conservatives and fascists who might all have believed in a free Wales, but disagreed what those two words meant.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan as always listened, waited, and then acted swiftly and without hesitation. Several trade union leaders affiliated with the FWA were summoned to Cardiff, along with them a host of the more protectionist or socialist leaning FWA members from across the nation and as they sat in Julian Cayo-Evans office it became apparent who was not there. The Church, the businessman and the ardent fascists were mysteriously absent from the meeting.\n\nWhen the men left the office not a few hours later a plan had been drawn out, negotiated and finalised. Pensions for the Welsh, national ownership of several industries, and the state working with rather than against the Trade Unions. Cayo-Evans had chosen a side, and the rest of the party would have to fall in line."

Julian Cayo-Evans does what is right because it will bring glory to Wales, at least according to the upper members of the Free Wales Army at any rate.\n\nTo the citizen on the street, to the farmer in the fields and the miner in his cave, what care they of glory? The average man wants naught but food and a roof over his head but the Y Mab Darogan strives for something more for his nation. It is not enough that Wales be a respected nation when it can be a great nation if it but pushes a little harder.\n\nTo this end Cayo-Evans has called forth those who share his vision, the businessmen and the police chiefs. The churchmen and the mayors and the political friends of old who aided the Free Wales Army when it was a mere fragment of the organisation that it has become.\n\nThey are given an offer, wealth and power will be theirs if they would merely consider supporting the government where necessary. The businessmen will get their contracts and the politicians will find their reelection campaigns mysteriously unopposed. To a one they accept, and a new alliance is born without the nation's knowledge."

Where before they had merely deigned to watch from a distance to see if the Free Wales Army was more bark than bite now the nations of the world have decided that the regime of the Y Mab Darogan is here to stay, and like any polity worth its salt they have come to ensure the new regimes friendliness towards their own causes.\n\nThe American is a rather understated fellow with glasses who makes mention of the potential benefits the Organization of Free Nations would offer Wales. The German is an aristocratic man of Junker stock who gives the Hitler salute to the Y Mab Darogan when he enters the room as befits a friend of the Reich. The Irishwoman merely gives some words of encouragement for Cayo-Evans bold rejection of English imperialism.\n\nFrom all the nations of the world they come and each and every one seeks a deal or an accommodation with the new state of affairs. What it notable however, is the absence of the English themselves, but few find it difficult to imagine why that is the case."

He got the feeling that were the Germans to land at Dover tomorrow Mr. Evans would be quite happy to assist them.\n\nThis would need to be reported back to London, and fast.

She'd never lived anywhere else and she tried to say as much, but her Nan shushed her before she got through the sentence.\n\nAs the truck moved off, Amelie hoped wherever she was going that it had a bigger house at least."

In this case however we must ask to whom the seats shall go?\n\nOne the one hand we could simply take all the seats for the men of the Free Wales Army, which is probably the easiest solution but likely to cause some dissent amongst our allies. We could throw in a few nominal independents who answer to us in reality but that might not fool everyone, and more to the point some of them might get too big for their boots. Or if we feel secure in our position we can share the seats with the Moderates, offer them a scrap from the table to keep them working with us nice and smoothly."

Julian Cayo-Evans might not be inclined against elections in and of himself, but the fact of the matter is that a loss or worse a doubted victory could prove damaging to the international reputation of the nation.\n\nAt the same time however, not holding elections at all is a very dangerous business. It clues people in to the fact that they don't have that much power in the decision making process, and when that happens people start to get uppity. In the kind of way where governments fall and new powers rise from the ashes. The Y Mab Darogan might have the people's support for now but that is not guaranteed to last in such circumstances.\n\nThe moderates back elections, the hardliners do not. It falls to Julian Cayo-Evans to decide the fate of Wales once more."

English sympathisers most likely and ones we should pay attention to from now on. In any case, we have proven ourselves competent at the art of politics as well as governance, and we should be most grateful for the assistance provided by the electoral commission in counting the votes properly without foreign interference. Best to be silent about that though, nobody likes to be bragged at."

Free Wales Army men and their supporters would have to fill out the majority of course, but there were some of the Moderates who looked like they were willing to assist in governing Wales the right way as well.\n\nGiving the Moderates a voice would be useful for his public perception, and endear him to the old guard of the party on top of that whilst providing some more experienced men to assist governance. But on the other hand, could you really ever trust your allies to not stab you in the back? It was an alliance of convenience after all."

cayo.21.desc:0 "What is Wales? A land of miners perhaps, or maybe a pious people who have rediscovered freedoms they once thought lost forever? What is it that defines the land of mountains and valleys in the modern age?\n\nThe outside world might say it is the unique language and culture of the state. The Celtic world might say it is the longest subjugated of the brythonic peoples and was the last to be freed from tyranny. But if you ask the ordinary Welshmen you will have a different and far more interesting answer.\n\nWhom was it that freed the Welsh from Unionist tyranny? Twas the Free Wales Army. Who stood against England and all her cunning plans to force Wales into submission once more? The Free Wales Army. Who will you vote for in the National Assembly elections? The Free Wales Army.\n\nThe party, movement and militia has become so synonymous with Wales that to mention the nation is to mention the party in the eyes of some. Wales is defined by nationalism in the same way the Reich is, and similarities are sometimes noted by foreign observers. Whatever happens to Wales in the future it will be the FWA who are at the heart of it."

WALSCO.1.t:0 "Wales Wants to Hire Dockyards"
WALSCO.1.desc:0 ""...And so to summarize one more, our initial proposal is for the Republic of Scotland to lease several of their functioning naval dockyards for a face value of 10 million dollars, as well as enabling the purchase of several ships belonging to Scotland for Wales."\n\nIt has been two hours of unending conversation between the Welsh and Scottish delegates over the potential sale of several Scottish ships to Wales. The welsh delegation has expressed Wales' interest of  future of mutual cooperation between the two states if this sale were to be approved, but Scotland herself needs these ships as well to defend her waters from potential threats.\n\nThe room was tensing up, and although the circumstances weren't world ending as the talks that the United States and Germany occasionally exchanged, there was a feeling of palpable tension building up between the two parties. Wales needed the ships and the dockyards in order to safeguard its own waters with its already lackluster navy, but the decision to sell the ships are in the Scottish delegates' hands.\n\n"Apologies, but I would like to make a phone call to Edinburgh." The Scottish delegate spoke up in the heat of the moment.\n\n"Please do, I do not mind." The Welsh delegate replied as he adjusts his tie with a sense of nervousness. The next several minutes were the tensest the meeting had gotten, and the room stood silent with only the mumbled voice of the Scottish delegate filling up the room.\n\nThe sound of the receiver to the body of the phone could be heard as the Scottish delegate returned to the room, and he immediately spoke up.\n\n"The proposal for the lease of Scottish dockyards to our friends in Wales...""

Not only that, but also we will be able to assemble a new Royal Navy, that will surely rival the one of old which brought us so many victories on the seven seas.\n\nPrime Minister Morris has been reportedly very happy to acquire the dockyards, as it seems that his Unionist ambitions are paying off, and that the Scottish-Welsh friendship still stands strong, despite all the hardships both our countries have endured. However, some naysayers have declared that the deal was a waste of resources, and that building a new Royal Navy is but a vanity project, devoid of any practical uses. Of course, these criticisms are only a minority, and they shall not stop us from regaining the prestige we lost following the Second World War."

"He wanted someone to tell you in person. So as not to be insulting, I mean."\n\nAnd that was all there was to it. If the diplomat was being timid rather than obsequious, then Morris could forgive that, but the refusal cut and chilled him like a splash of brackish Scottish water. With the Scots' assent, Wales could have brand new destroyers built as far as Rosyth and Kirkcaldy by the end of next year. Morris breathed out his affliction with a curt sigh.\n\n"Well, if it can't be helped, please tell the Prime Minister that I'm eager to negotiate new terms if he should ever reconsider. Can you do that?"\n\nThe diplomat cocked an eye to the ceiling, making a great show of answering a yes-no question. "I see no reason why the Prime Minister wouldn't consent to renewed negotiations at some point, but I can't do much to assure you."\n\n"Kindly do all you can. If I can't see the docks in Rosyth, I'd at least like to take a ride on the Circle Line.""

While expected, this is something of a setback for us, as our grand project of rebuilding the Royal Navy will have to be put on hold for now.\n\nWe now have two options standing in front of us, at least theoretically: we can either rent the dockyards from Scotland again, and cave in to Scotland's demands, or we can just abandon it; however, it is quite evident that the second option would be political suicide, given that now that our political endeavour of building Wales a navy has been started, ending it now would be quite unwise, on top of being a loss of prestige for our nation. And with the navy being Prime Minister Morris' pet project, it seems that in reality, we only have one option, and that is to rent out the dockyards from Scotland again.\n\nGiven the fact that said dockyards were also bringing us some much-needed income, we can only hope that renting them out one more time shall be the key to economic prosperity."

Today, Prime Minister Chesterton gave a fiery oratory in Westminster targeted directly at us, proclaiming that "Wales has for centuries been an integral domain of the British nation, and in time all must come to respect this ancient claim, whether by way of words or by strength of English arms!"\n\nThough we may have hoped this was mere nationalist drum-beating, reports of English armed forces slowly amassing along the border have dashed this fantasy. It is clear that the English intend to restore the old Kingdom, and they have no intention of consulting the Welsh nation's feelings on the matter.
