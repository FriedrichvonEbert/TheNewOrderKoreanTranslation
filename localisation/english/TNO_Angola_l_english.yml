 ANG_Wolfgang_Schenck_dep_desc:0 "§YReichskommissar für Südwestafrika\nNational Socialism§!\n§F------------§!\n§LOnce one of the Reich's most decorated fighting aces, Wolfgang Schenck's administration over Südwestafrika is wrought by the air. He is renowned in the fatherland for flying hundreds of combat missions and in the Luftwaffe he is distinguished for expertise in the development of bombers. Domestically, however, he presides over the poorest Reichskommissariat in Africa, lacking an industrial base and relying on imports and gas fees for its runways. The burgeoning air force of the nation is his sole focus, as evident to anyone who ever looked over the Angolan horizon. His planes rule the sub-Saharan skies.\n\nOver the years, Schenck has ensured that Südwestafrika is the air hub of German Africa. In other internal matters, he is known for his leniency and the close camaraderie he shares with fellow Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, who he often attends safaris with in his personal helicopters or joining in the hunt. Perhaps it is the refuge of the tropospheric clouds, away from affairs pertaining to natives or the SS, that attracts him to the skies. It is where solace lies.§!"
 
 ANG_Hellmut_von_Leipzig_mil_desc:0 "§YGebürtiger Stabschef\nNational Socialism§!\n§F------------§!\n§LHellmut von Leipzig, a German born in Africa, was one of the leading candidates for Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika after the war, in recognition of his loyal service within the Afrika-Korps. Despite the eventual choice of Schenck to lead the Reichskommissariat, von Leipzig has remained both highly popular and highly influential in the parts of Africa once ruled by the Second Reich under Imperial Africa.\n\nWhile disagreeing with Schenck on certain methodology and goals, the native-born von Leipzig also believes that the natives and Germans should strive to build stable, mixed communities within Africa. As such, he has happily worked with the Reichskommissar in his efforts to empower the natives and bring them into the fold, though he may balk once he realizes the full extent of Schenck's plans.§!"
 
 ANG_Gerhard_Homuth:0 "Gerhard Homuth"
 ANG_Gerhard_Homuth_for_desc:0 "§YGesandter nach Germanien\nNational Socialism§!\n§F------------§!\n§LGehard Homuth, like many in the African Reichskommissariats, achieved his position by pure virtue of serving alongside the unlikely sap chosen to be Reichskommissar. A former pilot in the Luftwaffe and a good friend of Schenck's, Homuth was chosen to assist Südwestafrika in their bombardment efforts. He has little experience leading men, but this is something that Schenck has seemed more than happy to overlook.\n\nEver since a near-fatal encounter on the Eastern Front, Homuth has avoided participating in the bombardments himself, instead helping to train and supply braver, more stupid pilots. Like Schenck, Homuth spends much of his time in the skies above Windhoek. Unlike Schenck, however, he does not take the time to engage himself in politics and scheming, even whilst grounded.§!"
 
 ANG_Otto_Herrigel:0 "Otto Herrigel"
 ANG_Otto_Herrigel_eco_desc:0 "§YEntwicklungsdirektor\nNational Socialism§!\n§F------------§!\n§LOtto Herrigel is a young up-and-comer in politics of the region, strangely appointed as economic minister of Südwestafrika upon his own request. After completion of Herrigel's degree in economics in Germany, he wrote Schenck a letter asking to assist with the economics of his home Reichskommissariat. Surprisingly, Schenck responded by offering him the position of head economic advisor, despite his lack of practical experience in the field.\n\nDespite his position, Herrigel is rather far from being in control of Südwestafrika's economy. Schenck and von Leipzig treat his advice as something of light suggestions, and oftentimes Herrigel will be unable to make sense of the books he is given by his superiors and subordinates alike. Despite multiple entreaties to Schenck to change the total disorder the economy is in, Schenck often merely shrugs and asks Herrigel to switch the numbers around, something the young man dutifully does.§!"

The newest batch of SS troops he has deployed within Südwestafrika are highly competent butchers, many of whom have significant experience from service in Ostland and Moskowien.\n\nWhile any help is appreciated, some are beginning to wonder if the price is worth Hüttig's own.

He assures the man that Südwestafrika's recent industrial developments are only the beginning, and additional investment will surely return tenfold their principals in time.\n\n"You are doing the right thing by investing in Südwestafrika," he says sincerely to the corporate suit, though the true meaning of his words is completely different. If only he knew what the "right thing" Schenck intended to do with all those Reichsmarks truly was, he wouldn't be so eager to drown him in money.\n\nDespite his discomfort, Schenck is grateful for the invitation to this social dinner at Windhoek's best (and only) high-class restaurant, and for what it means. Through his efforts, Angola now possesses a sizeable industrial base - sizable in Afrikan standards at least - bringing not only more prosperity for the natives employed as paid, if underpaid, workers rather than slaves, but more attention from investors now willing to pay for a part in what many in Germania have dubbed "Afrika's diamond in the rough".\n\nSchenck picks a canapè from the tray the server almost shoves into his face.

With a more lasting supply of electricity, the power outages that had plagued his factories have all but disappeared.

One Drucklufthämmer can pierce the hardest stone in seconds; combined with the newfangled electric carts, and not one spine had snapped delivering iron ore to the surface since.\n\nThe mine's director had complained at first, moreso when ordered to retrain the natives in "matters better left to Aryans" and increase their wages when all they deserved was "a whipping to remind them of their place in Aryan society." His tune changed when he read the reports: the director's eyes almost popped out of their skull when he landed on a quota figure with what was clearly a misprint of extra zeroes. His complaints left as fast as they appeared after the majority shareholder telephoned him to "shut his trap and let the money flow".\n\nThe natives of Benguela largely ignored such great gains, but they felt their effects. Death rates had dropped to single digits, and the workers' wages had grown large enough to afford canned goods, bicycles, and even store-bought medicines.

Some even arguing in favour of bringing back the stimulant cocktails we used during the last wars.\n\nA select few, however, more in line with our ideals, have proposed a radical solution, which is to open the air force to native cadets. While this would indeed grant us more personnel - and perhaps help us in our secret endeavors - it would also reduce the quality of our pilots, and irk the more conservative members, which could lead to problems in the future..."

The petty criminals are quickly radicalized, turning into freedom fighters as soon as they get out of there.\n\nIn order to reduce the chance of such recruitment happening, Hüttig has been more than happy to accept our request to send him hundreds of captured rebels. The knowledge that their comrades are going to die horribly in the Ostafrikan slave pits will most likely enrage their surviving comrades, but at least it will grant us the reprieve we need to mount a counteroffensive. It's such a pity that we have to resort to such methods to fulfill our duty to the people of Angola..."
 
 ANG_useourpeople:0 "Use Our People"
 ANG_useourpeople_desc:0 "We are NOT like Hüttig and his degenerates. WE haven't yet forgotten our humanity. It will be costly, but the only solution is to employ the natives in garrison and supporting duties: this should give us the leverage we need on the local population, and keep them happy enough. Also, should the bandits attack native patrols, they would be blamed by the population, an unwise move even for the dumbest leader.\n\nWe shall create several new auxiliary units, giving them what they need to keep order, but now a second question arises. How much should we pay them? On one hand, there is no need to be excessively generous: after all, being paid is already a good thing in Afrika, but the promise of bigger rewards could lure many towards desertion. On the other, we could go for the safe route and pay them enough to never make them want to betray us: it would be even costlier, but we would no longer have to worry about the home front, at least on the short term."

Despite our leniency, there are several extremist organizations hell-bent on chasing us away before we can finalize our plan: this can't be allowed, therefore we must look into solutions to ensure order is maintained for as long as needed.\n\nThere are two solutions we could use. The first involves massively employing the natives in garrisoning duties, a costly solution but one which would surely keep the natives happy as the new patrols would never resort to inhuman tactics, and their families would enjoy better living standards. The second - oh God please forgive me for what I'm going to say - is to request help from our "colleagues" in Ostafrika: they know everything about keeping order, but the cost... the cost may be more than we could ever pay in our lifetimes."

Surely he'll agree - he's too pompous not to do that and gloat about his superiority - and, if we are truly lucky, the SS and the rebels will simply kill each other, freeing us from two problems at the same time..."

A force that might even bring upon our destruction if we don't act quickly.\n\nIn order to address the issue, we shall order an increase in combat missions to find and destroy as many UNITA and MPLA cells as possible, to weaken the organization and ensure that, after Angola is independent, they won't be able to challenge the legitimate government."

"There's a war out there, yes? Why am I stuck here explaining concepts instead of fighting with my men?"\n\n"You'll be back there as soon as we are done discussing this." Schenck replied.

ANG.5.desc:0 "They call Sudwestafrika the Airport of Afrika, and the bureaucrats had appointed Schenck to be its head. After all, who better to run a whole continent's air fleet than this man who did nothing but fly? They weren't wrong about his love of flying because the bureaucrats barely had enough time to brief him about his upcoming orders in between sorties - orders from Germany that he couldn't care less about.\n\nHe thinks of the orders as he sits down in the controls of his cockpit: to modernize the aging air force for their continued "pacification campaigns in Westafrika" as well as for "intra-regional aerial support for your fellow Reichskommissariats". Schenck despised how the memo tried even a little flattery in the end: "You are our most valuable way into and out of Afrika and we appreciate your continued cooperation." For God's sake, they weren't even combatants. There was nothing left in Westafrika but small mud huts to bomb, and the dunces in the Luftwaffe called it "training".\n\nSometimes, he wonders if he should have died flying during the War. A burst of tracers through the cockpit - life ends, curtains fall, his Vaterland and family would remember him a hero, and that would've been the end of it. Dying as he lived, mid-flight. Schenck sighed. Instead, he had a career, and ceaseless nightmares."

Not as pilots, of course, but as ground crew and support staff. Schenck sat at his office, head between his hands. As usual, indecision ate at his resolve.\n\nThe orders would make his officers howl with rage. No matter how desperate the situation, the proud men of the Luftwaffe would never stoop so low as flying planes maintained by the natives. Better to keep up a pure, if increasingly ragged, air force, they would say.\n\nBut there were only so many proud Aryans in Afrika. And without air cover, many more would die fighting in the south. Sudwestafrika's air bases were already running into staff shortages, and using locals to maintain planes under German supervision would free up an immense amount of resources. Until now, the native employees had only been trusted to refuel planes and moving equipment. With this new order, the simplest planes would be entrusted to native mechanics, recruited from trusted African SS units, freeing German technicians to tend to the more complex machines. And perhaps, when all was done, the African technicians would have some money to bring back home.\n\nThen again, it would take considerable energy to get the new technician corps started, only to hear the men of the Luftwaffe roar with indignation that he'd even considered letting the Africans anywhere close to their jets."

With the Südwestafrikan Luftwaffe carrying the brunt of the air war in South Africa, aircraft and personnel were being pushed to their limits. Pilots conducted so many bombing runs in a span of a few days that they lost count of their missions. Aircraft were pushed past the limits of their maintenance cycles, so that the swamped maintenance personnel could have more time to ready another set of worn aircraft for another sortie.\n\nWhat wasn't working, however, was the pilot side of this cycle. A sharp increase in pilot accidents, some deadly, indicated to Luftwaffe command that the pilots needed more rest.\n\nNow, air crews are shuffled between air wings, so that the balance of personnel may be optimized. Pilots operate on a day-on-day-off system; on the first day, air crews are on alert for twelve hours of high readiness, followed by twelve hours of low readiness, where there should be ample time for rest between sorties, should the call come. On the second day, pilots shall, in essence, be granted a day of rehabilitation, resting for the trials of the next day.\n\nSuch a process won't allow us to squeeze quite as much out of our pilots as before, however, their combat readiness will be much greater, and hopefully we won't see any more deadly incidents involving pilot error."

Every candidate had been selected from the African SS auxiliary corps, and iron discipline had long been a fact of life. Now came a new opportunity for a higher paying job, far away from the frontline.\n\nReichskommissar Schenck couldn't help but suppress a smile as the day went on. He had chosen the first batch of instructors personally, to make sure they would teach the Africans well, no matter their personal dislike of the natives. As Schenck monitored the first day's progress, he saw the instructors surprised at the speed of their charges' learning. The natives had often been tasked with tedious work, too degrading for their German betters, but the technician candidates seemed to relish the opportunity to tinker with new machines in a less stressful environment.\n\nSchenck knew that it would not always be smooth sailing. Many would be thrown out as the endless shifts would begin to pile on. Many others were likely to try to sabotage the planes, or end up arrested on false accusations by paranoid German supervisors. Schenck could not be everywhere to enforce the rules he had handed out to the trainers. At night, worries of German pilots dying to sabotaged planes alternated with nightmares of tortured and wrongly executed African technicians. But for today, Schenck could not help but feel joy at the sight of men learning about his beloved airplanes, working to better their future."

Once, he had merely helped clean them, spending hours scrubbing away grease and fuel residue from the fuselage after each mission. Now, the new technician worked in the belly of the flying beasts, helping to verify circuit integrity and fluid levels for various systems.\n\nThe punishment for mistakes ranged from verbal abuse, to detention as suspected saboteur - or worse. But the work in itself was interesting, despite the long shifts. New planes were always coming in, and figuring out if they required more in depth technical attention was an interesting challenge. Now and then, the German engineers taught him new techniques so they could offload more work onto him. The increased salary was good, with some of it even given to his family, to ensure cooperation from the new assistants.\n\nAround the hangar were more of the new assistant technicians. It was good to work with fellow Africans. Despite the difficult and stressful work, Valdemar caught himself daydreaming about peace. The money he earned would carry his family for quite a while. And perhaps, the Germans would keep letting him work on their war planes? For that, though, the best thing to do was to keep his head down... and his work impeccable."

ANG.10.desc:0 "Schenck looked at the typewriter in front of him. Ideas did not come to him easily. Blank page syndrome? Perhaps. Perhaps it was simply that the Reichskommissar had tried every public channel possible to ask his colleagues for resources in exchange for planes. Any new letters sent through the usual methods would simply be ignored. Schenck could not even be sure that Müller had read all his letters.\n\nThoughts of clouds, of the sky above Africa. But there were no safe skies these days, just as there were no safe locations on the ground. The war raged on.\n\nMüller and Hüttig had blown him off. Even with the offer of planes crucial to any effort to win the war in South Africa, both Reichskommissars had told him in different ways that they had nothing for him, and that he was a fool to come begging for resources. The Afrika-Schild was all together in this war, yet there would be no economic cooperation to match the military efforts.\n\nPerhaps there were other ways. Schenck knew Müller was desperate for planes to keep the Congo safe. And Schenck suspected Hüttig needed planes for the chemical weapons he flirted dangerously close to deploying. Perhaps he could sweeten the deal."

The men from Zentralafrika were the usual types, futureless bureaucrats filling Müller's empire of ignored paperwork. At least they seemed pleased to escape their failing business for the day.\n\nWeber had no idea how Schenck had pulled the other two Reichskommissariats into this round of economic talks. The boss always kept his plans close to his chest. Weber had been assured that the envoys from the other Reichskommissariats would be eager to negotiate, and that Südwestafrika's negotiators could go hard. They were to offer planes and other assorted goods in exchange for supplies. No matter what kind of personal bribes or begging Schenck had had to do, Weber would see to it that the maximum concessions would be extracted.\n\nAs the talks went on, the complexity of the trade and supply routes grew and grew. An exasperated Ostafrikan negotiator casually said that all this sounded more like an economic union than a simple trade deal. As the sun set, the negotiators began to flesh out the final details, if only to get out into the night for some fresh air."

Wartime conditions made a gathering of all three Reichskommissars in one location unadvisable, and so Schenck found himself making a speech alongside mere aides to Müller and Hüttig to the assembled crowd.\n\n"In these difficult circumstances, as representatives of the fatherland in Africa, each Reichskommissar must stand together for the light of civilization against African barbarism and American degeneracy. The Afrika-Schild serves as the protector of Europe in the continent; now, the Mutual Assistance Pact will enhance commerce and development across all German territories. Alongside my esteemed colleagues, I am proud to sign this treaty of deeper brotherhood and partnership between the German territories in Africa. From now on, the resources, factories and infrastructure of the dark continent shall be joined into one, reinforcing the fatherland's logistics in its war with the South Africans."\n\nThe journalists barely lifted their heads up from their notepads. A few took pictures. The envoy from Ostafrika, a dour fellow, tilted his head ever so slightly toward the Reichskommissar. Schenck hastily added his signature to the treaty, before heading out of the back door. The journalists barely noticed his departure."

Came here to discuss the new trade routes of the Mutual Assistance Pact?" Schenck clasped the other man's hand. Müller's smile turned quizzical as he thought about Schenck's words.\n\nThe Zentralafrikan shook his head."Can't say I've followed that file too much, my friend. I've gathered a few eggheads that know the topic well." Müller's smile faltered for a moment. "About our last conversation. Did you..."\n\n"I did." Schenck said.

However, keeping the situation under control will require committing additional troops to patrolling the colony and isolating trouble spots until unrest burns out.\n\nTough times, however, also present tougher solutions. While our desire to spare the natives as much as possible to keep them docile is commendable, the time has come to consider tougher solutions. By rounding up known public troublemakers and marching them to Ostafrika's 'labor' camps, we can remind the population that we do not have to tolerate their endless complaints.

He observed the troops marching away in the distance. These were no white foreigners, but villagers from up the Okavango river. Even their commanding officer was African, taking his cap off as he and his men walked past the village's chief.\n\nPerhaps the war had drawn another gaggle of Germans down south to fight the Americans. Perhaps all this was a ploy to earn the village's goodwill. It definitely seemed to be working. Villagers had a cautious spring in their step. The men of the village didn't give as wide a berth to the patrolling soldiers.\n\nJoao was jostled from his daydreaming by another man sitting opposite him in the shade. They talked about the strange sight of African security forces. It was easy to reach an agreement: black or white, the soldiers remained capable of corruption and cruelty.

The war had to be won.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the report. More devastation. Terrorist attack by the MPLA. Agostinho Neto. The Reichskommissar tried to blink away the fatigue. So many rebels. Critical infrastructure, torched. German and native fighters in the south, deprived from food and ammunition. Schenck felt an unusual spark of anger, despite himself. He held on to it, magnified it, did his best to nurture the irritation into real fury. Had he not done as much as he could to help the locals, during his stay as Reichskommissar? Did the native elites not know about how bad things were in Ostafrika, how worse it could be here? Agostinho Neto certainly knew, and yet he led his rebels against the Reichskommissar's forces in this most critical moment.\n\nSchenck's fatigue helped dull his logic, helped cloud his self-loathing, helped him forget the righteousness of the rebel's cause.

Files wrapped in blue and beige covers seemed to protrude from the pile, crags jutting out from the mountain's body.\n\nPrying one out from the pile, Schenck reviewed the profile of a foreign national, presumably with a fake name. He saw their qualifications, an artificial life before his eyes. John Hopkins University, bogus degrees, all bound in clean ink and pristine paper. Lies upon lies, fed into the bureaucratic nightmare that he wrestled with daily. Schenck knew better, however. He had started it, and now he was in the eye of the storm. The next step was to chart his way out of it - and his heart faltered at the thought.\n\nHe picked up his pen. Schenck had only needed to sign a few dozen of them - and let America's eyes and ears into the Führer's realm. Whatever the risks were, he was ready. Schenck was a great man in the eyes of many; now the world would see him attempt to be decent. He had no care for his fame, for his tarnished and bloodied legacy. His hands reached out, not to grasp the warmth of the future, but to shelter what embers that remain. Let the Reich mock him, and the OFN lash him behind his back. He did not care. With a steady hand, he began to sign."

He would rather collapse upon his bed and forget the woes of the world, but there was yet work to be done, and this particular task had to be done alone.\n\nAgain, he stared at the phone which sat menacingly upon his desk. Cold sweat covered his body. He had given express orders for no one to disturb him. Though few would at such an hour, he had to be certain that none would overhear. Schenck took one final breath, and dialed.\n\nA familiar voice filled his ear. "Herr Schenck!" it spoke, "How good to hear from you again!" it finished, with a chilling, deceptive kindness.\n\n"Well," Schenck replied, "I wished to inquire on the matter of our partnership. Has - has the board come to a decision?" he finished, with a nervous swallow.\n\n"Ah, Herr Schenck. I am afraid that the board has convened and decided that your proposed venture is unfitting for the company. We apologize, and hope that you understand our decision." the voice said brightly.\n\n"Yes. Of course. Thank you." Schenck said, as the telephone slipped from his grip. The receiver dangled inches above the floor, as Schenck slouched into his seat, lost to hopeless despair."

The truth here in the Reichskommissariat is that we need weapons." A kernel of truth - Südwestafrika needed weapons, but not for war. His secret project demanded a constant, and ample, supply of arms. The African heat did not seem to hold back his chills.\n\n"Herr Schenck," the voice said, even-toned as always, "for America to arm her enemy - even one who decides to cooperate with her - she would need justification." A pause over on the other end. "As we all Americans say, friendship is a two-way street. If you are not willing to divulge the purposes of such armaments, there is only so much I can do to convince the Agency's brass to give you what you want. I hope you understand my position here. I am a liaison, not a plenipotentiary."\n\nSchenck had to be careful. Now was not the time to tell the Americans what he had in mind. "Mr. Lansdale, I can guarantee that the usage of such armaments would not be against Americans," Schenck said, speaking slowly to mask his chattering teeth. "If you need more reassurance, the next time we talk, it would be about an American object of interest. We shall discuss oil. I promise that I will give you full attention when the time comes."\n\n"Hmm." Lansdale did not seem to have the highest opinion of him. "I'll bring it up with the Agency. We'll be in touch.""

Naturally, Schenck masked it as construction material, giving express orders not to open the cargo. He doubted all of his soldiers shared his intentions, and should Hüttig or Müller realize what he planned, his project would fall like a house of cards. Despite the calm he projected to his secretary, Schenck was walking a tightrope.\n\n"The manifests are here, sir," the secretary said. Ever faithful and trustworthy, the man had proven himself a source of sorely-needed help for Schenck. It took a moment for Schenck to remember the young man's name - Wilhelm. "As you can see here, and here," Wilhelm said, pointing to certain lines in the manifests, "the boys have delivered it to the locations specified."\n\n"Thank you, Wilhelm. I wouldn't know what to do without you." Schenck smiled. Though Schenck was a pilot, he admitted that he had no head for numbers. The Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika would rather delegate what he considered the dull parts of his job to his subordinates. If only all of them were as competent -\n\n"If I may ask, sir," Wilhelm said, his voice hesitant, "what is the purpose of all this secrecy?"\n\nSchenck had nothing to tell him."

Whether it be accounting, bookkeeping, or the simple matter of administrative issues, he delegated it as much as possible. He realized that he had become a pretty face that hung above his Reichskommissariat, but he did not care.\n\nToday was inevitable, in retrospect. Even without the Americans' denial of gun shipments over to his fiefdom, he would have needed to take a long, straight look at the Reichskommissariat's finances. Today's focus was revamping his secret project. The Americans have thrown it off-course, necessitating a correction; Schenck would not be a good pilot without the benefit of foresight. He had to take some pills for his nerves, however.\n\nHis feet were restless. Schenck realized that he had mountains of work to do; the papers in front of him had waited for years. He heard the aides in the next room, an excellent set of lads, partying while he had to make precise clerical entries. Gritting his teeth, his hands moved slowly. The din was distracting him, and he had to concentrate. Why, he asked himself, were all the mainland Germans so eager to present themselves as savages? It was going to be a long day, as he had to account for the weapons and supplies needed to get the secret project back on track. Schenck only wished for himself some peace and quiet."

This Reichskommissariat surely cannot grant your request. Mr. Lansdale, there is siphoning off the margins, and then there is outright theft! If the other Kommissars hear of this, the Führer will have my head and my rank - and you shall have no one to negotiate with."\n\n"Herr Schenck," the voice said, attempting a diplomatic tone, "these are not my terms. Instead, think of it as an exchange." Schenck's fingers clacked on the table, and his feet became ever more restless. "America entered these clandestine talks with the single aim of aiding you. If you are not inclined to give what she needs, within limits, there would be no point in any negotiations. You are reasonable, Herr Schenck. An ace, a war hero. America could not have chosen a better partner." The voice paused as if to emphasize its next point. "What she cannot gain through words, she can gain through force. Remember, Mr. Schenck."\n\n"Yes, I understand," Schenck said, his leverage taken away from him, leaving him deflated and wheezing, "However, surely we can negotiate the rates? Twenty-five is too much."\n\n"That's your problem, Herr Schenck. I am not your friend, and, at this stage, neither is America. You either agree, or you don't. So what'll it be?" The Reichskommissar put down his receiver and cracked his fingers. He considered his answer."
ANG.92.a:0 "Fine. Twenty-five percent it is."
ANG.92.b:0 "Unacceptable."


ANG.93.t:0 "Clandestine Shipments"
ANG.93.desc:0 "Schenck hated accounting. Perhaps he should have never become a Reichskommissar and remained a respected war hero. He had come into this job with the expectation of flying the skies of Africa, leaving his underlings with the unenviable work of administering the Reichskommissariat. All of these, his guilt, his bleeding conscience, and his crimes could have been averted with a single, resounding "no." In Germania, he was a trophy. In his domain, he is a puppet.\n\nStanding up for a bit of fresh air, he peered at the nearest window. There, the vistas of Sudwestafrika beckoned to him, like a siren's call. Yet, he did not hear their songs, nor even their voices. The savannah spread empty, flat in almost all directions. An orange expanse with roads spreading like tattoos on its surface. On those roads, like ants, trucks carried the material produce of his domain, throwing reddish dust and clouding the afternoon light.\n\nSome of those would ferry what the Americans had demanded of him. If the Führer 's cronies discovered that he was shipping German oil to the OFN, he would be dead. A prospect which had brought him to his rarely-used office often lately. He had to prove, using creative accounting, that he was in a trade contract with the South West African Gulf Oil and Aviation Company, a no mean feat. He placed a finger on the window, longing to fly again in the African skies. That was for another day, however. The Americans had to give him something next - he saw no reason to continue the talks otherwise."

ANG.94.t:0 "Standing Our Ground"

Twenty-five percent, however, was right out. How could the Americans understand? He had to retain his position, else his project would be realized. The oil that flowed through his territory was one of his sources of revenue, not to mention a convenient cover.\n\nHe stared at the phone. "I understand," Lansdale had said, sounding defeated, "we'll call you at a later date to discuss another avenue of American interests in your domain." At the very least, the talks had not broken down right then and there. He sighed, his hands trembling. At least there was a way forward, and that his refusal had not sealed his project's prospects.\n\nHe stood up and peered outside. The vistas of Sudwestafrika, his dominion, opened its lips and smiled at him, beckoning him. Schenck felt the desire rise in him, to run in those fields and fly in its skies. However, his countrymen's - and his - hands were stained with blood. Whatever fire that could have burnt in its flat, orange, almost-infinite horizons was now only embers. With whatever he had, he was determined to defend the vestiges of its hope. Whatever he did, his sins would linger, and for that, he left time to heal all the wounds he had caused."

He had outlined what he had wanted, and on the face of it, they were not much. In the long term, however, whatever he had requested would play a key role in his project. Schenck felt the warmth of the day, carried by the light of the early afternoon. He had left the windows open.\n\nThe Reichskommissar's fingers twisted the receiver's wire. He still felt uneasy. "Medical equipment, for the most part," he said, trying to sound relaxed and laid-back, "radios, binoculars, backpacks, and rations." No guns. "This shouldn't be too difficult, right, Mr. Lansdale? I did not request weaponry."\n\n"You're right, Herr Schenck." Schenck's counterpart sounded calm, almost complacent. "This is not too much for America, but ultimately, the decision does not lay with me. The President and the Agency would decide whether or not to send whatever you need. You understand my position?"\n\n"I do."\n\n"I'll try to put in a word for you, but only if you let me decide the next topic of discussion: the rich mineral deposits of South West Africa, and how the Company seeks to use it for the greater good."\n\nSchenck had little choice. "Understood. See you later, Mr. Lansdale." He did not like Lansdale, but perhaps it was for the best."

They promptly left him alone, free to gaze into the oblong green box that America had clandestinely sent him. Schenck had forbidden his men from looking inside: loose lips sunk ships.\n\nOn his desk was a great treasure: American-made war materiel, practically the stuff of dreams. Prying the lid open, he saw what the Americans had sent him. On a bed of hay - to cushion the delivery, he surmised - were a binocular, a first aid kit in a tin box, a compass, and an MRE package. The binoculars arrested his attention immediately. What would it feel like to look at the world through American lenses? He picked it up, scattering strands of hay, and set it onto his eyes.\n\nThrough the windows of his office, the South West seemed an arid, wild land. Closer inspection, however, revealed the beauty of its nature. He saw rodents, lions, wildebeests, and many more, scurrying around, living lives devoid of any conception of sin and redemption. For himself, there was no such hope. Not anymore. He whispered a cold, empty prayer. He could see it plain as day, written on the walls of his office.

Yet, the United States of America used their proxy to utter a single, world-shattering word: 'No.'\n\nHis men had left him with stacks upon stacks of paper. A calculator lay beside the mess, ready to accompany Schenck into yet another session of overwork. All these negotiations had tired him, and he wished he could go a day without worry or anxiety. The medication helped soften his nerves, at least.\n\nHe recognized that this nervousness and anxiety would never go away. Schenck had gone too far, but if weeks of overwork were all it took to redeem himself and his actions, he would accept it, every time. However, as he looked outside, to his favorite panorama in the world, he felt the sun's low, sleepy gaze alert something in him. He had to do his work and do it quickly.

The Americans seemed determined to wring out all of Südwestafrika's material wealth. He considered it. His Reichskommissariat was perhaps a minor contribution to the industries of Germany, but if he aroused suspicion, he would not remain where he was for long and remain where he needed to be.\n\n"Mr. Lansdale," he said, masking the nervousness in his voice with a wheeze, "what exact rights do you want? My territory has a lot of metals in it - you'd have to specify which ones you want." Of course, Schenck had to agree to whatever exchange that occurred, but it helped to know one's enemy. It was half the battle won; Hüttig and Müller were unknown factors. Should they learn of his betrayal, they would abandon him in an instant. He had to be careful.\n\n"To tungsten, chromium, and everything you can sell besides. Do not worry, Herr Schenck," Lansdale lowered his tone, "we would pay fairly for it.

At the outset of his career in German aviation, Schenck never expected to ask for favors from an American political operator. Yet, here he was, consorting with traitors to his Fatherland.\n\n"Fine," Lansdale said, his tone curt, "have it your way.

He even hummed a little song or two while he wrote over the recommendations.

All the paperwork that laid before him was an excuse to let them in. Müller and Hüttig would not suspect a thing. They would perhaps even welcome his overtures to making a more competent and elite land force. Schenck did not intend such a thing - the Americans and the Germans were the enemies of his secret project, and both think Schenck their useful puppet. Oh, how wrong they were!\n\nIt was a momentous occasion. For a time, the veil of darkness that had descended upon Schenck since his first days as the Reichskommissariat was lifted.

It would not do much in the grand scheme of things, but he would make it as pilots always did - adjust the course of flight to make his destination in time.\n\nTomorrow he would address all his soldiers and hand out medals to the most experienced ones.

The one whose body he found in the dirt road of her village, torn to shreds by one of his air squadrons. Walking in his office, he looked at the necklace, studying it for all of its beauty, representing Angola itself.\n\nSchenck began to assault the wall of his office, punching it over and over with the fist clutching the necklace.

There are men putting their lives on the line for the emancipation of their country, where before men would only fight to keep them subdued. A cause more noble, no Angolan man has known.\n\nEver more of our people, inspired by the new cause, have decided that they too wish to become a hero of the people. Our recruiters now find themselves swarmed with prospective freedom fighters, all looking to take up arms against those who would put them people back in chains.

Many stones were left unturned. One stone, however, was recently reported to have been hiding quite a valuable military commodity.\n\nA group of adventurous young boys recently took it upon themselves to break into an old, locked-up German warehouse. They discovered not guns nor dusty supplies, but tanks. Parked side-by-side, the Germans must have crammed as many tanks as they could into the warehouse. Easily enough armor to outfit a battalion. It didn't take long before our officials heard of the discovery, and drove down to investigate for themselves. As sure as the sun rises, there it was: a warehouse containing abandoned yet fully outfitted German panzers.\n\nWhilst the models stored within the warehouse are outdated, it will doubtlessly prove to be an immense boon to our forces upon the front lines, should we choose to employ them in the field.

The night sentries were the first to fall, as the guerillas swiftly attempted to commence their slaughter. Men rose abruptly from their sleep, roused by the racket of gunfire. Before many had time to so much as rise from their cots, a barrage of grenades were tossed in their tents. Men in yet untouched tents emerged with their rifles, many without the time to so much as put on a single piece of clothing.\n\nAmidst the explosions and the screams, our men returned fire, killing several and sending the rest running off into the night. Whilst the enemy had been routed, over a dozen Angolan soldiers now lay dead, with many more wounded.\n\nThe fallen attackers wore mostly civilian clothing, with some brandishing ramshackle uniforms. The only common identifying factor between the attackers was a simple swastika arm band. Those still loyal to the Reich appear to have taken up arms against us, a bastardization of our brothers in Ostafrika and Zentralafrika who do the same to earn their freedom, these terrorists fight in hopes of putting us in chains.

Overwhelmingly, he simply wished to remain in place, rest, and remember.\n\nHe closed his eyes as he laid comfortably upon that blood stained soil, and he let his mind wander back to his humble village of mud and clay and woven thatch rooftops. He used to admire the Germans and their marble pillars. His mind skipped another beat. The Südwestafrikan flag that sat in front of one of the colonial buildings was cut down by freedom fighters and burned. Abilio recalls how at that moment he felt so inspired, so resolved to bring down the oppressors of his people once and for all. He bitterly recalled the difficult parting, as he bade his family farewell, promising to soon return home a hero. Would they hate him for breaking his promise? The thought lingered for a moment as a couple tears streamed down his face, before his thoughts leapt again.\n\nHe recalled all the cold nights at camp. Those long nights he spent maintaining his rifle and thinking of home, and of the horrors he had witnessed in his fighting. He reminded himself of why they fight, and of what horrors his family would endure if people like him did not take up arms for the Angolan cause.\n\nHis memories skipped to closer things, like the attack on camp. The Germans descending upon them from the darkness, expending ammunition into every defenceless Angolan soldier they laid their eyes upon, lobbing grenades at tents full of barely awoken men. He recalled his proudest moment, where he boldly emerged from his bunk, rifle in hand, and returned fire upon the assailants as his comrades scrambled to retreat. Would his family be proud of him? Would the Angolan people be proud? His thoughts returned to the present. Of course they would take pride in him, he was assured. So long as they fought on with a sense of sacrifice, his people would be free. And Abilio had made his sacrifice. His thoughts became a blur, as his head felt dizzy. It was time for him to rest."

Ambitious, the young men aspired to break the Schwalbe's standing speed record of 900 kmh.\n\nSensible Reichskommissars would put an end to this potentially disastrous chicanery, maybe hand the culprits to a tribunal for property damage and tomfoolery. Wolfgang Schenck watches eagerly from the hangar as the two men run down one last systems check over the radio. The air behind the engine's exhaust wavers against the heat as its lively whine grows from silent to eardrum-bursting loud.

As it turned out, the murmurs were right.\n\nLike an encroaching flood, the shoreline had wedged the regiment between its waters and the portion of dune slope too steep for any truck to climb. What he thought were wind marks in the sand dunes, Oberstleutnant Pasche realized in growing panic, were instead drift lines left by waves. He considered turning the convoy back, but quashed the thought just as easily; even he knew it will take nearly a half-day's travel to return from where they had left. Seawater will soak his engines in less than an hour.\n\nBarring a miracle, Pasche had just surrendered a regiment to the sea. How will he ever explain such a defeat to his superiors?\n\nMeanwhile, engines roared beyond their limits while the salty tides crashed against heavy rubber tires. Yet softened sand soon gave way to their friction and weight, and the convoy ground to a halt half-submerged in seawater. Men hurried to offload all supplies they could out of the sinking Opels; for all the strength desperation fuels, however, those heavier than rifles and ammunition -- water, rations, medicine -- slid down the sandy slopes and splashed into the sea.\n\nFrom his sinking command car, Pasche gawped at his shattered men clambering up the steep sand dunes to the summit's firm ground. He joined the scrambling masses seconds later. So it was that he sat on an outcrop half-drenched, helpless as the Skeleton Coast claimed a regiment's worth of equipment for its timeless hoard."

From the Volga to Burgundy, from Denmark to Lüderitzbucht, children the Reich over celebrated their heritage and their predecessors' sacrifices. The German children in Windhoek were just as eager to show their patriotism as any other in the mother country.\n\nFirst, a candlelight parade. Hitlerjugend marched with lit candles down streets to the town center. The spectating parents mulled over the procession's homages: the fallen of the First Weltkrieg, stabbed in the back by progressives and the bourgeois, who all stood idly by while the British ripped Südwestafrika from Germania's grasp. The fallen of the Munich Putsch, and those who died at the hands of Spartacists in the Weimar. Their sacrifice had bought Germany's deliverance. And through the sacrifice of many Germans more, this deliverance was made utterly permanent.\n\nThen came the play. The Hitlerjugend performed Schlageter underneath the Reiterdenkmal, a statue of a German soldier commemorating those lost in the Herero and Namaqua War. The play was the story of Albert Schlageter, a man who stood up as the Third Reich's first soldier and fought a hidden war against the Ruhr's unjust occupation by the French. Its message resonated within those who recalled the Mandate years, drawing tears from several old couples as the curtains drew to an applauded close.\n\nBut the natives who watched it brought home an entirely different take. These colonists had the gall to weep over the memory of their own occupation, under the monument to their conquest and genocide of the native tribes. They drew their own parallels to Schlageter derailing trains and the SWAVO rebel taking shots at colonial police.\n\nAll art is subjective. The Germans celebrated the play as a shining example of their culture. The natives took away the play's most famous line instead:"

Any moment now, the old aviator will receive the signal to broadcast his prepared speech to every radio set in Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika. His people will learn that, on this tragic day, German history's greatest man has died.\n\nIts greatest man indeed: a failed painter turned architect of a crumbling empire. The Führer's Thousand Year Reich, won in blood, now ran on the back of corrupt opportunists, cruel fanatics and, most importantly, spineless bureaucrats. Germany was rotting from the inside, and Reichskommissar Schenck knew that, shorn of its main pillar, the Reich will cave in on itself. He might have wept for those caught in the coming chaos once. Now, after the chaos it has exported abroad? The Reich will only reap what it has sown for two decades.\n\nThis collapse will no doubt spread to Africa. Even as the Reichskommissar droned his well rehearsed eulogy, his mind wandered. All three of the Reich's Afrikan colonies were powderkegs. Any embers drifting in the wind will set off one disaster after another. At the very least, the coming trouble will surely clip the Afrikaner Luftwaffe's wings. Inwardly, Schenck relished the thought of ending at least one source of pointless bloodshed. Anything to ease his burden, relieve him of a crisis he was incapable of fixing himself.\n\n"The Führer always taught the German people that the toughest trials can only be overcome by the strongest men. As vanguards of the Aryan race in Africa, we must hold our people's civilizing torch over the Dark Continent in his stead."\n\nSo did Schenck end his speech. A technician cut the microphone.

Now, one set of documents laid atop the leaning tower of forgotten bureaucracy.\n\nHans Hüttig's proposal for the "Afrika-Schild", a treaty of mutual defense among the Reich's three mainland Afrikan colonies. The Ostafrikan had been insistent that the deteriorating situation necessitated some military cooperation, that all proud Germans in Africa should close ranks together to forestall the civil strife that had befallen Germany. Less charitably, he commented on the Südwestafrikan's faint hint of hesitation; he asked, likely in a deadpan tone, if the man had anything to hide from his colleagues. Ostafrika, contrarily, held no compunctions in operating on what is merely another piece of the Reich's lebensraum - especially on matters of regional security.\n\nIn other words: Hüttig had trapped Schenck to a corner. Müller's thoughts Schenck can only guess, but he also acquiesced to Hüttig demands.\n\nAn hour had come and gone before Schenck signed everything Hüttig required. The former aviator looked at the window, from which the waning sun cast its crimson light throughout the office. How much the Reichskommissar would prefer to be away, flying in the sky.

Total control of the sub-Sahara shall finally preclude the Americans' aid shipments to native insurgencies in the continent."\n\nReichskommissar Schenck did not know whether to laugh or cry at his eastern colleague's message. All three Reichskommissariats in Africa were on a collision course with the South Africans and their American patrons. He knew even their combined forces would never break the South Africans fast enough to render American help moot. But what can be done? Hüttig never takes "no" for an answer.

All he knew and wanted was in that mine: its bounty gave him money, which gave him both food and home which he shared with his wife and children. Sure it left him with nasty coughs, but that was a price he'd pay for a happy life.\n\nBut though Oelsen hated politics, it was folly to ignore politics butting into his life. His recent ventures into the diamond mines had been accompanied by the tiny little American shits in the Army, always blathering about "guaranteeing interests for South African democracy". Whatever the fuck that meant. Oelsen himself thought it was codespeak for "give me your diamonds". He shook his head, hefting his pickaxe as he ventured towards the mineshaft's elevator.\n\nOelsen stopped in his tracks as an unfamiliar noise shook throughout the cave. A plane - not an American bomber or fighter jet passing through. This one was different, bigger. Oelsen only had enough time to turn his head before he heard a swirl above the roof, saw soldiers and miners scramble for cover, felt the ground beneath his boots shake. Dust flew, men fell, and the elevator full of miners snapped from its dangling cord, careening down the shaft and to its occupants' deaths. Then Oelsen only saw black; the mine's mouth had caved in, thousands of pounds of rocks blocking the entrance. Chills shooting up his spine, Oelsen ran to the blockage and picked at it with all his strength. If he didn't work his way out now, he'll never see the light of day again.\n\nMany hours did Oelsen claw and pickaxe his way past the rubble. He barely heard the cries and shouts outside as he made his way through all the stone, even finding the occasional body buried underneath. But every swing exhausted the weary miner further. He could try and try again, but the more he did, the more life-giving air left his lungs. More hours passed and the cave lights dimmed to candlelights for Oelsen. He laid against a wall - just to catch his breath. Or maybe take a nap, that sounds good. He closed his eyes.

A recent attack on the settler's village has pushed them over the edge, and now their men are aggressively clearing vast swathes of land and building checkpoints to control the movements of the natives.\n\nSuch reports of increasing tension are coming regularly, Reichskommissar. The natives feel emboldened by the absence of our troops, and the settlers feel increasingly exposed. Sending native units is out of the question, as the settlers will never trust them to secure peace. We can only hope that the settlers don't spark revolts while we're busy in the south."

Our proud German soldiers fought valiantly despite their losses, and the cowardly natives soon broke ranks and fled. However, the rebels still had the time to loot a weapon cache and steal most of its contents to arm their comrades.

Order was only restored when troops heading to the frontline noticed smoke in the distance and circled around to the ravaged city.\n\nAs a result of the native violence against the German districts and our soldiers' clearing of the native slums, most of the city has been burnt to the ground. Scores of slaves have escaped to the bush, and the remaining native population that has escaped decimation have been sent to detention camps.

Our besieged men have also been resupplied by air. With the arrival of troops in the Angolan northeast, we hope to finally crush the rebellion this week.\n\nPer your instructions, troops have been taken from the reinforcements due for the front and redirected to quell this revolt. It will take a few more days until the rebels are crushed and cleanup operations are completed, and so our men in the south will have to endure with lowered reinforcements and supply for the time being..

By imposing stricter discipline and a gag order on his troops, as well as by telling them that rotation back to the rear is imminent, order was restored to the sector.\n\nHowever, as unease spreads to other sectors, we might not be able to be so generous with the troops. The men are distressed at the thought of their family being butchered by the natives, but weakening our front even further is impossible.

 ANG.40.t:0 "Audacity - Dramatis Personae"
 ANG.40.desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck leaned back into the leather chair in his dimly lit office. The hour was late, yet he had no desire to leave, without the will to carry himself away.\n\nFumbling as he uncorked a bottle of whiskey, he pressed the bottle to his lips and downed as much of the toxic liquid as he could. Breaking to cough as his throat burned, Schenck placed the bottle back down onto his desk, alongside the other empty bottles.\n\nHe needed to forget. Why would God not let him forget? Schenck lingered upon the thought as he swallowed another swig of whiskey, only to hack out another series of coughs. What would it take to forget?\n\nHe ruminated over the atrocities he had signed off on over the course of his career. Decent people, men, women, and even children, unable to escape the fuses of his bombs, or the barrels of his troops' rifles. He wondered if it would make any difference if they knew he did not wish for any of it.\n\nSchenck took another burning sip of his drink, tears now rolling freely down his face. No, he thought to himself, this wasn't his fault. He never wished for any of this. None of the horrors in Africa were of his volition. They were all orders from Germania. One after another the orders flood in, mandating atrocities, ruining lives, killing thousands.\n\nWolfgang Schenck could not live with himself one day further if he continued following orders as he did. He would take the fate of the African continent into his own hands."
 ANG.40.a:0 "My dreams aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be."


 ANG.41.t:0 "The Only Option"
 ANG.41.desc:0 "Schenck looked at the complete mess of papers which laid before him: infrastructure in need of repair or improvement, projected employment numbers under a variety of economic plans, factory plans in such-and-such province, militia strength here, native unrest there, and many more. His head began throbbing. He could not run away this time. The Angolan Plan was the only way out, because no matter how high he flew, his conscience would be there. He prayed that if Angola were not to become a great nation, then it would at least be strong enough to stand against their oppressors, who would no doubt come back if they had the chance - German or otherwise. It meant a nation with water and sanitation, with jobs and income. It also meant a country that could fight, on the land and in the air.\n\nNo doubt the other Reichskommissars would be suspicious if he made any moves to execute the plan. Müller, as distracted as he was, would be suspicious of him using any materials not used directly for the war effort. Hüttig would be worse: any men kept in reserve would surely enrage him and the man was already paranoid to begin with. Schenck wondered if a free nation in the midst of this foolish war were even possible. Throughout history, there were many men more capable and more intelligent than he who could not achieve these very dreams. But he had to try. There was no other choice."
 ANG.41.a:0 "Angola must be free."



 ANG.42.t:0 "The Neverending Work"
 ANG.42.desc:0 "After trying to organize some papers, Schenck sat down exhausted. More time had passed than progress made. He was tempted to get one of his secretaries to handle the work, but it was a secret project after all. He shuddered at the thought of someone finding these papers and snitching to Germany, or even worse, someone like Hüttig. God knows there were too many Hüttigs in this world. Even more tempting, however, was to soar again in the clouds - but that merely delayed the work that needed to be done.\n\nHe sighed. What was all this for anyways? A free Angola was so far away. So many maladies bedevilled the country: the poor infrastructure, the unruly fighting men, the complete absence of any proper industry. These all needed to be fixed before Angola could even have a chance at mere freedom, let alone prosperity.\n\nSchenck closed his eyes and tried to imagine the Angola he wished to leave behind. Hopefully, when all this was said and done, as his plane would take off from these dusty airfields for the last time, he would leave behind a place which echoed the best of what was beating in the heart of every person. It would be a place where a simple man could provide an honest living for his family. A place where the children could run around in parks with their friends. A place where the wicked man would get justice, fair and promptly. Finally, he dreamt that this new Angola would become a place which would bow to no one except for Father Time - but only barely."
 ANG.42.a:0 "That's enough dreaming for now."

 ANG.43.t:0 "Nationbuilding 101"
 ANG.43.desc:0 "To make the Angolan Plan a reality, Angola had to be stabilized and the logistics for its new beginning needed to be set up before any other components were laid down.\n\nThere was, of course, the matter of the war. Any material used for anything other than the war effort would be scrutinized by the other Reichskommissariats. And the German Civil War would not last forever; should the victor intervene in this blasted war, then there would be double the scrutiny. Anything they did would need to be covered up and fast. Schenck furrowed his brow. He knew some men who could be trusted to handle the more sensitive parts of the plan.\n\nAnd how suspicious would Müller get? He would mostly be distracted by the war, but Afrika-Schild would permit Müller access to Sudwestafrika. If he realized that supplies were used to merely "stabilize" Angola, he might get suspicious that we aren't trying our best to win the war.\n\nIf too many resources were reallocated too quickly, Müller would no doubt act on his suspicions and put an end to Schenck's plan for good. Conversely, if too few resources were allocated, then a liberated Angola would crumble when the Germans, or even the Americans, decided to assert themselves."
 ANG.43.a:0 "We can't afford to rouse suspicion now."
 ANG.43.b:0 "We have to lay the groundwork for a stable state."
 ANG.43.c:0 "They will be ready, through our great sacrifice."


 ANG.44.t:0 "Building a Beating Heart"
 ANG.44.desc:0 "Schenck stared at the industrial blueprints: the first of many to ensure the future of a new Angola.\n\nIdeally, what industrial base Angola had would be used to further industrialize, to build the backbone of a new Angolan economy. Unfortunately, there was the problem of the war: military factories were busy churning out guns, planes, ammo, and everything else for the war effort. Civilian industries were at capacity trying to maintain the facade of normality, on top of repairing the infrastructure damage caused either by American bombers or insurgent bombings in the countryside.\n\nThere were no easy solutions, Schenck mused. The factories had to supply the war to keep the Americans from overrunning Angola, but without a post-war industry capable of supplying the natives in their post-war struggle for freedom, the Angolan Plan would be doomed from the start. Perhaps there was a compromise that could benefit both of Schenck's objectives...while risking failure at both."
 ANG.44.a:0 "The war effort is too important, we have to maintain appearances."
 ANG.44.b:0 "We will do what we can to ensure a prosperous Angola."
 ANG.44.c:0 "We give them everything we have, as part of a debt we can never pay."


 ANG.45.t:0 "The Quality of Life"
 ANG.45.desc:0 "Africa, as many know, is criminally underdeveloped. Generations of European colonizers never actually took much stock in helping the people survive, let alone develop. As Schenck takes stock of the economic situation in Angola, he is reminded again that Afrika was never prioritized for Germanization, being little more than a resource extraction scheme for Germania. But for the Angolan Plan to succeed, that would have to change.\n\nWe could invest generously into improving the standard of living, committing ourselves to civil development to the point that even the poorest Angolan will know the wonders of modern plumbing, but it will make Müller suspicious as we divert more of his raw materials for non-military purposes.\n\nThese plans are, of course, expensive - both in terms of resources and the political cost of getting Zentralafrika to look the other way. Needless to say, it was a bad time to be diverting wartime necessities for civilian utilities.\n\nSchenck sighed. Any major infrastructure push would no doubt raise suspicions from Müller. Yet, at the same time, he had to give the natives something to fight for - a semblance of prosperity and a headstart for the natives after so many years of oppression. That, and the hope of minimizing the crushing regret that he did not do everything possible, when this was over."
 ANG.45.a:0 "Building utilities while a war is at our doorstep is difficult."
 ANG.45.b:0 "Divert what resources we can."
 ANG.45.c:0 "Appropriate construction equipment and funds from the war effort."


 ANG.46.t:0 "The Art of Preparing for War"
 ANG.46.desc:0 "Whenever Schenck read the reports, glancing over the estimated militia strength, he couldn't help but notice that his light hand had actually made them more complacent in their bid for freedom. It would be an overstatement to say that they were competent fighters, and for their own good, this could not continue.\n\nSchenck dusted off plans to dispatch some of the garrison to remote villages - not as a garrison, but as a 'nativizing' training force, quietly preparing them for the day they would stand alone. Perhaps they would not have the most advanced weapons, but they would not need them if he trained them right. They would fight dirty, with guerilla tactics and unconventional strategies, bleeding their many enemies dry, whether they be American or German.\n\nThis would not go unnoticed. Hüttig, in particular, would be more than annoyed: his suspicions would be piqued. If the men are not ferried towards the frontline, he might question what, exactly, is so pressing on the Sudwestafrikan home front to demand so many troops. Schenck shuddered. For a moment, he wondered if Hüttig already knew what was going on in these rooms from some rat or erstwhile spy.\n\nFor now, Hüttig had his hands full with the war, but Schenck knew he couldn't push his luck; the madman could make a move before the war is over, and the failure of Schenck's plans would leave Angola in a worse place than when he arrived."
 ANG.46.a:0 "Give them the scraps, we have to buy time."
 ANG.46.b:0 "Split the weapons between us and them."
 ANG.46.c:0 "An Angolan soldier must be a German's equal; he will have to be."


 ANG.47.t:0 "Withdrawing The Guard"
 ANG.47.desc:0 "As Schenck looks at the last security reports, he ponders his next move. His plans are moving quickly towards completion; now all he needs is to allow the independence movements to take control of the territory in a final push, but for that, they need time and space to gather the men, and roads and factories to move and supply them.\n\nTo address this fundamental issue, his mind already has a solution: he will order the garrison to stop protecting the villages from the rebels, and stop the patrols that regularly keep vigil over the roads and highways. This way, the rebels will slowly take over, and extend their control over Angola. As soon as that happens, more and more will join the freedom fighters, further strengthening their cause.\n\nHowever, this option is not free from risk. The other Reichskommissars will surely notice the empty garrisons and unguarded roads, and this will greatly increase their suspicions about our conduct: if he truly is to make this move, he'll need to be prepared for everything, even - no, especially - for the worst.\n\nThe choices are straightforward: move fast, move carefully, or try to find a balance between the two. All center on a deadly balance: a stronger Angola, or a less suspicious uprising. Time to decide."
 ANG.47.a:0 "We cannot afford to have them jump the gun."
 ANG.47.b:0 "A slow withdrawal will suffice."
 ANG.47.c:0 "Redeploy all men to the front line, effective immediately."


 ANG.48.t:0 "Cabinet - The Future"
 ANG.48.desc:0 "Put bluntly, most parts of the Angolan Plan were logistical in nature; dangerous, to be sure, but mundane at heart. But the questions of good government - of the simple, yet impossible questions: these were the stuff of dreams and lofty ideals, which Schenck had lost years ago.\n\nA strongman, or strong institutions? Unity, or liberty? Schenck's decision tonight could set the precedent for all the other leaders in Afrika to follow. But the natives will not have the luxury of the Americans two centuries ago: two oceans, few enemies, and endless time to discuss and debate with their new countrymen. A weary man, who desired redemption and absolution, who wished to no longer see a country bound up in the chains of servitude - he would have to do.\n\nIt would be possible to call a meeting of dissidents to draft a constitution, but it would take considerable misdirection and concealment just to hide the meetings. Alternatively, Schenck's men could do the majority of the work, while briefing some hardy ex-revolutionaries in their cells, telling them to stick to the plan. It was not the most ideal solution, but better than gambling too much and losing it all.\n\nSchenck reached for the folder of..."
 ANG.48.a:0 "The soldiers hardened from captivity, with wills of steel."
 ANG.48.b:0 "The dreamers awoken at last, carrying the torch of freedom."


 ANG.49.t:0 "Building a Brain Trust"
 ANG.49.desc:0 "Schenck had believed that deep down in the hearts of all men burned the desire to be free - but, in his experience, many were content to plow the fields, to suffer servitude in exchange for peace. That made those willing to speak out for freedom all the bolder, landing them a place in the folder in Schenck's hands, and in his prisons.\n\nThe question was how many should be released to ensure a strong Angola. Any option taken would need to account for how much suspicion it would raise from Hüttig. There would need to be new names in the prison rolls, new identities for the released prisoners, but time was of the essence. The more prisoners that would be freed, the more difficult it would become to release them all unnoticed.\n\nSome would have to be released, no matter the cost: they had essential skills and education that would be vital to the new government. Others weren't essential, but would undoubtedly be useful.\n\nThen, there was the craziest idea of all: just free them all. It would, Schenck reflected, save him the burden of choosing who to free. And it would free him of the guilt of knowing that in him choosing to free some, he would condemn others to waste away for longer. After mulling it over, Schenck thought it would best to..."
 ANG.49.a:0 "Free only the most essential."
 ANG.49.b:0 "Free all those who would benefit our new Angola."

 ANG.50.t:0 "The Art of Deceit"
 ANG.50.desc:0 "Dr. Savimbi drove to the Reichskommissar's office, summoned for a checkup. It was a flu, he said, that could be contagious, hence the house call. With his doctor's coat and the Reichskommissar's invitation in hand, he passed through security without issue.\n\nWhen he entered Schenck's office, Dr. Savimbi promptly removed his doctor's coat. There was no flu here; only a table littered with identical satchel bags, containing matching manila envelopes.\n\n"As soon as you authorize this operation, these satchels will go out to every single freedom fighter that we know of." Schenck said. "If your men follow your instructions, then these forged papers will get your fighters through any checkpoint in the Reichskommissariats as they prepare for the uprising. They are made with the same paper and methods used for all official documents."\n\nSavimbi held one up to the light to see the Reichsadler shining through and nodded in approval. "Hüttig will be suspicious, even if the documents seemed real, given the number of people crossing the borders. It would not be a problem to hand all of these satchels out, but if you want to minimize suspicion, we have a few drop-off points that would be safer, even if it restricts the uprising.""

 ANG.51.desc:0 ""Dear Reichskommissar Hüttig,\n\nIn light of our recent alliance and collaboration, I thought it would be best to offer some assistance with regards to your prisoner problem. We have heard that you have jailed and imprisoned the UNITA bandits who have made numerous raids into your territory. Similarly, they have been a thorn in our side as well, and we have our own fair share of experience in rehabilitating these individuals to make sure that they will not attempt such brazen acts of chaos in the future. I am sure that these subhumans have received their due punishment under your vigilant administration, even as your valiant troops push towards victory. We offer to take over custody over some of these troublemakers, so that you may focus your full attention on the war effort under our new alliance. Attached to this letter are the formalities concerning the proposed prisoner transfer. Together, we will run the Americans into the sea and claim South Africa for the Reich and for the Afrika-Schild.\n\nYours, \n\nReichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck""

 ANG.52.t:0 "Fanning the Embers"
 ANG.52.desc:0 "Schenck sat at his desk, drafting his last orders as Reichskommissar. He needed to write out the orders for the soldiers deployed in the villages, for their sake as much as it was for the natives. Once the partisans could run unfettered, the troops would need a head start to escape with their lives, having been ordered to 'withdraw' from their posts.\n\nHe wondered at the absurdity of the situation: his treason relied on his soldiers' loyalty, so that both the colonizer and colonized would escape with their lives. If such a dilemma was supposed to make him feel better, it didn't. It was one more thing to hide from Müller, who would surely start asking questions when faced with such disorganized orders.\n\nThere wasn't much left to do now - most of the preparations for the Angolan Plan were finished, and Schenck could just tell his men to pull out of the villages immediately. Müller and Hüttig could go to hell for all he cared - with a bit of luck, by the time they came knocking, he'd be soaring towards a place where he could retire in peace.\n\nThen again, why risk it right before the end? If there was a screw-up, a leak, then it would all be for nothing. He would probably be able to escape, but the plan would fail."

 ANG.52.b:0 "Be selective about the pull-out. Make it justifiable."
 ANG.52.c:0 "Let's get the men out now. The plan cannot wait."


 ANG.69.t:0 "A Wrench in the Wheel"
 ANG.69.desc:0 "Across all fronts of the South African War, the Südwestafrikans have garnered a reputation - not of bold deeds or noble victories, but rather of seemingly systematic ineffectiveness. The aid Südwestafrika is obliged to deliver has, without fail, proved utterly useless.\n\nSüdwestafrikan aircraft buzz enemy targets harmlessly as air strikes almost always land off target. Their Kolonialgarnisons delay the movements they promised to conduct. Not to mention the questionable accuracy of the reconnaissance reports coming from their patrol craft; more often than not, they appear to cry wolf of enemy movements and imminent attacks. The Afrika-Schild's other elements dig in for hours or days and prepare for contact, yet no such contact arrives.\n\nUnbeknownst to the other Reichskommissars, however, is that the Südwestafrikans have been highly effective. Not in combating the OFN, no, but in disrupting their own allies' activities. Further discrete disruptive measures are planned as well, like supplies delayed because of "partisan activities", if not "mistakenly" seized by actual partisans within Ostafrika.\n\nSchenck sits comfortably in Windhoek, ready and willing to lose this war of his."

 ANG.76.t:0 "Right Under His Nose"
 ANG.76.desc:0 "The squeak and rattle of his office's aging darkwood floors never ceased to irritate Schenck - one of many expenses his soul carries as penance for his actions. This annoyance manifested itself again as his secretary sat behind his desk, donning a diehard National Socialist's fierce demeanor.\n\n"A cursory examination of this year's figures, Herr Schenck," hemmed the young man, "clearly shows Ostafrika's exponential economic growth. Sudwestafrika's own numbers languish pitifully in comparison. What will the mongrels say of our performance? They will think us weak, will they not?"\n\nSchenck had low tolerance for bureaucrats and con artists. Already the brat's insults neared Schenck to his limit.\n\n"And the civilian and military sectors?" he bit. Keeping his cool was a risky exercise in restraint; slip once, and his cover will be all but blown. "Their numbers are fine, yes?"\n\n"Right, but it's folly to assume we need, or deserve, marginal growth. Ostafrika is flush with both resources and money, no doubt because of their superior administration. If we desire to maintain our supremacy over the natives, Herr Schenck, then I advise approaching Herr Hüttig with an agreement. He will understand, I'm sure."\n\nSchenck continued to pace around his office. Oh, if only this kid knew Afrika's realities. That his plan weighed on the willingness to cut his throat that day or not, whether it was for "the glory of the Reich" or whatever nonsense he could come up with. Hüttig was a madman and the Nazis were cruel, sick monsters, to be sure. But Schenck knew failure was certain if he failed to disguise his true beliefs. And his failure meant Africa's doom at the hands of Ostafrika's leading sociopath."

Then he decided such thoughts belonged only to lowly, irresponsible, easily-seduced men as he nursed brandy in his Quelimane office. So he filled his thoughts with his truest prize: dominion over all accursed Afrika, ultimate testament to the Aryan's bosshood over the lowly native. At least, until they veered to his rivals' faces.\n\nMüller and Schenck plagued Hüttig's mind as he drank brandy, deepening his scowl. A full bottle of liquor would have been a quarter-filled bottle but for his secretary, dressed perfectly to Hüttig's standards, who entered meekly and laid a folder on his desk. Hüttig glanced at the folder, then at the clerk. "From Windhoek?" Hüttig asked, receiving a nod. Sighing, he perused the document that had seen fit to interrupt his workday.\n\nHe mumbled its contents, sneering eyes bulging in shock. "A request for further cooperation... aid of civilian and military production... importation of slaves... weapons?"\n\nFor once in his waking life, Hüttig had seen the benefits of cooperating with the buffoons to his west. Wolfgang Schenck, that damned pilot, in pursuit of further ties with Reichskommissariat Ostafrika. Was the fool's lands in so desperate a state that he had to beg and plead for his help? Or was Schenck finally taking his position with a modicum of seriousness?\n\nThe rushing stream of thoughts crashed against the sides of Hüttig's mind. Of course, this could all be a trick, a ploy by Schenck to backstab Hüttig in a single moment of weakness.

Irritation gave way to despair as he read Hüttig's response.\n\n"Reichskommissariat Ostafrika cannot bring itself to lend aid towards foreign states of seeming strength, and must refuse the request for additional resources to be delivered to..."\n\nSchenck's eyes wandered off. What details were there to speak of?\n\nThe wound in Wolfgang Schenck's heart continued to pry open, as the demons which rested in his very soul continued to pour out, with sins of the past, present, and future rallying in his mind. Hans Hüttig, all too suspicious and all too despicable to even lend a thought of providing aid to the other Reichskommissariats, and now the evil bastard couldn't even fold in this one chance to allow for a centimeter of success for Schenck.\n\nAs the sorrow ate away at the Reichskommissar, he nearly forgot of the young man standing there, iron-willed, the spitting image of a man like Hans Hüttig. "Get the fuck out." Schenck said, providing a dosage of fear with the gravity of Schenck's tone as he turned about and marched out."

 ANG.80.t:0 "The Secret War"
 ANG.80.desc:0 "Far above and beyond the blood-soaked sands of South Africa's battlefields, an unsung war simmers.\n\nIn the cities and fields, cells of freedom fighters strike under night's cover and day's exposure, wearing worn, smuggled uniforms and carrying "gifts" from their benefactors in faraway America. Vengeance is their watchword, liberation their war cry, and the blood of fascists their gruesome calling card. Ammo caches, air fields, officers, homes - no targets are spared from wrath long repressed, justly deserved.\n\nOn clear blue skies do the Luftwaffe fly fewer sorties, and when they do they soar to where their grace is needed least. "Where are the stukas?!" cry commandants in radio rooms filled with static noise and, a flash later, scattered dirt and bomb shrapnel. Trusted to turn the tide of war, the fearsome knights of the Reich were instead found wanting by the many corpses who lost its battles below. Desperate generals wonder if air support will ever be a given, rather than a dying wish.\n\nAnd in a Windhoek mansion's basement, a German listens to communiques and messages from a hundred men in a hundred places: Angola, the Congo, Mozambique, Langley. All operations are underway, they assure. A little more wetwork and misdirection, some more cracks in the fetid behemoth... and Africa will be free. Bleeding and rabid. But free.\n\nSchenck slouched heavy against his chair, dripping sweat from all pores. Despite the weight of a continent bearing upon him, the Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika cracked a grin."

 ANG.84.t: "The Fall of the Namib"
 ANG.84.desc: "Nowhere else in the African continent has fallen under the Reich's yoke longer than Namibia, with a sizable community of Germans descended from settlers in the late-19th century. The colony and its volk had endured British, then South African, rule following Germany's defeat in the First World War, before returning back to the Reich's fold following its victory in the Second. Despite its less-than-hospitable wind-swept savannahs and scorching-hot deserts, Namibia is a choice colony for many German settlers, seeing the established German presence as a welcome taste of the Heimat they had left behind. As a result, Namibia has become the most Germanized region in Afrika following Wolfgang Schenck's flight.\n\nSaid Germanization has proven to be a pain in our ass. While the erstwhile Reichskommissar had left the region to the free state of Angola in his final acts, it seems the local population has other plans: the Namibian Germans have taken up arms against their land's tentative Angolan administration, seeing Schenck's actions as nothing short of a betrayal. Led by the ramshackle remnants of Südwestafrika's colonial government, this insurrection has declared a collaborationist government aligned with the Afrika-Schild in their war not only against the OFN, but against our rule."

Luanda served as the homebase for our revolutionary government, allowing for us to easily coordinate movements and operations among the various militia groups scattered across the remnants of Sudwestafrika. However, reports have flooded in, saying foreign troops  marched inside, and within in a matter of hours, secured it. While our great leader Jonas Savimbi and his officials were evacuated shortly before the occupation, losing the city meant we we've lost our main facilities and means of equipment production. This means our forces will slowly be drained until they are nothing more than simply men. No matter how loyal and brave men are, they cannot compensate for the superior troops of the enemy; and without centralized command, the resistance will fizzle out into nothing more than several separated partisan cells, which will be easily hunted down and destroyed. It seems all hope for victory is lost, and that we must pray that our foes offer us some dignity, even in defeat.\n\nDespite this, we have done our best. We fought for the independence of our dear Angola. We fought in the name of liberty for our brothers and sisters suffering. We have fought to remove the colonialist forces controlling our rightful land! In the end, however..."

Whatever their motivations might have been, we owe them a debt of gratitude for what they have done to ensure the survival of the young Angolan state."

 ANG_constitution_desc:0 "We have seen the results of regimes that place authority into men and not institutions. We have only to remember Ostafrika where Hüttig ruled with the iron fist a kingdom of fear and terror, or to Zentralafrika where Müller's ignorance and apathy led to massive failures and collapse. Even our own former ruler, Reichskommissar Schenck flew above the clouds while hardly carrying for those stuck on the bare earth until the last moment. We will learn from these failures. The newly drafted Constitution of Angola has been careful to separate too much authority from any one individual or office. We have based our system on the one the American's are so rightly proud of, and have established an extensive system of checks and balances to maintain stability."

Their experience in the tactics of jungle warfare will make them excellent officers and NCOs for our new national army and hopefully they will keep us ahead of our regional rivals. At the same time, we can also use their particular talents in flushing out any remaining German troops still operating within our borders."
 ANG_few_prisoners_freed:0 "Marginal Prisoner Liberation"
 ANG_few_prisoners_freed_desc:0 "Before their collapse, the regime here in southwest Africa only bothered to free a few of the more important political prisoners, most of whom had been languishing in camps for years if not over a decade in a few unfortunate cases. While their release will provide us with the nucleus of a functioning administration, we are still running a skeleton crew due to a severe lack of education provided to almost all natives. Hopefully these few pioneers of the Angolan state will be enough to guide us through the first few turbulent years while we rush to prepare a new generation for self-rule."
 ANG_med_prisoners_freed:0 "Large Prisoner Liberation"
 ANG_med_prisoners_freed_desc:0 "In an unexpected move, the old Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika had made the decision to release almost half of the political prisoners that had been taken during the two decades of their occupation and administration. The released prisoners included influential local leaders who stood up for their people and even some with connections to the former Portugeuse colonial administration. We can now boast of a relatively stable political climate that should have enough seasoned members to ward off factional splintering or over centralization in the coming months and years and we lay the foundation for a government for the people of Angola, by the people of Angola."
 ANG_high_prisoners_freed:0 "Massive Prisoner Liberation"
 ANG_high_prisoners_freed_desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck presided over a colonial regime of racial superiority that would have had its end goal as the elimination of all "inferior peoples" from the African continent. By all sensible definitions, the man was an evil criminal. Despite that, we cannot now help but to hold some gratitude for his existence, for we have learned that it was by his order that over seventy percent of the total political prisoner population of the former Südwestafrikaner regime were freed. We do not know his reasons for doing this, and we do not really care. These prisoners will now be able to see the dream of a free Angola realized, and not only that, they will be able to see it thrive. The braintrust we have received defies calculation, as we have even received former prisoners from the former British and French colonies of Africa as well as those involved in the Portugeuese administration. The light of hope has once more been shined on the African continent, and we intend to take full advantage of the gift we have been given."

While further stability in Angola is yet to be seen, the influx of American support and influence speaks to an American effort to grant Savimbi a more permanent grasp on his nation.

Fortunately he didn't spend much time in them.\n\nHis work was out in the villages and towns, speaking to the people and soldiers living through this war. He remained struck by the devastation that touched everything, throughout the country. Even the richest towns had an undercurrent of uneasiness, fear, and weariness. No matter where he traveled, how many soldiers he spoke to regardless of side, this feeling of devastation; a country that had only just been starting to recover, persisted.\n\nHe had his limits. He didn't wander into ongoing fights. His PRESS badge wouldn't protect him there, though gunfire was a common occurrence, and he'd definitely been shot at more than once. The longer he stayed here, the more he struggled to capture the magnitude, horror, weariness, and importance of the wars that were consuming not just Angola, but the entire continent. Nothing seemed to properly capture this, and so he kept working.\n\nToday he was wandering the remains of a skirmish. Broken barricades, destroyed guns and equipment, and even some burned-out tanks and transports were strewn around the battlefield. He even saw the bodies from both sides sprawled on the ground, forgotten, abandoned, and rotting.\n\nA sound made him start, as he realized he wasn't alone. He spun to the noise, and his heartbeat slowly relaxed as he saw it was only a child. A boy that couldn't have been more than thirteen, dressed in ragged clothes, and little more than skin and bones.

The thought never crossed Issac's mind that this man could have been a soldier in the Free Angolan Army.\n\nThe man was native in Chokwe, but over time had learnt enough Portuguese to be able to communicate with it, which was fortunate for Issac. Isaac's ability to speak the language was a major boost to his application to join the volunteer force in the first place, but now it served as a telephone line between two vastly different cultures. They met well, as Issac was in severe need of somebody to drink with, and Adrien knew nobody that spoke either Chokwe or Portuguese.\n\nBetween drinks Issac talked about his hometown in New Orleans. Adrien, the name of Issac's drinking buddy, was interested in the intense mingling of culture that had made the city famous in both America, and now, it seemed, Angola. Adrien shared anecdotes from his time as a professional fisherman, which turned out to be less anecdotes and more fishing tips for the next time Issac was travelling down Lungué-Bungo.\n\nAs time went by, their conversations gradually shifted to the war. Both men were careful not to reveal their true professions as soldiers, but they spoke optimistically about the end of the conflict. Adrien spoke sorrowfully about the war, wishing an end to the conflict and a peaceful homeland for his people, a universal value so it seemed to Issac.\n\nIt grew late into the night when Adrien departed. Shouting had erupted from outside the bar, and the sounds of trucks grew louder and louder. Adrien understood the sounds well enough; his joyful expression had turned grim, but before he departed the establishment, he made a promise to Issac to once again meet at the same bar they were standing in right now. As the door to the bar slammed shut, Isaac truly wondered if he would be able to return to this place before the end of his deployment."

ANG_PW.12.d:0 "Checking his bag, Will triple-checked that he had everything he'd needed for the interview. While he'd never thought himself of much as a reporter- photography was more his forte, but when the US government offers you the opportunity to interview an ally out of Angola, you don't refuse. Standing on the helipad, his shoulder-long brown hair blew in the wind of the descending Huey bearing the focus of Will's trip. As it descended in front of him, Jonas Savimbi jumped out of the passenger seat, wearing his iconic beret, camouflaged uniform, and khaki slacks, he seemed like something out of a TV action flick. The burly monster of a man smiled through his bushy beard, and moved his mouth, though Will couldn't hear any words, thanks to the whirring helicopter behind him. "What?!" Jonas cuffed his hands together and yelled into the face of the journalist. "I take it your ears aren't shattered?!" The pair shared a smile. \n\nDriving through the city bearing nothing short of a thousand guards, Will was getting the grand tour. "And there would be the arms depot- you're not a spy, are you?" Savimbi flashed a smile, hardly caught out of the corner of Will's eye as he snapped a picture of the warehouse. "Heh, no, of course not. Now, you've said that the bombing raids against the Socialists have been something of a point of contention in the high command?" Savimbi scoffed, then let out a sigh. "Some of my subordinates call it 'inhumane'. They don't know that this is the best way forward for Angola, even with a few more craters. They don't know what is best, and I do." Will felt as though he was getting a better idea of Savimbi than Jonas knew. Looking at his notes, Will looked back to Savimbi. "Before the German occupation lifted, you said that you'd do whatever it took to liberate your people from the German menace. Since the civil war, however, you have received aid with open arms from German sources." Will looked to Savimbi, as his subject of interrogation slowly turned his head to him. What Will saw was not a look of anger, however. The closest which he could compare it to was his father when recounting stories of his youth. Nostalgic. Smiling, he looked to Will."

ANG_PW.20.t:0 "The Excuses of Empires"
ANG_PW.20.d:0 "Angola. A land of humidity, jungles, mud, and death. A nation of little importance, which was barely industrialized, and that held nothing but the bitter wounds and consequences of Nazism.\n\nYet he was here all the same. A Japanese commander in Angola, assisting the MPLA against the OFN-backed UNITA. He looked out the window in his small office, as children played with a ball below, and released a resigned sigh. What was he even doing here? What was even the point of this escapade? Spreading the liberation of Pan-Asianism? In Africa? Angola was well beyond where the Co-Prosperity Sphere was supposed to end.\n\nThere had been a time where he'd believed in the cause and mission, where he'd been proud knowing that they were better than the imperialists who had enslaved and exploited Asia for so long.\n\nNow though? He found this entire situation uncomfortable. Wrong. Japan had as much right to involve itself in Africa as the OFN did - which was in short, none whatsoever. How, exactly, were they supposed to claim to be better than the Germans and Americans when they engaged in the same imperial tactics? The politicians sold it as spreading 'liberation' and 'protection' from the 'evil west' - the exact same excuses the OFN and Nazis also used. He found them just as unconvincing, no matter if they came from Tokyo or Washington.\n\nIn the end, it all came down to a desire for power. Principles didn't matter when there was opportunity to spite the United States. He shook his head as he watched the children play. They were so carefree, and reminded him of his younger brother, and the times where they had feared the retaliation by the Americans after Hawaii. Japan might no longer need to fear America, but Angola was not so fortunate. Perhaps there was no reason to be here, but maybe he could at least ensure that something good came out of it regardless."

ANG_PW.21.t:0 "An Interview with "Neto-Dono""
ANG_PW.21.d:0 "Imada Harukichi, a journalist for the Mainichi Shimbun on assignment somewhere in Angola, found himself fairly impressed with the man he was interviewing. The man was Agostinho Neto; the venue was a fast motorboat on a river. The leader of the MPLA, far from being the bombastic Chō Hi that Imada would have expected, was instead a personable man of a moderate temperament. He treated Imada with courteous respect and asked polite questions about the journalist, his home, his newspaper and his family.\n\nAs the interview went on, Imada noticed one thing about Neto: the man was stubborn to a fault. Whenever Imada brought up the MPLA, Neto would narrow or roll his eyes and say things like "their ideas are at last misguided and at worst a prostration before American or German imperialism". After the second such attempt, Imada gave up, and changed the subject, only to be interrupted by Neto, who had ordered the boat stopped.\n\n"Senhor Imada, I beg your pardon, but can you tell me what you see?" Neto was pointing at a village by the far bank of the river. Imada looked and said that he saw a village. Neto sorrowfully shook his head.\n\n"You're right, but I don't just see that. I see destitute, hungry people, ruined by the imperialist manipulation of the masses. No riches, no pride in their own culture, no pan-Africanism, no nothing. That there, Senhor Imada, is what I fight for. To find a way to put an end to that sight. To give these people a chance for happier times, a happier life.""

ANG_PW.30.t:0 "Maine-Night Dinner"
ANG_PW.30.d:0 "Road King was a classic, New England style restaurant, the busiest one in this part of Bangor. Especially at this time of night; people flowed in and out like a house on fire. Martin got a good look at them all. It was good to see faces laughing and talking, rather than shouting and cursing.\n\n"To be honest son, I don't think I knew Angola existed until you sent me that letter from the place!"\n\n"Maybe I just invented it, see if I could trick you." Martin took a bite from his lobster roll. Damn, Maine seafood tastes good. "And I've caught you hook line and stinker, it seems."\n\n"Nope, I pulled out the atlas... it was a Portugese colony beforehand, believe it or not. Nowadays... uh, then it had been a German one, and now we've got it. What's the word they use for it?"\n\n"A mandate." Martin's mother chipped in. Martin's niece said little of anything, babbling away to herself in her high chair, playing with the food her grandparents had bought for her.\n\n"How'd you like the people? You know, the Angolans?"\n\n"They were kind... and for a country so poor, they like to give. Little trinkets... you know, stuff like that. Even to the Germans they were kind enough. Most of the time, at least. I suppose that's the best we could've asked for, but even so... they were all so poor. My regiment never went into the cities, so maybe it was different there, but still. Sometimes it almost felt like... stealing."\n\n"Well, we're all proud of you, even Bethany." His mother said, smiling at the toddler, who gave her a little giggle back. "But don't get too up yourself, we won't have you lounging around the house like last time!""

ANG_PW.31.t:0 "Day Out"
ANG_PW.31.d:0 "Richmond was in the process of exploding.\n\nEach street Tanner tried to walk down would be met with the bodies of a hundred chanting students. They held picket signs high into the sky, cramming up city streets with their persons. Most of the businesses in their path quickly closed up shop and commuters turned back around for easier crossing elsewhere. It was peaceful enough however, so Tanner removed his recorder from his jacket and approached one of the students.\n\nHe got a number of quotes that day. "We won't leave until they leave Angola!" was one of Tanner's favourites.\n\n"We've tainted our progress for peace. Every gun we've sent, every weapon... it's despicable, and the nation's only chance for redemption is an immediate withdrawal."\n\n"Conscription is crime!"\n\nBy the time he had gotten far more than enough quotes and a quick, snappy headline for his newspaper, they arrived. Ten vans, driving down both sides of the street. They blocked the approaching protestors, only stopping as the van doors creaked open.\n\nTanner watched as a new tide of counter-protestors erupted onto the streets of Richmond. Turning back around as the two sides met, the journalist decided that he could afford a few quotes more."

ANG_PW.32.t:0 "Present and Past"
ANG_PW.32.d:0 "The relic foreign district of Shanghai seemed only a little more of an oddity than Hayao would've first imagined. Derelict British era mansions and ancient French chateaus stood mighty against the low lying collection of slums that surrounded it, but if Hayao was to enter one of them, he was sure that the same type of inhabitants would be present.\n\nHe decided that this was not the portion of town he should linger in. Loading into a taxi, Hayao made for the shoreline.\n\nThe sun sunk behind the high-rise districts of the developing Chinese city, casting long shadows along the ocean's surface. The sky had developed into an orange hugh, forcing the few clouds to seemingly change colours. Focusing so strongly on the outside scenery, Hayao almost didn't realise that the taxi driver was talking to him.\n\n"There's a bunch of restaurants along the shoreline, most of them exclusive to Japanese, but that won't be much of a problem for you." Hayao sensed a slight tinge of resentment in the wizened driver. "You're a soldier, right?"\n\nBlinking, Hayao responded. "Uh... yeah."\n\n"Where'd you serve last?"\n\n"Angola." Hayao thought but did not say. "I was another volunteer helping destroy an undeveloped nation." The soldier shook his head. It would not serve well to reminisce. His vacation had barely begun, after all."

ANG_PW.33.t:0 "Talking Business"
ANG_PW.33.d:0 "Whoever had organised this meeting hadn't drawn any punches. Hayao Senior was thoroughly impressed by the level of professionalism the Angolan officials had shown him. He wondered if they would've shown the same level of respect to one of Hayao's foreign colleagues, but he determined it would not be wise to give that question to the two men. "It's quite the location. I've been told that this field in particular has a vast reservoir of diamonds about 750 meters underground."\n\n"That's right, untapped riches." The one on the right replied, his unflawed Japanese thoroughly surprising Hayao. "731 meters to be exact, and they've been located in various portions in the right of the field." The one of the left added, in similarly well punctuated Japanese. "But this field is one of many, and we are not here to merely discuss this particular set of diamonds. Your nation wants its mining firms all over Angola."\n\n"Correct. Diamonds are definitely going to be a large subsect of our endeavours, but iron ore as well as granite is a top priority. I've read up on reports... most say that while the resources are here, they are usually untapped."\n\n"That's right. We would be willing to sign onto almost any mining site, as long as we can maintain a few overseers over each sight. Plus a share of the profits, but that part was to be hashed out in the negotiations." The right hand Angolan feigned shock, and looked around the site in fake amazement, locking eyes back with Hayao after a few seconds. "Which appears to be happening right now."\n\nQuelling a laugh, Hayao thought for a moment. He was warned that the Angolans would've required a share of the profits. It would make overall profitability a little more difficult, certainly compared to Yunnan... but, this was an opportunity that a tiny caveat like that only made a little less desirable."
