 POLITICS_Cheddi_Jagan_DESC:0 "The founder and longtime leader of the PPP, Cheddi Jaggan is a man either adored or despised in the political world. The former President of Guyana, his tenure was marked by severe resistance both within and outside of his own party and splits over various policies. He left the post after losing an election to Forbes Burnham despite much reluctance on his part, largely due to outside pressure from the United States. Cheddi is not a man easily put down for good, however, and he has once again taken charge of all of Guyana. Following Burnhams authoritarian actions, the USA invited Cheddi Jaggan to lead a reconstruction government as long as he delayed his radical economic plans, Jaggan accepted.This time, with the knowledge of what led to his past failures, perhaps he can finally implement socialism in Guyana."
