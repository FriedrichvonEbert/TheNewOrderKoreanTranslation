    POLITICS_SUZUKI_TEIICHI_DESC:0 "훈장을 받은 일본군 장교이자 전 내각 기획원장인 스즈키 테이이치는 일본의 전시경제 건설과 이후 아시아에서의 일본 신질서를 위한 경제 계획에 깊이 관여했습니다. 1943년부터 귀족원 의원으로 존경받는 스즈키는 이노 총리에게 그의 중국에서의 경험, 군부와의 관계, 경제 전문 지식을 사용하여 광둥성의 기업들을 도쿄의 의지에 따르게 만들기 위해 광둥의 차기 최고 경영자로 임명되었습니다.\n\n광둥의 자유분방한 경제를 운영하기 위한 그의 직접적이고 국가통제적인 접근은 광둥의 4대 회사를 괴롭혔고, 그들은 광둥으로부터의 최소한의 간섭하에서 운영하는데 익숙해졌습니다. 하지만, 도쿄로부터의 수년간의 미약한 감독에 의해 조성된 부패 문화와 이노 총리의 지시에 따른 야스다 은행의 후원은 스즈키가 4대 회사에 대한 통제를 유지하기에 현재로선 충분한듯 보입니다.\n\n스즈키는 탐욕에 눈이 멀어 의무를 망각하고 행동의 결과를 모르는 영토를 봅니다. 그는 광둥에 있는 중국인들에게 특별한 애정은 없지만 (만주국처럼) 강력한 보안기구를 유지할 일본 정부의 자원이 없으면 적나라한 탄압이 중국인들의 반체제 활동에 지속 가능한 해결책은 아니라는 것을 뼈저리게 인식하고 있습니다. 스즈키는 일본의 이익을 위해 새롭고 더 강한 광둥성의 토대를 마련하고 기업 거물들과 임원들을 굴복시킬 것입니다."
    POLITICS_MATSUZAWA_TAKUJI_DESC:0 "'모든 위기 속에는 큰 기회가 있다.' 서양 속담에 따르면 그렇지만, 만약 당신이 마쓰자와 타쿠지라면, 이 경우 동양에서의 가장 적절한 격언은 '도마 위의 잉어'일 것입니다. 야스다 은행이 채권단, 정치권, 도쿄의 언론에 의해 해체되면서, 마쓰자와는 광둥에서 회사 업무를 정리하는 데만 몰두했습니다. 전 최고 경영자가 배를 버리고 남은 거물들이 독이 든 성배를 마쓰자와의 손에 밀어넣기 전까지는 말입니다.\n\n일본으로부터의 연결이 거의 끊긴 상황에서, 마쓰자와는 일본 정부에 의해 공식적으로 그의 자리에 임명되지 않았습니다. 물론 그에겐 기다릴 여유가 없기도 했습니다. 야스다 붕괴의 여진과 도쿄에서의 정치적 혼란으로 광둥의 예산은 깊은 적자를 기록했고 심지어 현지인들이 손실된 임금을 벌충하기 위해 범죄와 반칙으로 돌아서며 투자자들은 공포에 떨고 있습니다. 나머지 거물들은 달콤한 말과 편리한 '계획'을 가지고 자리를 차지하기 위해 앞다투어 노력하고 있으며, 이들은 분명 사태가 안정되면 자신들이 최고 경영자가 되는 것을 목표로 하고 있을 것입니다.\n\n비록 마쓰자와는 광둥으로 발령난 것이 자신에 대항하는 부패한 도당의 소행이라는 것을 분명히 알고 있지만, 그들의 계획은 마쓰자와의 일생의 결과물이 그의 주변에서 산산조각나게 만들었습니다. 이제는 그가 아무리 무고하다해도 돌아갈 수 없습니다. 그는 걸어다니는 시체이고, 그가 할 수 있는 것은 막이 닫힐 때까지 모두를 한데 모아 두는 것 뿐입니다."
    POLITICS_MORITA_AKIO_DESC:0 ""광둥의 기계조작자." "자이바쓰와 싸운 남자." "일본의 대실패." 모리타 아키오는 많은 이름으로 알려져 있고, 모두 어느 정도 사실입니다. 오사카제국대학을 졸업하고 제국 해군의 전시 연구 그룹의 일원이었던 모리타는 1952년 도쿄 통신사의 인수 문제로 한때 친구였던 이부카 마사루와 불화를 겪은 후 광둥의 해안가로 떠밀려왔습니다.\n\n암기한 설계도와 오래된 동료, 청콩공사의 리카싱의 도움으로 모리타는 1950년대에 광둥과 중화민국에서 고품질의 시청각 전자 제품을 판매하며 광둥의 기업 지위에 다시 올라섰습니다. 1960년 소니의 4대 기업 가입으로 모리타는 개혁을 외치는 외로운 목소리가 되었고, 그의 제2의 고향 광둥을 경제 강국으로 만드는 동시에 그가 대표하게 된 주인 공동체를 위한 더 나은 장소로 만들기 위해 싸웠습니다.\n\n일본인들의 그늘에 가려진 채였던 긴 10년은 광둥이 살아남기 위해서는 기업체들의 놀이터가 아니라 사람들이 집이라고 부를 수 있는 장소가 되어야 한다는 것을 모리타와 리카싱에게 확신시켜 주었습니다. 광둥의 일본 사업체들 중 그가 성공할 것이라고 생각하는 이는 거의 없지만, 반대 의견을 내긴 커녕 모리타가 그의 추락에서 다시 돌아올 것이라고는 예상한 사람은 더더욱 적었습니다. 그는 여기서 멈추지 않을 것입니다."
    POLITICS_MATSUSHITA_MASAHARU_DESC:0 "마쓰시타 마사하루는 일본의 가장 유명한 전자 회사의 상속인으로 임명되어 많은 사람들에게 매력적인 삶을 살았습니다. 귀족 출신으로 도쿄제국대학을 졸업한 마사하루는 마쓰시타 전기의 설립자, 초등학교 중퇴에서 일본의 몇 안 되는 비-자이바쓰로 대기업으로 성장한 살아있는 전설인 마쓰시타 고노스케의 딸과 결혼하기 위해 스미토모 은행의 금융가로서의 경력을 포기했습니다.\n\n마쓰시타 시니어가 오사카에서 회사를 이끄는 동안 마사하루는 1960년부터 코슈에 있는 자신의 사무실에서 중국으로의 확장을 감독하는 운영 책임자였습니다. 창업주의 아들이자 기업 경영자이자 정부 행정가로서 마사하루는 자신의 미래를 두려워할 이유가 없었습니다. 하지만 그의 지인들은 다르게 알고 있었습니다.\n\n마쓰시타 마사하루는 훈련받은 엔지니어도 아니고 관습적인 세일즈맨도 아니기에, 마쓰시타와 광둥 모두에서 자신의 외부인같은 지위를 통감했습니다. 해마다 두 마쓰시타의 사이는 멀어지고 있으며, 마사하루는 입법부에서 정치적 줄타기를 하면서 언제 그에게 고삐가 맡겨질지, 사실 그렇게 되기는 할지 궁금해합니다. 이제 그는 광둥 최고 경영자로서 자신의 반대자들, 즉 자이바쓰 동료들과 양아버지에게 자신이 주강 삼각주에 마쓰시타를 위한 말 그대로 제국을 건설하겠다고 약속한 모든 것을 보여줄 기회를 얻었습니다."
    POLITICS_IBUKA_MASARU_DESC:0 "이부카 마사루의 재능과 끊임없는 탁월함에 견줄 사람은 거의 없습니다. 그의 무한한 야망과 정치적, 사업적 통찰력에 견줄 수 있는 사람은 훨씬 더 적습니다. 가차 없이 기업의 사다리를 오르며 끝없는 로비, 정치공작, 그리고 경제 공작은 이부카를 친구는 적고 적은 많게 만들었습니다.\n\n도쿄 전기 통신의 공동 창업자이자 한때 친구였던 모리타 아키오를 외면하는 것에서 후지쓰 전자에 대한 지배권을 합병하고 굳히는 것에 이르기까지, 이부카의 끈질긴 야망은 후지쓰가 주강까지 사업을 확장하는 것을 가능하게 했습니다. 그 확장으로 광둥의 라디오 시장 지배권을 둘러싼 전설적인 법정 다툼에서 이부카가 모리타의 소니와 충돌하는 것을 볼 수 있었습니다.\n\n하지만 그 시절은 과거입니다. 야스다 추락으로 스즈키 정권이 붕괴된 후, 이부카는 후지쓰를 다시 한번 지배적인 위치로 끌어올렸습니다. 이제, 광둥의 무소불위의 권력자로서, 이부카 마사루는 마침내 새로운, 트랜지스터화된, 디지털화된 세계에 대한 그의 비전을 실현하는데 필요한 자유를 얻었습니다.\n\n더 이상 동료 경영진의 변덕에 구속되거나 도쿄 주주들에게 신세를 지지 않는, 이부카만이 미래를 볼 수 있고, 이부카만이 새로운 내일을 이끌어낼 수 있습니다. 광둥을 캔버스 삼은 그의 유일한 한계는 그의 야망 뿐이며, 이부카는 적당히 멈출 생각이 없습니다."

    # Minister LOC
    GNG_Matsuzawa_Takuji_hog_desc:0 "Chief Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LThe Representative Director of Yasuda Bank's Guangdong branch since 1959, Matzuawa Takuji runs the financial conglomerate's operations in Guangdong - which are but one part of a sprawling financial network that stretches from Tokyo to Calcutta. Yasuda's prominent position as the only one of the Big Four zaibatsu among the Four Companies means that Matsuzawa also serves as the de facto second-in-command of the civil government, the Chief Secretary, on top of his corporate duties.\n\nAfter a distinguished career in the Home Islands managing major corporate clients and the Ministry of Finance, Matsuzawa was rumored to be a prime candidate to join the board of directors, making his assignment to Guangdong a surprise - most so to Matsuzawa himself. Yasuda's recent turn towards breakneck overseas expansion (as encouraged by Prime Minister Ino's government) might partially explain things, but many still wonder as to the true reason why Matsuzawa was sidelined - and whether it simply reflects differences over business strategy, or something more.§!"
    GNG_Ibuka_Masaru_for_desc:0 "External Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LIbuka Masaru is known for two things - his towering command of electrical engineering, and his many, many 'opinions'. The former has served him well as the President of Fujitsu, the electronics subsidiary of the Furukawa zaibatsu, while the latter makes him an outspoken defender of the Four Companies' interests in Tokyo - and Nanjing, when he can be bothered to leave his workstation to venture into China.\n\nApart from his professional history, Ibuka is well-known for his longstanding feud with Morita Akio of Sony, after the two parted ways acrimoniously in 1952 following the acquisition of their joint venture, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering, by the Furukawa group. In the years since, Ibuka has tirelessly sought to realize his vision of a transistorized future, rising through the ranks at Fujitsu and aggressively expanding its presence in Guangdong - no matter what Morita or anyone else thinks.§!"
    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_eco_desc:0 "Financial Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LMatsushita Masaharu is the heir apparent to Matsushita Electric, invited by the esteemed Matsushita Konosuke to be his successor - and yet the two could hardly be more different. Where Konosuke is one of Japan's vanishingly rare self-made men, an elementary school dropout who cut his teeth selling electrical fans door-to-door in Osaka, Masaharu was born to the peerage, a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University and elite financier who took on the Matsushita name upon marrying into the family in 1940.\n\nWorldly, urbane, and refined, Matsushita took to his duties at Matsushita Electric with a grace and sophistication not out of place in Tokyo' s boardrooms - and befitting his role as Guangdong's Financial Secretary. But where most see a worthy heir to the Matsushita empire, the two Matsushitas are rumored to have grown apart - the elder increasingly critical of his heir's abilities, and the younger seeking to prove his twenty-year apprenticeship was not in vain.§!"
    GNG_Miyazaki_Kiyotaka_sec_desc:0 "Guangdong Police Force Commissioner\nCorporate Statism\n------------\n§LOne would be mistaken to see Colonel Miyazaki Kiyotaka as another enforcer of Japan's will in Guangdong, or a relic of Japan's past triumphs. Unlike the new IJA recruits rotated into the Three Pearls - or the ancient general officers sent out to pasture - Colonel Miyazaki is a twenty-year veteran of the China Campaign still in his prime. Starting as a non-commissioned Kenpeitai officer during WWII, Miyazaki has spent nearly all of his career on the Chinese mainland, hunting KMT remnants and dissidents in Manchukuo, the Republic of China, and now in Guangdong.\n\nTo the Chinese residents of Guangdong, he is an implacable predator, coming after those who test the patience of the police and the Japanese once too often. To the Japanese, he is a tireless defender of law and order, a swift and final arbiter for any problem too intractable to buy off. All know that Colonel Miyazaki is a dangerous man - a man with power, and almost limitless authority along with it.§!"

    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_Yasuda_hog_desc:0 "Chief Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LThe delicate politics of the Legislative Council and the Four Companies requires an exceptional skill at negotiating, and Matsushita is nothing if not a master of the art. When Matsushita, Ibuka, and Morita maneuvered their powerless colleague, Matsuzawa, into 'stepping in' as interim Chief Executive, it was abundantly clear that power would be principally in the hands of the three remaining tycoons.\n\nYet the management of power between multiple people is a tricky thing: Morita and Ibuka were already well known for their frequent and heated disagreements, and favoring either of them above the other could easily upend the delicate balance of power - and give Matsuzawa more power than he really ought to have. For the sake of peace between the Companies, Matsushita was the natural choice to serve as the Chief Secretary of Guangdong, a crucial - and not entirely unbiased - interlocutor between the Chief Executive and his peers.§!"
    GNG_Morita_Akio_Yasuda_for_desc:0 "External Secretary\nCorporate Paternalism\n------------\n§LEven as one of the heads of the Four Companies, Morita Akio and Sony had always been an outsider - comfortably outvoted by Yasuda, Matsushita, and Fujitsu combined. Yet, as Yasuda careens towards its dissolution and Chief Executive Suzuki abandons his post, Morita is one of three men standing between Guangdong and total chaos. It stood to reason that along with his new responsibilities, he would receive a title befitting his position.\n\nMorita knows full well there are ways to signal displeasure even amongst insiders: the External Secretary is a glorified PR position at the best of times, and an easy target for criticism in times of crisis. But even his small seat at the table gives him access to the Chief Executive - one who eyes the naked maneuvering of Matsushita and Ibuka as warily as Morita does. As for Morita - he is both the man with a plan, and a man who can be trusted, and he will not let this crisis go to waste.§!"
    GNG_Ibuka_Masaru_eco_desc:0 "Financial Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LAt first glance, the lateral movement of Ibuka Masaru from the External Affairs to the Financial Affairs portfolio is an unquestionable snub - the most outspoken opposition to the former Chief Executive, being forced to share power with his rivals. Yet Ibuka himself appears content with his position - in public. The new interim Chief Executive will be capably advised, he says, by the remaining tycoons in a strictly professional and meritocratic manner. There can be no playing favorites in the wake of Yasuda's collapse.\n\nOf course, his insistence on 'meritocracy' has long been understood as a favorite phrase of his, with only Ibuka himself up to the task of saving Guangdong. Even if Matsushita maintains the appearance of neutrality, and Morita tries to make himself heard, Ibuka controls the pursestrings - and the numbers never lie. Tough times will require tough choices, and only one man can make them: Ibuka.§!"

    GNG_Li_Ka_Shing_hog_desc:0 "Chief Secretary\nCorporate Paternalism\n------------\n§LA man of humble origins and means, Li Ka-Shing cuts an unlikely presence as Guangdong's only major tycoon of purely Chinese origins. Few would have guessed that the elementary school dropout and struggling factory owner would become the representative of the Chinese side of Guangdong's Zhujin community - and neither would have Li, were it not for a chance meeting with Morita Akio in 1952 that changed his life forever.\n\nAs the head of Cheung Kong Holdings - a sprawling local conglomerate with its fingers in retail, distribution, light manufacturing, and real estate - Li's commercial success has been intimately tied to Morita's rise in Guangdong. From business partners in the 1950's to their eventual formal alliance as Li diversified into new industries, it is an open secret in Guangdong that the two are political allies, with Li keeping tabs on the pulse of the Chinese and Zhujin population while Morita pitches their reform program to the Japanese expatriate community.§!"
    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_for_desc:0 "External Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LMatsushita is well aware of the value of keeping one's cards close to one's chest, for there is no benefit to the naked pursuit of power if one ends up empty-handed. As Morita maneuvered himself into pole position against Ibuka in the race to lead Guangdong in the aftermath of Yasuda's collapse, Matsushita ordered his men in the Legislative Council to throw their weight behind Morita's ascension - and was duly rewarded with the post of External Secretary.\n\nThere is no real closeness between Matsushita and Chief Executive Morita. Both men see each other as means to an end - an olive branch to the corporate loyalists in the Legislative Council for Morita, and as a guarantor of Matsushita's continued relevance for Matsushita. Power rewards winners, but it also rewards survivors - and as the Corporate faction's man on the inside, Matsushita has all the power he needs.§!"
    GNG_Stanley_Ho_eco_desc:0 "Financial Secretary\nCorporate Paternalism\n------------\n§LStanley Ho is a 'legitimate trader' of prodigious talent and of murky origins, a long acquaintance of Morita Akio and Li Ka-shing, and the darling of Guangdong society - to the extent that a part-Chinese, part-European man can climb in a world dominated by the Japanese. Born to Dutch Jewish and Chinese parents and initially destined for a bright future in British Hong Kong, Stanley was driven to Macau during WWII, and rebuilt his wealth by working - and then running - export-import businesses of luxuries (both legal and illegal) to Mainland China.\n\nAt first glance, a man of Stanley's background would be wholly unwelcome in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. And yet, the Japanese find themselves strangely open to his charms - whether it be by his cosmopolitan wit, his access to fine luxuries, his peerless manners on the dance floors of Makao, or the encouragement of some of his less legitimate 'partners' in the Triads.§!"
    GNG_Kan_Omori_sec_desc:0 "Guangdong Police Force Commissioner\nCorporate Paternalism\n------------\n§LAs Chief Executive Morita seeks to revamp the division of labor between the Guangdong Police Force and the Kenpeitai, it has become abundantly clear that new leadership is required at the top. Omori Kan - a senior Home Ministry bureaucrat with abundant experience in both police and military liaison positions in Japan - has been handpicked to lead a complete restructuring of the Guangdong Police after a lengthy selection process led by the Chief Executive himself.\n\nThe appointment of an outsider without extensive pre-existing ties in Guangdong has raised eyebrows in the Legislative Council and in Kenpeitai command, wary that the police will develop an autonomous streak. They are right to worry - and they will soon learn that Omori is not a man that can be bought easily, and a man to be ignored at their own peril.§!"

    GNG_Ibuka_Masaru_hog_desc:0 "Chief Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LAs Guangdong's Chief Secretary, Ibuka's appointment to the second-highest position in the civil government should represent a triumph - the reassertion of the Corporate faction's authority in the Legislative Council, with Matsushita at its head and with Ibuka by his side, and Hitachi's Komai waiting in the wings.\n\nWhile the dominance of the Corporate faction is a welcome development, only a fool would think Ibuka is satisfied by this arrangement. Despite having the Chief Executive's position slip through his fingertips, Ibuka has not abandoned his desire to see Guangdong become the vanguard of the silicon revolution to the world. To the extent by which he can bring said revolution about through the ear of Chief Executive Matsushita, he will do so - for although he has no love for menial minds in positions of power, he concedes that they do have their uses...§!"
    GNG_Morita_Akio_Matsushita_for_desc:0 "External Secretary\nCorporate Paternalism\n------------\n§LFor Morita Akio, being kept in the position of External Secretary under Chief Executive Matsushita is a consolation prize - an example of how he failed to seize his moment. With the Corporate faction once again outnumbering his and Li Ka-shing's State faction in the Legislative Council, Morita knows that once again, he is condemned to serve in the role of the eternal opposition.\n\nIt could be worse - he could have been shut out of the Chief Executive's cabinet, as was the case before Yasuda's fall. Morita wouldn't have been kept on without his being of some use - no doubt to serve as a counterweight to Ibuka Masaru of Fujitsu. So be it! Morita knows better than anyone how all-encompassing Ibuka's ambition is - and Matsushita will soon find that Morita is a far better confidante than Ibuka could ever be.§!"
    GNG_Yokoi_Hideki_eco_desc:0 "Financial Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LRugged industrialist. Vulture capitalist. Underhanded entrepreneur. Yokoi Hideki's reputation is as large as the portfolio of business interests he manages across the Sphere - acquired in lockstep with Japan's expansion across Asia. Building a fortune selling uniforms to the Japanese military during the Second World War, Yokoi leveraged his network of military contacts to purchase 'liberated' European real estate and investment properties in Asia at bargain prices - building a business empire from the loot and plunder of conquest.\n\nThough Yokoi takes great pain to appear respectable, he is often seen by Japan and Guangdong's business elite as unsophisticated new money. Few dare say so to his face, however, lest they end up receiving a visit from Yokoi's 'friends' in the Yakuza - and Yokoi understands that fear works as well as respect in almost every instance.§!"
    GNG_Tsuchida_Kuniyasu_sec_desc:0 "Guangdong Police Force Commissioner\nColonial Government\n------------\n§LTsuchida Kuniyasu, the new Commissioner of the Guangdong Police, has his work cut out for him. The Police are chronically underfunded, understaffed, and deeply corrupt - a state of decrepitude tacitly acknowledged under previous Chief Executives, who preferred to turn to the Kenpeitai as their instruments of blunt power.\n\nNow, as the Chief Executive [GetLeader] reasserts their authority in Guangdong, they turn to Commissioner Tsuchida to get the ball rolling. A competent enforcer and administrator in his own right, Tsuchida brings familiarity with both Guangdong's way of doing business and the key figures of the Corporate elite - a man who can be trusted to clean up the police and to do things their way, without being beholden to the IJA or the Kenpeitai. Guangdong shall be brought to order under law and copyright, and Tsuchida is intimately familiar with both.§!"

    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_Ibuka_hog_desc:0 "Chief Secretary\nCorporatocracy\n------------\n§LThe Corporate faction in the Legislative Council is ascendant, and Matsushita Masaharu helps lead the charge as the second-in-command in Ibuka's Guangdong. A distant second-in-command, as it were: a visionary as driven as Ibuka is loath to surrender control of his project even temporarily, and Matsushita finds himself operating almost purely in an administrative role, managing the minutiae of power in Ibuka's name.\n\nIf Matsushita is unhappy with this arrangement, he scarcely shows it. Ibuka's radical ideas have fostered incredible opposition in the Legislative Council, and Matsushita is not so wedded to Ibuka's vision to tie himself to the mast. Matsushita will grow so long as the Corporate faction remains in power - and for Matsushita, that is an acceptable, if suboptimal, outcome...§!"
    GNG_Komai_Kenichiro_for_desc:0 "External Secretary\nReform Bureaucracy\n------------\n§LPlenty question why Hitachi's Komai Kenichiro, only recently invited into the Legislative Council, was selected to be the external face of Ibuka's regime. Komai was already seen as an outsider, seen as an agent of Manchuria's state-dominated economy in the freewheeling corporate ecosystem of Guangdong. Would being forced to defend Guangdong to outsiders separate Komai from his masters in Hsinking?\n\nThe truth is that Ibuka doesn't trust Komai one bit - but he would rather keep any potential assets close at hand. It would certainly be better than bringing his nemesis, Morita Akio, into Guangdong's government once again - and Komai's emphasis on efficiency and profit is a thought process Ibuka understands, even if it comes with a particularly Manchurian brand of brutality.§!"

With a majority Chinese population ruled by a small class of Japanese expatriates, and a small (but growing) group of Cantonese-Japanese residents after over a decade of colonial rule, the people of Guangdong have little attachment to Guangdong as a political concept - but neither are they keen to bow to the will of Nanjing or Tokyo.\n\nGuangdong is caught between two worlds, born of two cultures and accepted by neither. Only time will tell what Guangdong becomes, even as China and Japan go their separate ways."

In Kōshu itself, as Yasuda's stake in Guangdong and the LegCo is destroyed and the company falls to pieces, opportunists circle like so many sharks in search of blood in the water.\n\nIt is a time of terrible upheaval and confusion for everyone from Suzuki Teiichi in his gilded offices to the common worker in the streets of Honkon or Makao or Kōshu.
