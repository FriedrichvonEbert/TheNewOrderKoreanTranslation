 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_TURDAKUN_USUBALIEV_DESC: "Born in 1919 to Kyrgyz peasants, Turdakun Usubalievich Usubaliev was an early convert to the communist cause - though the future he may have once imagined following his graduation from the Kyrgyz National Institute in 1941 came crashing down as the Germans destroyed the USSR and left the peoples of Central Asia to pick up the pieces wherever they fell.\n\nClearly there had been some fault in communism as it was. Just as clearly, however, it was not all bad - after all, it had granted him, the son of dirt-poor peasants, opportunities of education, employment, and social advancement that nothing else could have. Its main failing, then, was clearly its refusal to acknowledge the power of religion as a unifying force - and this is not a mistake Turdakun would repeat again. To unite the Kyrgyz people once more, what would be needed is not merely repeating the promises of the past, but to use that which has bonded them together for centuries, and which could help in obtaining support from far beyond the seas.\n\nWith this ideal was born the Islamic State of Talas, governed along the lines of orthodox socialism with strong religious aspects present in all parts of the government, led by Turdakun holding together this eclectic mixture of ideas - for the benefit of all the Kyrgyz people, of course."
 POLITICS_KALIYNUR_USENBEKOV_DESC: "The tumultuous decades have left their mark everywhere. On Kyrgyzstan, on its people, and most visibly, on the Chairman himself. Born in what was, at the time, the Turkestan Soviet, Kaliynur was raised to embody the ideal of the Kyrgyz man, and being raised on tales of the Tsar's caprice and the cruelty of his bandit-governors, he also grew into the ideal picture of the Marxist-Leninist man as well, and joined in the Red Army to defend his land, his people, and all other lands and peoples.\n\nBut eventually, the Union itself was defeated, and Kaliynur had no choice except to return to his fatherland with his comrades. Hoping to recover and recuperate from the devastating defeat in Russia, he and his allies instead only found more conflict. War had broken out between neighboring Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and the Tajiks were taking the worst of it. Kaliynur marched with the Red Army of the Kyrgyz People and fought valiantly, before eventually falling into the hands of a particularly cruel Afghan general. His left eye would be left behind in that cold, Afghan prison.\n\nRescue from this plight would not come by liberating army, but by the heroics of a single man, Turdakun Usubaliev. Hand in hand with Turdakun, Kaliynur returned to Kyrgyzstan a hero of two lost wars, and has since found his victories in the political arena instead. With the Kyrgyz people at his side, he looks to pave the way for a rejuvenated Central Asia."
