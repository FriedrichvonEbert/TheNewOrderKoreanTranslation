Whether we like it or not, the country would be damned if we continued to wedge a divide, as it will only serve to promote more outrage and disunity, even if taking action has been our greatest weapon in our successes. Thus, in our knowledge in the impossibility of America's success without even a crumb of stability, we must roll back some of our more outlandish statements regarding our policies of segregation. Although our support base will become more confused over the official they voted for, like hell would we allow the nation to break apart more than it already has and stop any process of healing. Besides, no matter what, we will continue to stand up for the states' rights against the federal government, even if we have to smother some of the flames."

Now it's time for Wallace to make good on his promise to the American people, he is about to undo the terrible damage that Johnson, Kennedy, Nixon, King, and all these domestic \"civil rights\" terrorists have done to the American way of life.\n\nPresident Wallace will start drafting the American National Traditions Reservation Act. This act will repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1962, as well as provide timetables and procedures for Southern states to begin re-segregating and, if we have chosen such a path, for Northern states to introduce segregation. We will also implement full segregation in federal institutions and push towards segregation in the armed forces. It will also give police departments a broad range of powers to enforce segregation.

Sadly, this fruitful relationship never fully recovered from the Great Depression, and the Second World War put to rest any hopes that it may be revisited in the near future.\n\nOne near future later, and things are starting to look up. We now have the means to reassert our position in Central America for the first time in thirty years. Our leverage may have atrophied, but we still have contacts to visit, old favors to call. Tell the State Department to spread the word far and wide: America's coming back for its bananas, and this time we're here to stay."

 USA_wal64_the_banana_republics_desc:0 "One of the most basic principles any businessman worth his salt follows is to \"buy low and sell high\". The more dollars you earn with every dollar you spend, the better. Raw materials have the benefit of being easy enough to extract with unskilled labor, while at the same time in high enough demand to command hundreds of dollars per unit in the world market. This is why some countries base their entire economies on one such resource and become tremendously wealthy in doing so -- be it with oil, gold, diamonds, or in Central America's case, bananas.\n\nBy signing trade agreements with the region's \"banana republics\", our businessmen can gain access to the fruit at bargain prices and sell them to a market willing to pay much, much higher for them. They get steep profits, Americans get delicious bananas, the local caudillos get revenue with which to buy more farmland and plant more bananas, and the federal government gets hefty sums of cash from the taxes pegged to every transaction throughout the whole chain -- a win-win scenario for everyone involved, in other words."

Such measures will have the twofold effects of multiplying production by orders of magnitude within the next ten years and granting Americans to a much larger share thereof.\"\n\nBeneath the polite, technical language, however, the message was clear: America's largest fruit companies have heard about our plans for Central America, and they want in -- preferably with federal aid money to buy off the farmland for themselves. Lucky for them, corporate cooperation is exactly what we need."

From there they are loaded in crates to massive, freshly-painted cargo ships, which then deliver the beans to coffee shops and stores the world over.\n\nIn the decades since its introduction, coffee has arguably grown to occupy a special place in the American lifestyle. Much like the Englishman and his tea, many Americans drink coffee as part of a daily ritual, one which they can arguably no longer live without. It can hardly be denied that normal business would grind to a halt in the absence of coffee; thus, it's important that we gain as much control over its sources as we can.\n\nIf that means nabbing half a country's economy from under its nose, then so be it."

A few severed heads express mailed to the company's headquarters later, and United Fruit left the country in disgrace.\n\nNow that we've decided to allocate more resources towards expanding our influence in Central America, United Fruit claimed they can participate a little more directly in bringing Guatemala back to the fold.

Thus, we must seek to employ the most middle-driven answer possible to be found: we will not take direct action to enforce segregation within our school systems, nor will we give up on our efforts. We will stay true to our words, and give the states the rights they want by allowing them to decide upon the issue of segregation of the states' education system themselves.

They're getting their Medicare, they're getting their Social Security, but they're getting those bills exactly the way President Wallace wants 'em written!\n\nPresident Wallace will make clear that this is his party by being the main champion of Social Security and Medicare. The NPP-FR will take center stage in policy advocacy and spread its own Dixiecrat message across the country in the process. The nation will see these bills as classic, down home Southern mutual aid just like the Kingfish proposed back in the day. This may alienate the Center, but can rally new voters from coast to coast to the Far-Right bloc."

 USA_wal64_segregated_security_desc:0 "Social Security isn't just for retirees, it also includes unemployment benefits as well. Therein lies a problem. The Southern economy thrives on dirt cheap labor performed by Black hands. Millions of Blacks perform farm labor or domestic help for a pittance because they have no other options to feed themselves, especially if they lost their jobs elsewhere. But providing them with unemployment benefits and old age pensions could leave them with enough money to refuse taking low-wage agricultural and domestic work. This could throw the fragile Southern social and economic system into disarray. Thurmond wants us to guarantee that won't happen, and we have just the plan.\n\nWe will exclude farm workers and domestic laborers from Social Security coverage. No work they perform shall entitle them to unemployment benefits or old age pensions, so they will have no freedom to quit their job on a whim and look for better ones. This will de facto segregate Social Security, since the overwhelming majority of those workers are Black. It'll shore up support among our Dixiecrat base, but horrify the Progressive wing of the party.\n\n§RThurmond is adamantly opposed to any social welfare programs that could threaten Southern domestic institutions, and will take as many votes as he can from us if we don't placate him.§!"

By explaining its effects of getting the elderly to retire, he will show that it will enable more youth to enter the workforce and make enough money to drive consumer spending. With our entire bloc behind us, passing the bill should be easy peasy."

Wallace hardly needs to assure them that they have nothing to fear.\n\nWe will add clauses to the Medicare law exempting retirees who were previously domestic and agricultural laborers from coverage. As these professions are overwhelmingly Black, this will dramatically reduce the number of Black patients hospitals could conceivably see, and also serve to keep those individuals in the cheap workforce.\n\n§RThurmond is adamantly opposed to any social welfare programs that could threaten Southern domestic institutions, and will take as many votes as he can from us if we don't placate him.§!"

He has invited the negro citizens of the South to work with us from their separate racial station, as we will work with them, to develop and grow in individual freedom and enrichment. This is the basic heritage of Wallace's religion, of which he makes full practice, for we are all the handiwork of God.\n\nPresident Wallace has come home, not to burn the South to the ground as the Yankees did, but to bring the true jubilee; he has come to usher in a new era of prosperity and restore its antebellum glory.

According to an internal poll, a full third of AFL-CIO members supported President Wallace in the last election, and their numbers are only growing. President Wallace is going to use the new Job Corps program to seize the moment and bolster his support base among unions. He will put out a new ad for the program in which he meets with ordinary workers, including ones recently employed thanks to the JOBS Act, and tell them he's the best friend that a union man ever had.

None could have predicted the extraordinary circumstances which ultimately lead him to the Oval Office.\n\nBorn to wealthy and landed Southern gentry, Thurmond quickly developed a keen political acumen. His legal education, stellar military service, and extensive connections led him to become Governor and later a Senator of South Carolina. Staunchly segregationist, he led the exodus of Southern senators from the Democratic Party in the wake of Brown v Board. As a leader of George Patton's Patriot Party, he successfully arranged the merger with the National Progressive Front and founded the modern National Progressive Party in 1957. Despite failing to win the Presidential election of 1960, he remained a major political leader and was President Pro Tempore of the Senate when Bobby Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey were assassinated.\n\nFor reasons still unknown, the Speaker of the House refused the office of the Presidency, and the line of succession fell on President Thurmond. His long-held ambitions on the White House having finally been realized, Thurmond presides over a nation in turmoil. While he has pledged to uphold the late President Kennedy's legacy, many fear he is plotting to destroy everything the progressive president stood for in order to remake America in his twisted, white supremacist image.\n\nWith the clock ticking down to the next election, the King takes his place on the board and begins his moves."

As the nation mourned their lost president, President Thurmond found himself quietly meeting with the party upper crust to handle the formal matters of his succession. Meeting after meeting saw terse discussion between himself and the wary remnants of Bobby's coalition, who saw him as a threat to everything the young Kennedy had worked for.\n\nIf he was to accomplish anything, Thurmond realized, these idealists would all have to go.\n\nFirst he would need a Vice President to serve at his side. A brief assessment of candidates would provide him the obvious answer. Maxwell Taylor, distinguished former air force martial, dignified military advisor to the US government for at least a decade and, most crucially of all, a notorious rubber stamp and yes man to whoever was in charge. Thurmond saw two excellent qualities in Taylor - he was apolitical enough to avoid disgusting Bobby's old clique, and servile enough to do whatever the hell he wanted him to. Plus his military background would no doubt appeal to the patriots.\n\nWrangling the party to accept his choice would prove a lot easier than he expected. The men of Washington were so desperate for stability in such strange and shocking times, that his choice was quickly approved and confirmed by all relevant committees. With Vice President Taylor now at his side, ready to do whatever needed to be done to set America back on track, Thurmond gazed with confidence towards the rest of the struggle to come."

By the end, much had been laid out, but so much more remained to be done.\n\nThe government's hurried acceptance of his Vice President pick had made Thurmond realize the window of opportunity he had, and Russell advised him to take full advantage of it. While the NPP were still reeling from the assassination and the country remained numb, they were far more likely to accept his ambitions in the interests of regaining some legitimacy and normalcy. They would need to act fast, but the rewards for success would be great.\n\nThurmond tasked Russell with the job of gathering their allied lawmakers together to get the necessary bills drafted, and quickly. When all was written up, they would take the floor and pass each and every one of them, one after the other in a lightning round of politics. The party could be corralled to vote for them, and the Republican-Democrats were split enough that a few bipartisan votes could also be earned from more conservative seats."

Denouncing the historically fractured nature of the NPP, he has declared that under his command, the party would move forward with one clear, decisive and \"American\" agenda. His remarks were met with enthusiastic acclaim by his fellow Right associates.\n\nFrom the sidelines, the Center looked on with steadily growing dread.

Naturally, this would no longer be a cabinet of idealists and supporters of government overreach like under President Kennedy, but a group committed to restoring dignity to the people of America.\n\nFirst on the agenda would be choosing his Secretary of State. Two candidates had distinguished themselves for the position. The first of these was the Senator for Arkansas, J. William Fulbright. Fulbright was an interesting individual; while he was a committed segregationist, he held a wide range of stances on various issues from across the political spectrum, and had seen eye-to-eye with the Republican-Democrats and the Center on many occasions. While perhaps not the most effective of choices, his potential for compromise could help soothe the other factions within the Senate and provide legitimacy for Thurmond's new government.\n\nThe second choice was Spiro Agnew. A capable and dedicated political operative, Agnew was more mild in his opinions on the segregation issue than Fulbright, but he could prove a valuable asset on account of his commitment and dedication to the American government. He was what some would call \"loyal\" and others would call \"a yesman,\" but regardless of perspective it was assured that he would follow President Thurmond's decree to the letter.\n\nBoth men would be beneficial to Thurmond in different ways, but only one could fill the role of Secretary of State.

Given the tensions that would undoubtedly arise from the more troublesome areas of society as a result of Thurmond's plans, a greater focus on security would not be remiss.\n\nAlternatively, there was Mendel Rivers. A representative of South Carolina since the War, Rivers is the epitome of an NPP Hawk. His fervent support of American military escalation in South Africa and his repeated calls for direct action against Japan had earned him the nickname \"The Granddaddy of the War Hawks,\" a name he wore with great pride.

Long is a man of strong political pedigree. The son of the so-called \"Kingfish\" Huey Long, and himself an accomplished Senator of Louisiana for many years, Long was a big proponent of government spending to improve the plight of the working poor, the elderly and the disabled. While not going so far as his father's more radical policies, Long fiercely believed that the plight of the less fortunate was the government's responsibility. While perhaps not the most economically viable option long term, he would only be necessary until the completion of Thurmond's crusade, and he would provide a much needed buffer of support from those he represented. With this final selection, the cabinet would be complete. A cabinet dominated by those loyal (or at least useful) to Thurmond's cause. Finally, the work could begin."

Decrying Thurmond's \"hijacking\" of the NPP with \"race haters\" and \"sycophants,\" the many angry voices of those aligned against him would cycle through the news cycle, spreading slowly and insidiously.\nMany of the protestors looked to the remaining progressives within the NPP for reassurance, hoping that they might frustrate the president's plans. More worryingly, some began to speak up in support of some of the most extreme factions within the Left wing of the party, believing that only their radical proposals could \"expunge\" segregationist thought from the nation for good. It would seem that Thurmond's scheming had not just united his opponents against him, but also disillusioned them with the rest of mainstream politics.\nSomething would need to be done to take back control of the narrative, or else the dissent would only continue to grow."

A greatness born of tried and true American tradition, justice and dignity that may have wavered over the years, but now can be reborn anew. So let us put aside our scuffles, and work united to move past this awful tragedy together.\"\n\nToday, President Thurmond addressed the nation to appeal for calm in the midst of continued anxiety over the assassination and consternation over his radical shift of the government. Though his speech failed to calm down his more vocal opponents, many polls suggest that his speech was met with approval by much of the general public. Some have come to see the president as a paternal figure attempting to steer America out of an impossible position, and that his more questionable actions are simply necessary measures to stabilize the country in a time when stability is needed the most."

Several proposals have been drawn up, but the committees are awaiting the word of the President to bring forth their ideas. The necessary commemorations and constructions would be costly, but it would assuredly help soothe the nation and grant President Kennedy a dignified rest.\n\nCertain members of Thurmond's coalition have suggested instead a refrain from honoring him altogether, as this might be seen as an endorsement of his... disagreeable policies. It would certainly save time and money and keep opponents of Kennedy on board, but it would be guaranteed to be seen as a grave act of disrespect that may inflame the already bitter tensions emerged in the wake of Thurmond's ascension.\n\nThe decision lies with the President."

With many of the old civil rights forces and party activists out on the streets in fear of what more Thurmond would do, America had seemingly begun to pick at the scabs of what was once a settled conflict.\n\nIn the areas of the deprived and the intellectuals and the radicals, some would call the discarding of Kennedy's legacy the final proof of America's \"hypocrisy\". Ultimate evidence that there would never be true change as long as reactionary forces cling to the American government and drag the nation backwards. In their eyes, the only way to truly bring about an America for all would be to push for an entirely new form of politics.\n\nIn the halls of the Senate, the most radical of President Kennedy's allies would meet to discuss the swing in public opinion.

The exact specifics of the memorial are yet to be determined - it could be a library, a statue like Lincoln's, perhaps some modern art - but the costings have been set out by party financiers. While expensive, it would hardly break the bank, and would be a more than suitable farewell to Bobby and his legacy.\n\nA proposal from some of the more starry-eyed members of Kennedy's old clique has come forward suggesting that a day be set aside as a national holiday in commemoration of his life and death. Though Thurmond's own circle have scoffed at such a seemingly excessive and most certainly more expensive measure, a grand gesture of remembrance could be exactly what is needed to unite a country still reeling from Kennedy's death.\n\nAlternatively, the whole endeavor could just be forgotten about.

Before the press had time to respond, the papers had already cleared the House. A few days trapped in committees allowed the rumor mill to build. Surely it wouldn't go through? Surely the remnants of the Center and the other progressive factions would kill it before it got to Thurmond's desk?\n\nWhen it passed by the slimmest of margins in the Senate through the heavy-handed wrangling of Thurmond's coalition of segregationist old guard, there was a brief hour of utter silence. And then the wounds of the civil rights era tore open anew, and the cascade of blood and hate and violence flooded the streets yet again.\n\nIn the South, jubilant segregationists ran black residents out of their homes, jeering and beating them wherever they could be caught. Across the Black Belt, cars burned and shop windows shattered as a people finally considered human now found themselves cast in the role of lessers once more.

In the interests of party unity, in memory of President Kennedy and in the name of bringing stability back to America, Thurmond vowed that he would leave the Act in place. His speech concluded to the relieved applause of the Center-NPP and the stunned silence of many on the Right.\n\nAfter a long day of discussions on party conduct and other rather constructive matters, in which Thurmond won many of the Far-Right back with various promises to push forward some of their other agendas, the party emerged from their meeting more united than they had been in a long time.

Short of an unparalleled seismic shift in American politics, the affected states would be guaranteed NPP fiefdoms for the next decade or two at least.\n\nThroughout the affected states, the newly disenfranchised voters marched en masse. Many of the marchers were black, but now they were also joined by a contingent of white Democrat voters who shared their disgust at the blatant manipulation. The marches were bitter and marred with clashes against those who considered the new order most beneficial, but many of them were able to make their voices heard. Many were locals, some were just passing through. Some were from the fringes of the old Center, now emerging into the mainstream to seize the momentum against the damnable elite.\n\nIn Washington, President Thurmond and his chief advisors raised a glass and a cheer to the continued stability of the National Progressive Party."

What would history think of him? What would they think of these, admittedly, blatantly un-American actions he had taken since day one to get to where he was now. He already caught a glimpse of it, as he glanced out of the window at the masses of protestors beyond the White House fences. The thought did momentarily disquiet him...\n\nAnd it soon passed. His heart hardened. His anger flared at those lowlifes outside, protesting against the authority of states and the values that America had been founded upon. What did they know? Idealistic simpletons such as themselves were half the reason he had to do any of this in the first place, to undo years of government overreach in the name of blind progress. What he was doing was un-American, yes, but he was doing it specifically to save America!\n\nNo. Everything he was doing was good. Everything he was doing was righteous.

In these difficult times, he needed judges who would... see things from his point of view. Officially, this was within his power to make sure of, but the precedent, well, that was a dangerous matter.\n\nGetting enough judges on the Supreme Court bench would require one of two possibilities. Either enough seats were given up, or he would make new seats and fill them. Freeing up seats would naturally require that those currently occupying those seats vacate them, and making sure they would be willing to retire so early would require some very underhanded tactics indeed. On the other hand, packing the court was an equally unscrupulous and far more overt measure that was certain to kick the American hornets' nest even harder.\n\nYet at this point, it hardly mattered. He had already come this far, and the restoration of American values was so close at hand. All it would take was shuffling a few chairs around, either way."

The Republicans in particular were furious, calling it an unforgivable and blatant act of tyranny, and the floor was not silent for several hours as insults and accusations were traded between the parties and even within them. On the other hand, the Democrats were notably ambivalent on the matter, and their apparent lack of scruples with the bill did not escape President Thurmond's eye. With the NPP in lockstep behind his bullrush to the finish, the Democrats' support could be key.\n\nEven with some heavy handed tactics, support for the bill in the Senate is low enough that without the support of the Democrats, it is very unlikely to pass. Getting them on board would be crucial to passing the bill... at least, through the usual means. As per the constitution, the President has the power to force the bill through as an executive order. However, given the current situation of American politics and its frequent description as a \"powder keg,\" using such forceful measures at this time could have dire consequences."

While not entirely convinced of the bill and somewhat nervous about the implications, various Democrats expressed a willingness to get in bed with Thurmond in exchange for a few riders being added to the bill. They expressed tepid support for our push for conservative values, though they desired a means of cushioning the blow to their reputation from supporting dubiously moral actions. Namely, they desire the inclusion of support for their home states in the form of increased benefits for the unemployed and more state pensions.\n\nFor such a reasonable price, though perhaps a touch out of place on a security bill, the Democrats support can be all but secured. Of course, it's not certain if it will be enough. The Republicans are all but certain to vote unanimously against the bill, and though the party has corralled the remainder of the Center into supporting Thurmond, there is a possibility that someone might do something drastic.\n\n...of course, there is still the option of signing an executive order and doing away with the uncertainty.

The diversity of the Supreme Court had kept one party from gaining overwhelming influence over the last two centuries; our judicial system was above all else. However, our great system has been growing rather degenerate under the previous Presidents. The preceding justices ruled against us far too many times, they showed an outright prejudice against the American way of life. Anyone with a sane mind could tell that our Supreme Court was turning sour, even impure. If our current justices had the option, they would sell our country immediately to the socialists and Fascists, and we just can't have these people holding office. This will change beginning today with our President Thurmond's most recent executive order.\n\nThe order passes four seats in the Supreme Court to Conservative Southern lawyers. The old justices were often indecisive and thus ineffective. Our new Supreme Court will be unified and its rulings shall be such. This will be part of a great reformation taking place in the great United States. Our people may not like the new judicial system at first, but they'll get used to it eventually; we need to instill Conservative values into every heart, every mind until we are unified as a nation.

A major problem.\n\nWhile they expressed a similar desire to consider their options, chatter was picked up by agents after the meeting that while they intend to retreat from public life, they are mortified by what they see as the \"blatant corruption and blackmail\" of the Thurmond government.

The Supreme Court, in one fell swoop, had been transformed into a bastion of conservative law, and thanks to the comparably young age of the selected judges, it was likely to remain that way for a considerably long time.\n\nThe increasingly meek remnants of the Center cried foul, insisting some foul play was at hand. The Left didn't even try to hold back, with one Congressman having to be dragged from the hall outright accusing the President of treason. Their protestations fell on deaf ears, however.

 lemay.1.desc:0 "Curtis LeMay, known affectionately among his men during his Air Force days as \"Big Cigar\", took his seat behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office and wondered absently how long it would be before someone burst into the room to tell him it was all just a big joke. Shit, when Wallace had approached him to ask him to be his running mate he'd never thought the old bastard would actually get elected, and never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined himself taking the oath in Wallace's place.\n\nWallace had left the party in a unenviably weak position, with the factions threatening to rip the NPP in two as the RDs nipped at their heels and chaos enveloped the nation as a result of Wallace's less advisable decisions. The Republican-Democrats were a bunch of weak-ass limp-wristed pansies that couldn't be trusted to protect America from the depredations of her enemies, and the firebrands in the NPP would rather set the country on fire than work together. LeMay knew it was up to him to bring America down from a boil to a simmer and ensure the NPP was able to stand united at the next election. The RDs could not be allowed to take control, and neither could the factionalists be permitted to tear the party apart.\n\nTrue to form, President LeMay struck a match and lit himself a fine Cuban cigar to puff on as he hollered for one of his aides to make him a gin and tonic. He leaned back in his chair and blew smoke rings at the ceiling. He'd never asked to be President, or even really wanted it, but being the leader of the free world was sure to have its perks. LeMay smirked, and decided that if he was going to spend the next few years in the White House he might as well try and make the most of it."

He'd taken it about as well as he would've taken a slap to the face. The President took a puff and blew the smoke out of the corner of his mouth, his eyes never leaving Harrington's own.\n\n\"Listen Mike,\" and Harrington darkened at his overly-familiar tone, \"I ain't Wallace but I sure as shit ain't a goddamn bleeding-heart sissy none neither. If people want something in this country they can damn well work for it, I ain't in the habit of giving handouts, and it'll be a cold damn day in hell before I compromise with the Krauts or the fuckin' Nips.\"\n\nHarrington composed himself and, with the utmost care, began again. \"Mr. President, I understand wanting to be tou-\"\n\nAnd that was as far as he got before LeMay took the cigar out of his mouth, leaned his paunch over the desk, and belted back, \"Goddamn right I want to be tough on the ingrates and the malcontents and the fuckin' fascists! I got nothin' more to say on the topic.\"\n\nHis face twisted in disgust, Harrington rose from his chair. \"I'm not going to sit here and take this disrespect. You're a disgrace to the Presidency and you only sit in that chair because your predecessor was worse than you. You've not heard the last of this.\" He coldly turned and strode for the door.\n\nPresident LeMay took another drag on his cigar and wheezed with laughter as Harrington made his way out. \"Tell your buddies not to get too comfy, Mike!

LeMay said nothing, refusing to break eye contact with the man sitting opposite. Goldwater, to his credit, did not seem perturbed. He crossed one leg over the other and looked LeMay in the eye.\n\n\"Did you ask me here just to stare at me, Mr. President?\" he asked sardonically, taking another sip. He smiled, but his eyes were cold. LeMay frowned. They actually had a fair bit in common politically, the President reflected, but the Democrats were a far cry from the strong, uncompromising leadership America needed. Goldwater needed to be put in his place before he got too big for his britches.\n\nLeMay and Goldwater sparred back and forth for a while, each man trying to put himself on better footing than the other. To the aides cowering along the walls, it was like watching a particularly furious tennis match between where the players were both affecting a cool aura while also whacking the ball with every ounce of fury their bodies could summon.\n\nFinally, they got to the crux of the issue. \"I'm running this show, Barry,\" growled the President, \"Not you. Me. You might be a bigshot next to them swishes in the Rep-Dems but your mincing don't impress me none. I got no intention of kowtowing to you just to get a few more votes and that's the long and short of it. If you stand in my way you'll find out damn quick why they call me Bomber LeMay.\"\n\nGoldwater jerked the corner of his mouth up in a joyless imitation of a smile and finished his drink. \"That's what they call you, is it? Well,\" he said, betraying no emotion, \"I guess we're done here.\"\n\nAfter Goldwater had left, LeMay sat quietly for a time. Goldwater was patently a dangerous man, maybe the only one with any teeth in the whole of the goddamn RDs. Without a doubt, he was one to watch, lest he wake up one morning to find a knife in his back."

Don't think I'm gonna take this shit just 'cus I ain't been sitting on my ass in Congress collecting moss for the last twenty years!

Why'd they all have to be so goddamn difficult? His men in Congress, who by all rights should be following his commands, preferred to forget that he was now the President, even if all the chairs in the White House were still warm from Wallace's ass. A fair few of the bastards thought that a change of President meant they could do whatever the hell took their fancy, an idea he was having to forcibly dissuade them of, one by one.\n\nThe people of America had elected Wallace and LeMay because they wanted certain policies to be enacted, and it would be patently undemocratic to do anything other than to continue following the policies Wallace began before his unfortunate exit from the sphere of politics. Christ, most of these men wouldn't even be in Congress if it weren't for Wallace, and now bastards like this twinkle-toes Whip were vacillating about instituting tougher immigration quotas.\n\nFuck 'em, thought the President.

 lemay.5.desc:0 "Mr. President, I know you are a busy man with the whole running a country thing, but there is something I have to bring to your attention: integrating schools in the South. I know, I know, it's a can of worms, and no matter what you do, there will be a bunch of people who aren't happy. Either pro-civil rights guys will call you a segregationist toady if you don't immediately make everyone equal, and the states rights folks will call you a fascist for stepping on the toes of their constitutional prerogative.\n\nHowever, the folks at the Department of Education and the Department of Justice have come up with a way to get around it: Integration quotas. By \"encouraging\" states to make a percentage of class rosters have a minimum number of another race, we will be taking the first steps to integrating the schools. It doesn't have to be high, like five or ten percent, but enough to start the process rolling.\n\nYes, there will be ways school will try to get around this. They can try to make a whole class of just blacks that are kept in a closet or something. But we will have some inspections and regulations to ensure that each class from kindergarten to Grade 12 have at least one black student. Schools that disobey the rules will be fined and could lead to further inspections.\n\nYes, I know. They will get their way around it. But, if we start with a small number of students, then over time we can increase it, resistance will break down, and eventually Southern schools will be fully integrated. The only decision we have to make now, Mr. President, is how big of an initial quota do you want to put in place?"

These schools must consist of at least 5% Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or any other racial minority population living in the state. Failure to comply with the order will result in action taken by the federal government along with the state government.\"\n\nThese words reached newspapers across the country, but they resonated most with the desegregationists reading. Immediately, leading desegregationists complained that President LeMay \"set the bar way too low\" and believed \"the South would never fully integrate at this rate\". Even other NPP politicians, mostly left-wing, denounced LeMay for his less-than-exceptional public school policy. Facing pressure on many different sides, the President must now decide the best path for proceeding with integration: keep Southern states content with the current integration policy, or favor the desegregationists by raising the percentage of minorities that will be admitted."

It hasn't been easy, as we are trying to push some of the most stubborn people on this planet to do something they don't want, which in this case is treating African-Americans and Hispanics the same as white folks.\n\nThe quotas that we established are fairly low, as we believed that by easing our way to desegregation, by showing the south that it won't be the end of the world. While some liberals are claiming we are moving too slowly, and many conservatives are outraged that we are interfering in states rights, I think we can be confident that we must be doing the moderate and right thing since everyone hates us.\n\nInspections are still being undertaken, and show that, for the most part, integration is taking place. There are reports of white students bullying and assaulting their new black counterparts, as well as stories of teachers neglecting their new charges, but overall, it is going forward, and the majority of black students are seeing higher test scores and better results than when they were in all black schools. So I think we are on the right course, Mr. President."

For a fleeting instant he fantasized about resigning like Nixon, but he squashed that notion like a bug. If he went down that path, a dark cloud would follow him around for the rest of his life. At least in the White House he had a chance to bring Wallace's worst excesses to a screeching halt and make sure those milquetoast pussies in the RDs didn't sway the nation to their side by the next election. Who knows, he thought, smiling disbelievingly, maybe he could even do something to make America a better place.\n\nGoddamn it all, he was having a hell of a job trying to convince the Republicans and the Center faction that he wasn't the second coming of Wallace. He'd managed to get his foot in the door, but they were pushing back just as hard, and he knew he had to get them on his side if he was going to exert any leadership at all over Congress.

As such, it was hard for him to accept the beating he was getting from the rising star of the NPP's Far Right faction, Margaret Chase Smith.\n\nA woman? Talking back not just to a man, but to the goddamn President of the United States? Unheard of. And yet, despite his initial misgivings at Smith's acid tongue and refusal to cower to his usual array of domination tactics, he found himself growing more fond of her with every passing minute. She may have been a broad, but damn it all, she had a heart of the coldest iron. Hell, she had more balls than all the limp-wristed Jap-loving queers in the Republican-Democrats put together!\n\nAnd so as he sat there puffing away at a fine Cuban cigar, gin and tonic in hand, he reflected that if she'd stood up to the excesses of McCarthy it was foolish to think she wouldn't stand up to him. Besides, he could use an ironclad like her on his side, and she'd be in a better place to seize the nomination with him in her corner.\n\nIn her grating Maine accent, Smith was laying out her plan to mend the rift within the NPP and heal the wounds of Wallace's worst extremes. \"Mr. President, this is the time for moderation. If we don't unify the party, we'll get buried at the next election. After Wallace, the people need stability, and they're looking to the RDs. If we don't get them to swing back our way soon we can say goodbye to our brief time in the sun.\" And you can say goodbye to the White House, thought LeMay.\n\nShe gave him a look of stern appraisal, and he realized she was waiting for his response.

After the first few Congressmen yelling in his ear, LeMay had calmly left the phone off the hook and ordered that no visitors be admitted. Feeling completely and totally at peace, he sipped at a gin and tonic, for once without his customary cigar.\n\nLeMay wondered how many great reforms had been stopped in their tracks because it might have hurt at the ballot box. Most Presidents spent their years in the White House choked with the fear of losing re-election, but LeMay was not most Presidents. Having no desire to stand for the nomination, LeMay felt he was in the perfect place to push through some of the reforms America desperately needed after Wallace's abuses of power, chief among those the long-belated Civil Rights Act.\n\nOf course, he'd known there'd be blowback. Most of those who had voted for him on Wallace's ticket had done so to prevent the advancement of civil rights, and keep segregation going indefinitely. Now, however, the President was beyond caring. He could hardly call himself a liberal, but he'd come to see the way blacks were treated in America as being patently against the virtues of freedom and liberty the Founding Fathers had revolted to bring into being. Since he sat in the Oval Office for the time being, he'd decided to do something about it.\n\nLeMay had been expecting to spend his Vice-Presidency shoved into a corner as Wallace ran rampant over America. He'd never expected to do anything of consequence, much less to change history. The President finished his drink. He was sure there'd be recrimination from the people who were, until recently, his strongest supporters, but he couldn't find it in him to give a damn. Someone had to do it, sooner or later."

The senator stopped short of promising to cross the aisle with his buddies when the time comes; LeMay reckoned he'd get that and more with a little extra perseverance.\n\n\"Then it looks like we're not letting up 'til you breathe and shit the Lone Star State!\" Johnson chuckled heartily as tissue paper wiped the last traces of oil and spittle off his fingers. \"How's next weekend at the family ranch sound?\" he asked. \"Business and pleasure in one.\"\n\nThe President grinned.

Many in the South were pleased, yes; but many others, in the North and elsewhere, didn't take kindly at all such a turn of events.

While some Americans ended up becoming more radical, if only because of Wallace's flaming rhetoric and grand campaign promises, most of his supporters ended up defecting to the R-Ds, as the NPP's image as a serious political party has taken a serious blow following the impeachment of its elected first president.\n\nNow, Curtis LeMay stands as the leader of the Free World after Wallace's controversial removal from office.

Integration will be promised, however limited it may end up being. This should be sufficient to placate the C-NPP."
 USA_allies_across_the_aisle_desc:0 "Wallace may have been charismatic enough to win an upset victory in '64, but his removal makes clear that political compromise was never his strong suit. But LeMay sees opportunities which Wallace was blind to, and he sees a rising conservative movement among the Democrats who are more...understanding of the Southern perspective than the Republicans.\n\nLeMay will reach out to the Democrats by meeting with Barry Goldwater, a rising star among their conservative wing. The President will show him that they agree on more issues than they disagree, and will express enthusiasm for working with the Democrats to build strong conservative institutions in America. Of course, Goldwater may have to be a little more flexible on the civil rights issue, but that's what compromise is all about, isn't it?"
 USA_revanchist_rhetoric_desc:0 "At the end of the day, the NPP are all in this together. We came together to form a common vision, to work toward a shared purpose. That purpose is getting our Treaty Ports and Hawaiian islands back come hell or high water.\n\nWe will promote party unity by playing up our shared revanchist agenda. The R-D's are a bunch of milquetoast pissants who don't have the guts to shake down Japan. The C-NPP can rest assured that despite our differences on civil rights, \"Bombs Away\" LeMay will make Tokyo tremble, and avenge the injustices of the Second World War."
 USA_like_wallace_never_left_desc:0 "Say what you will about Wallace, but unlike LeMay the people actually voted for him. Wallaceism was made public policy by the will of the people, and LeMay has a duty to uphold it despite his personal misgivings. The South can rest assured that LeMay will do his best to protect their freedoms and traditional ways of life.\n\nLeMay will defend Wallace's legacy. Wallace was overall a good man, but was only brought down by a few critical mistakes that should not outshine his otherwise stellar performance. President LeMay is Wallace's former veep, and the South shall be proud of his enduring commitment to Wallace's grassroots revolution against federal tyranny."
 USA_select_integration_desc:0 "LeMay has talked the talk and now it's time to walk the walk. Specifically, he's going to walk a very thin tightrope where he must convince the R's and C-NPP that he's given them what they wanted while showing the Southern D's and FR-NPP that he ain't laid a finger on their domestic institutions.\n\nThe President will begin drafting an incredibly limited integration programme. Schools will be \"desegregated\", but not forced to consolidate their formerly black and white school districts. Businesses will be \"integrated\" but the owners will be given the benefit of the doubt on all service refusals. And of course, everyone will be allowed to take their sweet time integrating. You can't suddenly force such a drastic change on the South, that was the very mistake that led to Wallace's election in the first place."
 USA_exempt_private_schools_desc:0 "What don't these liberals understand? Private schools aren't funded with our money, so it's none of our business who they accept. Are we going to tell Harvard they have to take every pauper off the street? Obviously not, so who is the Federal government to tell White private schools they have to take in Black students who would distort their carefully cultivated learning environment?\n\nPresident LeMay will give the green light to \"segregation academies\" by exempting private schools from integration quotas. Any man of means will be free to enroll his children in private sector education. And if some of those schools choose to bar certain students on the grounds of their race, that's their prerogative. Not the government's schools, not the government's problem."
 USA_yearly_integration_quotas_desc:0 "Here's the bone we throw to the C-NPP. We tell them, \"Sure, we'll integrate. We'll even set integration quotas!\" That's how we square this circle, the devil is in the details. We'll have quotas, sure, but they'll be low as can be, double digits even, and your average Southerner will hardly notice a difference.\n\nWe will begin drafting the yearly integration quotas, and they will be painfully low. As low as we can haggle the C-NPP down to. Integration will happen, but it will happen at a sluggish pace. This will hopefully placate both the Center and Far Right blocs of our party."
 USA_service_for_service_desc:0 "LeMay has had to check his convictions at the door many times throughout his presidency, but he's drawing a hard line in the sand at the military. The military must remain integrated, at least so we can be operationally effective. He will not allow segregationism to infect his beloved armed forces, and he will even champion military integration.\n\nPresident LeMay will promote social integration within the military. He will pitch joining the army to Black Americans as a path to higher social standing and authority. \"Service for service\", military service enables members of the Black community to be served by the government through veteran benefits and by the people through their respect."
 USA_right_to_denial_desc:0 "Integration can't be a one-size fits all deal, it is a delicate operation that must be tailored to the needs of individual communities. Do we need to forcibly integrate a mostly white county? Do we need to consolidate segregated school districts where the black schools aren't that bad? Not at all.\n\nWe will fill our integration legislation with a heaping helping of exemptions. Private schools were already exempt, but now public schools will find an exemption too if they try hard enough. No matter how nonsensical their reasons are, any school will be able to exercise their right to deny admission to students of color."
 USA_all_together_desc:0 "Black, white, green, red, can we put our tensions to bed? The civil rights controversy was an open wound on the heart of our nation, and President LeMay is doing his best to bring the country together after the unfortunate controversy that led to Wallace's impeachment. Now black and white, they may fight; but when the enemy comes we'll get together and run 'em out of sight.\n\nPresident LeMay will go on the air and try to calm our racial tensions. He will state that his new civil rights legislation is the definitive answer to the Civil Rights Struggle. He will also remind us of our shared struggle against Japanese imperialism and avenging our territorial losses in the war. Hopefully this will help us bind up our wounds and move on."
 USA_protect_our_troops_desc:0 "The military is our nation's most beloved institution. They are the heroes who won us the first World War and did their damndest in the second. With one of their own in the Oval Office, they will finally get the respect they've deserved.\n\nPresident LeMay will give a speech laden with pro-military and revanchist rhetoric. The troops will be called our greatest national treasure and the only hope for reclaiming our lost lands. Hopefully this will boost the military's morale while distracting the public from the Civil Rights issue."
 USA_separate_but_equal_desc:0 "Brown v. Board was a load of bupkis. If the schools actually are equal then why should anyone care about them being separate? Yes, there may be a few discrepancies and we can look into those as they come up. But as long as a black child can get a good education there's no pressing need for him to be enrolled in a class of white people, as far as the government is concerned.\n\nPresident LeMay will announce increased funding for black school districts and promise that they shall be integrated at some point in the future. As long as black children get a decent education now, we can take our time integrating them in the future. This will hopefully mollify the center and leave the Far-Right elated."
 USA_air_power_above_all_desc:0 "The United States Air Force is second to none. We have the most and the best planes of any nation. Our flying boys will control the skies and make the Japanese duck and cover. If the whole NPP can stand behind one thing, it's our mantra of \"Bomb Japan!\"\n\nLeMay will increase his investments into our Air Force, his military alma mater and the branch best equipped to secure victory in the next conflict. Hopefully these new military investments will spook the Japanese into standing down when tensions heat up."
 USA_personal_problems_desc:0 "President LeMay has had to make many sacrifices throughout his administration. He has had to sacrifice his convictions, his goals, and perhaps even his soul. But it has all been in the name of the party. He did his duty, he became the President the party needed him to be, and he made his predecessor proud. He did everything he should have done, everything he could be expected to do.\n\nSo why does the center still gripe? Why do they drone on about rights for this and rights for that? He gave them their damned integration. What more can they realistically want from LeMay? His job is done and he's ready to retire. If the moderates still aren't happy, that's their problem. "
 USA_moderate_roots_desc:0 "Before we were the NPP Far Right, we were the Patriotic Party. We were led by General Patton and our purpose was to avenge Japanese injustices, not to uphold the racist institutions of Southern elites. Time to get our priorities straight and return to being the party of American patriots, whatever their skin color.\n\nLeMay will condemn racism as publicly and unambiguously as any man can. He will reach out to rising stars in the party like Margaret Chase Smith and Spiro Agnew, good examples of American patriots who aren't racists. LeMay will restore the NPP-FR to what General Patton meant it to be, even if he has to drag the party kicking and screaming back to its roots.\n\n§RThe Wallace/LeMay ticket was elected on a segregationist mandate, and those voters may not react well to the party's new direction...§! "
 USA_denounce_wallacism_desc:0 "Trusting Wallace was the worst mistake both LeMay and this country ever made. His cavalier attitude towards racial segregation and his efforts to dismantle all the federal institutions that keep this country together have wrought unparalleled damage to our nation. It is time to call a spade a spade and call out Wallace for the scumbag he is.\n\nLeMay will utterly condemn George Wallace's segregationist and anti-federalist politics. He will call for strengthening the Federal government and implementing civil rights. Wallace will be stricken from the NPP's ideological canon and be left with no official support from the party."
 USA_alienate_the_FR_NPP_desc:0 "President LeMay is no friend to racists. He has made this quite clear after denouncing Wallaceism. Wallace may have led the party a few months ago, but this is LeMay's party now. In the new NPP-FR, segregationism dies today, is still dead tomorrow, and shall remain dead forever. Anyone who disagrees can find another party.\n\nLeMay will make support for integration a requirement for continued membership in the NPP-FR. This will solidify the NPP-FR as a purely patriotic party, not a segregationist pawn. This may infuriate our Southern base, but if they don't appreciate the President doing the right thing then the President doesn't need them in his party.\n\n§R\"If they're purged from the§! £GFX_npp_fr_texticon §gNPP Far-Right§! §Rthen there will only be §jone faction left§! §Rwhere segregationists can find a home...§!\""
 USA_appeal_to_the_hard_republicans_desc:0 "President LeMay's shocking pivot on the civil rights issue has opened up many opportunities for bipartisan collaboration. We may have been able to talk to Democrats, but now we have a chance to sway even the most liberal Republicans to our side. And LeMay knows just the man to talk to...\n\nLeMay will schedule a meeting with Lyndon Johnson, the Republican Senator from Texas. They will hash out their differences and will likely come to an agreement on many issues. This will secure us plenty of Republican votes in the Senate when it comes time to make our move on Civil Rights."
 USA_southern_hospitality_desc:0 "Just because LeMay supports integration doesn't mean he hates the South; it was the South's choice to center their entire identity around segregation. The South is welcome and wanted in the NPP-FR, but they will have to find a new ethos to live by.\n\nWe will campaign in the Deep South, promoting a hospitable and gentle Southern identity. We will implore the Southerners to think of themselves as a classically tolerant people, kind and courteous to all mankind. Hopefully this will mitigate our popularity losses in the Southern states once LeMay implements his master plan..."
 USA_perfectly_balanced_desc:0 "In Wallace's day, the \"Progressive\" part of our name wasn't worth a wooden nickel. The Far Right exercised hegemonic control over the party and left the Center bloc in the dust. But under LeMay, all will have a fair say. Having purged the segregationists from the Far Right and made deals with the liberal Republicans, the balance of power between the NPP's Far Right and Center wings has been made equal. Consequently, it's time to start making many things in this country more equal.\n\nWith the party now whipped into line, LeMay will begin his real political initiatives. This will include pro-business tax policies, educational investments, strengthening of the military, and of course, the Civil Rights Act. After cutting the segregationist deadweight loose, President LeMay is ready to start putting his plans into action."
 USA_military_model_to_integration_desc:0 "Some businessmen who want to be politicians like to say they'll govern this country like they ran their companies. Well President LeMay plans to run this country like a company too, a company of soldiers that is.\n\nAs CiC, LeMay will give the order to desegregate and by God it shall be done. The Armed Forces will be desegregated as soon as his pen leaves the paper and this will be the model America shall follow."
 USA_tax_breaks_for_business_desc:0 "Lester Maddox may be salty about having to serve black people at the Pickrick, but maybe he'll calm down once he learns he owes Uncle Sam less money because of it.\n\nPresident LeMay will offer businesses a carrot alongside his stick. He will slash business taxes in order to promote economic growth. This will hopefully boost his standing among the American business class and give him further support for his magnum opus civil rights legislation."
 USA_expand_the_GI_bill_desc:0 "Ever since the passage of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, those who've served this country can rest assured that this country shall serve them too. But it's nowhere near enough. A large cause of the present American Depression is the fact that our veterans feel neglected and disrespected after our defeat in the war, it's time for that to change.\n\nPresident LeMay will draft expansions to G.I. Bill subsidies. Veterans can rest assured that if they go to any public university in their state, their tuition will be paid for in full and receive stronger pensions and unemployment benefits. This will ensure that our veterans can contribute to the economy and feel well-rewarded for their service."
 USA_university_tax_breaks_desc:0 "Of course, when a large amount of students suddenly show up at the universities, their resources will be mighty strained by the influx. If we want our veterans to get a proper education, it's only fitting that we should help our universities accommodate them.\n\nPresident LeMay will announce special tax breaks for universities. This should loosen up room in their budgets to expand their programs and living accommodations. Hopefully our national education levels will approve as a result."
 USA_pull_back_economic_intervention_desc:0 "Aside from forcing them to integrate, the government doesn't need to have such a heavy hand in the private sector. That's one tenet of Wallaceism LeMay can get behind. The federal government has no business playing nanny to every shopkeep in the country, it's time to let our businesses become free to flourish.\n\nLeMay will loosen business regulations and cut various programs that sought to direct the economy. This will save money in our budget and also allow businesses more freedom to contribute to the economy."
 USA_militarized_schools_desc:0 "We need fresh meat for the grinder, and the freshest meat is ripe as soon as it leaves high school. To make sure these potential recruits don't go off to college or get a career, we need to send recruiters directly to schools to steer them on the right path.\n\nLeMay will fund a military recruitment drive in the nation's high schools. These will involve recruiters setting up tables and giving pep talks on why serving your country can be a great career path. This should boost recruitment numbers."
 USA_the_american_nationalist_desc:0 "\"Have pride, my fellow Americans. Have pride that the Han coal miner in Manchukuo, the Polish slave in Upper Silesia and the Frenchman deprived of his humanity in Burgundy all look towards one source of inspiration. One course of light that shines a ray of hope on all mankind, the last beacon of liberty and humanity's last chance for emancipation. We, the United States of America, are that light. As long as we keep it burning, it shall one day illuminate the whole world.\"\n\nLeMay will give a rousing patriotic speech to unite the nation in anticipation of his upcoming Civil Rights Act. Hopefully this will mitigate the impact the act will have on the stability of our nation."
 USA_military_pipeline_desc:0 "The South has historically furnished this country with some of its finest officers while the North has provided materiel through its factories. We cannot afford to keep having such a lopsided system, especially when it's becoming clear that the quality of equipment is often just as important as the quality of generals.\n\nPresident LeMay will invest in a new military industry in the South. This should provide plenty of jobs for locals and mitigate some of the resentment that the white population will feel when the CRA passes."
 USA_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc:0 "When Curtis LeMay first took his seat in the Oval Office, he was not the man for the job. Yet over the past several months he has already upended American politics and remade the NPP in his image. All his hard work, all his sacrifices, it's all built up to this moment, his magnum opus as President:\n\nThe Civil Rights Act.\n\nWallace would blow a gasket when he finds out what it contains. This Civil Rights Act is far more progressive than anything John F. Kennedy could have developed. It's astoundingly strict on school segregation and just as brutal on transport segregation. This will hit the Senate floor and LeMay will do everything in his power to push it through. When he leaves office, he will be remembered as the only President in history to have thrown away his entire political future to stand up for the Other America.\n\n§xThis is a complete betrayal of everything the £GFX_npp_fr_texticon §gNPP Far-Right§! §xstood for in 1964.§! §jCertain forces§! §xin this country will seek revenge.§!"

Wallace's advisors have thus called a meeting, and discussed the intricacies of gathering R-D support.\n\nAll men in the room agree that a very large majority of Republicans will vote to sink the bill given the specifics of it, so any negotiations with them are hopeless. As such, any hope of bipartisan support lies with the Democrats. However, the room is largely divided on which branch of the Democrats to attempt appeasing.\n\nHalf of the room would like to approach the largely conservative Senator Barry Goldwater. The FR-NPP shares some aspects of social policies with Goldwater, and this can be used as leverage to garner support from the rather large share of mainstream Democrats, assuming that Goldwater supports our proposal. However, Goldwater is very staunchly right-wing economically, and may shoot down any idea of Social Security in its entirety.\n\nThe other half of the room suggests reaching out to RFK, the brother of the late President Kennedy. While RFK's progressive Democrats are a smaller caucus than Goldwater's, RFK will surely listen closely to our proposal, given his social democratic leanings, and is more likely to bring his caucus behind him. However, this also means that he will oppose any overt segregationist clauses in our bill. The final decision after this discussion rests with the President."

Wallace sits down across from Goldwater, and the two begin to chat intimately discussing the bill's specifics. While the beginning of the proposal went rather well, Goldwater's enthusiasm dampened as Wallace kept talking. Mainly, Goldwater became more and more opposed about the very foundations of the bill, rather than specific clauses they were discussing.\n\n\"President Wallace, you're telling me that you want to reward the unemployed in this country? Why should we support the deceitfully lazy? And what about the unnecessary disability insurance and accessibility clauses? Do you know how much money we would squander on a very small minority in this country?\"\n\nWallace was becoming increasingly less confident that Goldwater would support the very core of the bill as it was. \"Now now, I assure you that programs like this will stop the poor and needy in America from turning to socialism--\"\n\n\"But Mr. President, this bill is socialism. We need to cut down on our unnecessary spending and work on repaying our national debt!\"\n\n\"Barry, do you not believe in the amount of productivity this will give the average American? That'll do more for our economy than a surplus will!\" Goldwater immediately stood up. \"I'm not going to support a communist bill written by a communist himself.

Progressive but by-the-book and in line with R-D ideals, their influence is not to be underestimated.\n\nEspecially today.\n\nWallace knows that Kennedy is a pinko liberal in wolf's clothing; only a Democrat because his family was. Kennedy knows that Wallace is a spineless, racist populist to American progressives; a kingmaker, a scion, and perhaps one of the greatest political devils of the modern era. Despite this though, the two men sat down at a table to talk about Social Security.\n\n\"You know, I'd practically be crucified back in my caucus for agreeing with many points of an NPP bill. Yet, it has everything I'd want to pass if I was in your seat, Mr. President.\"\n\nWallace smiled. \"Perhaps if things went a bit differently, you'd be sitting exactly where I would be, boy. So this is your chance to make things right. Help me pass this, and you'll take part in the glory of saving the downtrodden in this county.\"\n\nBobby gritted his teeth. \"As long as there's none of that separate-but-equal nonsense, or any of your racial southern appeasement...

And with RFK at the helm, it was likely he would use his influence in the Democratic party to spread negative feedback about the bill across the floor.\n\n\"Bobby, Bobby! Listen to me. Standing up for the poor doesn't mean standing up for the Negro! Good white men and women are among the poor you claim to represent! Are you gonna abandon your principles for a bunch of coloreds?\"\n\nKennedy, clenching his fists and being held back by his aides, furiously lashed back at the desperate Wallace. \"Fuck you, you racist bastard! I'd rather die on my brother's grave than appease your racist, whitewashed, disgusting attempt at aid for the poor. This bill has more holes in it than the swiss cheese on my sandwich this morning, and it's going to fail outside of your little cadre of backward, authoritarian warhawks. You hear me?\"\n\nWallace said nothing, simply walking away. It seems that any hopes of bipartisan support were swiftly dashed with the denouncement of the heir to America's civil rights legislation.

With President Wallace at the helm of the Southern wing, Margaret Chase Smith is the political scion of the Northerner FR-NPP. Both are powerful figures in the party, and both of them need to come together to pass Social Security.\n\n\"Miss Smith, a pleasure to have you in the Oval Office. I'm glad to finally be reaching out to the entire party. We are not just the branch of the South, you know.\"\n\n\"Naturally, George. We're here to get this Social Security bill passed, hmm? A shining piece of NPP legislation, able to help the man in the south or the man in the North.\"\n\nWallace and Smith got along very well, discussing and debating the intricacies of the bill together. What they settled on was a comprehensive compromise; something every supporter and legislator of the FR-NPP could agree on. \"Well, Mr. President, we're set. I'll let my fellow Northern legislators know about these changes. And we will get it passed, I'm sure of it.\"\n\nWallace grinned, and shook Smith's hand. \"North and South working together for the good of the nation. That's what I like to hear.\""

After a few moments of silence, Wallace turned, nodded his head at Kennedy, saying \"Mr. Kennedy, please, sit down, you wanted to speak after all.\" As Robert Kennedy stepped forward with a smile, shook his hand, and sat down ahead from the President.\n\n\"Well, Mr. President, I wanted to start our little meeting off with congratulating you, sir, as these past few years have finally managed to bring our party to victory. Actually, before we continue, would you like a drink to celebrate?\" He said, pulling out a small flask. The President, offering a small smile, pulled out some glasses to enjoy, as Kennedy poured the drinks and the men toasted. \"Well, President Wallace, I know that you are a man of business and work, so while I would love to continue the cheering, we ought to move on to the business.\" Wallace's smile faded slowly. \"President Wallace, you are a man of patriotism and party, you have fought and bled your way all the way to the top, and now, you have the opportunity to do great things for the country. In this,\" he stopped to drink, \"the children of America deserve just as great an opportunity as any of us. While the people of America deserve choice, the great freedom of choice, these are children we're talking about here, Mr. President. Segregation, although it's a choice, is not going to make these kids' lives any better, sir.\"\n\nWallace leaned back in his chair in contemplation of Kennedy's statement, twiddling his thumbs. After leaning forward, he looked at Robert in the eyes and said, \"Mr. Kennedy, do you realize that I have built my entire foundation on the freedom of the American people? On guaranteeing their rights. Children's education or not, this has gotten me into the Presidential office, what has gotten the NPP to finally succeed after all these years of Republican-Democratic bullshit. Now, tell me, Mr. Kennedy, how would I be able to continue from here?\" Kennedy felt the tension in the room skyrocket before saying, \"By putting heart and mind over the number of votes, Mr. President.\""

It just so happened that the same President Wallace swore off television, radio, telephones for the day, declaring that he had too much work to do and that they'd only distract him. He even said \"not to dare walk into the Oval Office unless the Japanese are storming San Diego.\" It wasn't until the Secretaries and Aides of the office got so pent up with fear that they shoved one man under the bus to do the work: that timid kid, Wilson. They shoved him forward to enter the office. Greeted with a fuming \"What?\" from the President before Wilson picked up. \"Um, sir, uh, the news, sir.\"\n\nThey were just lucky enough to catch a rerun of the official entire rant given to NBC that morning. \"This is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and now, Mr. Kennedy, you seemed quite eager to join us on the news, and we couldn't turn you down! Tell us, what's got you so pent up this morning, Robert?\" the newscaster asked. \"We'll, Mr. Reig, I'd like to explain a grievous insult to the American spirit and the National Progressive Party's goals as a whole. You see, I had a meeting with President Wallace yesterday about the status of segregation of the education system. Now, obviously, I represent the Progressive wing of the NPP, and thus I care to spread social justice towards Americans, especially the children of America. President Wallace, however, seems to spit in the image of that belief. He instructed me to, as the President himself said, 'get the hell out of his office, Bobby,\" at my request that he laxes certain positions for the betterment of our next generation.\" \"You're saying that the President said that to you, Mr. Kennedy?\" Reig asked. \"Absolutely, sir. While I have met several lowly politicians in my lifetime, never in my life have I met an obstinate, ignorant, angry child in the form of a man that wishes to undo the education system for the color of people's skin.

Today, it was a pristine envelope with a higher quality than that of kings of foreign lands. On the front, the envelope was sealed with a large wax \"K.\" Wallace tore it apart, revealing a large note adorned with the words \"Call me.\" followed by the signature of Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe conversation seemed to last for hours. Wallace dialed the phone to hear an explosion of fury on the other end of the line, as a furious Bobby Kennedy awaited the President. \"Kennedy, calm the hell down, what are you trying to say?\" asked Wallace. \"What am I trying to say? You no good, double-crossing liar, you swore you would not dare touch the northern united states with your segregating hands, and look at what you did! You tried to upend the social order and plant your damned racist crap everywhere! What happened to promises, are those not official down in Alabama?\" Kennedy responded. \"Oh.\" Wallace said slowly, nearly chuckling as he did so. \"Well, you see, Bobby, promises mean all the world in Alabama. However, that's part of the game here in Washington. Maybe your big ole \"Da\" didn't tell you, but he lost in his presidency, became a loser, because he couldn't keep up with the game, unlike myself, who will not lose for this country as you will and your father did. Sorry for your inconvenience.\" \"You no good son of a-\" the line clicked as Wallace promptly hung up the phone. \"The NPP isn't going to survive on good gestures like he has planned.\"\n\nThat evening, American television captured one of the greatest political spectacles in modern history. Robert \"Bobby\" Kennedy joined NBC Nightly News host Howard Reig to express his \"dissatisfaction\" with the Wallace presidency. His dissatisfactions ranged from George C. Wallace being a \"racist\" to a \"liar\" to \"pig-headed\" to \"an angry child who seems to hate the children around him.\" LeMay, Burke, and Mills had joined him in the Oval Office during the live airing that night. Wallace turned off the television set, prompting the three men to turn towards the President to gauge his reaction. Wallace got up silently, walked to grab the chair that Kennedy sat on during their discussion, and slammed it repeatedly into the television set, destroying the glass and collapsing the framework."

Sometimes it felt like they'd been a powerful force for American society, and sometimes it felt like everyone in America had a bone to pick with the administration. Wallace was wading through these thoughts when he was suddenly interrupted by a phone call. \"Hello?\" Wallace asked. \"Good morning, sir, Robert Kennedy's on the line, would you like me to patch it through to you?\" his secretary asked. \"Sure, sure, put Bobby on the phone.\" The phone clicked and Wallace heard a new voice pour through, \"President Wallace, are you there, sir?\" \"Sure, Robert, what do you need?\" Wallace responded. \"Well, sir, I wanted to say that I genuinely appreciate the actions you've taken following our little discussion. It's nice to know that in the modern day, I have someone I can rely on, different or not. With that, be sure to tune into the NBC Nightly News tonight, I think you'll enjoy it.\" Wallace was appreciative in the end, saying that \"A promise is a promise.\" Before they ended the conversation.\n\nThat night, as work was wrapping up for the President, he turned on the television set within the Oval Office. Turning it to the news channel, Wallace was greeted with a flashy logo before zooming into the host and Robert Kennedy himself. \"Good evening folks, this is Howard Reig with NBC Nightly News, and I am joined by Robert F. Kennedy himself. How are you doing this evening, Mr. Kennedy?\" Kennedy responded strongly, saying \"I'm doing quite well tonight, it's a beautiful evening with beautiful happenings in Washington.\" \"Really? And what may that be, Mr. Kennedy?\" Reig asked. \"Well, sir, the details are a rather private matter, but they do concern President Wallace, a firm member of the NPP, and as I've come to realize, a truthful and loyal man.\" \"Now, as far as I know, Wallace and you have come to blows in the past over issues, correct?\" Reig asked. \"You may be correct, Mr. Reig. However, agree or disagree with anyone, it isn't about that. To recognize the virtues laid within a man, even if you may happen to harbor completely different world views. That is where the term \"respect\" comes into play, especially in the circles of Washington D.C.\" For the rest of the evening, Reig and Kennedy continued to go back and forth about different ideas and respect. But no matter what, Wallace knew his concessions may cost him. But in the end, he knew he did the right thing."

Battles across the United States, not with rifles and bombs, but with words and bills. The North hadn't backed down faced with Wallace's desire to finally segregate the education system, and every day, more and more resources, time, and effort had to be dedicated to this process. It was exhausting to everyone, including the President. However, in the middle of a few advisors pinpointing possible speeches and campaigns to earn the President's approval, a phone call interrupted the action of the room. \"Hello?\" asked Wallace. \"Copy this down, Mr. President, every word of it. I can't be on the phone for too long, but you're going to want to hear this.\" A raspy voice called back. The men in the room aside from Wallace stood silent as the scratches of pen meeting paper and the occasional \"Uh huh.\" and \"Are you sure?\" came from the President. After a few minutes, the President issued a \"Thank you.\" before clicking the phone. Everyone, out, LeMay you ought to stay but I want everyone out of this room and no one within thirty feet of that damned door for the rest of the night!\" The men slowly exited the room.\n\n\"LeMay, we may have just found our breakthrough into the North.\" Wallace said frantically. \"Alright, sir, what's going on? Who was that?\" LeMay responded. \"Wouldn't say, but it's not who they are that matters, it's what they said.\" Wallace said, walking over to point at the map. \"There, Pennsylvania. Strong voiced Senator, direct opposer of segregation in the North, and absolute opponent of it for anywhere in the United States. However, that strong voice of his may die down a bit when he may hear we know about the kid he has outside of his marriage that he hangs around and makes payments for.\" Wallace said. \"A bastard? No offense, sir, but is that going to be enough to really push him to work with us?\" LeMay responded. \"Definitely, when we inform the public of the slant-eyed bastard. Kid's Japanese, Curtis, a fucking Jap!\" Wallace said. LeMay stroked his chin in contemplation. \"God above, that's a lot to use against the man.

Days since, with proceedings going on regarding possible groundbreaking developments of moving segregation northward. The President was anxious, fearful even, pacing around the Oval Office with the passing hours in every day. What if he wouldn't back down? What if this backfires? Not a damned word had come forth from that powerful anti-segregationist, not a protest, not a speech, not even so much as a whisper. That is, until the Senate proceedings from the day had concluded.\n\nNews anchors across the country had all begun reporting the same story, the same flip on the entire case of segregation: now, it had seemed a small coalition of Senators seemed to be organizing in support of the legislation put forward by the Wallace administration. Legislation permitting the possible expansion of segregation of the education system in Northern states. A coalition headed by a formerly iron-willed Senator from Pennsylvania who had argued each and every piece of work supported by President Wallace. Senate leaders were baffled, the R-Ds in Congress collapsed into infighting, as reported by some newscasters. The nation seemed to wonder what could have possibly gotten Wallace the lucky break he needed after the fights he experienced in the legislation process. LeMay came into the office, noticing a wicked grin strewn across the President's face, prompting him to ask, \"Any reports from the Senator?\"\n\nWallace responded that \"We didn't get a report; however, we got a whole goddamn bloc of Democrats voting for us in the Senate.\" The President and the Vice President shook hands at their newfound success, laughing at the blurry image of the Senator's face on the screen."

On one hand, this is one of the most lowly, deplorable actions to be committed by a man in as high a position as Wallace found himself in. On the other, Wallace found the prospect of nationwide segregation to be there, laid within his palms, waiting to be clutched, for his name to go down in history as the man who overturned political ties to embrace the good traditions of the Southern United States. And that damned phone ringing was the one thing he needed for all of this to happen.\n\nFinally, the phone upon his desk began ringing its usually annoying, but now exciting for the President. \"Who's there?\" He asked, frantically. The raspy voice answered, \"He's not buying into it.\" Silence persisted for a few, critical moments, moments of building fear, tension, and fury. \"Why in the hell not? Didn't you push hard enough, and say something about guaranteeing this fucking guy? What happened?\" Wallace said. \"It's not that easy, if we keep going, we'll risk being found out. At the very least, we know one thing at the moment: he's not backing down, no matter what I threw against him. He doesn't believe in the slightest that we'd dare leak the information, that we're just 'disgusting,' and that all this would be a bluff that would blow over. And that's the censored version of what he had to say.\" the raspy voice responded. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck. So, with all of this built up, what are our options then?\" The President said, rubbing the stress out of his forehead. \"In tough spots like this, this operation of ours could take two different routes: either we comply, do as he says, back down and not return until we have more dirt on him. The other direction would be to fire the loaded gun: leak the info, fucking destroy him where he stands and hope to God that he doesn't crawl back in to fight back.\"\n\nThe President was left in a frustrated state of stress and worry, with hopes that his heart wouldn't give out after all this. Either we swing with what we have or we back off, either way we could be absolutely fucked. The clock was ticking before the man had to hang up to avoid connection."

After so long, President Wallace shall break down the obstacles and pave his way forward after all of the infighting. Or so he had thought.\n\nPresident Wallace and Vice President LeMay sat in the Oval Office, watching the black and white screens within the television sets of the office. There, they saw speeches turned into protests turned into riots, all in the span of a day, as more people fought and bled and died within the span of a few hours. Banners waved and burned, displaying the President's face adorned with the words \"Slanderer!\" and \"Corrupt!\" As far as they were concerned, the people of America had finally been brought out in full outrage; however, not by the possibility of segregation, but rather, the rules of a game which had been played in Washington for decades. One newscaster over another described \"the situation in Pennsylvania\" as being pure chaos, as fights between Pennsylvanians erupt defending their Senator and his child, defending the President's actions, and the police trying to maintain law and order in the broken social situation they find themselves in. Even on the Congressional floor, Representatives postur the prospect of illegality within the actions of President Wallace, while Senators rush to defend their honor by standing behind the disgraced Democrat from Pennsylvania.\n\nPresident Wallace waltzed behind his desk and nearly fell into his chair. He nearly broke open one of the drawers, taking out a flask and two shot glasses. \"Well, if we're against the world, right?\" He asked LeMay, raising a glass of whiskey to his Vice President.

Joining him, Arleigh Burke and Wilbur Mills sat nervously, doing their best to prepare for anything that may happen there.

Whether it be by your beliefs or mine, we have grown strong; however, I need you to use that strength.\" Wallace said, as the men and women at the table brace themselves, some distracted from their orders. Wallace continued, \"Many of you will protest, maybe already are protesting, but segregation of the Northern states is necessary as the National Progressive Party's next step forward. Why? Well, to be completely damn honest, I believe in segregation. And with my belief in segregation, comes the FR-NPP's belief in segregation. And with more members, our whole entire party grows stronger. So, I ask: how in the hell could we not survive for another Presidential term without this victory? Goddamnit, the people are rioting out there! Cities are fucking burning, your goddamn cities! We're better than this, so I invoke into you all the courage to rise above the principles and realize that this is about survival. I'm fighting my hardest in my time in the sun, and the sun shall rise to you all one day if you stand behind me!\"\n\nThe room was silent, choked even, from the furious spiel they had just been subject to. The President stepped down from the stage, coming down to take a seat among the table, where the Senators could finally see the exhaustion of the President, as the bags under his eyes seemed to stretch further and further down his face."

After months of preparation, demographic analyses, and cross-party discussions and negotiations, the Executive Federal Aid Spending Act was forged, allowing for extended power in federal intervention in areas of state budgets, a baffling resolution on the side of President George C. Wallace, who has previously expressed his disgruntlement with federal intervention before.\n\nHowever, the confusion of the United States has not served to bring down the excitement present in the administration. President George C. Wallace strongly advocated for the success of the bill, saying, as it entered into the Senate, that \"Tyranny is the death of all nations. However, we'll be damned sure to use the strength of our economy for the betterment of Americans, not the other way around.\" Furthermore, the National Progressive Party as a whole has remarked that the Wallace administration's success has been \"a great success in the step for bipartisanship in an era of division and separation, with betterment for everyone in the country ensured.\" as one spokesperson for the Progressive wing of the NPP stated.\n\nNevertheless, groups of Americans have rallied in protest of the signing of the bill into law, with some of the more moderate factions of the country finding the situation abhorrent. \"The National Progressive Party has cultivated, fed, and nurtured an abomination to enter into the Congress, and they happily allowed such a mischievous, gross violation of constitutional American justice to allow for a huge step in party strength.\" one Democrat said, waving around a banner depicting a crown atop President Wallace's head as they marched in protest.

It seems as though the inherent confusion within the proposal ultimately proved to be too great of a gamble for President Wallace, as recent reports indicate the Bill's failure to pass through the United States Senate's vote.\n\nThe Wallace administration has found itself scrambling for answers to provide past the legislative misstep in the administration's history, with several teams of representatives within Washington D.C. answering countless journalists' questions, with one stating that \"President Wallace greatly expresses his vociferous loathing for the bureaucracy that strangles the country of any potential good to emerge from legitimate governance.\" These sentiments stretch across the National Progressive Party, however, as one representative of the Progressive branch of the National Progressive Party expressed his dissatisfaction with the actions of the Senate in the goals of the party and the President, even if they typically disagreed.\n\nHowever, not all Americans appear disheartened at the President's failings in the Senate today, as the number of protests have been met with an equal number of celebrations on behalf of more moderate members of today's politics. One member of the House of Representatives, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that \"The Republican-Democrat Party finds the President's lack of success in the amalgamation of the worse sides of traditionalism and progressivism to be a great victory in terms of American stability and progress.\" Though the country remains divided, everyone is alert for the potential future after the administration's failure in Congress."

This freedom obviously comes in the form of our representative democracy here in the United States; however, President Wallace and his administration have taken to a more economic interpretation of the nickname, as constant work has been put forward to free the American market from federal intervention as much as possible. However, today stands as a landmark for the President's successes, as the State Financial Independence Act, also called SFIA, which intends to cut incredible amounts of federal infrastructural intervention, has come to pass in Congress.\n\nOn one side, the administration has collectively cried to joy, as constant fighting back and forth between the legislative and executive branches have finally made some leeway in the success of the Act. President Wallace himself commented, stating that \"Americans across the country will enjoy unprecedented economic freedom, without the worry of regulations, rules, and governance from Washington D.C. any longer.\" Meanwhile, several Democrat and FR-NPP Governors have offered their conjoined support for the President and the State Financial Independence Act, with many claiming that the capital held a stranglehold on their potential workings towards the American infrastructure for years.\n\nNevertheless, large swathes of the population find outrage with the passing of the bill, and many have protested the legislative branch itself, claiming that it's become bullied by President George C. Wallace. Ardent Progressives of both parties and blue-collar workers came together to oppose the passing of the bill, with one Republican representative offering a statement, saying that \"President Wallace and his entire administration seek for nothing more but the abandonment of the American people, because he intimidates, he's a bully!\" Besides party divides, many economic analysts have stated that the drastic turn for the American economy will take time to tell its benefits and misgivings."

Of course, with the Wallace's administration's failure in Congress to succeed in passing the State Financial Independence bill, many are once again up in arms over the matter, whether navigating the uneasy atmosphere of the White House, the joy and anger of several businesses, or just witnessing the reactions of the populace from one's own home.\n\nThe Wallace administration has showcased a great deal of displeasure with the actions of Congress for a long time now, and with the failure of one of the largest cuts of federal restrictions on businesses in the United States, contempt from the President and his cabinet has only grown stronger, as several members declined questioning over the matter. Meanwhile, several company heads have expressed outright enragement over the failure of the bill, with one company representative stating, \"The United States House of Representatives and Senate has had it out for the President ever since he stepped foot in office. Now, they'll even keep us in this chokehold of regulations and bureaucracy, and I, along with my shareholders, can hardly take any of it anymore! What's there for us?!\"\n\nHowever, not all are as disgusted with the failings of the President to pass the State Financial Independence Act. Many supporters of federal intervention, as well as many coalitions of blue-collar workers have voiced their thanks for the President's failures, with one representative of a Construction Workers organization in Pennsylvania saying, \"President George C. Wallace thinking he's going to magically save the economy by clearing his work schedule is not going to help anyone in the United States of America. Now, we all have the ability to receive all of the funding we need to help our states prosper without the abandonment of the United States government.\" Several political analysts have recorded that the failure of the State Financial Independence Act will cost a significant blow towards the President and his administration, but only time will tell if these failures will persist in the future."

The Act will completely sever federal ties to education centers' budgets, with one hundred percent of the schools across the country now having their budgets directly tied to their state government.\n\nThis reorganization of the balance of powers has delighted the Wallace administration, with several key members of the administration already calling for celebration having seen that they have generated joy among the states rights proponents of the country. Treasurer Wilbur Mills himself spoke of the issue today, saying that \"President Wallace and our administration recognizes the rights of the states to maintain control over the customs and regulations of their school centers, including their budgets. The Education Financial Reorganization Act will help all those schools tied up in the bureaucratic mess of Washington to find a new and prosperous future in connection with their states.\"\n\nHowever, while strong proponents for state freedoms celebrate, others, including some within the education system itself, have produced sharp criticism of the President. One prominent member of a Wisconsan School Board, who asked to remain anonymous, declared that \"President Wallace's despicable new act is going to choke the life out of hundreds, maybe thousands of schools across the United States! These children need help for God's sakes, not just to have their government drop all responsibilities for them, especially when some are already having to live in a state of financial crisis thanks to the Wallace administration's effects on the economy!\" Newest reports indicate state governments are rushing to introduce new legislation regarding school systems thanks to the new act."

Now, we get to maintain our success through those happy to pay to see these school-children succeed as the next successors to our great country.\" Newscasters have already captured clashes between school administrations as well as protestors of the failure of the bill, who have gathered across schools en masse and even withheld their children from attendance."

President Wallace, evermore diligent on his fight to achieve greater powers for the state governments in this country, effectively pieced together a bill that passed through the Senate today requiring a complete overhaul of the police forces of our country, establishing a requirement for each state to maintain a force of police which are constantly active, alongside a \"Local Defense Division\" to serve as a local defense force within the state, whilst freeing regulations regarding the activities of these police forces and their methods of enforcement. The country, as a whole, however, remains heavily divided on the issue.\n\nThe Wallace administration finds the American Defense Reorderment Act, known as ADRA, to be one of the crowning pieces of legislative accomplishment for President George C.

Others, however, remain skeptical.\n\nOn one hand, we have Southern schools and state leaders, who, from the swamps of Louisiana to the beaches of Florida, have remained in celebration over the new bout of federal aid. \"President George C.

One hardline leader of the Republicans, Colonel John Glenn spoke at a press conference just a few hours ago, saying that, \"The Southern Education Promise Act is a clear indication of President George Wallace's intention on supporting segregationist policies, whether it's written in the law or not.

Due to the direct focus of funds towards school's practicing unlawful segregationist policies through SEPA, many groups have figured that the bill was far more concerned with legislating support for segregationists in the United States. \"Yes, President Wallace and his administration sit behind the veils of 'states rights' and 'Southern support,' but we all know what's truly evolving in his mind.\" said one Civil Rights activist. \"The man's a virulent racist, trying to starve as many African-American children of knowledge as he can!\""

For example, Mississippi High School Social Studies teacher Matthew J. Browning has said that \"Our family and I are greatly celebrating regarding the issue, considering that we can finally move up in the world and quit relying on paycheck to paycheck. Whatever's going on about segregation isn't my business, I'm not on the board of administrators, am I? Sorry to those kids, but I've been working with scraps for the past few years now, President Wallace has given us a blessing here!\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is so ready and eager to shake hands with the President regarding SEBA. In fact, the open protests from school districts across the Northeast of the United States has broadcasted a sense of disappointment and fear for all the opposition of President Wallace. \"First we get our budget completely slashed, and now they're going to pour everything they have down and all across the South, where they're telling African-Americans no at the door!

We're going to be teaching the youngsters about the strengths of this country, and how they ought to be proud of it.

Through time immemorial, people referred to the United States as being the land of plenty, where anyone can do anything they wanted, all while making the success for themselves and their families that they desired. President George C. Wallace has shown his desire to uphold this notion, and has taken a step towards promoting the land of plenty ideal through the Local Business Relief Act, or LBRA, which offers an immediate flat tax relief towards local businesses and their owners, cutting control of the United States federal government from its own economy further. Whilst some praise President Wallace for his intentions to create an independent economy, others find it just another hole to fix in a leaky economic crisis.\n\nThe Far Right have joined the Democrats today in celebrating a potential victory in the name of a free market, as small businesses have already rushed to work harder and produce more than before the tax relief. Just down the street from our news station, a local grocery market store owner was seen rushing to their business with a truckful of appliances and registers to upgrade the efficiency of his business. \"LBRA is a culmination of the logical reasoning backing President Wallace,\" says Treasurer Wilbur Mills in a press conference today, \"and we will continue to take these sound steps for the sake of the American people!\"\n\nHowever, the state of the American economy following the Local Business Relief Act hasn't caused happy cheers for all. Stock owners have begun to notably scramble their investments following the Act, as local investor's offices have continued to receive phone calls regarding shifts and changes in future American finances. Meanwhile, public welfare advocates have assembled en masse to combat support for the Act, with one Republican leader saying, \"America doesn't need to open more pitfalls regarding the help of its people and government.

However, whilst economic hardships have spurred the United States government into reaching out to the average citizen, President Wallace has deemed such actions to be detrimental to the American economy, issuing the American Welfare Concentration Act, or AWCA, which will immediately cut non-working Americans from Welfare programs in the future. After much debate over such a controversial bill, however, proponents of a more conservative nation have won out once more, putting an end to a variety of unemployment programs.\n\nThe recent changes at the hand of the executive office have delighted the President and the entirety of the Wallace cabinet, whose great desire for more independent local governments have produced this strong cut to the welfare programs of the United States. \"In earnest, President George Wallace, myself, and many other of our associates within the administration simply can't find where AWCA produces such a hard loss for America, if any loss at all.\" stated Treasurer Wilbur Mills in a press conference today. \"Getting leeches off of the back of hardworking Americans who have toiled for years to benefit themselves and this country?

Glenn, we need to talk...\"\n\nJust two days later, and President Wallace found himself across the desk from the famed Ohioan governor, praised for his service, his dreams of the stars and stripes, and his never-ending charm. \"So, Mr. President, what is it that I can do to serve you today, sir?\" Glenn asked. \"I'm glad you asked, Glenn, cause we have a lot to discuss up here. Tell me, Glenn, how cold does it get in Ohio?\" Wallace said, rising out of his chair and wandering towards the window. Glenn had to sit back and think about the odd question the President asked. \"Well, sir, it can get quite chilly up there in the winter, why do you ask, sir?\"\n\nWallace shot his eyes back towards Glenn. \"Cause that's just how fucking cold I feel proposing this Union act to the Senate, and if I don't get some more support from Republicans like you, then I think I'll just be freezing to death, now won't I?\" Wallace said, pouring a glass of whiskey for himself and the Senator. \"Ah, so hospitality for votes. I understand your bargain, Wallace, but we're gonna have to get something in return for all of this, sir. Throw in a few lines regarding Social Security and we have ourselves a deal here, sir.\"\n\nWallace could hardly contain his frustration regarding Glenn's demands. If he gave in, that would mean he could jeopardize his status as the strongman of the party, able to get the NPP to the Presidency like it never had before. If he refused, AWUCA could be left alone, and end up dead in the water. The silent room only rang out with the noise of a glass, as Wallace edged it towards Glenn, asking for him to drink once more.\n\n\"Sorry, but I'm not the drinking type, Mr. President.\""

Today, President George C. Wallace signed an executive order which directly implemented the Southern Education Promise Act, designed to funnel what little remains of federal education funding towards Southern states, which was in response to the \"emergency situation which has torn apart Southern education,\" according to President George C. Wallace.\n\nThe Wallace administration, along with scores of groups of its supporters, have stood strong in the face of criticism and public ridicule facing the outbreak of the news regarding the executive order. \"The legislative branch is not necessary, seeing the emergence of the Education Financial Reorganization Act displays a clear allowance for executive control over the systems of funding for centers of education, and seeing the tremendous emergency brought upon the South, the administration and I find it both pertinent and important to directly enforce the Southern Education Promise Act via the will of the executive branch.\" said President Wallace in a press meeting following the enacting of the executive order.\n\nHowever, some cliques within the United States political sphere have fought fiercely against the President's order, ranging from politicians donning the podium to protestors taking to the streets. \"Wallace and his cabal in the White House are destroying every bit of fairness and equality in the education system, all because he's a stuck up, backwater racist with a fetish for the South!\" shouted one protestor on the streets of Chicago.

Today, President Wallace signed an executive order which would fundamentally implement the policies of the National Education Budgetary Act, or NEBA, which would drastically cut federal funding of education whilst retaining it as a federal matter, on reasons that the changes in federal aid through the Executive Federal Aid Spending Act would allow for the executive passage of such an act. The storm over the United States, however, shows mixed feelings in this regard.\n\nPresident Wallace and the entirety of the White House administration have come out of the executive order feeling a sense of pride in their actions. The President himself gathered to the podium regarding his actions in signing the executive order, saying, \"While everyone in my administration and I cherish the ideals of states rights and hold them dear to our heart, it is with all good will that we seek to make the large financial cut across the board, in order to give each and every American more room to grow themselves out and make their own great supporting factors to our economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, however, another sentiment has strewn across the opposition towards President Wallace's executive order: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. In that, several sects of fringe Far Rightists, some would even say Fascist-influenced groups, and leaders of education have cried fury in regards to the President's great overreach, each taking to the streets with banners and poster-boards to signify their thoughts. \"President Wallace is thinking about that fat checkbook that got him to the Presidency, not for the kids which I stand by every day to teach and instruct on how to become great American citizens, the idea of which has surely escaped the President himself!\""

President Wallace himself offered the press a statement on the issue, saying that, \"The United States is a land of greatness, and of great people.

That's what the National Progressive Party seeks, and that's what I seek, for all the poor children of the South!\"\n\nDespite President Wallace's seemingly egalitarian intentions, many across the country find SEBA to be a direct accessway for President Wallace's support of dangerously anti-federal practices of segregation, despite the certain opposition of several governmental figures. \"SEBA, and this executive order it passed under, is a joke, no, a fucking insult against the American system.\" one state representative said, seeking to remain anonymous. \"I don't stand for injustice.

Finally, the doors had opened, and already, the five men were met with hundreds of camera flashes as they walked up to the podium set up outside.\n\n\"Good afternoon, my fellow American patriots! Each and everyone of you represents something to me: the product of a beautiful country, a country which has been bruised and beaten in recent history from the horrors of the world's past. As I look back to the Second World War, the images rush through my mind: the men who stood and fought in the British Isles, the fiery, destructive hellfire rained down on Pearl Harbor after the atomic bomb had been dropped, and the stream of men, scarred physically and mentally by the brutalities that the Japanese had committed to them and their compatriots out there in the Pacific. And you know what I say to that, America? Never again!\" The crowd roared in enthusiasm for President Wallace's envigoring statements. \"Now, more than ever, the United States is prepared to put the Empire on the defensive, as the four brilliant men behind me and I have constructed a plan: a plan to unite our allies, to rally the good people of the world together in a similar goal. The goal of taking the fight back to Japanese for trying to destroy the ideals of freedom and liberty by spilling blood, American blood, into the Pacific!

This is why the Department of State has decided to approach the both of you in proposing an alliance of trade security between the two of our nations. While the Germans have continuously impacted the state of the Union's economy, the Japanese regularly tear down our economic securities, thus prompting the following plan drafted by the most brilliant trade analysts the United States have to offer: in addition for the growth and spread of American-based businesses into the Iberian Union to stimulate economic sources from metropolitan and suburban areas, the United States will officially work to scale the importation of raw steel materials from the Iberian Union by one hundred and fifty percent. This will allow a raw financial boost towards the Iberian economy, and in exchange, the United States hopes for the Caudillos to downscale the ongoing trade relations with the Empire of Japan, to secure a more positive, economic outlook for Iberians and Americans alike.\n\nWith complete respect and honor towards your rule,\n\nGeorge C. Wallace, President of the United States\"\n\nIn the days following the securing of the trade alliance with Salazar and Franco, the R-Ds, especially that Barry Goldwater, tore into President Wallace for daring to associate Americans with the likes of Fascist dictatorships. \"However,\" President Wallace thought, \"they didn't get the first Holiday Inn built on the coast of Barcelona, did they?\""

From fighting in the trenches against the Germans in France during the First World War to the Defense of the British Isles led by American and Canadian men, the braveness and gallantry of our peoples have shaped the modern understanding of North America. However, once more, as the collapse of alliances failed the world against the Germans and Japanese, once more does a lack of unity threaten us all against the coercions of the Japanese in the Pacific, and the Organization of Free Nations will not fall in the face of evil. Thus, we shall organize an immediate increase in the importation of Canadian oil by one hundred and seventy-five percent, in order to benefit the American civilian and military economies while helping to shape the petroleum industry within the Canadian economy. While the drastic nature of the upscale in importation may seem rushed and immediate, it is within the best interests of both of our countries and our liberties to do so, under the threat of the Japanese Army and Naval forces as they grow throughout the Pacific. The United States shall begin preparations immediately to receive the petroleum offered by the wonderful people of Canada in such a time of strife and fear.\n\nWith great thanks to the government and people of Canada,\n\nGeorge C.

Together, our people suffered the sins committed by the Japanese forces across the Pacific, with the blood of our compatriots, fallen to the chronicles of history, soiling the palms of Japanese soldiers and officers. It is with great honor that we not only wish to guarantee such a trade agreement with the Australian government for the sake of the horrors of the past, but also in order to lay the foundation of a greater, more secure foundation of our nations' economies in conjunction with one another. The federal Department of State has reviewed the prospects of the Australian continent and found a variety of wondrous opportunities available to connect the two of our countries into a sense of brotherhood in an already brightening future. Thus, it is my honor to announce a new opening of the American markets towards Australian goods; most specifically, the American government is seeking to increase the purchase of Australian steel and steel-related goods by tenfold current estimates.

However, as I navigated down the paragraphs, I noticed a bit of an inconsistency, sir.\" Mills said. \"Inconsistency? What the Hell are you talking about, Mills?\" Wallace said, moving over to try to look over the speech. \"You see, sir, the points you make within the body seem to come off as, well, inherently contradictory towards one another.

It just isn't possible to do both, sir, and quite frankly, it's down to a matter of choosing a side regarding the argument.\" As much as Wallace hated to acknowledge it, but he was going to have to choose a side regarding the economic argument on behalf of the FR-NPP.

However, on the other hand, therein lied the key to monstrous success regarding sewing together the factions of the National Progressive Party, while also managing to please the Southerners who didn't give a damn about larger businesses so much as supporting themselves on a local level.\n\nMills and Wallace sat for what felt like hours, as the unbearable tension of a party-changing decision was set to rock the United States.

The African-American community have expressed their absolute resolution in ensuring the President does not interfere with their lives longer, and have begun a wide range of protests to the clauses of the Education Rebudgeting Act.

Barely surviving, this means that the Act with accusation of attacking African-American schools with a slash in budget has become approved, even if by just barely.

In this case, it's for those in education: teachers.

After all, you championed the notions of a free and competitive American market, did you not?\" Lyle asked, with some farmers intrigued. \"I championed the notion of a market open and free to Americans themselves, not the overgrown cesspools of greed that large companies have become.\" The Texans clapped for Wallace's response. Finally, one of the representatives, looking red in the face, took the stand, yelling out, \"Well, Mr. President, if you're so keen on sticking out for them, why don't you tell them how you plan on affording all these handouts?\" The citizens of Texas looked towards the President, who appeared flustered. The moments of silence went by before Wallace answered out, \"The People of the United States are going to power the economy enough to afford it.\" The simple response set an even match for the debate."

That's why the knocking on the door shocked the President and sent the papers in his hand flying. \"Fuck's sakes.\" the President muttered under his breath, before yelling, \"Come in!\" Immediately, the scrawny aide named Wilson walked in with some glasses-and-suit wearing business type, saying, \"President Wallace, sir, this is Mr. Lyle, an executive of...\" as the aide babbled on, the President couldn't help but allow a wave of confusion and anger wash over him, who the hell was this guy looking to bust in at a time like this? And why would Wilson let him in? \"Anyways, he's here for that business meeting, I'll leave you two to it!\" Wilson said. \"Yeah, thanks, Wilson.\" Wallace responded.\n\n\"Well, good afternoon, Mr. President, it is an honor to be welcomed here to meet with you! May I sit here?\" Lyle asked, pointing to the chair in front of his desk. \"Yeah, sure,\" the President responded, \"now, what are you here for exactly?\" \"Well, I'm glad you asked, Mr. President, as Wilson didn't explain the situation as accurately as I'd hoped.\" Now the guy's making fun of my staff? Oh, what the hell? \"So, my company was one of the top contributors towards your campaign for Presidency, and in doing so, you promised a wide variety of economic freedoms for the people of the United States. We greatly appreciated the work of such a candidate willing to fight for the freedom of the market, as so many presidents of the past led to restriction after restriction.\" Lyle continued. \"Okay, so what are you getting at?\" asked the President. \"Well, President Wallace, we've grown quite nervous. We've seen a continuously growing trend of freedoms of large companies, such as my own, to give towards the individuals of the United States.\" Wallace saw what was going on here, this Lyle, thinking he can walk in here like this. \"Listen here, Lyle. I've done what it takes to unite a broken party and broken nation, just cause your stocks aren't going through the roof doesn't mean the economy isn't booming more than it ever has before.\" Wallace boomed.\n\nTense silence flowed through the room after Wallace's intimidation. \"Well, in that case, Mr. President, I believe our meeting has concluded. Thank you for taking special consideration in the matter of my associates and myself, and just remember,\" Lyle continued, nearly out the door at that point, \"you're going to have to make a choice.\" he said, closing the door."

We've seen a sharp dropoff in high-wealth, Fortune 500 level individual donors, and flat or reduced contributions from the major corporate political action committees. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce flat out refuses to meet with us.\"\n\nWallace was indignant. \"Why the hell are the businesses giving us the cold shoulder?\"\n\nThe strategist shifted uncomfortably, but pressed on. \"In short, Mr. President... it's you. And your focus on states' rights and the Civil Rights Act.\" Wallace's hackles rose.

All of the previous functionaries had either been incompetent or too political. They'd touted their proximity to the President, and the expectation that in exchange for the privilege of access, business would need to support the Administration's more controversial policies. But taking sides so openly had been a nonstarter from the beginning, especially as opposition to Wallace's civil rights views had hardened. There were minimal expectations that the new guy would prove to be any better than the old.\n\nThe new business czar took his seat at the head of the table. \"I'm not here to lecture anyone. I'm not here to ask for favors or contributions. Politics is a turbulent business, and I know that turbulence is bad for business. What I can tell you is that I am here to listen to your needs with open ears and with discretion - and that the Administration has given me the authority to bring your requests drive to Congress with minimal political interference.\"\n\nThe assembled corporate suits were still hesitant.

Even after the business community had tentatively gotten back on the wagon after Wallace had cleanly split his business and civil rights programs, there was still enough unease about the relaunched relationship in corporate America that careful choreography was the name of the game for any executive-level meeting with the White House.\n\nTalking to other Americans involved more diplomacy and felt more foreign than meeting with other OFN leaders, Wallace noted sardonically. The minutes and bland platitudes wore onwards, until finally Wallace and his counterparty shook hands again and stood, walking towards the door.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce president leaned over and whispered into Wallace's ear. \"We appreciate the new direction of your business policies, Mr. President, despite our differences elsewhere.

With every regulation placed under executive review, or labor law taken up for watering down in Congress, the wallets of corporate America opened wider.\n\nWallace's own campaign coffers weren't benefiting quite as much, but that suited Wallace just fine. It'd all been a quid pro quo with the CEO's - he'd get out of their way on the economy, and they'd look the other way on civil rights. It was, after all, good business.\n\nAnd if one measured the value of one's policies by the opposition they generated, the condemnation of the NPP by organized labor, and the vigorous courting of the unions by the R-D's, was evidence enough that the tables had indeed turned. Of course, there was the matter of the Center-NPP caucus being put in a bind, caught between their union supporters and the Wallace administration, but Wallace found it hard to care too much when the money spoke for itself."

For once, no one had to worry about their \"responsibilities\" towards other citizens, and could live life freely, happily, and patriotically.\n\nA sudden knock at the door interrupted the contemplative thoughts of the President, responding to the interruption with a sharp \"Come in.\" Inside stepped Wilson, that little aide of his he always felt pitiful humor for. \"A letter, for your eyes only, Mr. President.\" Wilson said, handing the letter to the President before leaving the Oval Office. Ripping open the letter, it appeared to be another official message straight from some Senator from Ohio.\n\n\"To the President of the United States:\n\nIt is with fervent approval that we congratulate your efforts, President Wallace. Finally, the gross bureaucracy slowing the wheel of progress has been overturned, and the states have received the power they have been lacking for so long. It is not the government's role to care for the sick or injured, nor is it the government's role to win over the poor with welfare checks or 'social security,' or allow the blacks into school if the rest of us do not want them. No, Mr. President, you've shaved off those leeches and allowed the United States to march on freely, even allowing the states to protect themselves as they would like.

Finally, the true patriots within the country were finally realizing the potential within the governance of the President. Wallace had not wanted to earn the title of \"tyrant\" or \"Supreme Leader\"; no, Wallace pictured the title he wanted. \"Butcher.\" Not of people or of swine, but of the federal ties which had begun to choke the life out of the nation's economy and its people. Americans could finally take a sunday stroll without necessarily wondering if the \"feds\" were going to be breathing down their neck. And even better, Wallace's phone had been ringing off the hook, new, prospective Democratic senators and representatives were questioning and pondering the notion of conversion! With the executive branch in line, it was only a matter of time until the legislative was as well.\n\nWallace began rotating the dial of the rotary phone to a variety of different numbers.

You would be correct, Mr. President, as it has grown more evident with the passing day that the President is wandering dangerously farther from his party's goals with every passing day.\" Goldwater said. \"Oh, and how is that, Senator Goldwater?\" Reig responded. \"Well, you see, Howard, President Wallace came into the Presidency promising to 'champion the ideals of the conservative American mind,' as he stated within a speech in Ohio. However, President Wallace has turned this idea on its head, and is expanding on the federal government further than it already was. New policies and regulations slither from the federal government in an effort to further the Wallace administration, and while it is not as bad as what could be possible from the National Progressive Party, it's still a considerable threat to the people of the United States' freedoms and liberties, economically, socially, and politically. Mark my words, Howard, the proclamations of Wallace ought to serve as a warning to conservative Americans.\"\n\nPresident Wallace shut off the television set. If Barry Goldwater wanted to sit up on national television and spout warnings of doom and gloom to Americans, let him. It hasn't earned him the Presidency yet, and it won't in the future."

In it, the President compiled a variety of newspaper clippings, each detailing a different, yet equally powerful message that the President had to decide upon. In the first, the President bore witness to an economic travesty: \"Henry's Diner and Cafe.\" A small, but powerful economic force in downtown Montgomery, Wallace even remembered bringing Lurleen there for a few dates. Shut down because of new federal health inspection regulations. The President was disgusted, how could they do such a thing to a financially successful and truly American business? The President then flipped to the next newspaper clipping. This was depicted a more political landscape; here, the state legislature was preparing to pass a variety of education reforms for an economically industrious, predominantly Christian school zone; however, the entire reform was blocked by a single vote, a Democratic state senator named Barrett, quoted as saying that \"I don't believe those kids need all that money, after all, my business is suffering, why not help me?\" Wallace knew that his entire party and beyond were counting on him to bring freedoms to the people of the United States. However, what if those freedoms destroyed progress elsewhere? The entire ordeal put a great deal of stress onto the President, and he knew his stresses would only get worse as time went on.\n\nThe President took a cigar out of its carton and brought his lighter's flame to the end.

That's when, after so long, the President began to add up all of the recent events and phone calls that had been pouring in\n\nConsistently, after the showdown at Tuscaloosa just a few days prior, Wallace had heard a variety of phone calls from his Far Right constituents within the Senate. \"Now, more than ever,\" one of the more powerful Far Right Senators said over the phone, \"the people are calling into my office happily.

Thank you.\" Wallace happily grinned in reminding himself of his praise, knowing he had done as the true patriots of America had wanted all along. That's when Wallace thought of the idea. He gathered Lurleen, and got his driver to bring them around the local D.C. area to \"check out the sights on this beautiful day.\" And a beautiful day it was, in Wallace's mind, as the more he looked around, the more he saw the signs. \"No Blacks Allowed!,\" \"Whites Only!,\" and, his personal favorite one he saw, \"Afroes go down the street!\" Even as he watched the streets, he knew that the United States was made White, in his image, as he had wanted it to be. All the while, Lurleen happily sat in the car beside her husband, lovingly.\n\nOn their way back to the White House, the President's vehicle had stopped at a red light.

Only time could tell for the two men as if they were about to bear witness to a bloodbath or a victory.\n\nThat morning, a group of forty-five black students departed from Druid High School, the black high school for the Tuscaloosa school zone, to march to the gates of Tuscaloosa High School, demanding to leave Druid as it emphasized the teaching of manual skills rather than promising a path to University-based education like Tuscaloosa High did, a segregated school of only Whites. Now, President Wallace stroked his chin as he watched the standoff between federal soldiers guarding the gates of the segregated school and the protesters. The gates were shut, the rifles were loaded, and each second ticked by while the possibility of a slaughter grew. While they occasionally gave off a single chant, the group of students were silent for the most part, acting as if entering Tuscaloosa High was their right, contrasting from the law. \"Stupid fucking kids, they need to get back home, we don't need this right now!\" Wallace said, slamming the Oval Office desk with his fist. \"The protesters aren't trying to fight anyone, they've calmly approached the guard asking to finally be let in.\" Byrd said. \"I don't give a flying fuck what those kids want. The law is the law, segregation is segregation, and they are not allowed to step a foot into that school's courtyard, Byrd!\" the President shouted at his National Security Advisor. The soldiers stood resolute in the face of the wall of protesters which had formed; meanwhile, a large crowd of white adults had begun flanking the forty-five students, shouting at them, demanding they move on.\n\nFinally, after a blood-curdling hour of anxiety, Wallace felt relief as the leader of the protesters backed down, and walked the group back down to Druid High School. Local and federal authorities were investigating the matter and the students involved.

Now, metropolitan areas throughout the United States were consumed in protest, while burned in rioting.\n\n\"This is going to look horrible if we give into these miscreants, these criminals.\" Wallace said, obviously flustered over the state of the country in the face of these dangers. \"My entire party and those beyond who give support to the administration are banking on cracking down on this liberal nonsense, who wants these people around if they're just going to tear everything apart anyway? Not only that, but the economy's bound to tank with the cities under fire like they are now.\" Wallace rubbed his forehead after his venting. \"Well, sir, we already have law enforcement units in route to contain the protests, and ordered them to maintain a level of containment over the surrounding areas which had been affected by the protests. Furthermore, while police units have been issued to the larger cities in order to suppress the riots and clean up any of the damage, the perpetrating groups appear to be far from finished in regards to their actions. Having said that, federal authorities are asking for permission to go on the offensive, to safeguard the streets. Most prominently, Sacramento, New York City, and Denver have seen the worst of the riots, and the nation's law enforcement are being deployed to these areas to put an end to the riots.\"\n\nWallace had known that these people were furious, destructively so, now.

He noticed reports of stores closed off to Blacks, schools segregated, all the way to social events in southern states being designated as \"White only.\" Wallace knew that he had championed the notion of segregation and the freedoms of Americans to practice their lives as they wanted, but a creeping thought irked him all the while.

What's the status of law enforcement in the affected areas?\" The President asked Byrd. \"As far as we can tell, dozens of units of local and state police forces have been deployed in the suburban areas where the riots are taking place, and others are swerving around to deal with some of the smaller protests. Reports of arson, vandalism, battery, theft, and more have exploded in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Virginia suburbs where the states have tried to handle the riots, while federal forces are on their way to further suppress the outbreaks of violence.\"\n\nThe suburbs, places of industriousness and the growth of the family, now engulfed in the fire of hardliners.

Plastered all over television stations, the country watched as rifles were loaded and American stood against American.\n\nNear the border of Texas and Arkansas, a Texan Army National Guard base stood strong. However, arriving from nearby suburbs, a group of hardline segregationists and racial groups, calling themselves the Vandals rallied near the gates of the armory, challenging the federal government due to their softening of policy regarding segregation and the softer approach to Black America as a whole. In response, the Brigadier General commanding over the base deployed a Military Police Platoon to meet the Vandals at the gates. Now, the two groups stand in the middle of one of the tensest showdowns of American history, as the Vandals creep forward could transform the area into a bloodbath. Meanwhile, in Washington, the White House, and the President inside, was fuming. \"Those are Texas-born Guardsmen, Byrd, not one of those bastards ought to touch one of them!\" Wallace screamed. \"I understand, sir, but they can't just let the Vandals in, they can't turn the countryside into a slaughterhouse, they're just stuck sir.\" Byrd responded. Wallace and Byrd watched together as the standoff, which had been going on for about two hours up to that point, inflated the fears and anxieties of the men.\n\nAn hour later, a breakthrough for the country occurred: the leader of the Vandals backed down as they saw the potential reinforcement of another platoon of military police. Rather than risk the gunfight, the Vandals broke apart, retreating from the potential battleground. Local, state, and federal authorities are investigating any links to the Vandals and its members.

There, even though it wasn't his preference, he saw the fruits of his labor all around: blacks and whites convening in the same stores, eating at the same restaurants, and even working together to give a facelift to old black neighborhoods. The new America was something to behold, the President thought, happy about it or not. Wallace continued to drive around the area and enjoy himself.\n\nOn his way back to the White House, Wallace happened to stop at a red light next to a formerly segregated school. There, he saw a white crossing guard welcome in a little black girl for her new classes to start. The President offered a small smirk as he began to drive up the road."

President Wallace knows this is only the beginning, his segregation bills will not go along without incident. Returning back to the White House, he picks up the phone, ready to call the one man with the ability to stop this Civil Rights movement before it can truly gain steam."

Two citizens of California, Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale have founded a militant black nationalist political party, named the 'Black Panther Party'. The radicals in this movement seem to think that even the Yankee states aren't going far enough and advocate armed resistance against any pereceived discrimination and police brutality. In spite of how fringe and radical this revolutionary ideology should be to all reasonable people, this movement has been gaining members and new local chapters at a worrying pace, as your support among the general population and recent policies have given grounds to radical groups among the urban ghetto communities. Most worrying of all is the mass acquisition of arms by Black Panther groups and the practice of \"open carrying\" of firearms by black power militants, a practice that appears to be little more than an effort to provoke a violent incident."

If the Republican-Democrat Presidents before him allowed for such a program to be created there is no reason why President Wallace wouldn't do the same to destroy his even greater line of enemies. With that said, Hoover himself could very well be considered an enemy of Wallace as a man firmly entrenched in the old Republican-Democrat establishment, and giving him this much freedom to attack and harass members of the President's own party might prove to be more trouble than it is worth."

Some of them were poor, and would find it difficult to justify their presence in the neighborhood; others were members of the city's moneyed and political elite, and would find it difficult to justify their presence at such a gathering at all. But they sympathized with the effort to keep the black population of America disenfranchised, by any means necessary, up to and including murder: and for that, the Ku Klux Klan opened its arms to them.\n\nThe discussion turned to the matter at hand: how to stop the 'civil rights' lunatics from making their idiotic march from Selma to Montgomery. How could the Klan send them a message that they would never be welcome in the South? There would be celebrities in attendance, alongside the wicked King and his lackeys: Joan Baez, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett. They couldn't count on the state police to ambush the marchers like they had at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n\nSo they would be more discreet: wait until dusk, then pick off the stragglers surrounding the main body of the march, each and every night. Fear would do the rest as the dead bodies began to accumulate in ditches.\n\nThe designated notekeeper dutifully recorded the details of the plan, impressing upon the remaining Klansmen that yes, they'd better make sure the rest of their compatriots were on the same page.

He, and three other hooded Klansmen, were chasing another car, with two people inside, a white woman and a black man, that they had spotted fueling up after the civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery had begun to settle in for the night.\n\nThe Klansmen whooped, pushing their car as close to the other car as they dared. One of the Klansmen retrieved a pistol from the glovebox and shot two rounds into the rear windshield of the car ahead. The car made a sickening swerve into the center of the road, crossing the centerline, before veering back and careening into the dirt off the road. The Klansmen cried victory, and celebrated by unloading round after round into the disabled vehicle, whose windows were soon smeared red with the blood, spurting forth from every wound.\n\nAs the Klansmen drove away, they failed to notice the black man pull himself out of the ruined vehicle, his own blood indistinguishable from that of his late companion, her body ripped apart. He would wait in indescribable agony for several minutes, until he was retrieved by a passing pastor, who would tell the story of the Klansman's latest murder to an outraged public."

The mayor of Oakland has declared a state of emergency and has requested the Governor of California to deploy the National Guard to augment stretched police resources, which was approved earlier today.\n\nPresident Wallace, when asked about the developing situation, expressed his faith in the FBI to investigate, alongside local law enforcement, the circumstances surrounding the death of Newton.

It was a mutually beneficial exchange, and thus it only made economic sense to bring the Central American countries into the Perth Bloc. Indeed, not inviting them might have seemed a political slight - and it wouldn't do to give Japan any political opportunities it could exploit in America's backyard.\n\nNot everybody was happy. Some of the more independently minded, leftist countries had howled about economic surrender to the United States, about yanqui domination and exploitation.

They won't budge on keeping certain sectors of their economy closed, at least until a detailed timetable for their opening can be discussed.

And a statement did President Wallace receive, as J. William Fulbright handed the President another paper.\n\nTo George C. Wallace, President of the United States\n\nThe government of New Zealand has intensively studied the nature of request by which the United States has submitted towards the members of the Organization of Free Nations and beyond. With stark reminders of the tragedies of modern history apparent through the scarred Pacific, leadership within the New Zealand government has come to the conclusion that it is more than necessary for the governments of our two nations and beyond to attempt to piece together a strengthening of our alliance in the nature of economics and trade protections. The nations of the world need to be reminded as to the greatness, potential, and prosperity offered in the realm of democracy and a free market, and with the planning of a Pacific Trading Zone to secure such ideals, New Zealand would be a proud attendant of the conferences occurring at Perth. While the peoples spread across the Pacific live in fear under the mandates produced by the harsh nature of Japan's domination in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, New Zealanders seek to promise for themselves and for others a brighter future than ever thought before.\n\nWith justice and freedom in mind,\n\nKeith Holyoake, Prime Minister over the people of New Zealand\"\n\nPresident Wallace saw within the small paragraph on the statement the ideals of the Perth Conference forming. Of a future for a democratic economy. A safe and secure future, without the threat of Japanese incursion any longer. With fire in his eyes, he congratulated his Secretary of State with a pat on the back and a nodding of heads."

In other words, President Wallace had been begging for a distraction from the mess of paperwork on his desk; however, the sudden slamming of three knocks against the door knocked the President off guard at the sudden answering to his request. \"Come in!\" Yelled the President. J. William Fulbright rushed in, approaching the desk while handing a statement to the President. \"You're going to want to read this over, sir.\"\n\n\"To George C. Wallace, President of the United States:\n\nYour proposal to unite nation's surrounding the Japanese sphere of influence is as respectable as it is outreaching for your country. Throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere, innumerable cases of suffering produced from the actions of the Japanese military and government have occurred, and it is unfortunate to have to bear witness to these atrocities at such a close distance as the Indian government must. However, an escalation of conflict with the Empire of the Japanese would produce subsequent conflicts, with the people of India in front in such occurrences. Such a possibility is not within the grasp of the Indian nation's interests, and a coalition of economic value in an effort to bring together the members of the Organization of Free Nations possibly resorting to a loss of profit in an already ailing global economy would produce suffering for a great number of the Indian population. We simply cannot allow the risks to disrupt our promises to the Indian people of a free and independent future with such ties, and thus, we will not be attending the conferences occurring at Perth, nor the results of such conferences.\n\nWith Peace and Prosperity in mind,\n\nThe Government of the Indian nation.\"\n\n\"Damnit. Another frontline lost.\" Wallace said, flinging the piece of paper across his desk. \"I wanted to bring it up to you as soon as I received it, sir, to make sure you kne-\" Fulbright said, before being interrupted with Wallace stating, \"It's alright, Fulbright, you did your job fine.

Even if it sweetens the deal for the Aussies and Kiwis, it's not as if they need roads, hospitals, or other public infrastructure that they can't fund themselves. Much of the proposal now sitting on Wallace's desk simply distributes bloc grants to the Australian and New Zealand government, operated and disbursed at their discretion.\n\nWallace scratched his head.

Arguing that the national governments of Central America have 'capacity constraints' that prevent the adequate (or uncorrupt) distribution of funding for infrastructure projects, the proposed development package places outsize importance on American corporates with a long presence in Central America, particularly the United Fruit Company and Castle & Cooke. The two companies dominate the economies of the region and their export of agricultural produce, owning shipping, transportation, and media throughout much of Central America.\n\nWallace was a business friendly politician, to be sure, but achieving a leveling of international trade through reduced tariffs was an entirely different beast from further entrenching the dominance of American monopolies in the Caribbean. If nothing else, the outsize role played by United Fruit and Castle & Cooke would squeeze out other Americans looking to expand into Central America..."

It mixes a desperate need for infrastructure with a dearth of local private capital to fund it, leaving the massive bill squarely with the American government and taxpayer.\n\nWallace could hear the pundits screaming for blood when faced with the potential cost of winning India's participation in the Perth Agreement.

The legal details were labyrinthine in complexity, but at heart, Washington wanted to ensure that American firms would not be subject to frivolous legal disputes from governments - or expropriation - without due compensation.\n\nWhile Australia and New Zealand might back the proposal, given their robust private sectors and comparable legal framework to the U.S., the Central American nations were a different matter. The dominating presence of United Fruit and other conglomerates in their economies was a matter considerable controversy among the citizenry, and the conglomerates spent enormous sums protecting their interests.\n\nThe clause in the Perth Agreement would, hopefully, put American firms at ease; and for that reason, the negotiating team expected pushback from Central America's socialist governments.

There, the President rose to a high up podium to deliver a fiery speech regarding \"the beauty that is the green jewel of the Southern United States!\" before returning to the theme of his journey, \"to get on the asses of your senators and representatives and tell them: repeal that damned act! For your freedom, for your liberty, for your independence!\" Wallace's screams dominated the area, giving rise to the thunderous applause of the southerners who came to witness the sensation.\n\nThat evening, President Wallace took but a little while to relax and enjoy himself, thanking his wife for going with him the whole way and making it such a nice trip."

As he was enjoying himself, a knock at the door interrupted the President's breakfast, calling \"Come in!\" with a full mouth to work with. Curtis LeMay entered the Oval Office, saying \"Sorry about the interruption, Mr. President, though we are going to have to start getting work to figure the rest of the campaign out.\" Wallace nodded while fruitlessly attempting to wipe the syrup off his face.\n\n\"Mr. President, we received outstanding support for the campaign within the South, reports indicate that approval ratings regarding the repeal have jumped tremendously from before. However, this is where things get difficult: we have a choice from here.\" LeMay said, while pointing to the map ahead of him. President Wallace inspected the map, noting that while they covered the entirety of the south, it wouldn't be enough to get the repeal they needed. No. They needed to expand. The next two areas were certainly not going to be easy to get through, as their options looked to be the Northeastern United States or heading out Westward. \"You see, we have some issues here, LeMay. The Northeast has some strong liberal shitheads around the region, each one of them constantly pissing themselves whining about 'President Wallace and his racism.' The plus side is that the area is some of the least ground to cover, meaning that if we hit it and hit hard, everyone in there is going to hear it and get it drilled into them. On the other side, over in the West, they're a little bit, what's the word, uh, fickle. They could be swayed with a little bit of hammering hard, the problem is that it's a whole helluva lot of ground to cover, meaning a lot of resources and a lot of time. And, if worse comes to worse, a lot of time spent on a loss.\"\n\nThe President and his running map looked over the map carefully, looking at the benefits and problems of each trip. Either way, at least they get to get out of the White House for once, right?"

As the President was enjoying the nice rest he rarely got, he felt a calloused hand beat against his soldier. \"Hey, George, plane's gonna be descending soon and we need to make some decisions about where to head next.\"\n\nWallace got up and stretched, causing his wife to be shaken awake as well. \"Alright, you have me up now, what's the decision now, did they set D.C. on fire while I was gone?\" LeMay offered a chuckle in response, saying \"Not yet, sir; however, your entire support base will be if we don't get this passed, and to get votes, we have to start getting the word out. This is just about our last stop on the trip, and we need to decide where to go from here, sir.\" LeMay's words delivered a sense of remembrance and happiness over the past few days, feeling proud as his words branded Americans with a simple request: repeal! Wallace had to shake himself out of his daydream as he took another look at the map. \"Well, uh, what's your ideas, sir?\" LeMay asked, seeming unsure, which Wallace thought was usual by this point. \"Well, LeMay, the way I see it, we've got another two options: this time between the Rust Belt or the Great Plains of the good ole' USA.\" Wallace said, nodding his head. \"Both of these places are losing thousands of people a year, LeMay, let's make that clear; so, no matter what, we're going to have to hit precisely and accurately if we want our voice heard. The Rust Belt is historical for having a helluva lotta working Americans and political force behind it. Meanwhile, the Great Plains is known for its 'representation of the country's beauty' or whatever the fuck, giving it that good American look with some country folk who may feel happy to listen up to the possibility of getting that damned Civil Rights Act out of their hair that's plaguing what little business they have. Either way, we're going to have to spend a lot of resources in making our voices known out there.\n\nA flight attendant came nearing the President and the Vice President, offering a bright smile before saying in a thick southern drawl, \"Please, sirs, the plane's going to be descending soon, I'd like to ask you both to watch yourselves so you don't get hurt if things get bumpy.\""

Whilst the President tours the journey in an effort to raise support for the repeal of the Civil Rights Act in order to push further along in segregation policy, the legislative branch bickers and argues once more over the President's actions.\n\nIn particular, reports indicate that a small leak from within the office of the President made its way to the Senate floor, where it alleged that alleged that President Wallace had been in direct contact with a variety of law-makers for the country and manipulating them to vote alongside him in the upcoming vote which prompted the nationwide tour the President is currently engaged on. In particular, the source was unsure as to whether the President was employing payments to bribe the senators into following his footsteps in the vote or if he had collected controversial information regarding the senators and threatening to publically leak the information to secure their vote; however, the leak emphasized that the manner in which the corruption was happening didn't matter, so much as though that it was happening in the first place. News teams are spread across the capital attempting to record information in regards to the chaos on Capitol Hill, but no matter what, the people present around Washington D.C. can feel the air tighten all across the city.\n\nOne senator declared that if the President really had been resorting to such acts that he be \"removed from office with all due haste for tampering with the legal process.\" Only time may tell what will happen to the President."

The senator was dismissed from duties as he awaits a federal trial on grounds of bribery and corruption for his acts of attempting to force votes towards the repealing of the Civil Rights Act. Nevertheless, the actions of the senator does not seem to have slowed down the journey of the President as he travels across the countryside in an effort to earn the hearts and minds of Americans in an effort to repeal the same act which caused the controversy within the senate in the first place. Finally, Americans can get some rest after the momentous shocks that came from Washington these past few days, and instead, can prepare as the vote to repeal the Civil Rights Act comes closer and closer. This has been Howard Reig, with NBC Nightly News, signing off and wishing Americans across the country a goodnight!\"\n\nWallace collapsed into the bed he was sitting up in.

Orval Faubus, passionate supporter of segregation and President Wallace, declared that with Wallace's blessing he would allow local businesses to restore seperate white and black facilities, and would be ordering formerly desegregated schools to remove all non-white students immediately. His declaration was met with cheers by a crowd waving pro-segregation and confederate banners.\n\nThis has come as something of a surprise to President Wallace, as he gave no such direct blessing for the Governor to restore segregation so soon. Not every barrier to segregation's restoration has been removed, and with Brown vs Board still technically in place the matter of resegregating the schools in particular could prove extremely legally problematic. Naturally, the Governor's decree has sparked protests by civil rights activists across Arkansas, and fierce outcry from black parents whose children have suddenly found themselves turfed out of school.\n\nSegregation is a delicate matter in this current age of America, and Faubus' careless act may cause many issues indeed."

And it seems to be a school that caused Governor Faubus a great deal of consternation once before.\n\nLittle Rock Central High. In the 50's it was the site of much furore when, after the implementation of Brown vs Board, Faubus personally attempted to resist the desegregation of Arkansas by physically blocking black students from entering the building before he was removed under direct order from President Eisenhower. Now, it is a thorn in his side once again.\n\nAfter a bitter argument between staff, black students and their parents, and with some encouragement from some sympathetic teachers, the African American kids were allowed to re-enter the school in direct defiance of the Governor's order. They have declared that they have a right to be there, no matter what \"some no-good, ignorant, racist pig\" might think, as one student put it.\n\nGovernor Faubus is reportedly maintaining medically concerning levels of fury, and is already making plans to send the police and even the National Guard to the school to forcibly remove the students. Such a large and, some would say, disproportionate response is certain to cause an uproar. This could get out of hand very quickly."

Faubus was apologetic for jumping the gun, but insisted that he had no intentions of backing down, pointing out that he did now have the right to send in the National Guard as per Wallace's reforms - a fact which Wallace accepted, bitterly.\n\nThe two eventually discussed how prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. Faubus insisted that he had the experience and expertise to handle the matter on his own initiative, to which Wallace sarcastically remarked \"had worked out just amazingly so far.\" Wallace demanded that Faubus allow him to put the National Guard under federal control for the operation, so as to better manage things and prevent any further escalation. He also suggested reinforcing their ranks with reserves from the US Airborne forces, believing that their presence could deter the protestors and convince them to back down quickly.\n\nNow it was Faubus' turn to be angry, questioning why a man so determined to de-escalate the situation would consider sending in military forces. They argued for another half an hour or so, each sticking to their proposed solution. Eventually, a decision was made."

The students' parents joined their voices to their childrens' anger, and as word spread throughout the town, countless men and women soon showed up to add to the din. Within a few hours a massive protest had gathered, the National Guard now sandwiched between them and the school.\n\nIn scenes reminiscent of the most heated days of the civil rights movement, the crowd demanded equality and justice, yelling chants and waving banners at the armed Guard who could do naught but hold formation in front of the entrances to the school. As the clock struck twelve, the heat of the Arkansas afternoon brought the crowd to a fever pitch. A small group of counter protesters arrived to hurl abuse at the demonstrators, which only added to the tension. Facing a cacophony of fury and boxed in from all sides, the National Guard slowly began to lose their patience.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Little Rock had become a tinderbox.

As their demands for entry became more forceful, one of the guardsmen became increasingly twitchy as the leader approached him. As she cried out for equality, he snapped.\n\nHe would later claim to have felt threatened by her presence. Others would ask however an armed and armored white man could possibly feel threatened by a young black student who just wanted to learn.\n\nThe crowd froze as the shot rang out. The guardsman, his gun in hand. The activist, bloodied and dying, falling to the ground. And then chaos.\n\nSome ran in terror. Others charged forwards in fury. Now in complete panic, the other guards released more shots into the crowd in a desperate attempt to restore control. Two more young protestors would be dead by the end of the day. One brick thrown by an outraged student would send one of the guards into a coma from which he would never wake.\n\nAs the chaos unfurled across Central High, just as it soon would across all Little Rock and through America, the first journalists arrived on the scene. The images they would capture, of the blood and the dust and the bodies of students and the terrified children watching from the school windows would soon be broadcast across the nation.

The investigation's not in our hands anymore, and we're going to be called to give testimony at some point.\"\n\nWallace swore.

Even if the people are still skeptical of Wallace's good faith, the statement might be enough to tie the NPP together, buying more time for the administration to craft its defense in Congress.\n\nOthers advocate a more confrontational approach, from claiming that the entire mess isn't Wallace's fault and pinning it on military discipline, to continuing to advocate for law and order and ignoring the administration's role in the crisis. While elements of these approaches would allow us to directly challenge the facts of the case - or, in the case of the latter, try to get back to the business of actually governing America - the response of our allies in the NPP, to say nothing of public opinion, will most likely be sharply negative.\n\nThere's only one shot to get this right."

Now, citizens, politicians, and even his own cabinet members are asking, no, demanding an answer from the President regarding the happenings at Little Rock. \"Mr. President, we go live in 3, 2, 1...\"\n\n\"Good morning, my dear fellow Americans out there. The past day has been filled with emotions of terror, anger, and grief. Yesterday morning, as Little Rock Central High School opened its doors to begin the school day, a group of expelled African-American students began marching in a column towards the doors. As they marched, they were met with fierce resistance by counter-protesters looking to block the young adults from entering the school, prompting federal soldiers to attempt to de-escalate the situation. In the growing tension and rising violence, they were forced to make a terrible decision to maintain law and order, and opened fire into the group of students to disperse the combatants. The injured and dead were collected by the soldiers ordered to guard the area, in total amounting to fourteen dead African-American students and thirty-six injuries. Ladies and gentlemen, no matter who you are out there, this is a shameful tragedy that my administration is hard at work to investigate the nature and surroundings of the event. Any student being shot and killed is a terror that we wish to do away with in modern society for the United States, and it is unfortunate that as great as our country is, we must suffer as we do now. I ask you all to stay united, to stand strong in these times of crisis. Do not riot or protest; rather, stand with us, and we will do all we can for justice. For country, for family, for party, for freedom and justice for all.\"\n\nThe flashes of cameras continued to plague the President, but acting harshly would only drive this situation worse. \"Let them take the pictures, let them be the first to know that George C.

With that in mind, the House Oversight Committee had wasted no time in calling on a wide range of witnesses involved in the decisions leading up to the Little Rock Massacre, ranging from the soldiers on the ground to White House staffers privy to the most sensitive decisions by the administration.\n\nWallace flicked through the list of witnesses and attached rationale provided by the House investigators. It was an expansive list, on an aggressive timetable. Wallace grimly noted that his administration would only be enough time to fully coordinate and lock down the stories of one of the two groups of individuals summoned - the soldiers on the ground, or the staffers helping issue the orders.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the matter of the NPP legislators on the House Oversight Committee, and how willing they'd be to softball the investigation. With the Center-NPP on the verge of revolt, this too would be no easy task, but surely, leaning on members of your own party was more acceptable than coaching witnesses?"

A crack; had a weapon discharged? An exchange of harried glances down the line, followed by another crack, then screams. The crowd surged forth. Rifles up. No time to aim, except at center mass.\n\nIt all sounds like a terrible accident, and we could argue as such, that the confusion and ambiguity makes any presumption of impeachable intent ridiculous. That being said, none of that changes the fact that all of the dead were from the African-American demonstrators, and in light of that there is no assurance ambiguity will be a believable defense. Indeed, we would open ourselves to accusations that the ambiguous orders were by design, a mobster's suggestion to avoid accountability for upholding 'the law' of segregation.\n\nWe could get the soldiers to 'agree' that they were not explicitly authorized to use force, but did so anyway, on their own judgment. It is a clear admission of blame that lets us off the hook, but preparing the 'incentives' for the soldiers to testify in this way would be expensive and unethical, to say nothing of how the military could be affected by being made into a political scapegoat."

But legalese and government records have their own way of obfuscating essential truths, which could really only be parsed by bystanders intimately familiar with the background of their creation.

Thornton already seems up his own ass about his innocence about shooting a bunch of kids; so, if we use him, we can show that the \"peaceful protests\" among the African-American students there were a lot more bloody than the media claims it to be. Plus, if they're disgusted, no matter what, Thornton's statements will be in pride of his own actions, distancing us from his orders in all regards if things go the other way.\n\nWallace took a few moments to think about the plan, when an idea struck him. \"Sadowski, we aren't going to use the kid, Jameson?\" Wallace said. \"Well, we weren't planning to, why?\" he responded. \"Cause if we poke holes in his claims, we succeed in showing that he and the media blew his credibility out of proportion, and show that my policy about segregating they're kind is right, showing they can't be trusted.\" Sadowski and the legal team had to take a minute to process Wallace's radical proposal for a defense, because it could actually make sense due to the segregation argument.

Wallace forever. However, it would be unwise to treat the intermission as a mere break to catch their breath and make any last prayers. No, this intermission was to be one of the most dynamic points of the entire trial, according to Sadowski, and Wallace enjoyed the prospects of potential victory being in their grasp, no matter how desperate the situation may have been at the time. Thus, Sadowski and the rest of the team began their plotting and scheming for the President, while Wallace himself enjoyed the quietness. \"Finally, those old assholes won't be on their guard.

Oh, how the taste of progress will be sweet once he claws his way out of here.\n\nOn the other end of the table, the team of attorneys were worried. The estimations weren't concluding enough results.

Having said that, the darker side of such supposedly \"valiant\" leaders of the country were beginning to show everywhere. Shadows lie everywhere when the light of the innocent is snuffed from the world.\n\nOne of the attorneys on the team defending Wallace beckoned him closer to him, protecting against the inquisitive ears in the room. Finally, Wallace had gotten close enough to hear what the man was so worried about telling him, and the news he heard back was well worth the effort: some of the senators aligned with the Far Right of the National Progressive Party had been discussing voting in favor of the impeachment and removal of Wallace from office. Wallace nearly fell out of his chair, crushed over the news. The treason, the betrayal, had these senators no honor left at all? \"Fucking vultures, why wouldn't they help me, they've supported me in everything that's happened so far?\" Wallace whispered loudly, the lawyer seeing tears well up in the President's eyes. \"Sir, the best estimate I can offer you is that if the vote happens to condemn you anyway, they do not want to be lumped in with those that wished to support you, sir.\" The President had to contain himself from smashing the top of the table with his fist. \"This wasn't right. They were allies, Hell, some of them were fucking friends, people you'd shake hands with and talk about the big game with.\" Wallace thought. \"Fine, fucking fine.

Together, they saw that same unfortunate truth, and in that truth, the potential need for redirection. However, where one ally may fall, more arise. The R-Ds may be harboring promises of \"stability\" and \"steady progress for a truly united America,\" however, what about the underbelly of such claims? What about those strong conservatives among the Democrats, the ones who promised their constituents a free and liberty-filled life during their time being one of the two greatest representatives of their state to the Union? What if such sympathetic characters managed to be swayed under the pleas of a bullied and harassed southerner who has fought gallantly in protecting the freedoms for the people of the United States?

While it was getting difficult to breathe, the President stood resolute, even as the vein pushed out along his neck. \"I did everything I could for the people of America, but know, they want to paint me as some monster at the end of the day.\" The counting of votes and occasional \"Yea\" and \"Nay\" interrupted the President's train of thought, causing him to tighten his grip on the table he sat at, now showcasing white knuckles to the entirety of the Senate. With every vote, the anxiety, fear, and anger grew within Wallace tenfold. \"How could they do this?\" He thought. \"Do they realize the embarrassment of a second President removed from office in a row?

The man can't run politics correctly, good luck getting him to shit rainbows and a successful economy for the American people.\"\n\nWallace waited. His legal team waited. His whole cabinet waited.

Yesterday, the people of America were awoken to a news headline soaked in blood. A news headline displaying the images of schoolchildren, dead on the steps of a large school called Little Rock Central High School. With these school-children disobeying the law and being met with fierce resistance from civilians acting as a counter-force to the children, the National Guardsmen were forced to make a difficult decision in a difficult situation. However, much to our despair, such a decision would not have had to be made if the outdated systems of the federal government and the extensive bureaucracy of the armed forces had made haste. Rather, having to pass the message along to the next person in a long chain of officials down into the military, the order was unfortunately held up by unnecessary traffic in communication centers across the country. Thus, in what should have been an easy call to make, the bloat of our government led to the killing of fourteen children, and the injury of thirty-six more. This is a disgrace of our government, of restraining the executive branch from executing just orders to stop the bloodshed from those willing to slay these children like animals. It is not right, and I, alongside the talented members of my administration, will do all we can to make sure nothing like this ever happens again, and will find out just who allowed such a bloodbath to happen in the first place. God bless the United States of America, and God bless you all.\"\n\nFinally, the camera clicked having finally ended the live broadcast. President Wallace asked, \"Is it done?\" The leader of the news crew responded with \"Absolutely, thank you, sir.\" Wallace followed the thanks with a simple \"Good, now get out, now.\" prompting White House Security to move the crew out of the building immediately."

But before we hold this critical vote, I believe we need to discuss what really matters. I come before you today to speak about a subject very dear to my heart...\"\n\nIt became immediately clear that this was indeed a filibuster. Rather than focus on the matter at hand, the senator began a lengthy reading of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, his favorite book from his youth. Despite the ridiculousness of the situation, filibuster is of course a protected practice. His voice was clear and driven, and at no point did he falter, leave for the bathroom or do anything that could bring the filibuster to an end. Even worse, lain out in front of him was a myriad of other reading material - it was clear that he was in this for the long haul.\n\nAside from giving in to the filibuster, we have two main courses of action. We could attempt to call a cloture vote - a vote to end the filibuster and immediately ratify the agreement. However, this requires us to secure a two-thirds majority. As time goes on, more and more people will be eager to see this filibuster come to a close, so an alternative is to wait it out until we can be sure we have enough support for a cloture vote to pass."

There are already some promising signs, however, with the Dollar surging on the stock exchange as the markets respond positively to this historic development.

However, the presidency itself comes with caveats, one of which is that campaign promises are often only half-fulfilled.\n\nThe C-NPP, the general progressive party of the United States, begrudgingly supported Smith during her presidential campaign, and now expects her to support their pro-laborer demands. Under their leadership, and with the support of the Smith Administration, the C-NPP could unravel the President's business support, killing her chances at re-election.

Consequently, economic progressivism has seen a massive resurgence in the C-NPP and other groups, and they have become so vocal about their rhetoric that they are now impossible to ignore.\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith is famously pro-employer, but should she wish to pass some of her legislation, she must gain the support of the C-NPP. As outright pushing for pro-employee policies is out of the question, the President believes that better relations between businesses and laborers is the most effective and prudent solution to the problem.

All-in-all, the United States of America is in bad shape.\n\nLuckily for the States, however, it has a president and congress who mostly recognize the issue, and are willing to do anything to put an end to it. While President Margaret Chase Smith wants most Americans to have access to welfare programs that would allow the poor and infirm to get back on their feet, she also knows that the federal budget could not allow for massive expansion of welfare.

Yet, for decades, women have been refused leave from work to care for their child following birth. For such a crucial time in infantile development, precious little attention is given to it by the law. While it is true that some employers will allow new mothers to take perhaps a few unpaid days or weeks off work to care for their child, many do not. Consequently, many new moms are either forced to leave their children at home with a babysitter while they work- an increasingly expensive proposition- or take their infants to work with them, where they put immense stress on their mothers.\n\nAs most politicians are male, relatively few are more aware of this problem than President Margaret Chase Smith. She knows better than most that women not only deserve maternity leave, but require it. Raising a new generation is neither easy nor cheap, and thus, the President will press state legislatures to pass laws that mandate maternity leave, preferably of the paid variety."

This state of affairs cannot continue, for the sake of all those Americans forced to work long hours in poor conditions for the bare-minimum in wages, and President Smith acknowledges such.\n\nUnder the President's new economic reforms, the ability to unionize will no longer be a privilege for American workers, but an inextricable right. Previously, unionization was only protected at the state-level, with virtually no federal regulation in the matter. In her new legislation, the National Labor Relations Board would be given the authority to protect American workers' unions across state lines, greatly increasing the strength of the employees against their potentially unfair employers."

At the time being, the best we can do is grant economic security to the most low-income of people in American society; the blind, disabled, and those who have to provide for others, like single mothers.\n\nIn her most recent bill in a long but unfinished list, President Smith and her Congressional allies have worked together to create the American Economic Security Act, which will guarantee financial aid for those who either cannot work or cannot support their families, namely the disabled and low-income families. It will not be a great stipend, and likely won't have a great effect on rates of homelessness and poverty, but it will be a start."

The elderly often bankrupt themselves or drain their life savings trying to keep up with bills from their often-necessary medical care. For a group of people far more likely to suffer health problems, this news is plainly unacceptable. In order to rectify the issue, the President and her allies in Congress have drafted a new bill to create a new federal program to assist the elderly: Americare.\n\nIn this new healthcare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years of age, or those suffering from serious, lifelong conditions, would become subject to government-provided health insurance. Americare would not discriminate along racial or monetary grounds either, with full coverage regardless of race, gender, income, or other factors.

As young, unschooled children are at a very important developmental stage of their lives, having poor familial connection is devastating. To ensure the health of our working mothers, as well as the future generation of Americans they are raising, President Margaret Chase Smith has proposed greatly lessening the financial strain that children place upon their parents. This would be achieved through extreme cuts to taxes upon single mothers who work full-time, increased social security with less extreme benefits given to low-income families in which both parents are employed."

While many government laws over the past hundred years have tried to increase safety in the American workplace, these have been few and far between.\n\nHowever, due to extensive, somewhat-bipartisan campaigning and President Smith's cooperation with the C-NPP, this standard may be ready to change. The President and her allies in Congress have penned the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, for short. It would provide for the establishment of a new federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which will cooperate with workers unions and health experts to determine which workplace practices are safe, and which are not. In order to ensure business compliance, OSHA guidelines are not just advisory, but mandatory, with violators severely fined.

In the former, preferred by the President and most conservatives in Congress, the United States government would heavily subsidize insurance companies across America to keep medical expenses for the individual relatively low. This option is not without its downsides, however; these insurance companies are still businesses, and thus are primarily for-profit, so there will still be a not-insignificant price-tag.\n\nIn a state-provided system, supported mainly by the C-NPP and progressive elements of Congress, the government itself would be the primary care provider, with tax income serving as the payment method. This system would almost completely eliminate the cost of medical care for the patient. However, it would also cost significantly more, and lead to a massive increase in federal spending. It also runs the risk of angering private insurance companies, who may not take kindly to free, state-provided healthcare."

As they had no intention of choosing a lifelong career or profession, not many attended college.\n\nNow, this status quo is being challenged as more and more women begin to seek higher education and white-collar jobs. This \"Quiet Revolution\"- so called because of how the change has gone relatively unnoticed by society at large- represents a fundamental change in how women view themselves and their place in the world.

The party had nearly consumed itself after 1964, with the progressive and labor-friendly Center group, now led by the avowed socialist Michael Harrington, clashing incessantly with George Wallace's Far Right bloc, espousing 'states' rights' and free business. The two only begrudgingly agreed on actively resisting Japan, which the R-Ds paid plenty of lip service to anyway.\n\nAs party divisions escalated openly going into the midterms, Smith - whose tenure in Washington, orthodox economics, and Maine liberalism could open doors across the party - had sat the two factions down. She'd flatly warned that their squabbles were hemorrhaging support for the NPP, unless they put their differences aside behind a novel candidate - Smith herself. Wallace and Harrington had grudgingly agreed, if only because the alternative was the political wilderness.\n\nBut now that Smith had won the White House, in defiance of political gravity in the NPP, reality would soon come crashing back down. And although Smith has her own ambitions - in labor, healthcare, women's rights, and the fight against Japan - none of them would matter if the NPP went up in smoke."

The expressions of everyone else in the room tightened instantly. Smith smiled; of course everybody knew the story of how one of the major political parties of the pre-Civil War era had imploded, fracturing under the weight of its own contradictions concerning the great question of its day - slavery.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the NPP is going the way of the Whigs, but with Wallace on our right and Harrigton to the left, we're not too far from that scenario either.\" Smith paused, letting the room absorb the magnitude of the task at hand. \"The papers are saying that having a woman in the Oval Office is history in its own right. But any President is judged by the legacy they leave behind, and I refuse to have this administration be a footnote to the divisions in our own party!\" "

Flanked only by the deputies of the NPP's center and leftist caucus, the President had the audacity to declare, presumably without consulting her colleagues to the right, that the government would make \"the addressing of economic inequality and the cause of civil justice\" a priority.'\n\n'By all means, we welcome measures aimed at addressing the plight of the rural poor and disadvantaged. Our readers know many in need of such help. But we must ask, in the name of good and decent government, whether government funds will be productively used; that is, whether we are teaching a man to fish, or simply handing them a fish.

But now here they were, two creatures of differing political camps in need of each other.\n\nSmith opened the meeting. \"Mr. Harrington, you know as well as I do that the NPP is being pulled apart between the Center and the Far Right. And if we're going to get anything done in the next four years, I need at least one of the two to support legislation in Congress.\"\n\n\"Believe me, the Center is more than happy to help, just as we have on civil rights in the past.\" Harrington replied brightly, before pausing.\n\n\"I assume there's a 'but' coming?\" Smith said.\n\nHarrington nodded. \"My colleagues and I joined the NPP to have a shot at reforms for the working class - real reforms, not just the kind of band-aid fixes proposed by the R-Ds and opposed by the Far Right.

We cannot confirm whether these incidents are more frequent than those found widespread a decade ago, but we can confirm that the frequency of reports has increased since President Smith took office.

That required a sustainable majority, and votes were precious in Washington, with a price tag to match - and so Wallace had been invited to a 'morning coffee' in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Well, I'd love to help you, Madame President.\" Wallace said, flashing a genteel smile. \"Good roads, strong businesses, and sticking it to the Japanese. I think we'd work well together.\"\n\nSmith mustered as neutral an expression as she could. \"And what about civil rights?\"\n\nWallace grimaced. \"I won't pretend that the country's not moving how some of my fellows want it to, and I know America's going to be a different place after I'm dead and gone.

The two sides jostle, and the stands vibrate with a crackling animosity.\n\nAmidst the tangle, an Army linesman's helmet jerks backward from an errant fist. He slams into a Navy receiver, who tumbles violently into an Army cornerback. Pandemonium reigns as the teams descend into a brawl, teammates rushing from the sidelines as the energy of the stands explodes into a frenzy.\n\nAfterwards, a Pentagon spokesperson sheepishly attributes the incident, and its numerous injuries, to 'excessive exuberance.' The press is far less circumspect, comparing the football brawl to the recent mudslinging on Capitol Hill, lamenting the sorry state of a government too consumed by infighting to lead the nation."

She had hoped, against the evidence, that the Army would retain a semblance of professionalism. These hopes were now dashed, as Chief of Staff Bryce Harlow's investigation into the leaks tormenting her Administration had identified Brigadier General Alexander Haig as the link between the Army and the press, distributing the key memos linking John Stennis to the Navy's segregation debacle.\n\nResigning in protest, and then loudly complaining about it, was a time-honored tradition, and President Smith had resigned herself to dealing with the fallout of Stennis' mismanagement of the Army. But this level of trickery? It was behavior she'd come to expect from the R-Ds - but not from an Army looking to do an end-run around their President.\n\nHer hands shook gently as she took her reading glasses off, chewing on the arms in a quiet fury. If the Army wanted to play with fire, then they could burn: she could publicly axe General Haig, making an example of him to the cheers of the NPP. At the same time, she could imagine the fury that would inspire in the remaining Army staff, even if they got the message. Would satisfying her fury be worth it?"

He'd even gone so far as to advertise his 'good offices', if the President needed 'somebody to smooth things over with the Army.'\n\n\"I've had enough of this,\" President Smith muttered, before slamming Harlow's investigation file onto the desk. \"Read the first page aloud, General Haig. Tell me all about your friends in the press and on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nHaig fell silent. He didn't pick up the papers.\n\n\"I don't care that you don't respect me; I'm not here to win your vote.\" President Smith said testily. \"But if you can't respect the office of the Commander in Chief - if you can't pick up a piece of paper when I tell you to - then you need to get out.\"\n\nAnother few seconds of silence. \"You have until noon tomorrow, if you want to go quietly.

The Army officials at the hearing noticeably bristled in their seats. Some looked to the R-D's on the committee to offer them some cover.\n\nNone did.

The Japanese have paid greatly in blood in uprooting the foreigner from the land they exploit, and this effort will not be in vain. To have American naval presence in the South China Sea would be considered an insult to all those who gave their lives to the liberation of Asia, the countless tombs in the depths of the Pacific would be disgraced as soon as the approval is given.

As the hours continued, she heard horrific reports of the aerial battles over Australia, as increasing amounts of American aircraft are shot out of the sky, until they reach their graves below, coated in fuel, fire, and blood. Land forces were ordered to mobilize and prepare for a full on invasion plan of the Pacific Islands, as various leading generals yelled at one another over competing battle plans and how to finally bring down the Japanese Empire, in their minds. On top of it all, the Seventh fleet reported that they're prepared to regroup, but the Japanese look to be preparing a counterattack, one which could decimate the fleet if they do not get the reinforcements they need out there. The Pacific was on fire, and the inferno was only spreading, as the Final Pacific War had begun!

He is in the process of putting together a speech to recognize the Imperial Japanese Army's accidental shooting down of Mr. Stennis's aircraft, and is allowing complete access of the United States Navy to attempt to search for the wreckage, in order to 'alleviate tensions.'

It appears that the Prime Minister has signaled that they do not wish to press the issue forward any longer, and 'seeing that tensions are high with the President' as he put it, has decided to grant access to the American Navy into the South China Sea to search for the wreckage, and hopefully recover Secretary of Defense Stennis.

She didn't need to be reminded that things were not looking good. The newspapers, the TV news, just listening to the staff in the White House, everyone was talking about the imminent dissolution and political irrelevance of the National Progressive Party. Her goals, her efforts to unite the party was crumbling. Her efforts to make the NPP more than just the unending opposition to the Republican-Democrats, to turn it into an actual option for the American people, was falling apart.\n\nAgnew spread his hands as he stood in front of the desk, and took a deep breath. \"I think we should make our positions clear, Madam President.

Make it clear that you will listen and work with everyone in the party. However, when a decision has been made, it's important that we all work together to get it passed. Party unity is much, much more important than winning political points. That needs to be made crystal clear. But, at the same time, if you stand against the decision, if you break ranks, if you leave, then you are on your own. We won't help you. If you leave for the R-Ds, you are a person non grata.\"\n\nChase pondered what her Vice President was suggesting.

All this, while letting the Republican-Democrats lean back and watch the fireworks, occasionally throwing a bit more gasoline on the fire when they finally got the chance to stand up and speak at the podium. Journalists were loving every second of it. Newspapers were going wild with the stories that were coming out. Only TV networks, without film footage from a still camera shy Congress, were restrained from turning the Congress into a pay-per-view wrestling match.\n\n\"What are you suggesting, Spiro?\" President Smith said. She still was determined, and resolute, but she knew when she needed assistance. All her years in the House and Senate never prepared her for this. That's where the Vice President came in.\n\nAgnew was sitting on one of the couches in the center of the room, right above the carpeted Presidential Seal, legs crossed. \"We just need some more time.

With the spirit of Southern Hospitality, the meetings in the homes and offices of Senator Strom Thurmond, and George Wallace's hotel room in the Willard Hotel have been the scene of many a long night of drinks, smoking, and backroom politicking.\n\nEventually, the leaders of the FR-NPP present Agnew with something they would want in the event of a massive bill. While the majority of the FR is segregationist and would love nothing better than to roll back civil rights, that is off the table thanks to the public pressure. However, they also fought for the \"little man\" and those left behind, and so they wanted something else: a massive aid program for the South. Low or no interest loans for farmers, subsidies for new industries, and efforts to alleviate the impoverishment of the region that stretched back as far as the aftermath of the Civil War. And of course, every Senator, Representative and Governor will have their own pork barrel project: a big bridge across an uncrossed river, a contract to a local business, or some new courthouses and police stations.\n\nNow, any administration could propose such a program and most likely get it through Congress. However, the problem is that it would be massively expensive, and with all the other possible additions to the bill it could make the national debt balloon and make many deficit hawks start screaming to the heavens. So, will we play ball and add what the FR-NPP wants, or try to pass the law without their support?"

Money would be provided to refurbish and repair schools, provide new textbooks, train more teachers, hire nurses and qualified therapists, provide a robust school lunch system, improve school gymnasiums, playgrounds and other activities, and much more. This would mostly focus on schools in the inner cities of the Northeast and Midwest that have been suffering since the rise of \"white flight\" to the suburbs in the past couple of decades, which have resulted in gaps in funding and the drop of test scores and the prospects for their graduates, if they even can.\n\nSponsoring an education bill that would give a lot of money to schools around the nation is a pretty popular idea (after all, who doesn't want to help the children?), but adding it to this law will be very expensive and add a lot of red ink to the federal budget. So it's up to Vice President Agnew if he wants to add this to the bill to unify the NPP or not."

As one of the two main leaders of the Centre wing of the National Progressive Party, it's vital that Agnew find out what he wants to try to bring the party closer together.\n\nHarrington's strong support for the working class has never faltered, and his proposal to the VP is massive in scope: the establishment of a federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, to facilitate collective bargaining and rule on unfair labor practices.\n\nThe NLRB, in Harrinington's view, would give more power to the workers and their unions, and rebalance the American economy away from the single minded efforts of wealth generation for the already rich and wealthy, but to enable safe workplaces, a living wage, and benefits for employees, and to enforce fines and penalties on companies that attempt to suppress unions. Harrington said he would like to make this new body as non-partisan as possible, so he'd be willing to have members of the FR-NPP, and maybe even R-Ds, to sit on it's board.\n\nWhile the idea of supporting unions and their millions of dues-paying members is a sound political strategy, and wouldn't even be horribly expensive compared to other programs and ideas members of the NPP have proposed, it would result in more costs for companies with the higher wages and increased standards required, and some of the conservative, pro-business politicians of the NPP would be loathe to support such a measure.

Explicitly, cut the taxes on some of America's largest corporations, and perhaps a few of the very rich as well. After decades of mismanagement by a bloated federal government dumping the hard earned wealth of \"job creators\" and the \"engines of prosperity\" into a black hole of bureaucracy and thousands of niche programs, it's time to reward these guys and their companies with a bit of a kickback. With these new resources, they can invest back into the economy by expanding their business, hiring new workers, acquire new technology and all that good stuff that will, undoubtedly, make everyone much, much better off in the long run.\n\nIt's hard to tell how much of what Cohn is suggesting is true, that these companies need just a few million more tax-free dollars to make their companies grow even more, or if it's really just an excuse to grant even larger paychecks to the executives or dividends to the stockholders. The gap in revenue from lower corporate taxes will have effects on other parts of the federal budget that will have to be covered with raised taxes elsewhere, or even more debt.

Even if everyone had a chance to go over all the details, and debate the bill on the floor of the Senate, voting against the bill will likely result in you voting against your own best interests, both in having popular suggestions scuttled, or in having your supporters consider you a traitor, corrupted by the Washington elite.\n\nWhile not everyone got what they wanted in the bill, hopefully enough people, from enough factions of the party, did so that they will vote for it.

Toss some more generous welfare benefits to appease Harrington and Jackson, some directed funding to the south to appeal to the segregationists, a few Buy American riders and regulation cutting for the businessmen.

If you are Margaret Chase Smith, the answer seems to be that it's next to impossible.\n\nThe debate and politicking to get the different wings of the party working together to try to get the Budget of [GetYear] put together to give everyone some of what they want has run on too long, resulted in too many frayed tempers and shouting matches, and even a fistfight or two, so Vice President Spiro Agnew has basically ignored all of the proposals, writing his own version of the budget with a couple allies in Congress. On the surface, all the programs and ideas that had been suggested by the different wings of the NPP have been added in, but digging into the numbers, it's clear that they are much reduced, with only a fraction of the money asked for.\n\nThis action is yet another \"Intolerable Act\" by the party leadership, as one C-NPP Congressman declared, referencing the laws that pushed the colonies to revolt almost 200 years ago. Already many members of the NPP, excepting those of Smith's and Agnew's faction of the FR-NPP, are crying foul, and it seems clear that this effort at party unity is dead in the water."

However, the primary victim of the bill's failure, or more appropriately, non-starter, is landing on the White House. The fact that President Maragret Chase Smith, having already brought the NPP into chaos and collapse, apparently has no interest in negotiating with anyone to get out of the mess, and has resulted in more rumored defections and speculation fracturing of the NPP coalition.\n\nWhile spokespeople for the President, speaking off the record of course, are saying it was Vice President Agnew who had suggested the plan in the first place, and seemingly tried to sabotage it to undermine the President, but few are taking this suggestion seriously.\n\nEither way: the National Progressive Party is in crisis, and there now seems to be no way to fix it."

The easiest solution could be agreeing to Larry's terms; agreeing to raise the minimum wage would be seen as radical by some, but was sufficiently progressive enough to placate the Center without antagonizing the right too much. A peaceful, negotiated end to the strikes would have its advantages... if all the farmers agreed to it.\n\nAnd then, there was Chavez. Going along with his plan would likely elicit a violent reaction from the Far Right; increasing pensions and reducing work hours, not just at Delano but attempting to do so nationwide, would be a showstopper for the Far Right.

The National Guard would then be deployed only in limited numbers to protect scabs and federal workers from the strikers.\n\nA potential compromise solution, presented after the meeting by Nathan Wolkimir of the National Federation of Federal Employees and backed by the friendly union leaders Alan Whitney and John Griner, aims to split the UFPC and thus leave Rademacher's NALC as clear leaders of the strike.

Legislators are saying whatever they want to the press, as usual. Nothing's getting done today.\n\n1650: POTUS dragged Harrington and Wallace into the Oval Office earlier in a come-to-Jesus moment.

The resentment had accumulated like so much dust, starting with clandestine side meetings over contentious policies, leading to arguments over committee seniority, and finally devolving to frequent committee recesses just to prevent a public walkout.\n\nAnd if the essence of leadership came from the top, the White House wasn't helping. The President no longer presided; she was partisan, and that had just added fuel to the fire. Now, even simple things were exercises in Sisyphean futility, and Jackson had to watch it all.\n\nThe two NPP 'colleagues' refused to answer Jackson's plea for unity. Sighing, Jackson looked back at his list, mostly scratched out. \"What about O'Hara? He's a lawyer, a member of the local Chamber of Commerce-\"\n\n\"No.\" The Far-Right representative cut Jackson off. \"He's NAACP; how am I selling that to Wallace?\"\n\nThe Center man bristled. \"So we're only running racists in the South these days?\"\n\nAs the two returned to insulting each other, Jackson crossed off yet another name in the list, and sighed. At this rate, the R-D's might end up getting the seat after all."

There are less errant press conferences, and feverish walk-backs of erroneous statements. Voters are starting to come back to our rallies and town halls. The NPP, even if it remains a party divided internally, is at least taking care to no longer show those divisions as openly as it once did, and finds that the way forward in Washington is far easier for it."

Whatever that may mean to them personally, the NPP promises them that tomorrow will be better than today. The marriage between the cadres of the Center and the warriors of the Far Right may be a strange one, but it is working - and crucially, the American people believe it might be a lasting one."

 chase.eco.1.desc:0 "Margaret steeled herself when Agnew announced his Oval Office visit with a jaunty tune. More often than not, a good day for the phlegmatic Vice President foretold a litany of headaches in hers. She eyed the newspaper roll tucked into the sauntering man's arm crook.\n\n\"Madam President,\" he said, proffering today's issue of The Washington Post. Margaret swiped it off his hands and unfurled its pages; half a second later, the newspaper flew an arc onto a switched-on paper shredder atop the Resolute Desk. With barely-repressed glee, the President watched the contraption tear Strom Thurmond's raisin-wrinkled mug, and the bold-faced words \"'PINKO-LOVING TURNCOAT': SEN. THURMOND BLASTS MCS IN SESSION\", into ribbons of day-old paper.\n\nShe turned her withering glare to Agnew, who shrugged as he dusted bits of Thurmond and libel off his lapels. \"Can't say I didn't warn you, Ma'am.\"\n\nThe President of the United States ground out a long-suffering sigh. She pretended the simper her advisor sported was a trick of the light."

Her attention turned to the Situation Room's other occupants. \"Jeane?\"\n\nSecretary of State Jeane Kirkpatrick grimaced. \"We shouldn't give in to the radicals any more than we already have,\" she muttered, arms crossed.\n\nThat meant the vote was now 1-1, minus Agnew. \"John?\"\n\n\"All I know is wrangling JCS, Madam President,\" said Secretary of Defense John Stennis shruggingly. \"I'd appreciate if that's all I'll ever need to know.\"\n\nAlso as expected: the Pentagon's neutrality unless their budget was on the line.

As it turned out, we were both wrong.\"\n\nThe luncheon began with high hopes tacked to it by everyone involved. Wall Street needed something to reassure its stockholders just as much as the President needed something to reassure the Rightists that she wasn't just brown-nosing Harrington and his ilk. Pundits, insiders and the press corps - the Three Norns of the Beltway - had already trumpeted the consequent meeting as a reaffirmation of a symbiotic relationship as old as the Civil War.\n\n'So much for trusting precedent,' thought the President grumblingly.\n\n\"I personally wouldn't call labor reform part of precedent-\"\n\n\"What did I say about listening to my thoughts, Ted?\""

GAO published the ten-year cost projections for it around a week prior.\"\n\n\"How much?\" said President Smith.\n\nThe Secretary pursed his lips for a long moment, before responding with a conservative estimate. \"Hundreds of billions.\"\n\nLike a choir, the Cabinet Room sucked sharp breaths in tandem. Silence reigned until Vice President Agnew chimed in with a suggestion. \"Suppose we let the states fund a portion themselves.\"\n\n\"Then the costs go down. Considerably. Getting them onboard is another problem entirely...\"\n\nLong trailed off. Smith filled in the gaps herself - one gap shaped like the American South, in particular. Still added expenses for their state governments, but with much more leeway on what to spend, how much to spend... and who they should spend on. The federal government would have no choice in the latter.\n\nWith the specter of Wallace looming over their heads, Margaret Chase Smith decided:"

The speeches themselves might as well have been carbon copies of each other at first covers' glance, with the same words, the same margins and even the same headings - excepting every copy's page eight.\n\nIn the first draft's version, President Smith spent three whole paragraphs extolling the virtues of expanded, if not universal healthcare, and the specific initiatives her administration will enthusiastically pursue towards that end. The second's replaced the aforementioned excerpts with detailed plans for improving labor protections for every American worker. The third had a page eight inasmuch as it lacked a page twelve; vague, off-handed references to poverty relief dispersed throughout the text substituted for condensed policy proposals that took up a whole leaf.\n\nWhen Agnew returned, he immediately fed two of the drafts to a paper shredder.

I've read the bill end to end; with how little it actually solves all the paper you've wasted on it's worth only for toiletry!\n\n\"Where are the just shares for laborers working eight-to-eights eight days a week?\" he roared, making wide, sweeping gestures of his arms with every crescendo. \"Where are the lifelines between America's cornucopian fields and America's teeming famished? Where are our safeguards against predators with more wealth than the Lord and none of His mercy?\"\n\nBy now the bill had become an uneven layer of office paper blanketing the Great Seal in white, circumscribing an angry, panting Jeremiah. \"This is no proposal Madam President: this is an ultimatum guised as one. And there will be no deal unless you deal with the people with better faith than what you had offered me.

Both switched between boring holes into her skull and into their opposite's through sheer force of will. Cigar smoke wafted from an ash tray, just beyond her shaky fingertips, atop a table carved out of a shipwreck. The grandfather clock had just struck an ungodly hour: ten, midnight, quarter to four.\n\nThe President sighed. What a perfect microcosm of the NPP. God willing, an inaccurate one come - she glanced at the clock, its arms fixed at half past two - the early morning.\n\nOne moment stretched into several dozen as neither Smith, nor Harrington, nor Thurmond said a word. Then, lips wavering yet pursed, the Missourian spoke up. \"It's agreeable,\" Harrington admitted. \"Not optimal, not sufficient, not even acceptable. But someone,\" he side-eyed a certain Senator, \"will do their damndest to block the vote himself if we ask for more.\"\n\n\"For once I agree with the Communist,\" replied Thurmond. \"At the least, we've each made fair concessions for the Party's sake. Repercussions can be handled later; now's time we show the R-Ds America had made their best choice in twenty Goddamn years.\"\n\nDisbelief gave way to relief and Margaret's weight against the velvet-lined chair.

Her Chief of Staff did good work in ordering enough for every attendee, some several dozens in all. The cost might haunt her wallet tomorrow morning; then again, nobody said impressed millionaires weren't expensive.\n\nWhat common sense does say is that impressed millionaires are worth their weight in gold. More specifically, their pockets'.\n\n\"Anyone would welcome a gift from the Preisdent ma'am,\" offered Agnew, voice muffled from the handkerchief enveloping half his face. \"Even ones that kill you in twenty years.\"\n\nThe President smiled despite the dig at her habit. Now was time to celebrate small victories, like the compromise she had just brokered with her congenial acquaintances in the Fortune 500. Will Thurmond and friends paint her red so soon after she made peace with the captains of industry bankrolling the party's warchests?"

She is a friend and a colleague in the Senate, among the first to represent her state's true interests when the Republicans and Democrats no longer did. That she became the first Madam President in our history serves as an inspiring reminder that anyone, even those of the fairer sex, can lead the Free World if they worked hard and did their best.\n\n(SEN. THURMOND pauses to sip water.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Which brings me to my one complaint against her. You've no doubt already heard of the President's addresses as of late, whether from the radio, print, TV or even word of mouth. They told of the so-called \"welfare for the American people\", and the prosperity it'll bring for everyone. But don't be fooled: the President spoke of handouts in all but name.\n\n(Murmurs erupt from the audience.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Our grandpappies always tell us that the man who's taught to fish will live a full life 'til he's old and grey, and that a man who knows only how to take fish from others will take his way to an early grave. We'll have failed the Founders indeed if America turns from a nation of fishers to a nation of fish-takers. That may do for the reds and their misguided allies. But will it do for us? Will it do for hardworking Americans, like you and I? Must it do for our daughters, the new generation of American citizens, and who'll soon fill your shoes twenty years from now and nurture the next?"

Elderly people are an incredibly vulnerable group when it comes to healthcare, plagued by predatory insurance providers and skyrocketing premiums - and it is up to us to fix that problem.\n\nThe new NPP-sponsored bill aims to enroll all citizens aged 65 or above in one common, federally managed insurance program. Backed by the government, this program would offer essentially free healthcare services to those over the cutoff age. Partly, it'd be financiated through a new payroll tax - however, a significant part of its budget would stem directly from the federal treasury revenue. Quite a few small-government proponents already voiced their concerns about the massive increase in federal spending this bill would cause, and their voices are amplified by radical segregationists who despise any sort of government program that does not specifically exclude those of African descent."

Less than a minute ago it was pomp-and-circumstance; a long ceremony, a marching band, a bible, and a cacophony of cheers. In that minute, something had changed. The woman at the podium was now the most powerful on Earth, with all the hope or dread that accompanied such a fact. Now, perhaps a million voices lay quiet, with their expectant owners wrapped in scarves and coats anxiously awaiting the words of their new President: Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick.\n\n\"Among the foremost duties of a government in the provision for the common defense; a guarantee, against external aggression, the survival of our way of life. We must ask ourselves: is the government fulfilling such duties? As evidenced by foreign troops on rightful American soil, and the continued warnings from military men that our current strategy is ineffective, and my very presence on these steps, perhaps the answer is \"No\". I have been elected and approved by the American people to head a new presidential administration. I know full well the responsibilities placed in me by them and by God, and will fulfill them to the best of my ability...\"\n\n\"...The troubles faced by our nation today cannot be solved by a single man, or woman. It does not require the sacrifice that so many have made in service to democracy, as in the Argonne, or on Bougainville, or on the dunes of the Namib. However, it does require the best effort of every citizen to believe in themselves and their capacity for great deeds. In this endeavor, I have the utmost confidence in the people of the United States to adapt to and overcome their challenges, for we are the progeny of almost two centuries of great individuals. We are America, and with our exceptional will and the grace of God, no trial shall prove too great for our strength to overcome.\""

 POLITICS_KIRK_DESC:0 "Many less liberal-minded politicians once presumed a woman to be too soft to hold the office of President-- too weakened by feminine tenderness. Now, the fools and doubters line up out of respect and fear to Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick: a woman with a heart of steel and a mind for politics. One of the founding members of the modern Far Right Wing, Kirkpatrick was rocketed to the political spotlight as the Oil Crisis grew in intensity. With her mastery of geopolitics and unbreakable resolve, the Presidency was relatively easy to win. Now, as President, she advocates what is being called the \"Kirkpatrick Doctrine\": a geopolitical precept that America should support friendly dictatorships in order to prevent the spread of Nazi totalitarianism. While this concept has drawn ire from many, few doubt its effectiveness in achieving its goal.\n\nOriginally from Oklahoma, Kirkpatrick studied at Columbia University while a member of the \"Young People's Socialist League\", the youth wing of the Socialist Party of America. While continuing to study political science at Columbia, she became less and less enthralled with socialist maxims, eventually deciding that socialism required a fundamental change in human nature to succeed. Over many years, her conservative values grew while others withered, until all that remained was cold, hard, pragmatism. After completing her PhD in 1968, Kirkpatrick became an extremely outspoken member of the Far Right, with her focus on foreign policy playing a major role in the rebranding of the group since the end of the Civil Rights debate.\n\nNow, the practical, calculating woman of iron sits in the Oval Office, slowly hammering a soft nation into a creature as unyielding as she is. If she has her way the Central Intelligence Agency budget will skyrocket, as will the number of pro-American third world dictatorships. The chaotic winds of the world, whether through words or through swords, shall be rent into an order that respects and fears the United States of America."

Swept into office on an NPP surge in the aftermath of the oil crisis, she now faces the task of restoring confidence in the executive office and the reputation of the United States abroad.\n\nThis task will be a daunting one- though over the initial shock of the oil crisis, America is still in a vulnerable economic state and beset by domestic unrest. President Kirkpatrick is prepared to respond to both problems swiftly, to curb the influence of radicals and restore certainty in the future of our nation!"

This ends now.\n\nThe intelligence community is a critical part of the president's new foreign policy initiative, for it is the most capable tool by which we can take advantage of the weaknesses of ideologically opposed governments. We've already tapped a new candidate for Director. Once they're approved by Congress, a meeting must be held immediately.

Ideas that fail to thrive in the marketplace of democracy cannot be given special treatment, but these radicals fail to realize the harm they do to the nation.\n\nOperation CHAOS will enable us to monitor and suppress these dangerous organizations. The majority will simply be monitored, those found to be dangerous will be suppressed by our own front organizations, and the most dangerous ones will be targeted for dismantlement. If sufficient legal evidence to arrest prominent dissidents cannot be found, it will be created. Democracy will represent the will of the people, not radical fringe movements."

This must be ended.\n\nThe newly sworn-in president is known for her new pragmatic and realistic approach to foreign policy. Instead of bending to the naive desire to promote liberty and democracy on a world scale, we must recognize that we must foster democracy through the establishment of strong and stable governments that can serve as a solid foundation for the future of a global alliance. These governments must not be weakened by our attempts to inorganically democratize them, but instead must be hardened against outside influence from our geopolitical rivals and internal revolutionary movements alike."

Out in the tropics of the Carribean, pirates reigned and scourged the seas of the colonists forging their way there. Now, however, Authoritarians and Fascists more than make up for the long-dead scourges, as the heartless dictators open the way for the Germans and the Japanese to sink their teeth into America's underbelly. And, like the strong will of British law centuries ago, we shall see them hang.\n\nMost notably, the hangman reaches for the regime of Joaquin Balaguer, who has managed to imprison his \"Republic\" in a gridlock of authoritarianism and oppression. While the opposition striving for democracy crawls in the shadows, however, we shall ship over our best arms and ammunition to ensure a fiery end to the unjust reign of Balaguer over the Dominicans."

For now, hundreds of thousands have rallied in the name of standing against the dictatorship of Balaguer and his collaboration with Fascist powers, from the streets of Santiago de los Caballeros to the cabinets in the capital of Santo Domingo de Guzmán. People are tired of giving in to the wanton wants and desires of Fascists, and President Kirkpatrick is more than happy to oblige their defiance."

The brewing conflict in the Dominican Republic needs such a revolutionary actor, someone courageous, someone charismatic, someone willing to do all that it takes to earn their people freedom and America its ally to the Southwest, to shield the continuous strikes of the Fascist Axe against the doors to the New World. Sure, some may call the practice of searching for such a face to the revolution \"outdated,\" or accuse it of limiting the breadth by which the revolution can expand for the country. However, America's best interests lie in the safeguarding of the revolution, and a shining star can help kickstart the progress as quickly and securely as possible."

Segregationists of old, Reformists of new, and American Conservatives of now must band together behind the Star Spangled Banner, for it is the Far Right of the National Progressive Party that upholds the light of patriotism against the darkness of Fascists and Imperialists abroad. Besides, organizing the party will allow us to reign in all of the weak-willed, rubber-spined bureaucrats in the party who keep getting shoved around by the likes of the Republican-Democrats, while taking hold of our more liberal-minded brethren across the wings of the National Progressive Party as well."
 USA_kirk_72_restore_war_powers_desc:0 "Some people in this country who lack the guts to stand up for it have criticized actions of Presidents past in utilizing our brave troops on air, land, and sea to protect our interests around the world.

Now, we have to focus on a greater future, one where we won't even give the enemy the chance to subvert our power across the world. A future illuminated by the Beacon of Democracy.\n\nHowever, to do this, we'll have to take some grand steps in terms of legislation, and knock a few pegs down from the \"checks and balances\" that are preventing the Kirkpatrick Administration from fully protecting the interests of America. In particular, the War Powers Resolution has put a stranglehold against the President's ability to act quickly and effectively, requiring a full forty-eight hours of alert to Congress in advance, with full ability to get shot down by those bureaucratic bastards, and a strict time limit on the length of our intervention. Thus, we need to tear this Act out of the legal system, so we may act as the sword and shield of the American Spirit across the world."

All that it will take for Balaguer's Fascist-minded government to crash and burn now is a spark. And America, oh beautiful, for spacious skies, is a matchbox filled to the brim.\n\nIt may stand true that the revolutionaries of the Dominican Republic may walk from all different paths of life. Businessmen, market salesmen, soldiers, politicians, and more. However, while some of them may have the chance to bicker and squabble, none of that matters now that the revolution is prepared. The guns are loaded, the people are rallied, and the leadership has a new face. It is our duty, now more than ever, to secure America's safety by bringing down the network of Fascist influences in the Carribean, and Balaguer's spider-web will be the first to burn against the flame of the Beacon of Liberty."

Of course, President Jeane Kirkpatrick didn't think it could have possibly gone poorly, but it was better than expected. Together, they had laid out the plans for the expansion of the agency's budget, as well as the \"realignment\" of the agency towards anti-fascism. Regime changes in several disagreeable governments throughout Latin America were beginning to take shape.\n\n\"Well, Madam President,\" said Angleton, \"most of the plans for your 'Kirkpatrick Doctrine' are being set in place.\"\n\n\"I take objection to that name. It's a product of many people's pragmatism, not exclusively my own.\"\n\n\"Regardless, I think it's best that we move on to domestic matters. The agency has identified many potential threats to the United States government, such as the Black Panthers, that it may be prudent to keep tabs on.\"\n\nKirkpatrick leaned forward on the Resolute Desk. \"And what do you recommend we do about these... threats?\"\n\nAngleton pulled a manila folder out of his blazer and slid it across to the President. She opened it, finding pages upon pages of names. Gus Hall, Angela Davis, Francis Yockey, and dozens of others. Next to each name was a word or phrase in blocked red ink: MONITOR, COUNTERACT, SUBMIT FOR ARREST, or SUBMIT FOR TERMINATION.\n\nKirkpatrick looked back to Angleton, astonished. \"What's this?\""

 KIRK.3.desc:0 "Secretary of Defense John McCain Jr. looked puzzled by what his associates, Walt Rostow and Jeane Kirkpatrick, were discussing. Their meeting in the Oval Office had begun in earnest, but so far all they had talked about was the Dominican Republic and how important it was to protect American interests overseas. \"So,\" he began, \"you plan on completely overthrowing the government of the Dominican Republic without having a single American soldier involved?\"\n\nKirkpatrick nodded, and McCain became even more puzzled. \"Then why am I here?\"\n\n\"Secretary McCain, the Western Hemisphere occasionally requires a deft touch, and occasionally a less-than-deft touch. The plans set forth by the Central Intelligence Agency are not in conflict with those of the Department of Defense; rather, they require them. These regime changes need to happen, and the Agency will get them done, but the United States military will ensure that these new regimes remain loyal.\"\n\n\"Like Guyana?\"\n\n\"Like Guyana,\" said Rostow. \"Most of the regimes throughout Latin America are less-than-friendly to American interests, and far too friendly to those of our enemies. The Dominican Republic is a domino that might fall over if given just one small... push. We need to make sure it falls on our side. Once that's done, the muscle of the American military will be a good motivator for them to stay on our side.\""

 KIRK.4.desc:0 "CIA Director James Angleton stepped into Secretary of State Walt Rostow's office with some purpose. He tossed a manila folder onto Rostow's desk. \"So,\" he began, \"the President wants the Dominican President ousted by this man?\"\n\n\"Vincho Castillo,\" replied Rostow, puffing up a cigarette, \"Dominican lawyer, political figure, and leader of the opposition. It's a good thing, too; Caudillo Joaquin Balguer is a bit of a fascist strongman.\"\n\n\"And Castillo isn't?\"\n\nRostow smiled. \"Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but he's better than the alternative. In any case, how have your preparations for his coup gone?\"\n\n\"Well, after making a few calls, a few bribes, and a few friends, I'd say our friend in Hispanola has his chessboard set. He's got a few thousand CIA-armed militiamen at his back.\"\n\n\"And the Dominican army?\"\n\n\"We're looking into that. Word in Langley is the commander of the Santo Domingo garrison might take a 'donation' over a paycheck.\"\n\n\"Well then, what are we waiting for?\""

 KIRK.5.desc:0 "President Jeane Kirkpatrick, Secretary of State Walt Rostow, Secretary of Defense John McCain Jr., and CIA Director James Angleton sat around a map of the Dominican Republic, the stench of tobacco smoke filling the dank meeting room. Angleton pointed at various blue markers that dotted the map of the island nation. \"Several police departments in Santo Domingo and Santiago de los Caballeros have quietly expressed support for Castillo's movement. When his forces, now numbering around 8,000 men, move out of the jungles, they'll seize the largest cities without too much internal resistance. The general currently guarding Santo Domingo has said he won't have his men interfere, either.\"\n\n\"How much did that cost us?\" asked the President.\n\n\"Not too much,\" said McCain, \"I figure most of the Dominican military can see the writing on the wall.\"\n\nAway from the cameras of the press corps, Jeane Kirkpatrick took a long drag on her cigarette. \"American interests come first,\" she said coldly, \"we do things to protect those whom we love, that which we hold dear: America.\"\n\nShe tapped out the ash and laid the smoke onto a tray. She looked at Angleton."

 KIRK.6.desc:0 "Today, after more than a month of political argumenting and compromising, it seems that all was for naught, as President Jeane Kirkpatrick's War Powers Resolution failed to gather enough votes in the Senate. The act, doggedly pursued by the Kirkpatrick Administration, would have allowed the President to send American troops overseas for extended periods of time without the approval of Congress or a declaration of national emergency. It also empowers the President to, under times of war, imprison \"individuals suspected of foreign allegiance\" without trial. What exactly this nebulous term would have meant in fact, however, is a matter of great debate.\n\nWith a defeat of her plans in Congress, President Kirkpatrick's foreign policy plan seems to have been slowed, at least for now. While the President herself has yet to comment on the bill's failure, the White House Press Secretary said that \"things would be moving forward as planned\". The Kirkpatrick Doctrine, it seems, will not be stopped so easily."

What exactly this nebulous clause means, and how it will be implemented going forward, remains a matter of quite some debate.\n\nWhile many of the left-leaning political figures in America blow the whistle of \"tyrant!\", the Kirkpatrick Administration's foreign policy plans are quickly spurring into motion. The new powers invested in the President and her staff have not only given her a chance to exert her will by force, if necessary; they have also given her a great boost to her political confidence. When the next bill comes, it may not be so veiled in flowers and smiles."

He was staring idly at a picture of a house next to an absurdly white beach that seemed to go on for eternity. \"Morning, Walters,\" said Angleton, \"are you already wanting to head back down to Florida?\"\n\n\"Morning, boss,\" Walters said, \"I'm just reminiscing. What's all this?\"\n\n\"Personnel reassignments to Operation CHAOS. More than 1,000 agents and employees are to be allocated. I expect them all to receive their new assignment by month's end. There are also details for first moves, individuals of interest, and so on.\"\n\nWalters flipped through the files and furrowed his brow. \"I didn't know you had gotten approval for the operation to be on such a large scale. This is... extreme. We're assigning almost 5% of our personnel to illegally spying on the American public.\"\n\n\"Illegal? Don't be so dramatic. We're just bending the rules a little. I've got a lot to do, so I'll leave you to it, but if you're so bothered by it, you can go back to Florida. There's already a home waiting for you.\"\n\nAngleton left the office before Walters could reply. He looked down at the papers and sighed, a pit forming in his stomach. He glanced back up at the picture of the beach with the little summer house, the gentle swelling waves of the ocean rippling in the distance. \"Maybe I will,\" he said to no one in particular."

After we've already won and been inaugurated.\"\n\n\"I was under the impression that one won an election before beginning the administrative duties of the office. I hope you don't need a lesson? Regardless, as you know, you're a very... shall we say colorful individual in American politics. Some people hate you, but many love you.\"\n\n\"Your point being?\"\n\n\"My point being that no matter what you say, people are going to listen to it for the hell of it. You're entertaining, in short. So, when I say that you're going to be the lynchpin of garnering support for foreign intervention here in the homeland, I mean it.\"\n\nYorty smiled, knowing his job just became a whole lot more important."

He'd been practicing at lectures and radio for days now - polishing everything for tonight, for primetime.\n\n\"President Kirkpatrick and yourself won the election on a promise of standing up for America in a dangerous world. How is the administration putting that vision of foreign policy to work?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you one thing - we're not going to convince the Germans and the Japanese to play nice with us. The Germans salute Hitler's corpse and the Japanese think their Emperor is a living god. We're not going to get anywhere by trying to reason with these people.\"\n\nThe interviewer grimaced. \"Sir, America has fought two wars in the past decade. A lot of families wonder if their sons will be sent to yet another foreign war.\"\n\nYorty chuckled. \"The President and I aren't warmongers; we're not out to conquer the world like Hitler and Hirohito. But I think you underestimate how many people want a positive relationship with America, despite what their leaders say. They want American capital, American engineering, and American goods.

A dozen old M1 carbine rifles, haphazardly stacked atop one another. Agent David Atlee Phillips handed one of the worn old weapons over to the Dominican in cheap army fatigues that hovered beside him. \"Start handing these out to your unit,\" he said in slightly-accented Spanish.\n\nSo many of these obsolescent guns had shown up today in a shipment from Miami. Cracking them all open had been backbreaking work, but luckily not work that Phillips had to do himself. A few yards away, they broke open yet another crate, this time filled with old tommy guns. The guerillas handed them around, pantomiming gangsters mowing down vast numbers of people.\n\nBehind him, a voice caught his attention. \"Do you think all this will be enough?\"\n\nHe turned to face his fellow agent, Michael Townley. \"I don't think it will need to be,\" he said, \"but its more guns in a country that's already got too many.

Taking inconspicuous sips from his espresso, he analyzed the approaching soldiers with glancing looks from his notebook. In it, he wrote: \"Soldiers of the Dominican Army, unit unknown at this time. Patrol along Av Simon Bolivar. Circuit once every 20 minutes. Number: 20 men on patrol.\"\n\nThe man leading the formation got a look at Rodrigo and stopped his formation's march, a stern look on his face. \"You!\" he yelled. \"You have been at this cafe all day, why?\"\n\nRodrigo raised an eyebrow. \"I like the coffee here,\" he replied, \"is that a crime, sir?\"\n\nThe few people who were sitting around outside the Cafe Luis were now staring at Rodrigo. He sighed and pulled a badge out of his pocket, identifying him as a member of Dominican Intelligence. The officer was taken aback. \"What is your name?\" asked Rodrigo.\n\n\"...Lieutenant Alfonso Ramon Jimenez.\"\n\nRodrigo made a note in his book. \"Well, Lieutenant Jimenez, I must get back to my superiors. Thank you for your cooperation and... good formation.\"\n\nA look of horror went over the Lieutenant's face as Rodrigo sauntered away.
