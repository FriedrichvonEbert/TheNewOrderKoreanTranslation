 KAZ_last_days_bandit: "Last Days Of The Bandit Kings"

The territory of Kyzylorda, while encompassing a third of Kazakhstan, has authority over a much less. Bandits have taken power in many areas and have become rich off raiding. This has to end. General Secretary Momyshuly has a plan to deal with these "bandit kings" that has been years in the making. They may not know it, but these are the last days of banditry in Kazakhstan."
 KAZ_set_the_trap: "Set The Trap"
 KAZ_set_the_trap_desc: "A swift decapitation of the bandit leadership is a key component for dealing with this threat. For this operation we need to lure in the leadership of the various clans and petty "kingdoms" placate each one, and finally kill them all. While many potential execution methods have been proposed, the one decided on is to use German bombing campaigns to our advantage. Use radio static to get bombers near our preffered to location, and lure in the bandit leaders. Those outlaws are survivors, but few leave them a barrage of bombs alive."
 KAZ_whisper_campaign: "Whisper Campaign"
 KAZ_whisper_campaign_desc: "Distrust is a potent weapon of war. Destroying the leadership can only do so much, for others will rise to the occasion.

 KAZ_add_treats: "Add The Bait"
 KAZ_add_treats_desc: "Bait will be needed to attract the bandits to the trap, by leaving a small amount of military equipment we will be able to ensure as many bandits as possible are brought to the trap, making the bombing attack all the more successful.

 KAZ_unleash_hounds: "Unleash The Hounds"
 KAZ_unleash_hounds_desc: "With the date for when the trap is to be sprung closing in we will need forces that will quickly close in and attack bandit camps around the country and crush them before retreating and letting the rest fight amongst themselves.

 KAZ_spring_the_trap: "Spring The Trap"
 KAZ_spring_the_trap_desc: "The time is now, with the proper preparations we will be able to draw in the various leaders of the bandit groups and then with large amounts of radio communication in the area, get the germans to bomb the region.

 KAZ_clean_streets: "Clean The Streets"
 KAZ_clean_streets_desc: "With a open war going on between the various bandit groups, many towns and cities have been engulfed in violence that while we have predicted has been damaging on the cities.

 KAZ_purge_zhezqazghan_desc: "With the fighting over all that remains is one last stronghold, the city of Zhezqazghan has been inhabited by a number of the fake Khans men that broke away. They have managed to avoid the majority of the fighting and remained relatively unharmed, we must destroy them and purge the city of their influence if we ever want to recover. This is the last hurdle and they shall be overcome like all the rest."
 KAZ_over_and_done: "Over And Done With"
 KAZ_over_and_done_desc: "With the fighting done we should get the trial stage over and done with as fast as possible so we can get onto recovering.

 KAZ_fair_trials: "Fair Trials"
 KAZ_fair_trials_desc: "With the fighting done we must ensure fair trials to take place to judge and sentence those bandits that offended.

 KAZ_kangaroo_courts: "Kangaroo Courts"
 KAZ_kangaroo_courts_desc: "The quickest way to deal with the hundreds of bandits is through various kangaroo courts.

But even if the Marxist ideals proved itself to be stronger than the Fascist bombs, such situation can't continue any longer when the enemies of the people grow stronger with every day; our further idleness will only serve as our end.\n\nIn his speech towards fellow generals and party workers, General Momyshuly proclaimed the beginning of the Four Year Plan, which will entail the reconstruction of the national economy and preparation for our future confrontations against the rebellious gangs across the country, reuniting the Kazakh SSR once and for all.\n\nThe Mother History has not left us more time to spare.

Its failure still left a legacy of buried supply caches, relocated resources and looted German arms hidden beyond their reach.\n\nSome of the weapon cornucopia was used up during the West Russian War. But the collapse of the united front has sent our army back to Kazakhstan. Since then, our domestic manufacturing and foreign imports have kept most of our supplies topped up, making the use of Soviet era caches redundant.\n\nNow that the bombing campaign has ended, and that war is again on the horizon, it might be a good time to dig up everything that is left over. A bureaucratic effort will let us cross-tabulate every stash's location, and the best way to allocate resources. Some of this old equipment will go to reserve units to free up the best stuff for front line troops. Critical industrial tools will be used to replenish our stocks and help with the industrialization campaign. We must make use of the previous generation's work!"

We may soon reach a point of diminishing returns where everything that could be reused has already been secured. For now, however, there remains untapped sources of equipment out there.\n\nIn the collapse of the Soviet Union, and then the failure of the WRRF's war, many Soviet installations have been abandoned. Meteorological stations, distant military outposts, radar stations and most important of all, energy installations.\n\nAny power plant, oil field or coal deposit established during the Bukharin era must be made available for the Kyzil Orda. The industry and vehicles needed to push back the reactionaries will not move by themselves, and so it is crucial for us to reclaim any source of power we can use.

The wars, though they ended in defeat for the Union, had imparted to it valuable lessons and experience. In the meantime, however, various warlords have laid their claims upon Kazakhstan, taking advantage of its absence.\n\nNow that the terror bombing has ended, its officers have begun preparing for the army for its eventual role as a force to reunify Kazakhstan.

That they once provided us with the necessities is no longer enough; fortunately, we have a way to utilize the rivers further.\n\nOur engineers and architects have drawn up plans for a hydroelectric dam. Their streams will flow to the turbines, finally providing us with the means to electrify our region in general and our factories in particular, on a scale not seen from after the Fall of the Union.\n\nWith those dams in place, we can open new fisheries in the region, using the now-heightened currents as a base and grounds for them. We can also channel the rivers into irrigation, providing us with the means to restart cotton farming and production, and thus clothe our people for Kazakhstan's hot summers and cold nights."

The plant is particularly useful to spin into absorbent, versatile fabrics of varying thickness. In the cold desert climate of our lands, cotton-made clothing is popular but scarce.\n\nWith the new dams channeling the river into irrigation ditches scattered all over our territory, we can now consider reviving the mass cultivation of the crop. We will envelop the banks in white and clad Kazakhstan and its people likewise. The flexible fabric will let us work for longer, and better. The varying thickness can be adjusted for either the hot summer days or cold nights.\n\nThere are others that live in Kazakhstan other than ourselves. These will also desire to gain access to the revered Comrade Cotton. Through trade, we can increase the administration's budget, and therefore be one step closer to reunifying Kazakhstan under a legitimate authority of the union."

 KAZ_coal_production_desc: "After the union retreated from Kazakhstan and various warlords laid their claims on it, coal mining was relegated to a secondary role, as it's market value plummeted in the wake of the chaos that ensued. Then the German bombers came, and after that, there was no more use for coal other than warming and small-scale industry. The coal mines that once dug deep into the bowels of the earth are now quiet, abandoned.\n\nNow that the Germans have withdrawn, reindustrialization is now a viable option for the administration to take. But first, we have to seek ways to re-power our factories and machinery. The coal mines are indispensable in this goal. By sending miners to their depths again, we can ensure that coke flows out afresh, providing us a stable base to re-electrify the region.\n\nThe coal thus secure, we can look toward trading surpluses with our Kirghiz brothers for raw materials to process. After that, who knows? Maybe one day we will have the Kazakh giant awaken again as a bulwark of the union."

However, our current situation doesn't present us with an opportunity to be too demanding to our unfortunate partners.\n\nThe diplomatic agents of Kirghizia arrived to our capital with an offer to provide the Kazakh SSR with a substantial amount of their abundant resources in exchange for our surplus arms.

What remained after the Germans' ruinous rampage were swiftly gathering dust; the government could not organize labor amid shrapnel, and the workers were unwilling to risk the travel. Compounded with issues regarding raw materials and energy, the reindustrialization of Kazakhstan seemed a faraway prospect.\n\nThat has changed. With both coal and a steady supply of raw materials, we can now proceed to the final step of rebuilding our industry: reorganization of labor and reopening of our remaining factories, as well as the salvage of heavy industrial equipment lying within ruined ones. A new union awaits, somewhere on the horizon, and Kazakhstan shall join it, with our heads held high."

They lost their houses to bombings and warfare, they lost their crops to bandits and they gave their last remaining tools for food and money to survive. Every day they wander long distances to nearby cities and other villages to sell their belongings in exchange for supplies and leave themselves open to predatory paws of speculators who profit on their misery. To neglect help to the Soviet agriculture means only to doom our whole farmer class to a certain death.\n\nThe calls for the help of a Soviet countryman will not be left unheard by the ears of the Party.

Several issues remain, however. The agricultural distributions are concentrated around farms, leaving the periphery of our territories often unaffected by the aid. Further from the border, an epidemic of hoarding has left some of the population without access to foodstuffs.\n\nIn order to change this, the economic planners have proposed a system of rationing, similar to that in force during the Great Patriotic War. Doing this will allow us to spread the farm produces more equally, reducing the risk of any further famines, and curtailing inequality along the way. Though it may seem odd to implement such a constraint when there is no war, hunger is an enemy to every one of us. Fighting it shall be a duty borne by all citizens."

There, the sheepherders guide their herds from one grazing ground to another, living like their ancestors, a relic predating the Union and Empire. The Germans did not even seem to bother them. Their fat-tailed sheep provide the luxury of the Kazakhs: milk, wool, and mutton.\n\nOur Soviet planners have worked out the plans to integrate them into our economy. The government will firstly establish a renegotiable price for the wool, allowing us to spin it into coats, mittens, and headwear. Next, we will map out, highlight, and protect grazing areas and the routes into them, ensuring a steady supply. Even if they don't realize it, the herders are comrades; and with these efforts, perhaps one day, they will embrace socialism themselves."

In its place, capitalism and private businesses grew, replacing the ideal system that socialism envisioned. The workers, laborers, and farmers found themselves again under the yoke they had cast off long ago. The administration has, until recently, taken a pragmatic approach regarding this. It was a choice between that or having no economy at all.\n\nThe government hasn't been idle, however. In the intervening years between the cessation of the German terror bombing and the present time, it has rebuilt its centralized economy. Now, without the utter need for survival, it is time to be rid of these parasitic and exploitative elements of the human condition. We shall buy or force them out.

 KAZ_reopen_air_bases_desc: "At the onset of the German bombings, the Central Asian Air and Air Defense Armies scrambled to intercept the terror bombers that flew over Kazakhstan. It was successful for a while. However, as the bombings intensified, with the Germans sending more and more planes, the Air Force began losing fighters, parts, and fuel. These resources were irreplaceable, as the bombings had made their production impossible. The high command ordered all interception missions canceled, and all planes hidden.\n\nWith the halt of German activity in the sky, and a subsequent revival in some of our industrial capacity, an air force is feasible again. The administration has agreed to reopen the hangars and airbases, along with the resumption of air drills and pilot training. These efforts are necessary to maintain an edge over the warlords, and, eventually, in the reunification."

Whatever was left intact had degraded in the meantime, rusting with no replaceable parts available. There is a severe discrepancy in the numbers we expected to recover and its actual figure.\n\nTo alleviate this difficulty, the administration will dispatch mechanics and technicians to assess the damage and repair them. Workers will be tasked to lift the rubble and salvage whatever parts they can find. Though the planes are old, with the newest ones dating to the '50s, they are still useful in denying the enemy air superiority. Perhaps, at a later date, we can devise new inventions of our own, and let socialism dominate the skies."

This aircraft, utilizing rotors for lift and thrust, has seen use by the Russians, but not in Kazakhstan itself. A technological marvel, capable of performing tasks fixed-wing aircraft cannot: troop transport without airfields, direct fire support, and better aerial reconnaissance, its value is clear to the high command.\n\nIn order to produce these for ourselves; we have gathered engineers and technicians, as well as economic planners, to come up with a design adapted to our native production methods. This will put our scientific and industrial capabilities to the test, as helicopters are complicated vehicles. However, succeeding and producing even a few will be a triumph for socialism, and aid for the wars to come."

As humanity conflicts with itself, the world requires the soldier to be better, stronger, faster, and more numerous than ever before. With the growing number of weapons and equipment he must master, all nations rush to create training methods more universal and accessible to their citizens.\n\nAlthough we lost the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War after it, the experience gleaned from the bloody battles against the Germans and the traitors has given us clues as to what constitutes the perfect soldier. Using this knowledge, we can reform and improve our training methods, so that when war comes, it shall not find us wanting."

Afraid of continued loss due to the Luftwaffe's growing number of bombers, the high command decided to hurry this evacuation. It left some storehouses practically untouched, with guns, ammunition, and explosives nestled inside them.\n\nWith the Germans out of the skies and our minds, we can look forward to reopening and salvaging these. Dusty, old, and outdated though the weapons may be, they can still be put to use in the service to Socialism. The warlords, illegitimate as they are, present a credible threat against us, but they will think twice to face soldiers armed by the last gift of the Union."

 KAZ_legacy_of_the_patriotic_war_desc: "For the Central Asian Military District, the Great Patriotic War was a time of revelation. It fought vigorously in that conflict, managing to score victories against the elite German SS divisions. Yet for all its achievements, the war exposed the weak, underdeveloped elements of the Soviet doctrine. It had practically fought using tactics taken straight from the Great War. Faced with an enemy with a crushing advantage in tactics and equipment, it won those battles by the skin of its teeth.\n\nTo remedy this shortcoming, we have to take a long and hard statistical approach towards analyzing data from the war. Our military scientists will be tasked to come up with critiques of the principal army doctrine and to suggest improvements in how to better utilize military equipment in different situations. With this tactical superiority over the warlords, it won't be too long until all of Kazakhstan is under Socialism again."
 KAZ_motorisation: "Motorisation"
 KAZ_motorisation_desc: "The Great Patriotic and West Russian Wars saw a prevalent usage of motorized vehicles for both sides. The Germans and the Soviets utilized these in the same manner as one another: to exploit openings in the battle line and to form fire brigades with which to plug them closed. As the wars wore on to the winter months, however, the Russian Rasputista stopped both armies in their tracks, as the puddles of the Soviet roads turned into death traps for trucks and tanks alike. The mud would cling to tires and tank tracks, pulling them down and requiring a lot of men to push them out.\n\nIn Kazakhstan's deserts and arid plains, however, the story is different. Fast exploitation tactics are viable all-year, and the lack of geographical impediment means that properly trained and equipped motorized divisions can rush the enemy, encircling and trapping them in pockets. The warlords must realize this to be the case as well, and how quickly we can train and arm these divisions will be a matter of life and death."

These planes screamed alarm as they approached to deliver the payload: tank-busting bombs, pillbox-shattering explosives. When the German terror bombing campaign commenced in earnest, the high command was not keen on repeating their mistakes and ordered the tank fleet.\n\nThese armored vehicles, once the pride, joy, shield, and sword of the Union, now sit in warehouses and tank hangars, rusting away in atrophy and apathy. With the threat of war looming on the horizon, the administration and the high command has agreed to dispatch engineers and mechanics to repair and salvage whatever they can of the tank fleet. Paired with our motorized divisions, these will again be the Union's greatest asset."

Outside of the Union, where war continues apace without so much as a pause, a need arises for a vehicle that combines rapid troop transport and armored support. The Infantry Fighting Vehicle, evolving out of the three great powers, has fulfilled this niche. Better-armed than a regular Armored Personnel Carrier and much more mobile than a conventional tank, the IFV manages to combine the best of both worlds. Naturally, our high command has been wanting to get their hands on them.\n\nBy pooling together our scientific and engineering talent from across our territories, we can come up with a design that specifically addresses the terrain of Kazakhstan and the limitations of our industry. Once produced, these will be the teeth of our mechanized divisions, combining both speed and durability: a worthy product of socialism."

Recruits, hardened by the new training methods and steeled with battle, now fill our ranks. The Air and Air Defence Armies have risen again, dominating the skies in the name of socialism.

During and immediately after the German terror bombing campaign, we have turned a blind eye to these. Pragmatism was the rule of the day; even if the administration could take on all of them, the remnants of the army would be too weak to hold it, lacking fuel, qualified personnel, and equipment.\n\nThese obstacles are now gone. The economy is roaring alive after the depression following the bombing, and the army stands ready to take the battle to these interlopers.

 KAZ_the_islamic_traitors_desc: ""A faraway call from the days of the Basmachi uprising, the Islamic fundamentalists and obscurantists under the leadership of Nikolay Zabelkin, a traitor to his Motherland and former bandit, took over the city of Kostanay and embarked on their despotic and intolerant rule, intending to fully eliminate every single gain of the proletarian dictatorship and enforce their medieval and patriarchal customs to every sphere of life.\n\nBut no matter how hard they are trying to, they can't turn the clock of history back. The Kazakh proletariat, which became free from the prejudices and superstitions of the past, will not follow the preachings of the parochial imams of Zabelkin. Armed with the hammer of modernity, the proletarian soldiers will smash the dogmatic ignorance of fundamentalists."

 KAZ_peace_with_the_poles_desc: "The hellish march of Fascism broke the fates of numerous people and displaced many of once free nations, who were pressured to leave their homes to spare themselves from the German cruelty. Among them were the sons and daughters of Poland, who were forcibly resettled by Nazis in Western Kazakhstan. The Soviet government generously gave them shelter, but in the anarchy that followed, the Polish ASSR seceded from Soviet Kazakhstan.\n\nAs it stands, the "New Poland" does not recognize the Soviet power but neither it does seek to spread their reactionary customs and their government is mostly motivated by desire of their people to settle down in the new home. If we guarantee their safety and protection in exchange for acknowledging the ideals of Communism and preserving rights for their Kazakh minority, we can probably expect them to agree on a peaceful rejoining with the Kazakh SSR."

Not only they have denounced the values of the Communist ideology and rejected the Soviet authority, but they also avowed to imitate the monstrous and cannibalistic customs of Hitler's Germany, waging terror against the honest laborers of our Motherland and pitting the Kazakh citizens against our internationalist Russian brothers and sisters. No words can describe the extent of horror spread by the Aktau Fascist militants.\n\nFor too long the Fascists reigned in our lands!

With our enemies defeated and the dictatorship of proletariat reigning anew, it is time for us to prepare our Fatherland for a better future. As the Soviet Union, our common Motherland, died in its valiant fight to protect the peoples of Eurasia from the Fascist invader, the Presidium decreed that our state, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, will become an independent and sovereign entity, the one that expresses the interests of the workers and peasants and will be aiming to build a true Communist society.\n\nEven if the Union fell, Kazakhstan remains faithful to the principles it was founded upon and will stand for its glorious legacy.

Like its predecessor, it was weak, divided. Now history repeats itself. Its democracy, with its delusion of political parties and partisan division, has, under historical precedence, crumbled to socialism.\n\nHowever, the administration finds its grasp over its populace tenuous. To remedy this, our civic planners look toward reaching out to the remnants of the Social Democrats. By blending them to a socialist party structure and ensuring their subservience to us, we can exert some more political control over the territory. Though social democracy is a failed ideology, we can use it to gently turn the people of Pavlodar from rivals and enemies to comrades marching under one banner."

 KAZ_collectivize_their_industry_desc: "Marx, the godfather of socialism, once proclaimed that capitalism needed to progress before a classless society could emerge from it. The capitalist was to him a creature of necessity, mainly for the creation of capital and the means of production. Although Lenin, in his wisdom, decided to bypass this stage during the formative years of the Union, and Bukharin's failure to balance a capitalist economy with socialist control, Marx's proclamation could still find its realization in Pavlodar.\n\nIn the years following the terror bombing campaign, the government of Pavlodar has fostered a bustling and prosperous private sector. The administration shall collectivize this, seizing and buying these companies before turning them over to the state-owned institutions. It is time for the workers of Pavlodar to rise against the capitalist pigs and to finally taste the fruit of their labor."

Its capitalist economy had made out of this fact a backbone of an economy. Their oilfields teem with pumpjacks, and refineries dot their landscape. Private companies pour this black gold unto barrels, before shipping them off to the highest bidder.\n\nPavlodar has come under socialism, at last, and the administration now possesses this valuable asset. To further the extraction of it, the economic planners have recommended for collectivization to cover these companies. We shall strip their rights to mine and refine oil, placing their facilities and engineers under the ownership of the state. These will fuel our mechanized and motorized divisions, eliminating one of our most glaring weaknesses."

They then formed new bandit gangs or bolstered the existing ones, exacerbating this problem. Caravans, arms shipments, as well as travelers, became their regular victims. Although more honest in their robbery than the reviled capitalists and nobles, these rats have taken from the proletariat labor and lives.\n\nWe cannot allow this crime to hold. The high command has agreed to send troops to protect convoys and to implement patrol schedules along the roads. They will also dispatch scouts to note the hideouts of these pests. When the hour comes, we will rain our wrath against them, breaking them before scattering them to the four winds. None that harms the worker shall stand on its two legs on the plains of Kazakhstan, and live."

Most of the most murderous bandit nomads died in battle or were executed in the aftermath of Dusukhambetov's fall, but those who chose to run away instead of following their leader to his end or those who refused to follow Dusukhambetov at all, continue to walk freely and still organize their raids, refusing to leave behind their destructive ways. Even with the Soviet power reestablished in the city and the countryside, the people of Kokshetau live without any feeling of confidence in their safety from bandit attacks.\n\nThe war on criminals in Kokshetau has not ended, but it took a different, subtler form. To combat the banditry, the garrison units around the city will be authorized to conduct regular patrols across the nearby steppes to deter any attempts at raiding from bandit horsemen and bring the loathed criminals to justice, ensuring that the civilians can sleep without fear for their lives."

Their eyes regard us with suspicion, and their arms are slow to embrace us as their comrades and saviors. To them, socialism is another ideology out to exploit them.\n\nTo convince them, words are no longer enough. We shall go one step further. We shall build roads, schools, and factories on Kokshetau. They shall have their education, and no more shall its children be illiterate. Its workers will have their right to work, staffing the factory floors, and paving the roads that span its lands. With care and time, the people of Kokshetau will walk with us again, no gulf driving its way between us."

They were ordinary Muslims once, driven to anger and unreason as they saw their homes ravaged by cruel and heartless bandits. They found their salvation in Zabelkin's brand of Islam, blaming decadence and godlessness for Kazakhstan's punishment by the divine. For all their faults and ignorance, they are not monsters. Once, before the collapse, they were steadfast comrades, a pillar of the old Kazakh SSR.\n\nRather than immediately force them to recant their faith at gunpoint, we will extend the olive branch and attempt to deradicalize them. We will drive the radical and fundamentalist imams out of their mosques, replacing them with more moderate ones. These will preach peace and reconciliation, starting a long and arduous process. Perhaps, at the end of it, the people of Kostanay will abandon the opiate of the masses."

Never more this statement was more evident than in Kostanay, where the old Islamic religion became the main weapon of suppression and stupefying of the working people, drowning their human image and depriving them of any aspirations for a better earthly life. Even after the obscurantist Islamic regime fell, those vile mullahs and imams still attempt to covertly oppose our rule and are trying to spread their anti-Soviet slander in their mosques all over the Soviet Republic, believing that they are immune to any secular law within their houses of false worship.\n\nThe previous Soviet government tolerated their presence and allowed Kazakh priests to live in their ignorance to some extent, but we can not afford such leniency against the sworn enemies of any enlightenment and worker's morals. Across the whole Kazakhstan, the fundamentalist hideouts will be shut down and repurposed and the Islamic reactionaries won't be able to spread their lies without punishment any longer."

Under Zabelkin, the institutions of madrassahs spread themselves across Kostanay, with the express duty to educate all children in the ways of God. This system is an artifact of older ages, to immerse the masses of the world in opiate, blissfully unaware of their oppression at the hands of the bourgeoisie.\n\nWe shall implement a new curriculum for the region of Kostanay. The architects and planners will plan the construction of schools throughout the region. All children will enroll themselves in them upon their completion; we will give no exceptions nor reservations. We are doing this in the spirit of truth so that no generation can be blind to the merits of socialism, and that none can be led astray ever again."

Such a wealth of industrial capability concentrated in such a small region has not escaped the administration's notice. Should we require it, we can integrate the only positive legacy of the NRF into aiding the socialist revolution in Kazakhstan.\n\nWe shall dispatch our workers to these factories and uncover them for our own purposes. Our planners will account for them in future industrial planning, ensuring that the goods produced within them flow to the appropriate channels without delay. Again, in Khromtau, the ideals of Marx shall find their realization. These factories belong to the workers, not to any madman who can claim themselves to be the leader of the Kazakh people."

A mix of nationalism, fascism, capitalism, and bastardized socialism, our chief ideologues were quick to declare their disgust towards this ideology. Yet, many in Khromtau still believe in the myth of National Renewal, with those still loyal to its base ideas attacking civilians and causing chaos in the countryside. The solution must be twofold: both with force and with a light hand shall we convince the people of Khromtau to join the socialist revolution.\n\nThe administration will send its troops to Khromtau to keep the peace there, securing the roads and grazing grounds frequented by the sheepherders and civilians alike. Meanwhile, schools shall dot the landscape of Khromtau, so that none will fall to the lie of National Renewal again. Given time, the people of Khromtau will march together with us, toward a world revolution."

During Onoprienko's reign, he forced many of the miners to endure long work hours to produce more and more ores in the name of National Renewal. With his defeat, the administration now controls most of the mining pits.\n\nThe first step towards revitalizing the Chromium mining industry is to free the miners previously conscripted by the National Renewal junta. Next, the administration will entice them to work again in the mines in exchange for shorter work hours and a more friendly work environment. After all, miners are workers as well; we must restore their faith in socialism, for no worker shall be left behind in the march toward world revolution."

Starting from a stretch of land in Kyzylorda, it has defeated the other illegitimate warlords that prey on the workers of Kazakhstan. It now stands as the sole legitimate power in Kazakhstan, the inheritor to a legacy of a Union long dissolved in chaos and violence. Beyond its borders, the world still looms overhead, but we are not afraid.\n\nBut first things first: the lands of the National Renewal Front and Nowa Polska stand empty without any structure of bureaucracy over them. The administration would like to rectify this situation immediately. We will send our officers and bureaucrats to those lands to establish a new bureaucracy and management, ensuring that socialism is at work there. For the red flag now flies over Kazakhstan and the world revolution is closer to being complete."
