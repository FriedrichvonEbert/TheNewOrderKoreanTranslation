 fiscal_crisis.0.t:0 "재정 위기!"
 fiscal_crisis.0.desc: "재정이 위태로워지고 있으며 gdp 대비 부채 비율이 치솟고 있습니다! 이제 정부 지출을 대폭 줄이거나 아니면 심각한 경제 위기에 맞닥트려야 합니다.\n\n[THIS.GetLeader] 지도 하의 정부는 국가 부채를 줄이면서 예산의 균형을 맞출 방도를 찾아야 합니다. 채무 불이행을 선언하거나 완전히 파산하지 않도록 말입니다."
 fiscal_crisis.0.a: "재정 위기에 처해 있는 동안 지속적인 경제 회복은 얻지 못 합니다."
 fiscal_crisis.1.t: "회복에 이르는 긴 여정"
 fiscal_crisis.1.desc: "은행이 다시 문을 열고 상점이 셔터를 올리면서 우리나라는 안도의 한숨을 내쉬고 있습니다. 우리 경제는 최악의 폭풍우를 이겨냈고 이제 맑은 하늘이 지평선에 나타납니다. 하지만 모든 것이 좋은 것은 아닙니다. 집은 압류되었고, 사업체는 문을 닫았으며, 가난으로 인해 삶이 망가졌습니다. 어떤 사람들에게는 회복이 너무 늦었습니다. "
 fiscal_crisis.1.a: "미래는 더 밝다. 아주 조금일지라도."
 fiscal_crisis.2.t: "숨 쉴 공간"
 fiscal_crisis.2.desc: "경제 침체가 남긴 상처가 아물기 시작했습니다. 간간이 일어나는 통증으로 여전히 고통스럽지만 치유되고 있습니다. 정부의 지원과 개인의 독창성이 재정 회복을 이끌었고, 우리가 어디까지 왔는지 감사할 수밖에 없습니다. 나라 전역에서 사람들은 조심스럽게 투자하고, 대출받고, 위험을 감수하기 시작했으며, 갑자기 빈곤층으로 떨어지는 두려움은 피했습니다. 상황이 호전되고 있지만 이러한 위기에 다시 빠지지 않도록 방심하지 말아야 합니다."
 fiscal_crisis.2.a: "먼발치에서 약간의 희망이 보이군."
 fiscal_crisis.11.t: "Credit Out of Default"
 fiscal_crisis.11.desc: "A year after our government could no longer pay its debt and declared bankruptcy, we have, thankfully, escaped from our fiscal sinkhole. Our credit is no longer defaulted, and we can once again resume borrowing money. Our economists, however, urge us to be more careful in the future, lest we find ourselves back in such dire circumstances."
 fiscal_crisis.11.a: "Steady as she goes."
 fiscal_crisis.12.t: "파산"
 fiscal_crisis.12.desc: "Due to terrible mismanagement and misfortune, we are no longer able to pay our creditors. As a result, we have declared bankruptcy, which will have devastating effects on our economy and citizenry. Our reputation amongst our creditors will be damaged, the banks will be forced to issue write offs, and internal demand will plummet. We can only hope that things will improve, but we face a bleak immediate future."
 fiscal_crisis.12.a: "How did we let this happen?"
 TNO_bankruptcy: "§RThis will not be good for the economy§!"
 fiscal_crisis.20.t: "Deeper Into The Red"
 fiscal_crisis.20.desc: "Despite our best efforts, the fiscal crisis continues to worsen. Homes have foreclosed, businesses have evaporated, and jobs have been lost. If we continue on this path, we stand to lose even more than we already have. As economists and politicians scramble, the people watch their savings go up in smoke. As money makes a hasty exit, so too does trust in the government."
 fiscal_crisis.20.a: "\"Fix this, and fast!\""
 econ_fiscal_crisis_deccat_available:0 "A new §Ydecision category§! to manage the fiscal crisis will be unlocked!"
 no_action_against_fc: "We are not acting on the fiscal crisis"
 Fiscal_crisis_response_category: "Tackling the Crisis"
 Fiscal_crisis_response_category_desc: "A fiscal crisis is the answer of the wider economic world when a country's spending agenda is perceived as too reckless to be even remotely sustainable. While sometimes caused by world-wide geo-political or geo-economic factors, some of which may be entirely out of the country's possibility to influence or protect against, the end result is the same: privates refuse to fuel public spending via acquisition of public bonds, deeming them excessively risky to buy, even at high interest rates, and as such, the country suddenly finds itself unable to pay for even the most basic services such as the armed forces, law enforcement and strategic infrastructure.\n\nThe longer a fiscal crisis persists, the worse its effects become for the country's economy, as public services collapse, industries shut down and banks are subjected to heavy pressure by panicked investors and desperate families trying to salvage their meagre savings. Eventually, not even the government itself is safe from fiscal crises: no matter how harsh the repression, or persuasive the propaganda, soon the people will demand swift action - and woe betide the leader who fails to address it..."
 slash_bureaucracy: "Slash Bureaucratic Expenses"
 slash_bureaucracy_desc: "A country's bureaucracy is often large, redundant and labyrinthine, and constitutes a large portion of any nation's budget. One of the most effective ways to reduce government spending is, therefore, the drastic reduction of bureaucratic personnel: clerks and functionaries who occupy offices perceived as non-primary are fired, while all others see a harsh reduction to their emoluments, at least until the crisis has passed.\n\nOf course, this is not without consequences: critical lack of personnel and materials will soon ensue, drastically reducing the government's ability to see its agenda enacted as many bureaucrats are unable to perform their duties effectively, and some even turn to accepting bribes in order to maintain their lifestyle. Even after the crisis has passed, consequences will haunt the nation for months or years, as the new levies will have to address mountains of backlog dossiers."
 FC_admin_cost_down: "This will §Gdecrease§! our §Yadministrative expanses§! by §G60%§! but §Rcripple our administrative efficiency for a long time§!."
 privatisation_programs: "Enact Sweeping Privatization Programs"
 privatisation_programs_desc: "Most governments, no matter their political leanings and economic loyalties, maintain a large array of public institutions, properties and activities perceived as strategically vital. From parks and forests, to nationalised armament industries and state-owned extraction operations, the State uses them as a tool to satisfy demand for staple goods and services.\n\nIn times of crisis, cash becomes more important than long-term planning. As such, privatizing a large amount of state-owned properties and businesses will fill the public coffers with money, and eliminate potential sources of additional losses: while immediately rewarding, of course, this will result in increased dependency on the market once the crisis has ended, as the government no longer has the means to directly satisfy its needs."
 FC_privatization: "This will §Rharm our stability and our income§!, but will §Ggrant us some quickly needed cash§!."
 negotiate_deferred_payment: "Negotiate Decreased Payments With Our Creditors"
 negotiate_deferred_payment_desc: "Sometimes, an egg today is better than a chicken next year. Our creditors want their money, but even they know that a rope pulled too harshly risks breaking: as such, the most threatening weapon at our disposal is the power to simply declare default. While disastrous for our economy, it would also mean all our creditors would end up without a single coin: let Sanson die with all the Philistines.\n\nSurely, we can muster convincing arguments to allow for a reduction in our overall debt, in exchange for the promise not to declare default, and eventually pay. However, threatening our creditors is not a good way to present ourselves once again into the global financial market: once the crisis is over, we can expect potential bond buyers to demand higher interest rates..."
 FC_interest_rate_down: "§RWe will decrease our interest rate by 60% in exchange of 5% of inflation§!\n"
 print_emergency: "Increase Monetary Supply"
 print_emergency_desc: "The nominalistic principle of obligations means that we have to pay the amount stated on the bond, even if that amount is no longer enough to even buy a coffee. Therefore, printing money - lots of it - can be used as a way to quickly repay large amounts of debts.\n\nOf course, this practice is not without consequences. Artificial money production equals a large increase in inflation, which may haunt our economy for years: this will also enrage the middle and lower classes, who will see their savings basically vanish overnight as the currency loses most of its buying power."
 fiscal_crisis_default_overlord: "Negotiate A Debt Repayment Plan With Our Overlord"
 fiscal_crisis_default_overlord_desc: "Thanks to our... tight relationships with a world power, we can call for their help during these troubled times. By asking them to sponsor a debt repayment plan with our creditors, we'll surely be able to secure better conditions, and maybe even a reduction in the overall amount.\n\nOf course, this kind of help never comes for free. As soon as the plan has been approved, we'll surely see an increase to \"friendly suggestions\" and requests of \"mutual cooperation\" with our sponsor, which will mostly entail allowing them greater influence in our affairs, and a larger economic penetration of their businesses into our economy: kindness can be two faced, it seems.."
 FC_overlord_cancel_debt: "Our overlord will §Grepay§! some of our §Rdebt§!, in exchange of §Rsome of our revenue§!."
 fiscal_crisis_default_1: "Issue Emergency Public Bonds"
 fiscal_crisis_default_1_desc: "In times of emergency, all citizens are called to do their duty. During a war, this obligation is fulfilled through enrolment into the army, or rationing, while during a fiscal crisis, it takes form in the way of emergency bond subscription: a propaganda campaign will stress the need to sustain the motherland by buying patriotic bonds which will most likely never be repaid.\n\nOf course, such a campaign is destined not to be well received by the population whose money we are basically asking to donate to us. However, trying never hurts, and the collected money may sustain our urgent expenses until the crisis passes: then, we might think about how to reward their loyalty."
 fiscal_crisis_default_2: "Cut A Deal With National Banks"
 fiscal_crisis_default_2_desc: "While international creditors are tough nuts to crack, national investors, and especially banks, are another matter entirely. With careful cajoling, and the right amount of threats, we might be able to \"convince\" them to give up on some of their demands in exchange for a promise to pay the rest, and some fancy public recognition.\n\nOf course, most won't be impressed, and the political backlash won't be light, but this is the only alternative we have to full payment. Private interests must be sacrificed to the country's general well being, no matter our political leanings or economic policy: survival always comes first."
 default_2_tooltip: "§RThis will slightly increase the impact of the debt on political power for the duration of the crisis.§!"
 fiscal_crisis_default_3: "Call For a Conference on our Debt"
 fiscal_crisis_default_3_desc: "Sometimes, it's best to tackle a crisis directly. Both national and international creditors expect swift action, and the best way to reassure them of our willingness to cooperate to solve this fiscal crisis is to showcase the work we are doing: by calling an international conference, everyone will be able to see our progress.\n\nAs expected, this will have political consequences. The people will interpret the conference as a way for foreign powers to exert undue influence over our affairs, and us as their willing puppets: we can expect large protests and an increased radicalization of society while the conference operates."
 fiscal_crisis_default_4: "Force Concession on Debtors"
 fiscal_crisis_default_4_desc: "Economy is a cruel world, and sometimes, even being right doesn't mean being satisfied. We need money to keep functioning, and we won't bow to our creditors: as such, we shall make it clear that we are the ones in command, not them - and if they want their money, they'll listen to us.\n\nWho cares if fewer will be willing to buy our bonds later? Our reforms will make sure we won't need as many: let them keep their money in their pockets, we'll find better ways to fill our coffers, or at least, we hope so..."
 fiscal_crisis_default_5: "Restructurate Unfavourable Bonds"
 fiscal_crisis_default_5_desc: "It is evident our creditors only wish to suffocate our economy with extortionate interest rates. With our patience long exhausted, it is time for extreme measures: by our power as a sovereign nation, we shall unilaterally decide which bonds shall be repaid, and with ones will be totally or partially restructured.\n\nThis will, of course, have consequences. International economic actors will decry our violation of the most basic rules about public obligations, but let's be real: if we have come this far, it's because we have no choice but to pay the price."
 default_5_tooltip: "§RThis will greatly increase the impact of the debt on political power for the duration of this crisis and reduce stability even more§!"
 end_econ_investment: "Cut State Programs"
 end_econ_investment_desc: "Any government funds large subsidisation programs, from education to economic development. In difficult times, the budget must be drastically redimensioned, and all available funding redirected towards more important expenses.\n\nAs one might expect, this kind of general slashing will cripple our societal and economic development. However, long-term planning is something we cannot afford: if the crisis continues, we won't have an economy to subsidise anymore."
 FC_civ_cost_down: "§RWe will temporarily decrease our state expanses at the cost of economic growth§!"
 slash_research: "Slash Research Fundings"
 slash_research_desc: "As any sane government, we invest large amounts of funds into promising scientific institutions within our country. In these troubled times, however, it is clear we can no longer afford such luxuries: research expenditures will be cut, and institutions left to fend for themselves.\n\nWe understand that this will result in an overall reduction in our ability to keep the pace of innovation, but money is a more pressing concern. Thousands of years ago, someone thought \"money\" was a great invention: if only we could get our hands on his bones..."
 FC_research_freeze: "We will §Rgreatly§! decrease how much is spent on §Yresearch§!, at the cost of §Rseverly slowing down future research efforts§!"
 restore_trust_debtors: "Buy Back Some Goodwill"
 restore_trust_debtors_desc: "Brinkmanship and overconfidence will lead us nowhere. In the end, we can't survive without someone buying our bonds, or we wouldn't have been in such a difficult situation in the first place: as such, we should work on rebuilding the market's confidence in our solvability.\n\nBy spontaneously repaying a small tranche of overdue bonds along with their interests, we'll let our creditors know that we are willing to cooperate. It will be like trying to draw blood from a stone, but we must ensure that, after this crisis is over - and it will be over, one day - we'll be able to once again face the markets without being shunned."
 freeze_military: "Cut Military Spendings"
 freeze_military_desc: "A state's power is often measured in its military power, but what use is a large military, if we can't even pay for their stipends? Rather than find ourselves with a riotous soldiery in a few months, it's best to act decisively, and choose what can be kept and what must be cut: halting any new recruitment, delaying any expansion project, and reducing to the bare minimum maintenance expenses, will surely provide relief to our state coffers.\n\nAs one might expect, this will have harsh consequences in the long run. Unattended equipment breaks more easily, old tactics and weapons will show their age against more modern opponents, and young men will think twice before enrolling, if they aren't even sure of being paid: still, a war is a war, and economic battles require sacrifices too."
 FC_mil_freeze: "§RWe will not be able to train troops, and will see our manpower craters§!, in exchange for our §Ymilitary expanses§! being reduced by §G80%§!"
