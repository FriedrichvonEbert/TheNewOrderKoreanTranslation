 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_VASILY_BLOKHIN_DESC: "어떤 이들은 엄격한 도덕규범을 가지고 있습니다. 바실리 미하일로비치 블로힌은 내무인민위원회, 즉 NKVD의 수석사형집행장으로 될 떄 오래 전 그들을 버렸습니다. His effectiveness in "wetwork" as a Cheka member would not go unnoticed, and so he would quickly gain a higher position. Blokhin's brutality was unmatched: he personally oversaw mass executions of "enemies of the state", from the most insignificant ones to those of the most prominent Bolsheviks in the history of the Soviet Union. Thousands would perish under his watch, yet he himself would manage to avoid being affected by any purges carried out.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War and the humiliating defeat of the USSR, Blokhin would not let his power go that easily. As chief of the Vorkutlag, a large gulag complex, he would exercise his power, initially as the face of the West Russian Revolutionary Front's authority. In reality, he did whatever he wanted to, and there was no one that could stop him, for they would be executed or mysteriously disappear. However, things would change with the rebellion of the gulag inmates against the guards: the formation of the dissident group of the Ural League put him in danger, but soon he would reign supreme once again as they fled southwards.\n\nVasily Blokhin was left to govern the gulags of Vorkuta, and now the city itself, on his own, especially as the WRRF crumbled with the famous West Russian War. With the help of what few guards remained, he would reorganize the area, and effectively set up his warlord state. However, Blokhin is not an ambitious man; all he wants is for his fiefdom to be left alone and survive, no matter what the cost for that may be."

 VOR_security_state_desc: "The state of Vorkuta made its origins with the NKVD officers sent to guard and survey the armies of prisoners of war, political prisoners, and violent criminals sent to pillage the vast resources of the region. From the era of the Front onwards, and past the West Russian War, the NKVD was granted free reign to rule the province as they saw fit, to maximize the crucial resources needed to keep the war machine in the West operational.\n\nOne can say they were cruel, and that they were brutal, perhaps unnecessarily so. But one cannot say that they were incompetent. The NKVD of Vorkuta, now swollen with volunteers and 'rehabilitated' prisoners is a formidable machine, with truly fearful capabilities in the field of combat, security, and intelligence-gathering."
 VOR_inhospitable_climate_desc: "Vorkuta's climate, to put it as lightly as anyone is likely to, is brutally cold and unforgiving. In many parts of the region, permafrost cakes the ground, agriculture is impossible, and hunting is unfruitful. Unwinterized equipment is liable to freeze, and ill-prepared soldiers are liable to suffer. To fight in these harsh conditions is not a prospect one should take lightly, or approach with anything other than caution and acceptance of the dangers involved."
