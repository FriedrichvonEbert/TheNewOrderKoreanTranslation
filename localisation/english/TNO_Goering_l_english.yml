 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC:0 "괴링은 \"만약 연합군 폭격기가 한 대라도 독일에 닿는다면, 나를 헤르만 마이어라 불러도 좋다!\"라고 한 적이 있습니다. 세계대전에서 국가사회주의가 승리함으로서 괴링의 허풍은 더 이상 허풍이 아니게 되었고, 연합군이 패배하면서 괴링의 명성은 드높아졌습니다.\n\n어찌보면 정치적으로 유능하다 할 수 있는 사고방식과 깡패, 민병대, 그리고 '애국자' 등을 사용해 그의 권력을 방해하는 자들을 몰아내는 것으로 괴링은 군부의 목소리에 진정으로 귀를 귀울이는 유일한 정치인으로서 독일 정계의 중심 인물이 되었습니다. 다른 좋은 집권 방법을 찾지 못한 괴링은 늙은 총통을 '라이히가 번영할 유일한 방법은 바로 라이히의 적들을 완전히 파괴하는 것'이라고 확신하게 만든 제복을 입은 아첨꾼들과 길을 같이했습니다.\n\n이제, 괴링은 많은 사람들이 라이히의 패망으로 가는 지름길이라 생각하는 길을 행진하고 있습니다. 그러나 이것은 그가 얼마 안가 망할 것이라는 가정 하에서 그런 것인데, 왜냐하면 괴링이 바다 건너에 눈길을 돌린다면 어떤 일이 일어날지는 상상만 할 수 있기 때문입니다."
 POLITICS_ALBERT_BORMANN_DESC:0 "라이히와 같이 파벌주의와 뇌물에 취약한 정권에서는 자연스럽게 최고위 당직자 중 한 명의 형이 능력과는 상관 없이 자신이 원하는 만큼 고위직에 올라갈 수 있을 것이라 생각할 수 있습니다. 알베르트 보어만은 이에 동의하지 않을 것입니다. 당수부장이자 라이히의 최고 권력자 중 하나인 마르틴 보어만의 형임에도 불구하고 형제의 쌀쌀맞은 관계로 알베르트는 쉽게 정부 고위층으로 갈 수가 없었습니다. 하지만 예전에 있었던 총통과의 끈끈한 유대관계는 그를 완전히 홀로 두게 만들지 않았습니다. 당연히 그가 한 때 육군 내 중재자로 활약했을 때 아돌프 히틀러는 그를 항상 좋아했으며 알베르트가 관계가 소원한 동생 때문에 저 멀리 있는 국가판무관부 중 한 곳에서 썩혀 버려지지 않도록 만든 것도 고 총통의 후원으로 가능했던 일이었습니다.\n\n총통의 사망은 모든 것을 위협했습니다. 즉, 승리자가 라이히 권력층 내에 있는 다른 주요 보호자인 군국주의자들의 사랑, 헤르만 괴링이 아니였다면 실제로 위험했을 것입니다. 군국주의가 장교들을 제국원수로 붙게 만들었고, 그 또한 마르틴은 가졌던 적이 없는 괴링만의 상당한 매력에 빠졌습니다. 이제 괴링은 그의 가장 큰 적 중 한 명의 형제였지만 이제는 기꺼이 그의 명령을 이행할 유능한 행정관을 얻게 되었습니다."
 GER_Otto_Ernst_Remer_army_chief:0 "§Y쇠르너가 도살자라고 한다면 오토 에른스트 레머는 그의 피 묻은 칼일 것입니다. 나치가 일어나기 직전 성인이 된 젊은 장교인 레머는 국가사회주의를 위해 몸과 마음을 바쳤습니다. 레머는 폴란드, 발칸반도, 바르바로사 작전 기간에 뛰어난 활약을 펼쳤고 결국 그로스도이칠란트 사단의 대대장으로 승전했습니다. 레머는 총통 히틀러가 직접 곡엽 기사십자 철십자장을 수여해주는 최고의 영광을 누리기도 했습니다. 레머의 부대는 마침내 연방이 붕괴된 러시아 심장부 깊숙히부터 전쟁이 끝난 영국 북부의 언덕에 이르기까지 전쟁에서 가장 치열한 전장에 참여했습니다.\n\n그 후 오랜 세월 동안 꾸준히 독일 국방군 내에서 영향력을 키워 온 레머는 빠르게 성장하여 페르디난트 쇠르너의 오른팔이 되었으며 결국에는 군국주의자 장교 군단 파벌의 2인자가 되었습니다. 레머는 동료 전쟁광과 직속상관에 대한 존경심이 강하지만, 그의 존경심은 국가사회주의의 최종적인 세계승리를 가져온다고 믿고 그 목표를 달성하기 위해 가장 적극적으로 나설 수 있다고 생각하는 이에게 향할 것입니다.§!"

 GENERAL_JOHANNES_STEINHOFF_DESC:0 "§L루프트바페의 영웅들 중 그 누구보다도 앞서는 한 조종사가 있습니다. 그는 요하네스 슈타인호프입니다. 손꼽히는 경험 많은 에이스 중 하나인 슈타인호프는 제2차 세계 대전 발발서부터 종전때까지 도처에서 항공 임무를 수행하며 끝까지 살아남은 극소수의 조종사 중 한명입니다. ME262 제트기 프로토타입을 시험 조종하는 동안 참혹한 사고로 화상을 입은 후에도 슈타인호프는 병원에서 화상 치료를 받은 후 다시 하늘로 날라갔습니다. 그런 귀중한 자산을 잃고 싶지 않았던 괴링은 슈타인호프를 루프트바페 사관학교로 보내 그곳에서 몇 년간 학교장으로 근무했습니다. 슈타인호프는 서러시아 전쟁이 찾아오며 다시 날아야 했지만 그 이후에는 교관으로 남은 여생을 평화롭게 살기를 바랬습니다. 하지만 독일에 내전이 찾아오자 공군 에이스는 다시 한 번 더 어려운 선택을 해야만 했습니다. 결국 그는 고 총통께서 결정하였던 후계자였던 헤르만 괴링의 뒤를 따르기로 결정하였습니다. 이 때 제국원수는 슈타인호프를 단지 교관 숙소에 두러 하지 않았고, 괴링의 승리 직후 노장은 이제 루프트바페의 최고 지휘관이 되었습니다.§!"

 GER_Rudolf_Diels_sec_desc:0 "§YChef der Geheime Staatspolizei\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LBefore there was Hangman Heydrich, before there was Gestapo Müller, there was Rudolf Diels. Diels is another of the long-time Göring cronies who have seen their fortunes rise dramatically thanks to their patron's ascent to Führership. Diels and Göring first met in 1933 when the latter was given the position as Minister-President of Prussia where Diels served as the head of the Preußische Geheimpolizei, the state's secret police. Thanks to his work, Diels had an encyclopedic knowledge of prominent political figures, including members of the Nazi party, and some of their dirtiest secrets. Seeing the potential benefit of having Diels' knowledge at his beck and call, Göring established what would soon become the Gestapo and placed Diels in charge of it. Diels tenure as Gestapo director would only last a year however as Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich would work to undercut him within the government. Their maneuvering paid off and in 1934 Diels's tenure came to an end with Reinhard Heydrich succeeding him as the head of the Gestapo.\n\nDiels has kept largely to himself for the past two decades, although his connection to the Reichsmarschall has only deepened - he is even married to Ilse Göring, cousin of the Führer. Now that the accursed Heydrich is gone however, Diels can regain control of the organization that was always rightfully his and a new era of the Gestapo's dominance within the Reich is about to commence.§!"
 GGR_Artur_Axmann_for_desc:0 "§YReichsjugendführer\nNational Socialism§!\n------------\n§LArtur Axmann is considered one of the first politicians wholly of the Nazi generation. Artur first joined the NSDAP in secondary school, becoming an exemplary member of the Hitler Youth. After his graduation from the youth ranks of the organization, Artur became Reichsjugendführer, and fully took upon his shoulders the responsibility of teaching the German youth of the greatness of National Socialism and of the German Reich. Notably, he was also responsible for conscripting members of the Hitler Youth into the German army.\n\nAlways a patriot, Axmann also gave service to his country during the Second World War. He fought with the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front, though was sadly forced to retire from this duty when he lost his arm in combat. Artur has known no life but that of a loyal Nazi since he was a child, and as such, remains totally and absolutely dedicated to the cause he has been brought up upon. As such, he is a clear symbol of the intelligence and dedication of the German children.§!"
 GER_Ferdinand_Schorner_high_command_desc:0 "§YChef des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht\nStratocratic Nazism§!\n--------------\n§LThey call him "Butcher", "Bloody Ferdinand", "Hound of War" and many other brutal sobriquets. He is content with the title of Generalfeldmarshcall. He is skilled in large scale operations involving hundreds of thousands of men, and he cares nothing for their individual lives. Ferdinand Schörner is a man loved by none and feared by all. In the West Russian War it was said, the chances of being hanged as a deserter was greater than the chance of death in combat. His sway in the military was more than proven when, following a brief coup attempt at the end of that war, Schörner found his prospects for power actually rising.\n\nA veteran of the First World War, Ferdinand would end up as one of the Führer's favorite commanders in the Second. In more recent times he has also cultivated a mutually beneficial partnership with Reichsmarschall Göring, the old ace lending his political capital to Schörner's requests in exchange for the loyalty of the militarist faction.\n\nStill, the old devil of the Eastern Front has his own designs for the future, ones that may or may not require any politician to be his master. His rivalry with the other star of the Wehrmacht, Hans Speidel, is one of the largest obstacles he has yet to encounter. Only time will tell if he has finally met his match, or, as some fear, he is only a step away from achieving his own ambitions.§!"

Schörner is livid and almost frothing at the mouth in his insistence that the SS remains a threat to the colony and direct military action is necessary, but the recovery has been too successful and the opportunity for his measures to be enacted has passed.

This union would normally not happen so soon, but the Führer is confident that this step is necessary to ensure that Ostland recovers swiftly and enjoys the full benefits of being part of the Reich proper.

Still, he might be amenable to working with Göring despite their political differences. Indeed, secretly, Göring is relieved to be dealing with a conservative rather than a militarist, as the latter would undoubtedly have been in Field Marshal Schörner's pocket.

However, traitors from inside destroyed the Reichskommissariat, and the fool Terboven handed the Reich's greatest fortress over to the people and abandoned Norway to them.

Though many of the militarists, notably Schörner, have complained about what they see as the politicians taking their glory, it is widely agreed upon that no Germans should die over such a rock as Norway.\n\nWe can only wait and hope they accept.

Unfortunately, the bases have slowly wasted away, due to the relatively tight budget of the Kriegsmarine in the last 20 years and the loss of control at the start of our Civil War.\n\nTo fix this, we will send thousands of slaves and materials to fix these bases, turning them into the great harbors and naval bases to rival those in Iceland.

By using our fleet to cut off major ports and blockade the coastline, we will shatter the Norwegian economy, causing economic collapse and driving the Norwegians to poverty and starvation. If the plan succeeds, the Norwegians will be too weak to lift a finger against our forces when we land.\n\nUnfortunately, this plan does have some flaws. The Kriegsmarine is underfunded and still somewhat damaged from the chaos of the civil war, and currently is not in the best shape to conduct any large scale operations such as a blockade of the long Norwegian coastline. In addition, the fortifications we built with German sweat to hold off any western invasions, complete with naval guns, are undoubtedly now in the hands of the traitorous Norwegians, and may be used against our fleet.\n\nBoth of these problems are easily fixable, of course. Pumping money into programs is one of Göring's strengths, and the sheer might of our cannons and weapons will undoubtedly be enough to obliterate whatever puny resistance the Norwegians may put up.

Where once airborne troops would have to leap from bulky transport planes in limited numbers, now full squads of men can be quickly and efficiently transported in helicopters. Not only that, but helicopters can also be used as a form of close air support, supporting troops and providing quick fire on any enemies on the ground. By using this fascinating new technology, we can swarm the resisting Norwegians with a cloud of steel and lead, overwhelming their defenses and seizing ports before they can mount a defense.\n\nOf course, helicopters have their drawbacks. Their slow speed makes them susceptible to anti-aircraft attacks, and their air-to-air capabilities are limited at best. However, with the numbers we will bring, this will not matter.

To combat this, we shall use an invention that the strategists of 1940 could only dream of- missiles. By building up bases in Denmark, we will be able to fire missiles of all kinds into the mountains of Norway, obliterating any bunkers and forts in a hail of rockets and bombs, without a single German man being forced to lay his life on the line.\n\nIn addition to the immediate strategic benefit of these bases, they will also be a fine addition to our defenses against any American incursion into Europe, covering the entrance into the Baltic and much of the North Sea. Indeed, some have even gotten to asking why these positions have not been built before now. While the answer to this mainly lies in the economic downturn of the 50's, this issue matters little to the current situation.

This development, while unfortunate for obvious reasons, has left the Oberkommando in an even larger state of outrage than normal.

Obviously, now that the same Göring that Koch revered is in control of Ukraine, the fears of the Ukranian populace has increased. Everywhere our soldiers go, there is passive resistance. Natives refuse to follow orders, insolent citizens lie to our soldiers regularly, and decrees from the Reichskommissar go unheeded. This cannot stand, but the standard strategy of brutally cracking down is so clearly a mistake in this situation that even Schörner is against it.\n\nInstead, as much as it pains us to stoop so low, we must win back the people of Ukraine through a hearts and minds campaign. By loosening our grip, imposing softer punishments, and generally being less imposing to the natives, we can hopefully convince those who are mistrustful that Koch was not the norm, but rather the exception."

The ghost of the food issue still haunts the Wehrmacht, and it must be exorcised if we wish to assuage their fears.\n\nFood from Ukraine will now be redirected into massive grain stockpiles, located within Germany proper, in order to make sure our food reserves will never be threatened again. Though the cost of these massive silos will undoubtedly be gigantic, surely the profit of never risking a food shortage again will be worth the high price. After all, such a huge stockpile can also be used in public relations, to show that the Führer cares for his people. These silos may serve more of a purpose than just calming the army."

The Slavs toil in the fields, the Germans watch on from the cities, and the natural order restores itself with the Aryan above the Slav, as it always should have been.\n\nEach day that goes by brings a report that numbers of attacks, shootings, and casualties are returning to pre-civil war levels. Of course, such a success requires parades and celebrations all across Germany, of which both have been celebrated. Perhaps the happiest men in Germany, though, are the Führer and Schörner, who both celebrate for different reasons.\n\nSchörner celebrates because the Wehrmacht once again has a great success under its belt, and every day its standing with the people grows.\n\nGöring celebrates because, once again, the wealth of Ukraine is in his hands, and the people's adoration returns to him almost as quickly as it rains down upon the soldiers who fought for the fields of Ukraine.\n\nThe victory in Ukraine is surely one to remember, and one can only hope that such success continues to follow the Wehrmacht in its next exploits."

In German People's eyes, they aren't as noble and brave as the Basques, since all they've done is complaining about the oppression from Madrid and they don't even have the courage to form their own resistance organization like the Eta.\n\nAs a result, while the Basques are receiving favored treatment from the Reich, the Catalans will face harsh rule from us. Their industries and resources will be nationalized by Germany, and every move they take will be closely watched. If they dare to do anything without the permission from us, they're going to face some serious consequences. In the past, they said they don' t like to be oppressed by Spain, but only from now on, they're going to realize what real oppression means."

Believing the long-distance from Berlin can stop us from efficiently governance, some resistance groups have risen and taken up arms to fight against us.\n\nBut for the Reich, every inch of land with the border is precious and must be watched and ruled seriously. We will never keep a close eye due to the long distance, but on the contrary, even more efforts will be taken to make our control of the peninsula can be controlled as solid as other parts in Europe. No one can get away from the Reich's fist, even if they live in the remotest corner of the earth."

Meanwhile, with the fall of Iberian nations, the desert of Morocco is now a land without owner, and all we need to do is to take whatever still lies there.\n\nIn addition, the fall of Gibraltar also means the lifeline of Mediterranean nations is now in the grasp of us. The block of dam will greatly weaken our potential enemies in that area such as Turkey and Italy and make our conquest of Europe much easier. Once upon a time, the great power who controls the whole Mediterranean was seen the greatest empire in the world. And from today, the golden road of glory and greatness has lied before us."

To ensure the secure of our western border when the war with Italy begins, Iberia must be brought knee as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to the Führer's command, this new military operation named Fall Blau will be tasked to wipe those factions out in one single invasion and restore stability on the Peninsula. Soon we'll be enjoying the blue ocean and golden sunshine of Atlantic, as well as local people's cheers for peace on the western beach of Iberian Peninsula and cheering at the success of Fall Blau."

Time flies, and the empire has long gone into dust, leaving nothing but total trash behind it. Some wise men like Franco and Salazar had tried to hold the last ray of their former glory, but even their efforts were in vain at the end. At this moment, the peninsula is consumed in the flame of bloody conflicts, with different factions fighting endlessly with each other, hoping to find their own place in this chaotic abyss.\n\nBut only we know that, soon this brutal drama will meet its end, as the Reich's iron fist has prepared to smash on the peninsula.

In Iberia, when all other states were fighting against each other for their own causes, the Galicians on the northeast part of the peninsula are greedily collecting coins by smuggling weapons to all other warring states.\n\nFrom the national socialist point of view, such an avaricious nation is a shame of human kind and a natural enemy of German people. The Wehrmacht will be tasked to eliminate this dirty deed quickly and precisely, and annihilate all those blood-sucking insects from the earth, rekindling the flame of morality on the peninsula with our national socialist holy flames."

In fact, betrayals and other dirty deeds are nothing new in our so-called allies. And at this moment, when the Reich is focused on the conquest of Galicia in the remote corner of Iberia, those parasites in the Pakt have found their opportunities to weaken the Reich by smuggling weapons to the enemies of the Reich.\n\nTo prevent their crimes from damaging the Reich's cause, we must take inspections on these nations and crack down all suspected moves we can find. A new Pakt free from the harassment of inspects will serve the European nation much better than before."
 GGR_the_misguided_desc:0 "Not all ethnic groups in Iberia are inferiors in our National Socialist racial theory. The Basques, for instance, is viewed as fellow Aryans in our eyes. Though long oppressed by the Spanish in history, the Basques have never given up their struggle for national liberation and their rightful place in the world. Such courage, resolve and unyielding will is just the proof of their noble origins, and are always respected by the German people.\n\nHowever, even the most noble child could still fall into a wrong and dark path without rightful guidance. Trapped in the Iberian quagmire, the Basque people have forgotten their blood and degenerate into barbarism and ignorance. Luckily, as the natural leader of all Aryan people in this world, the Reich has more than enough patience toward its little brothers. Now, we're going to shoulder the responsibility of the Basque nation's education and guide them back to the shining road that they're born to take."
 GGR_setting_up_shop_desc:0 "The Iberia Peninsula is distant from Germania, and the situation there can be very complex to deal with. Consequently, it will be a necessity to set up local headquarter for the Wehrmacht if we wish to push further into the hearts of Iberian nations. And with the conquest of Basque people's homeland, we've found the ideal position for this headquarter.\n\nLocated on the north part of Iberia, the Reichskommissariat Baskenland will be tasked to maintain local order, collect industries, and most importantly, serve as the command center of our forces on the Iberian battlefield. Each unit is an organ, and the HQ will be the brain to coordinate their moves and make actions as quickly as possible."

Though they've lost almost everything they'd conquest in hundreds of years, their old memories about being the master of Iberia and even a world empire has never faded in their heart.\n\nHowever, as the Reich has made them the next target of our conquest, even the most idealistic Spanish people must face the fact that the hope has extinguished in this cursed land.

To merely maintain the illusion of their old lives, they'll be willing to work with anything or anyone which they can find hope from. And the good news is, we've decided to give them a hand.\n\nBy giving them a little financial and material assistance, they will be asked to cooperate with us in administration and policing. With someone both loyal to us and familiar with local situation, our rule in the Peninsula will be much more solid."

Found by the veterans from the famous División Azul, their belief in our national socialist doctrine has stood the test of battle and time. And now, as the Reich is looking for collaborators in the Iberian campaign, a helping hand from them is worthy of consideration.\n\nFor now, the Führer has authorized the shipment of guns and ammunitions to the fighters in the Frente Azul. Some may holds doubts about such a decision, for the Frente Azul has been known for their brutality and insane activities, but we know that political interests is the only thing that the Reich should consider, and we'll never stop here for some stupid moral reasons."

Though their rebellion gives us the opportunity to launch an attack into the Peninsula, such treachery has angered our honest soldiers greatly, and many have been looking forward to destroy them since the Iberian Civil War breaks out.\n\nFor the Reich, however, the invasion of Catalonia also has its strategic significance. Catalonia is at the borders of our sphere, and it will be a breaking point of our military campaigns in the Peninsula. Meanwhile, the destruction of Catalonian rebels will be a great strike for those who hope to see the end of our new order, especially those cunning leftists. Be aware, you filthy rebel scums, the Reich is prepared to strike back right now."

Some has to stand against such evil, and that warrior would be no one but the German Reich.\n\nFrom the famous Sagrada Família to the sunny beaches, each brick of this city is polluted by the sins of the Catalans. This city cannot be allowed to exist in this world anymore, for it will only produce nothing but more madness and chaos. The German artilleries will raze its buildings and streets to the ground, and when all sounds become silent, purity will be restored in this wasteland."
 GGR_the_traitors_desc:0 "For a very long time, the Portugese had been the master of Iberia alongside the Spanish. When Franco and Salazar decided to unite their two nations, they thought it could ensure the unity and stability of their beloved homeland. But in the end, the Portuguese betrayed such a noble plan, leading to the downfall of the Union and the following catastrophe.\n\nThough Portugal is the most distant nation in Western Europe, their despicable deeds has angered all brave Aryan warriors, for loyalty is the most precious virtue in our culture. The Portuguese will pay the penalties for their stupid decisions before, and the Reich's realm will reach the westernmost coast of the European Continent."
 GGR_divide_the_discontent_desc:0 "A traitor will never stay loyal to anything, even their own kinsmen. After the fall of Iberian Union, the Portuguese quickly turned on each other, consumed in their endless in-fighting in the name of ideology or political ideals. Therefor the new government of Portugal's fate has destined that it will continue to collapse into pieces even though they've just gained their precious independence.\n\nHowever, the weakness of our enemy will bring opportunity to us. By simply spreading rumors about their current government, those Portuguese who share different ideology with its leader will gladly betray it and eventually crashed it down, stopping them from organizing resistance towards us. Pity nations like the Portuguese will never understand the power hidden in the words of "unity" and "loyalty"."

Spain, Catalonia, Basque, Portugal, Galicia... many names have fought for this realm, but in the end, they are all swept by the Wehrmacht, kenning before our boots, trembling and begging softly for our mercy.\n\nThough all those names have become nothing but a page in our history books, the work is still far from being finished. There's still lots of unrests spreading over the Peninsula, and many is watching in the darkness, watching to destabilize our rule that has just been set up. But for this moment, let us all rejoice for another glorious triumph of our great fatherland! Sieg Heil!"
 GGR_the_hub_of_iberia_desc:0 "In history, Spain is always the hub of Iberia, both geographically and politically. As a results, those who control Madrid controls the whole peninsula, and if we wish to secure our dominance of Iberia, Spain must become the heart of our governance.\n\nHowever, since the decline of Spain as a world power, its industries have been known for being backward, and its infrastructures are even worse. To ensure our rule over Spain, a huge construction program must be made to improve the infrastructure levels to a standard that can at least be tolerated in our eyes. We acknowledge it won't be easy to finish such a grand work in a short time, but the Reich is always capable of making miracles, right?"
 GGR_securing_loyalty_desc:0 "The nations of Iberia have been wiped out, and now there exists six different RKs in the Iberian Peninsula in total. We know that relationship between central and local governments is always a serious problem for all regimes in Iberia, and the fall of Iberian Union has shown us what could happen if we cannot find a proper solution about it.\n\nHowever, the Reich is different from all previous and corrupt regimes. All those RKs will be observed closely by our agents, and every move they take cannot avoid our attention.

Now, the dam is under the control of the Reich's enemy, and if we don't take it back, the Third Reich's Europe is always threatened by our wicked opponents.\n\nTo alter such an awkward situation, the Führer has ordered to advance and occupy the dam regardless of its defender's warning. Some cowards may be worried that such an act may be seen as a provocation in other nations' eyes and leads to the total war against another great power, but our generals are confident that we're just calling our enemy's bluff. Nuclear war? It's impossible, right?"

If the dam continues to be under control of such an unreliable person, he Third Reich's Europe is always under threaten.\n\nTo alter such an awkward situation, the Führer has ordered to advance and occupy the dam regardless of its defender's warning.

Therefore an ultimate will be given to them with an option, surrender to the Reich or face our invincible troops, and it won't be a difficult question for them to answer, will it?"
 GGR_forming_the_asb_desc:0 "Iberia has been conquered, the civil war has ended, but the Peninsula is far from pacification. Nationalists, monarchists, liberalist, socialists, anarchists and even communists must be plotting against their new master, and the terrorist organizations that founded long before our conquest still exists and will always threaten our regime like haunting ghosts if we don't deal with them. Action must be taken immediately if we wish to have a stable Iberia at our back.\n\nThat action, as our trusted generals have seen, is not difficulty to find. In the past, the Iberian Union had the Axencia Anti-Separatista to fight against the terrorists, and we will create a similar department called "Agentur zur Seperatistenbekämpfung", or ASB in short. Some may say learning from the AAS will be a mistake, for they had totally failed their duties in past, but how the hell could the German agents act as poorly as those Latin trash? A peaceful and stable Iberia will be created by the ASB swiftly and effectively."
 GGR_divert_their_attention_desc:0 "The fall of Iberian nations has taught us a simple truth: a united Iberia may be powerful enough to challenge our hegemony over their land, but a divided Iberia will be easy to conquest and rule. If we could make them busy fighting with each other, they will never have opportunity and ability to stage an uprising against our RKs above their heads just like how they defeated Napoleon's forces in the 19th century.\n\nTo fan the flames of ethical conflict, we will spread provocative rumors and give them enough space to argue with other ethnic groups. Thousands of years has planted seeds of hatred toward neighbors in their hearts, and all we need to do is to provide a little water, so that flowers of conflict and blood will blossom on every corner of Iberia."

While many thought they are just enemies of the Reich that need to be eliminated, some intelligent generals have persuaded the Führer that by proper words and price some of those terrorists will be willing to serve the Reich since we may have the same targets with them.\n\nWith those 'allies' on our side, a lot of manpower and equipment will be saved on the villages and mountains of Iberia, and the threats that our RKs face will be much easier to deal with. They may not be the best friends we can make, and it is understandable such some may think the places we choose to make friends are too weird, but no one can deny that they will be useful friends to us. And if someone is foolish enough to question our decision, well, they'll be 'convinced' after all."

To ensure the secure of our western border when the war with Italy begins, Iberia must be brought knee as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, in Iberia, to prevent their inevitable falling into our hands, a desperate attempt was taken by Franco and Salazar-to merge their two nations into one Iberian Union. And after all these years of jealousies and disagreements, the Union manages to survive against all odds. But despite of how strong the fort Spanish and Portuguese have built is, they're naïve to believe that it can resist the power of the German Reich.

 GGR_securing_france_desc:0 "As our plans for securing domination of the Iberian peninsula develop, it is time we turn our attention to a secondary matter, but one that is pressing nonetheless. The French State was able to wriggle free of our grasp in the chaos of the civil war, and it just so happens that they have the only land border with the Iberian Union that we could hope to exploit. Attempting amphibious assaults across the coast of Iberia is possible but significantly more risky than storming across the Pyrenees.\n\nThe French are of course far too weak to oppose us, even if they are independent now. All we would have to do is threaten an invasion and they will no doubt fold. They won't risk another invasion after their recent losses to Burgundy and Brittany. With our old puppet restored we'll be able to much more directly apply force to Iberia, and then to Italy and even Burgundy when their times come."
 GGR_a_multi_front_invasion_desc:0 "The military power Iberian Union holds is much weaker than any great power, and it's due to the tough terrain and forts in the hills that they believe they can resist our forces. And it's clear that direct frontal assault will be a idea that only fools would have a try. To prevent the unnecessary loss of the Heer, special forces will be tasked with the vital part of this campaign.\n\nWhen the war breaks out, our specials forces will immediately set out and breakthrough the enemy's front. Our paratroops will land from the air like eagles, our marines will appear from the sea like sharks, and our mountain infantries will sneak in and destroy their forts in hill like ghosts. Those Iberians have no point what modern warfare looks like, and this time we will show them about how huge the gap between their military forces and ours is."

Of course, the Reich and his noble guardians will never become some filthy bastards like the Burgundians, yet we have to admit that sometimes the Burgundian ways are quite useful for us.\n\nTo ensure our current war plan against the Iberian Union, the Führer and his generals have decided that we will start to fund those terrorist groups in Iberia like the Eta, hoping to cause the stir in Iberia. And when Iberia was in havoc, the Union will have to scatter their forces in the whole Peninsula. It may be seen a shame by some as we need to learn from those Burgundians, but it will be disgraceful if we cannot achieve a quick victory against the Iberian Union."

Yours is a restless life, and never shall you know peace, until you've freed your kinsmen from the iron cage made by the rulers in Madrid.

Convinced by their points, the Führer has grant the Abwehr full authority over our negotiation with those organizations. After all, some disorderly terrorists are much easier to deal with than Iberian regular army, and they are a far more distant threat to consider. For now, the Iberian Union is all we need to think about."

However, the Führer has much cooler head than those officials, and he has made a more cautious decision.\n\nAccording to the Führer's command, we need to keep our funds to those terrorists at the minimum level instead of meet their needs. Every one need to learn that the Reich isn't their babysitter and they don't have rights to make demands on us. And more importantly, we only need them to distract the Iberian forces, and when the conquest of Iberia finish, they will be much easier for us to deal with if they have only received little help from us.

And now, the chance has been offered to the Wehrmacht.\n\nUnder the governance of Iberian Union, a lot of Portuguese who faced oppressed by the Union have expressed their willingness to help our war cause. We could use them to subvert the local government of Iberian Union, and by doing this, we shall be able to weaken the resistance we're going to face when the war breaks out.

From lush forest to steep mountains, from frozen land to muddy swamps, every kind of terrain made by the earth has been conquered by us, and the Iberian Union won't become a insuperable barrier to our forces.\n\nTo easily root out the resistance, our special troops will receive specific training designed for the landform of Iberian Peninsula. And with the incomparable military power, the Reich will provide our courageous soldiers the highest standard of training in this world.

And the bad news is, decades of chaos have doomed the infrastructures in France, and the Iberian governments is also incapable of constructing a few modern roads. If we wish to invade Iberia from France, we're going to face the problem of slow marching speed and shortage of supplies.\n\nSuch a situation is obviously not what we wish to face, yet the Reich still needs to get it at any cost. Unlike those incompetent nations, the national socialist doctrine has given us unimaginable power to concentrate our nation's strength on the major tasks we're going to face. Time is running out for us, but no matter how impossible it seems, we'll build broad and unblocked highways and railroads from Paris to the heart of Iberia, and that's why the Third Reich is the unchallengeable hegemony of the world."

New air bases will be built on our little beachhead to facilitate troop and supply movement, along with a steady stream of combat aircraft to provide cover for our advancing forces. Our objective will be to seal off Iberian North Africa as a potential fallback point for our foes. We have seen with our own eyes the damage that soldiers from Iberian can do when operating out of their colonial possessions. Were we not the ones who helped bring Franco to Spain during their own civil war? We will not make the mistakes of the Second Spanish Republic."

Though rapid progress in technology has been achieved by human since the 19th century, without smooth roads we may still reach into the same dilemma that consumed Napoleon Bonaparte's invincible army more than one hundred years ago. And the bad news is, decades of chaos have doomed the infrastructures in France, and the Iberian governments is also incapable of constructing a few modern roads. If we wish to invade Iberia from France, we're going to face the problem of slow marching speed and shortage of supplies.\n\nSuch a situation is obviously not what we wish to face, yet the Reich still needs to get it at any cost. Unlike those incompetent nations, the national socialist doctrine has given us unimaginable power to concentrate our nation's strength on the major tasks we're going to face. Time is running out for us, but no matter how impossible it seems, we'll build broad and unblocked highways and railroads from Paris to the heart of Iberia, and that's why the Third Reich is the unchallengeable hegemony of the world." #duplicate loc key

Your government has failed you, and your army is too corrupted to organize any real defenses against us. Your cities will be razed, villages will be pillaged, industries will be seized and everyone of you will be forced to work for the Reich whether you like it or not. In a nutshell, you and the Iberian Union, are doomed.\n\nHowever, there's still one opportunity for you to take. All we wish to destroy is the Iberian government and its loyalists, and anyone wish shares the same enemy with us can become our allies. We German people are benevolent and we'd like to show you mercy as long as you're feeling oppressed by the Iberian government and willing to fight against it. People of Basque, Catalonia and Portugal, please don't let this once-in-a-lifetime chance slip through your fingers! Stand up, join the German side! Together we can overthrow the bureaucrats in Madrid and rule the Iberian Peninsula as close allies."

The Basques have been oppressed by Madrid for a very long time, and their hatred towards Spain is getting ever stronger in these days. If we can get their support via some propaganda and diplomatic methods, their struggle in the north will do us a great favor in our war against the Iberian Union. To achieve this, a propaganda article haven been drafted by our diplomats.\n\n"People of Basque, please hear our voice. You are one of the bravest nations in this world, and a close kin of we Germans ethnically. But for years, you've been humiliated, tortured and oppressed by the Spanish bastards. We do admire your unyielding determination to fight against it, but you cannot win this war on your own. Now please answer to our call of friendship and join this holy war against the Iberian Union. You will win your rightful place in our New Order once we succeed.""
 GGR_call_to_the_catalans_desc:0 "Our initial plan about the total civil war didn't go well, but we can still reach out to those who had already been hostile toward the government of Iberian Union before our propaganda. At the west of Iberian Peninsula, the Catalans have been oppressed by Madrid for a long period, and they're willing to do anything for their independence. Though they've been polluted by decayed values and will be enslaved by us according to our post-war plan, we can still make a temporary alliance with them before the fall of the Iberian Union. To achieve this, a propaganda article haven been drafted by our diplomats.\n\n"People of Catalonia, we know you may not like us, but it doesn't matter right now. Please think about it, is there any benefits for you to reject our proposal of alliance and friendship. Accept our invitation, fight alongside the German Reich against your enemies in Madrid, and you'll have the freedom you've craved for decades. As the most sagacious nation in Southern Europe, you won't forsake such a precious chance, will you?""
 GGR_call_to_the_portugese_desc:0 "Unlike the fools of Basque and Catalonia, our agents in Portugal have brought us good news after our ultimate.

With the Portuguese on our side, the Iberian Union will collapse To achieve this, a propaganda article haven been drafted by our diplomats.\n\n"People of Portugal, twenty years ago, the Spanish lied to you, cajoled you into the so-called 'Iberian Union'. But twenty years have passed, we know that you have through their true ambitions under the name of it. Are you an equal partner of the Spain, or a low servant in their eyes? You must have already gotten the right answer in your head, and now, the German Reich has come to give you a hand. Twenty years ago, that lie started with the fear of a fabricated 'German invasion', and now, after twenty years, you can end it with a real German invasion of Spain. Fortune is smiling on you, and please take this chance to correct your mistakes in the past, for you won't have a better one more.""
 GGR_but_no_one_answered_desc:0 "Hearing our call of friendship, many Iberians contact us and expressed their expectation for an alliance with the Reich. The Reich, of course, appreciates their good intentions, but it is a shame that the luck doesn't stand on their side even though they made the right choice. Considering the current situation in Iberia, they're not needed anymore. And since they're definitely not racial brothers of the Reich, there is no reason that they could enjoy any privilege that other Iberian people shouldn't have. Any promises we made before will be defined as fabricated and invalid, and they will be treated like all other dissenters and the Iberian scums. All must understand that no one can bargain with the German Reich, and total submission is only way he can take.\n\nAnd after dealing with those bastards, all memories of our promises will disappear with them. No one is going to know what happened during our conquest of Iberian, and all Iberians will live equally in fear from this time on."
 GGR_demand_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "Dissenters never disappeared in Iberian Peninsula: in this past, they keep criticizing the rule of Franco and Salazar, saying their authoritarian regime is an oppression of everyone in their nation; and now, we know that many is hostile toward our governance and secretly cursing our soldiers, generals and officials. They won't be able to do this anymore. The former rulers of Iberian didn't succeed in suppressing those dissents, and their failure has leaded to their final collapse before our forces. We, with our advanced experience of purging those insects in other places, cannot repeat their foolishness.\n\nFrom this day on, all Iberians must be totally loyal towards the German Reich. Every move they make, every word they speak and every mood they expressed will be closely watched by our agents, and any sign of disobedience will lead to imprisonment or even execution. They can have no doubts, no hesitations and even no free thoughts, for all they need to know is to follow our orders. They used to think they cannot stand anymore under the 'oppression' of the Caudillos, but now they will understand what true oppression really means."
 GGR_no_more_games_desc:0 "The ghost of terrorism has been haunting around Iberia since the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War, as different organizations directly fighting against the government all over the peninsula. And the Iberian government, due to their inefficiency and corruption, never really suppressed those terrorists. Consequently, the strength of those organizations kept growing and caused more and more troubles every day. Eventually, the prosperity and stability of Iberian Union was doomed in constant violence and riots.\n\nBut now, we could tell those terrorists that, their good old days are gone. Failing to pacify its own realm is a shame for a nation, and we cannot act like those Latin scums. There will be no more stupid childlike games between police and terrorists, for now the real anti-terrorist campaign is going to start."

Adéu, Sagrada Família, sadly you didn't get your people redeemed; Adéu, Hospital de Sant Pau, it's shame you can save your people's lives but not their souls; Adéu, Palau de la Música Catalana, from now on there will be only German military music can be heard in Catalonia.

 GGR_contain_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Iberia is large, and any attempts to govern the Iberians with one single political body may lead to low efficiency and failure to maintain local stability, as the Iberian Union has showed us. Luckily for us, from the beginning of our conquest we've noticed this problem and set up 6 different RKs in total with each one dealing with one specific region in the peninsula. Divide, conquer and rule over, such a strategy is as old as time itself, and we shall implement it here.\n\nIn addition, to avoid the possible risk of communication and cooperation between different ethnic groups in Iberia, we need to divide those people with enough caution. Population for each RK must be carefully designed so that each RK may be able to handle their own realm on their own without needs to worry about a total uprising. Through the scientific administration the Reich can gain as much as resources and maintain the peace and stability of Iberian Peninsula."
 GGR_always_vigilant_desc:0 "The conquest of Iberia is indeed a great victory for the Reich, and we did have reasons to celebrate for it. Yet it would be foolish to ignore the threat of other powers in the world that still seek any opportunity to weaken our fatherland, especially the OFN and its American master. Each German victory in Europe is a warning of them, and scared of the mighty military power we hold, their subversive activities is getting more and more frequent. And thus, our soldiers must stay vigilant enough at any time.\n\nFor the US, Iberian Peninsula is westernmost part of Europe and therefore has great strategic values. Our agents reported that secret ships and OFN spies have been sent from their ports to Iberia. Due its distance between Germania and Iberia, we may not be able to deal with the sudden case there and as the result, we can only rely on the sense of responsibility of our local occupied forces. All ships that move near our coastline must be cautiously checked and make sure no one can sneak into the Reich. The security of Europe is at our troops' hands."
 GGR_close_the_dam_desc:0 "In history, Gibraltar, as the gateway of the Mediterranean Sea is the key of global trade for Mediterranean nations, which includes many of our former and future enemies. Considering this, one reason of our Iberian conquest is to control the lifeline of Italian international transportation and trade so that we can weaken their economy a lot and even make it collapse without a military campaign. And now, as the whole Iberian Peninsula has been firmly controlled by the Reich, we are able to cut the throat of the Italians and destroy their ability to sustain themselves.\n\nToday, according to the direct order from Germania, the Gibraltar Dam will be closed until all Mediterranean nations bow before the German Reich. When we started constructing the dam, many have doubted and even mocked at the utility of such a grand project, especially when the program was suspended due to financial reasons. But now, the dam will become a true nightmare for all Italians when they realize how terrible their shortages can be. After closing the Gibraltar dam, all our plans about Iberian Peninsula will be finished perfectly, as the economy of Italians will soon be strangled to its last breath. Now let's cheer at the beauty of sunset in the entrance of such a peaceful and vast sea. Sieg Heil and cheer for the Fatherland once again!"

When Hitler defeated the corrupt and decadent imperialist and Bolshevik powers, he did not see fit to install a truly German administration to rule over the entirety of Russia: despite his incredible wisdom, this was a mistake, and cost us dearly during the subsequent war with the Western Russian Front.\n\nOur new leader, however, has vowed to put an end to this sorry state of affairs! Like an avalanche, we shall crush the last pitiful remnant of the Soviet Union, and integrate it into our ever-growing domain! The eternal snows of desolate Siberia shall be melted by the fire burning in our hearts! Heil Göring!"
 GGR_reinforce_the_garrison_desc:0 "For more than a decade, Reichskommissariat Moskowien has been the first line of defence against the Russian chaos. Now, however it will become the bridgehead from which we shall launch our unstoppable offensive!\n\nIn order to prepare for the inevitable beginning of the hostilities, we need to ensure that Moskowien is properly defended against any threat coming from the East. To this end, the German garrison will be bolstered by fresh troops, while we muster our army for the invasion."
 GGR_enlist_the_locals_desc:0 "In order to prepare for the offensive, we need as many men as possible, and the Russians of Moskowien are perfect to bolster our numbers. Though their valor and skill are far inferior to what we can expect from our fellow Aryans, they are loyal enough to prevent the risk of rebellion.\n\nAlso, their numbers are already a great advantage, and being Russian themselves they shall make perfect occupation garrisons for when we start to consolidate our control over the conquered steppes."
 GGR_mercenary_army_desc:0 "Due to the relative scarcity of true Germans, dozens of mercenary bands operate throughout the border regions of Moskowien, paid by both authorities and privates to protect villages and industries from both raiders and terrorists.\n\nIf we want to further increase our numbers, we can enlist these armed groups into the army with the promise of a nice payment at the end of the war. While these men are completely disloyal, they'll make fine meat for the meatgrinder, and we won't even have to pay them after..."
 GGR_proud_sons_of_germania_desc:0 "Grossraum Germania is the largest metropolis in the world! Even though such a notion brings pride to every true German around the world, it does have its downsides: after the first economic collapse, and even more with the upheaval that followed the Bürgerkrieg, the amount of poor and unemployed Aryans has reached staggering numbers.\n\nHowever, we can now solve two problems with one, intelligent solution. By conscripting the unemployed masses, we shall both grant people a honorable way to earn a salary, and increase our army for the coming war. Our homeland has so much untapped potential, and we shall exploit it all for the good of the Reich!"
 GGR_cornwalls_finest_desc:0 "The Cornwall garrison is an elite unit made up of decorated veterans and extremely capable officers.

 GGR_undoing_their_efforts_desc:0 "Despite twenty years of constant internal strife, it seems the Russians are still as adept at the art of war as they were under their bolshevik predecessor.

The Russians must be already trembling at the prospect of facing our full might..."
 GGR_the_finnish_return_desc:0 "Despite Murmansk and Karelia being owned by the Russians, their population is Finnish in majority. As such, simply integrating it into Reichskommissariat Moskowien would only bring problem, as it would encourage the Finnish to revolt.\n\nWith this in mind, it's much more convenient to include the regions into a land inhabited by their brothers.

 GGR_expanding_moskowien_desc:0 "Murmansk and Karelia may be inhabited mostly by Finnish, but the territory is clearly part of Russia, and integrating them into another territorial entity would only create logistical problems.

On the other, we can strengthen Reichskommissariat Moskowien and ensure that the Russians already under our authority don't stab us in the back at the first chance..."

How's that, General Winter?"

 GGR_and_your_enemies_closer_desc:0 "In the end, our best bet against the Russians is Reichskommissariat Moskowien.

With our backs covered, we can launch our offensive without having to worry about our rear!"

With several fighting units, and a large part of the logistical machine being Russian, a native revolt in Moskowien due to racial conflicts, or dissatisfaction with the treatment they receive while under our command, would cripple the war effort with disastrous consequences.\n\nAs much as we loathe to even think about it, we might need to increase their pay and living conditions so that they have at least some reason to remain loyal to us. Of course, we can always let them understand what happens to those who betray the master race, with the help of a generous number of summary executions..."

While they might indeed be true on the latter, the former is still very much up for discussion, and our generous gift will surely be a VERY convincing argument..."
 GGR_coordinated_rebellion_desc:0 "Russia has been divided for more than two decades, and many of those warlords had - or still have - deeply conflicting political ideologies. This means that there's lots of fertile ground to seed dissent and foment rebellion: by coordinating the agents we have sent there and having them infiltrate already-existing opposition movements, it will be easy to set up well-timed uprisings and other disturbances.\n\nEfen in the case that they don't manage to completely topple the enemy government, they'll still provide a useful source of distraction, forcing them to divert troops to guard supply lines and sensitive targets from terrorist attacks or raids."
 GGR_fear_campaign_desc:0 "We can't limit ourselves to destroy their infrastructure and industry.

While the occupied territories are still under direct military control and waiting for integration into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, we need to act to crush the rebels before they can hinder the war effort.\n\nBy deploying special troops to the most troublesome regions, and showing the wretches that we aren't above retaliating against the civilian population, even their families and loved ones - no, ESPECIALLY their families and loved ones - we should be able to keep them under control until proper police forces come to patrol the roads and cities."

The first is to send in more fresh troops from the Vaterland to storm the mountain fortresses, a costly but effective solution. The second is to establish Russian penal battalions and force them to attack the fortifications or face execution: while much cheaper in both money and German lives wasted, this solution is also riskier as there is a higher chance of desertion or even revolt..."

They'll have a simple choice: almost certain death at the hands of their own kin up in the snowy Urals, or certain death at our hands if they refuse. If they survive, there's always another fort to take, or another minefield we can't spare deminers for...\n\nAfter all, we are just copying their own tactics: as Zhukov said, "If there is a minefield, the infantry will advance as if there wasn't a minefield"

Even though we managed to repel the offensive, the border was redrawn nearer to Moskowien.\n\nWith our offensive triumphant, we can now reverse this shame! The A-A Line shall be rebuilt, a stalwart sentinel forever guarding Germania from her enemies!

This will prove to be a hindrance, and requires an adequate response.\n\nBy bolstering our mechanized corps, even our basic infantry will be far superior to anything they can throw at us!

 GGR_dont_look_back_desc:0 "With our duty done here, we can leave Central Asia without looking back. When the rest of Russia is properly dealt with, we'll return and establish a proper Reichskommissariat, but for now this land is best left on its own.\n\nIf we're lucky, the wretches will even kill each other on their own without any outside help!

GGR_review_the_fleet_desc:0 "Once upon a time, before Hitler had even joined the National Socialist movement, the Kaiserliche Marine was the pride of Germany, and the envy of the world. Indeed, it was so powerful that the weak, pitiful west forced us to dismantle it after the shame of the Great War, for fear of us returning to greatness. Of course, this did not stop us from rebuilding our fleet in the glory days of the Reich, restoring the Kriegsmarine to heights unseen by even the Empire. By the end of the Second World War, the German fleet was among the strongest on earth, with the masses of U-Boat wolfpacks becoming the bane of our enemies and the surface fleet, backed by the power of our battleships, spreading fear across those who opposed us. For a time, it seemed, the old imperial dream of naval dominance could be achieved.\n\nHowever, as of late, the Kriegsmarine has been, if not treading water, sliding backwards in its ability. The ships and submarines rust in their harbors, underfunded and undercrewed. The Kriegsmarine in general has become the black sheep of the Heer, constantly overlooked in favor of the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht's needs. Nowadays, the Kriegsmarine is in a state of disrepair, slowly decaying. This cannot stand, especially with some of the Führer's more grandiose plans requiring a strong navy to succeed.\n\nTwo schools of thought have emerged in the Admiralty, each butting against each other in a constant battle. The first school emphasizes the need for battleships in the modern age, arguing that with simple renovations and fixes, the sheer power a battleship brings would dominate both the American and Japanese fleets. The second school pushes heavily to scrap our old battleships, instead pivoting into the new world of carrier-based doctrine.\n\nThe decision falls to Göring now, who must decide- shall the old, tried and tested battleship prevail, or will it fall to the modern competition of the aircraft carrier?"

While this choice is certainly a controversial one among the old guard of the Kriegsmarine, it is certainly a necessary one- what use is a battleship if it can't even see its target?\n\nThe restructuring of the Kriegsmarine is set to begin immediately, starting with the renovation of the battleships. The process to gut the old kings of the sea, painful as it is, must be begun now. That way, with both the weight of maintenance and the profits of the scrap, we can begin production on our new line of carriers, and make a tidy profit in the end. Though this process will strike deep at the heart of any true German patriot, it must be begun now, or else we will find ourselves unready and unable to fight when the time comes."

While this plan does not try to save the battleships in their current forms, what it proposes is almost as shocking and daring as the original change.\n\nThe plan, obviously refined and rewritten multiple times, details the potential opportunity we currently have to refit our battleships into carriers, instead of scrapping the old hulks and building new ships. While the process of converting our battleships into carriers is certainly a costly one, the plan emphasizes both the practical and overall benefits of such a change. Practically, the plan will allow us to keep some of the old hulls around as bases to new carriers, instead of being forced to fully scrap each of our relics. Overall, these retrofits would give us the necessary experience needed to build full carriers.\n\nWhile scrapping the battleships is certainly the more economical choice, the possibility of repurposing our old prides of the fleet into a modern day wonder of Germany has captivated the Führer. With the flick of his pen and a word to his advisors, the plan has changed, and those battleships that once seemed to be reaching the end of the line have been granted a new lease on life."

In such a situation, it seems the risk is just too great.\n\nTherefore, as painful as it is, we will have to dismantle and scrap some of the Kriegsmarine's greatest ships. Though we have tried to save and restore them, it seems that the years of neglect and disrepair have taken their toll. Even now, scrapping ships take the first sections of these kings of the sea apart, tearing old traditions away piece by piece.\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, however, and the silver lining in this particular cloud is quite comforting. The steel we scrap from the oldest battleships can be remade into the hulls and sections of our new carriers. In effect, the legacy and history of the battleships of old will live on in a new, modern form. Isn't that a sweet thought?"

Whatever one's opinion is on the plan in the Kriegsmarine, the only important opinion on the matter is the Führer's, and he is firmly in favor.\n\nAs Göring bluntly states, the only way to defeat such superpowers as America and Japan is to defeat their navies on the open seas, and a modern Plan Z would give the Kriegsmarine the ability to do just that. As Hitler worked so tirelessly to defeat the Royal Navy, so shall we work tirelessly to defeat the Americans and Japanese.

The Kriegsmarine, instead of throwing money into the pit of a full fleet retrofit, shall stay the course of the Fleet in Being. Instead, our fleet shall renovate our battleships into the modern age, adding the improvements of the modern age to our behemoths. If the Americans and Japanese think that the age of the battleship is past, they're in for a real surprise. We shall make our battleships into the envy of the world, as they once were.

If no solution is found, then we will be sending rookies into battle against our enemies, who have great experience in the art of naval warfare. Such a situation would be asking for disaster.\n\nLuckily, the solution is right in front of our eyes. By using our experienced admirals as teachers for the young blood entering the pool, we shall train them to fill the shoes that our old leaders will leave.

The Luftwaffe has made several of its most high tech spy planes available for the task of finding and mapping out where these missile silos have been stationed. Once we know where they are, we can tell our bombers where to target and program our defenses to intercept them in the regrettable event of nuclear launch."

In came a group of four men who looked far more suited in overalls and straw hats than the suits they were wearing. As soon as they laid eyes on Göring, they made the faces of children in a candy shop or of men facing their reckoning with God. Hell, they were probably resisting the temptation to kneel on the floor and grovel. Their leader, Robert Williams, said nervously, "Mein Führer, it is the greatest honour of our lives to meet you."\n Göring nonchalantly flicked the cigarette ashes on his desk. He was not paying these strange men much attention. "Oh? Oh, yes, of course. It's my pleasure." The two military men beside Göring give him a look that was more exasperated than angry, as they were used to and perfectly happy with their supposed leader's apathy and numbness by this point.\nRemer got straight to business. "Gentlemen, you have certain paramilitary organizations who might be willing to support our cause against your degenerate government, correct?"\n "Yessir!" Replied the second-in-command Gordon Mohr. "The Christian Patriots Defense League is at your disposal."\n "Sure... Excellent. Let us discuss some plans we have for the assassination of the US president," said Remer, who was effectively controlling the meeting by now. These were some of the most eccentric men any of the three Germans had ever seen, but there was no harm in getting them to do some dirty work for the Reich if they were so eager to help.\n At the end of the meeting, Mohr humbly asked, "Mein Führer, if I may make one small request of you. I have a letter from one of our fellow sympathizers, Father Charles Coughlin that he has asked I give to you to read. It would be another wonderful honour."\n "Of course," replied a distant Göring, almost forgetting to reach out and take the letter. "I will gladly read it.""

After a tortuously long week that had been dominated solely by political matters related to the newest of the Reich's occupational regimes, Göring had managed to get one blessed night to himself. How to spend it had never been in question; the Staatsoper Germania had premiered a new run of Weber's Der Freischutz, and the Führer was determined to attend the show come Hell or high water. Why, even if Schörner were to barge in and announce that they had entered into war with America or Japan, Göring would not be dissuaded. He needed this as a man in a desert needs water.\n\nBundled up in multiple layers for disguise and accompanied only by the most discrete and trusted of his personal guard, the man who ruled over all of Europe and much of Asia and Africa did not look the part. He was careful to avoid the gazes of any of the other opera goers, as even with all of his efforts to disguise he was still the most known man in the Reich, if not the world. After a few stressful encounters necessary to procure his seat, Göring was finally able to take a place in the most prestigious of the viewing boxes. Now all that was left was to relax, and immerse himself in the show.\n\nThat was his plan at any rate, but it was not destined to be. The performance, as expected of the renowned theater, was as terrific as Göring could ever remember it being; its quality was not what haunted his mind as the lines of "O diese Sonne" ran through his head. No, it was the dawning realization on the part of the Führer that he, for all his power and prestige, was in no better a situation than young Max. Those damned militarists, Schörner, Remer, and the rest, they were the demonic Zamiel who had given him the magic bullets that had granted him such success. When, the thought flashed into his mind, would it come time for the seventh bullet to be fired? And what would be its terrible price? He shuddered silently as unbidden images of hellfire and death presented themselves to him in an inescapable montage of doom. The magic of the night was gone, and the Führer collapsed into a deep sense of fear as he heard the chorus utter the line that had always been able to move him before, only now in quite a different sense."

Subhumans rarely comprehend the fact of their defeat immediately, so there will need to be extensive and appropriately harsh measures taken to secure the region for the Reich."

Is our shared history not one of endless conflict and bloodshed? Perhaps the time will come when we must bring them under direct rule from Germania, but for now they aren't enough of a threat to bring our full might to bear on them. Instead, they just need some prodding in the right direction - a few carrots dangled before them, with the stick kept out of their sight. We'll buy their oil, sell them goods at reasonable prices and continue supplying their fledgling armies with German equipment. If they should ever move in a direction disagreeable to us, it will be child's play to bring down the hammer on their ungrateful nation."

GGR_bolster_our_arms_desc:0 "Kleinasien is much larger than one would think, and the terrain has made our efforts to secure it more difficult than expected. This is of no great concern, but the faster we can subdue Turkish resistance, the faster we can begin exploiting the region's natural resources. To this end, our occupation forces need a large boost in terms of supplies and manpower. More divisions can be shipped across the Bosphorus as needed, but the nature of Kleinasien also necessitates the construction of better infrastructure; the Turks have done a poor job of modernizing their nation in the past few decades. Railways, surfaced roads, airports, supply ports and garrison compounds need to be built to tighten our grip on the region and show the Turks who rules them now."

GGR_pressure_the_iranians_desc:0 "The Reich has enjoyed historically good relations with Iran, but our conquest of Turkey has them on edge - excellent. Though perhaps tenuously linked to European Aryans through ancient blood ties, their people have no doubt been weakened by years of miscegenation with Turks and Arabs. We must have no illusions about their unreliability and backwards nature. Still, their fear can be exploited; with the strength of the Wehrmacht on full display during Operation Gertrud, their meager military must be quivering in their collective boots! Trade delegations will be sent to re-negotiate existing deals and resources rights. The Reich needs their oil, and they are in no position to refuse us."

GGR_intimidate_the_italians_desc:0 "As the hour of Italy's conquest approaches, we must be sure to engage them on multiple fronts, the better to stretch their armies thin. The Italian Middle East is a turbulent region, filled with groups vying for various degrees of independence or autonomy from their Mediterranean masters. It is also, of course, filled to bursting with oil, vital for the continuation of our glorious conquests. Now that we have a border with Italy's possessions, we should move a number of divisions into the area to conduct open exercises, aggressive aerial patrols and general displays of force. When the time comes to move on the Levant, the Italians will be so terrified and demoralized that their resistance will crumble like the ruins they inhabit!"

This land of coastlines and mountains will be the springboard for projecting German power into the entirety of West Asia, thanks to our infrastructural improvements and the vast amount of natural resources it provides. The barbarians who infest Kleinasien continue to be a minor problem, but their time will come soon enough. We now possess one of the most defensible geopolitical regions in the world, and the Turkish threat to the Balkans has been ended forevermore. Regardless of what the future might hold for the Reich, we have achieved a great victory for civilization."

 GGR_the_hawk_and_the_hunter_desc:0 "The Führer knew this day would come. Schörner was always a perfidious snake, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and claim power for himself. Now, with the Reich stronger than ever and the Wehrmacht pushed to its very limits, he plots against his commander-in-chief and thereby the entirety of the German people. Should he succeed in overthrowing our government, the Reich will surely be plunged into an abyss from which it will never escape - a deathtrap of deranged militarism and senseless violence.\n\nGöring must rise to the challenge one last time. For the Reich and its glorious conquests to be secured in perpetuity, the Monster in Uniform must be destroyed along with each and every deviant traitor who would follow him."
 GGR_donitz_shadow_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine, even after being brought to heel, was never a friend to Göring. Grand Admiral Dönitz's shadow still hangs over our great fleet, tainting it with Bormannite conservatism. While the Führer now finds himself facing his own erstwhile militarist allies, there are still far too many questions about the political nature of the Kriegsmarine's leadership. It is unlikely that Schörner has brought any of them into his camp, but if their loyalty is not secured they might choose to remain neutral in the power struggle, just as they did during the Bürgerkrieg. Still, if the Führer can demonstrate the validity of his new, dynamic form of National Socialist conservatism, they might be reined in and their mighty guns directed to his benefit."
 GGR_can_we_trust_the_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The Führer must have his navy on-side to maintain German power projection and overseas capabilities, no matter what comes. Quiet negotiations shall begin; the Abwehr will be dispatched to probe the officer corps for any Schörnerite presence or plans of disloyal neutrality. Their loyalty is easily worth whatever paltry concessions they might demand of the Führer in exchange for deeper political cooperation. Once their political position is ascertained, our strategy for handling them can be adjusted accordingly. They certainly can't be any harder to manage than the militarists ever were."
 GGR_find_the_trustworthy_desc:0 "The struggle between the Führer and his treasonous field marshal is not yet common knowledge outside the shadowed halls of the Reich Chancellery. The average German on the street knows nothing of the coming storm, and the Kriegsmarine, always at sea, knows even less. Of course, this is precisely how the Führer would have it; the fewer individuals are compromised with knowledge of the divide in the Reich's leadership, the better. Care must be taken in our present dealings with the Kriegsmarine so that they learn nothing more than they must. Only those few reliable admirals with a vested interest in Göring's success should be brought on board."
 GGR_we_know_who_we_can_trust_desc:0 "Namely, not the Kriegsmarine. During the Bürgerkrieg, they fled to Crimea, showing that the only colors they flew were their own. They might have professed loyalty to the Reich above all else, but how could we ever believe that excuse when Göring was clearly the only legitimate Führer in the first place? The Kriegsmarine has been insubordinate for years, dithering at every order and not even bothering to maintain the correct political standards for its leadership. The only appropriate solution is to cut out this cancer infecting the Reich - purge the ranks, from the admiralty down to the lowliest e-boat crew! They will be of little use against Schörner anyway, so who will miss those sea-rats?"
 GGR_an_airforce_with_a_navy_desc:0 "Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine will always be secondary to the Heer and the illustrious Luftwaffe. With the old guard and unreliable crews purged, we should begin the long-overdue process of reforming our naval command to correctly represent its position. We have had quite enough of salt-worn old men and disloyal, drunk sailors. Naturally, the most logical choice here is to put men who have experience in combat, organization and administration in charge, but there is currently a dearth of skilled seamen for some reason. Thankfully, the Führer knows plenty of talented and politically reliable men in the Luftwaffe who are due for promotions! These men will form a new board to replace the admiralty and ensure the swift reorganization and - more importantly - loyalty of our reborn Kriegsmarine."
 GGR_revive_the_freikorps_desc:0 "The Freikorps - nearly five decades have passed since their glory days, but the saviors of the Reich live on in the German cultural consciousness. Their victories over communism and the Jewry were forever immortalized by Hitler, and their deeds remain the bedrock of our National Socialist traditions. Freikorps membership, or descent from a Freikorps veteran, remains a marker of prestige in our society. None would question us, therefore, if we were to announce the reformation and formalization of this old paramilitary. To ordinary citizens, it would appear perfectly innocuous - a means by which to prepare as many people as possible for war and allow old soldiers to maintain their martial pride. To the Führer, however, it will be the largest and most well-trained militia force in history: a personal paramilitary at his beck and call. Our enemies will quake at our numbers, should further strife come!"
 GGR_arms_under_the_table_desc:0 "Strictly speaking, the Reich has a vested interest in keeping the capacity for violence among the populace at a low level. These are dire times, however, and the new Freikorps cannot afford to be bound by the same laws and regulations as civil organizations. Anything not being directed to the Wehrmacht should be funnelled to the militia; guns, grenades, trucks, even light vehicles and helicopters if possible! They must be a true fighting force, able to hold their own against anything the enemy might throw at them. Every militia fighter must be the equal of a hardened grenadier!"
 GGR_the_unsullied_service_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, Göring's pride and joy, has always been loyal to him and always will be. He is their glorious father and their favorite son, marshal and veteran both. Schörner could never taint this branch of the military, the pinnacle of Aryan martial might! Organizing them for a possible conflict with the militarists will therefore be a simple matter - Göring speaks, and they obey. Air wings shall be recalled, Air Landing divisions put on standby and Fallschirmjäger roused from barracks. While loyalists in the other branches will undoubtedly have a role to play, it is the knights of the sky who will bring us final victory."
 GGR_protect_the_bases_desc:0 "Knowing that he could never sway them, it is likely that Schörner will instead try to sabotage the Luftwaffe by any means possible. Naturally for such a brutish man, his first choice will be to attack vulnerable bases and hangars, probably with commando units or bribed turncoats. Security at all key Luftwaffe facilities must be increased dramatically. It couldn't hurt to have better-armed units up to and including Panzer companies guarding them. Furthermore, security checks must be tightened up and base personnel monitored closely. Even a single broken link in the chain could have severe consequences for our beloved aviators."
 GGR_mark_targets_in_advance_desc:0 "Schörner has not yet begun to move against us openly, so there is no risk in scouting 'his' territory. It will be obvious to his clique what our reconnaissance aircraft are up to over their Reichskommissariats, but they wouldn't dare turn them back. While we do not expect Schörner to possess a significant air force of his own, the Abwehr has confirmed that he has been devising an answer to the Luftwaffe. His allies also possess large numbers of older aircraft, ostensibly to maintain control over their airspace. It is imperative that we find this mockery of the Luftwaffe wherever it hides and wipe it out the moment Schörner makes his bid for power."
 GGR_move_against_schorner_desc:0 "All possible preparations have been made and enough loyalties have been secured. With the more practical concerns taken care of, we have some administrative reorganization to do. Schörner's clique is deeply entrenched in OKW and in several important Reichskommissariats, which simply cannot continue. We must clear his toadies out of their positions and replace them with more loyal and controllable men of the Führer's own choosing. Schörner will push back against this as soon as he hears of it, but if we move quickly enough we should be able to completely displace his clique before he is prepared for open conflict."
 GGR_replace_the_field_marshal_desc:0 "Schörner once served ably, but no longer. Having lived through both World Wars, the West Russian War and all of the Reich's subsequent conquests, he is getting old and tired. Surely, the old warrior deserves peaceful semi-retirement in a quiet, less stressful role. Reichskommissariat Kamtschatka, perhaps? The Führer is certain that his old friend will be most grateful to have fewer commitments - and to be very, very, very far away from Germania. It's such a stressful place to live, after all."
 GGR_the_afrikajager_desc:0 "Siegfried Müller is incompetent, corrupt, treasonous and possibly the most pathetic excuse for a Reichskommissar in the entire Reich. His oversight of Zentralafrika turned out to be a complete sham and it is only by the Führer's mercy that he yet lives. However, his apparently undesirable traits also make him pliable and easy to control. He can be appeased with material wealth, has no grand ambitions, and his incompetence can be compensated for by delegating his duties. Müller is likely to be the worst Field Marshal the Reich will ever have, but he will certainly be the most useful."
 GGR_the_berliner_ratte_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is no friend of Göring, but he is easily the most competent candidate for the position of Field Marshal. With a long record of service and a reputation for honest patriotism, Speidel is immensely popular amongst both the populace and the Heer. Merely promoting him to the position of Field Marshal would be seen as a supremely wise and generous act, and could bring many militarists to heel. However, he might prove to be more trouble than he's worth; Speidel is a vocal critic of militarism and the Abwehr reports that he has always privately opposed the further expansion of German territory. He may not even be any more loyal than Schörner, in the end. That said, perhaps his principles will win out over his political opposition to Göring, and he will restrain himself appropriately."
 GGR_nepotism_desc:0 "Frankly, Göring has had enough of self-proclaimed 'suitable candidates'. All these ambitious, self-serving men squabbling to take Schörner's place - what good are they, really? How can any of them ever be trusted to abide by the Führer's directives? Any one of them could be another Schörner in waiting, another traitor seeking to stake his claim on the Führership! No, we need a good man, someone we can trust, someone who will neither challenge the Führer's right to rule or attempt to rock the boat.\n\nSomeone like... Theodore Göring, beloved nephew of the Führer! Under-qualified? Perhaps, but also reliable. Besides, who's to say he won't learn on the job?"
 GGR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "At last! We had our doubts - our fears, even - that Schörner would not go quietly, that he would go to any lengths to dominate the Reich. The eruption of a second Bürgerkrieg seemed inevitable as the Field Marshal gathered his forces and rallied countless traitors to his banner. Those few enemies of the Reich who remain no doubt waited with bated breath to see our mighty empire fall to infighting once more.\n\nAnd yet, their dreams will never be realised. The treasonous Field Marshal has been unseated from his office and stripped of any capacity to wage war upon us, all without firing a shot! Relegated to the furthest reaches of Siberia and with his allies bought, bullied or broken, the monster in uniform will never again threaten the Führer's rightful mandate. Heil Göring!"
 GGR_test_their_loyalty_desc:0 "Since assuming power, the Führer has seen many new generals commissioned. The cream of the Reich's officer corps, these young men are all seasoned veterans of our many conquests, having learned as much on the battlefield as in the academies. Their loyalties remain undecided, likely due to their preoccupation leaving little time for politicking. Now, however, with Schörner's clique working to shore up their strength, the young generals have become a target for militarist intrigue. The traitor will surely attempt to bring them into his camp by any means necessary. We have to sway them before he has the chance - by hook, or by crook!"
 GGR_incentivize_the_new_guard_desc:0 "Despite their claims to be proud, principled men in the Prussian tradition, many of our new generals are anything but. Part of it is simply the nature of power; money is ultimately merely another means by which to acquire it. In that regard, it is no less effective a currency than blood. Those younger generals who are not yet wholly loyal to either Schörner or the Führer could be easily swayed in the latter's favour by the sweet allure of higher salaries and pensions, or even 'gifts' straight from his own purse. Making someone's life a little easier rarely goes unappreciated, after all..."
 GGR_a_little_extra_desc:0 "Some of today's young generals are unfortunately a little harder to please, as with the rest of their generation. They aren't content unless they're enjoying fine dining every night, cavorting with half a dozen high-class ladies and zooming around in the latest Mercedes sports cars. Though the older officers shake their heads and rant about the days of austerity under Hitler, the Führer understands the wants and needs of this new and talented generation of leaders. If they require even greater rewards to be satisfied, so be it. Fast cars, country estates, wine from the Führer's own cellar - whatever it takes, they must be loyal to us!"
 GGR_an_abundance_of_medals_desc:0 "The downside to being a newly-minted general these days is the unfortunate shortage of medals one can wear. Back in the days of the Empire, every general worth his salt would be absolutely festooned with medals and his uniform decorated with gold filigree. Only a few trembling old men can still boast such a grand panoply, and the younger generation of officers feel that they are unfairly compared to the old Prussian officer corps. In his generosity, the Führer has proclaimed that he will restore this proud aesthetic tradition. Henceforth, all deserving generals will have however many pieces of gold, silver and silk to decorate their uniforms as they feel is necessary - all that is necessary is for them to swear eternal allegiance to the one true Führer, Hermann Göring. For one's glory to be so resplendent, is that so high a price?"
 GGR_we_know_where_you_live_desc:0 "Gold, jewelry and fine wine? Who do these upstart generals think they are, middle-aged bourgeoise housewives? The true German officer needs no incentive beyond patriotism! If he cannot find it within himself to devote the entirety of his being to the Reich, then perhaps he needs a little reminder of what is at stake! There will be no tolerance for preening, vainglorious children within the Wehrmacht's command structure; they will serve because the Führer demands it! All suspect officers will be closely monitored by the Gestapo, and any cowardice, corruption or disloyalty duly punished by the most severe means possible!"
 GGR_and_youre_families_desc:0 "Some young officers think themselves brave. With their egos bloated by their rank and rewards, they believe that they are above discipline and loyalty. Not even the harshest threats to their livelihoods are taken seriously, perhaps due to our historically lax attitude towards officer autonomy under the militarists. They will soon learn that Göring is not Schörner - he does not tolerate his subordinates living corrupt lives as petty kings of their divisions. If threatening their persons is insufficient, perhaps their families should become involved in present matters. After all, isn't family the core of Aryan values?"
 GGR_never_look_the_other_way_desc:0 "Though we have always tried to be merciful to the lesser races of the world, it is an unfortunate reality that many are as recalcitrant children who refuse to acknowledge their betters. Well, as the saying goes: "Spare the rod, spoil the child." We have been tolerant up to this point, but recently some of our subject peoples have been far too uncooperative - even violent. We cannot show weakness in this crucial time; we must discipline these ungrateful savages with bullet and bayonet! Some might balk at this task, but there are a number of officers in the Schörnerite tradition who will follow any order, no matter how harsh or - in the eyes of weak foreigners - inhumane."
 GGR_trials_for_warcrimes_desc:0 "Shocking! A number of our best officers, once thought loyal and true paragons of the Reich, have been directly implicated in horrific war crimes against non-Aryan populations! That something like this could have happened on Schörner's watch is unthinkable - how could any good, honest German ever succumb to such violence and depravity? State media will make this outrage known to the whole Reich, and the guilty parties arrested and brought to trial immediately! National Socialism does not permit acts of senseless brutality and genocide, and nor will the Führer!"
 GGR_reward_faithful_service_desc:0 "Many of the Führer's closest followers have been with him for decades. These officers have proven their loyalty time and time again, supporting him in the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg and beyond. The bravest and truest of Germany's soldiers, their time to be justly rewarded has finally come. Medals and financial benefits are not enough - these men simply must have their own Reichskommissariats! Is there any more comfortable and well-deserved retirement than to manage one of our prosperous and hard-won colonies?"
 GGR_governor_generals_desc:0 "There was a lot of debate within the Führer's cabinet about where to send our new Reichskommissars. After all, we have already allocated all of our conquests to RKs, or annexed them into the Reich. Then, a stroke of genius struck the Führer: Central Asia! It remains one of the most ill-managed and rebellious areas in the greater Reich, probably due to the overstretched and weary administration. The logical solution to the problem is, naturally, to divide the region into four new Reichskommissariats, thereby killing two birds with one stone; the administrative issues will be solved, and our generals will have their promised fiefdoms far, far away from Germania."
 GGR_wandering_minds_desc:0 "The Führer has been notified of an unfortunate occurrence in our logistics department: the new Reichskommissars report that their troops are severely under-equipped! This is truly a tragedy, but how could it have happened? All the paperwork on Germania's end show that the required equipment was shipped out on schedule. Perhaps there was some error, or the trains delivered their cargo to the wrong place? Well, never mind. This will soon be resolved - the Führer himself has pledged to oversee all future deliveries of equipment to Central Asia personally! Our men can rest easy knowing that he's on the job!"

 GGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Treason without compare has struck the Reich once more - we are again engulfed in civil war! The traitor Hans Speidel has risen up in rebellion, and the former Field Marshal, Ferdinand Schörner, has established himself as a rival claimant to the Führership! We have come so far, conquered so much in the name of National Socialism and the Aryan race; we cannot afford to fail now!\n\nOur great Führer has led us through trials to eclipse even the World Wars! He has defeated fleets of thousands - crushed rock and metal and bone beneath the grinding treads of the Wehrmacht! His reign will not end this way, not at their hands! The world he has built will endure for a thousand years! Sieg heil!"
 GGR_the_key_to_victory_desc:0 "Schörner might have his conscript hordes, but we are the sole bearers of the Germanic martial tradition. No violent thug pressed into service and armed with a rifle produced in some god-forsaken Reichskommissariat can hope to match a true son of Germany. We will demonstrate to the world once and for all that German steel, backed by German discipline, is the finest in the world! Only ensuring the continuation of our tradition of high-quality soldiers and equipment will keep us safe from the tide of treachery rising around us."
 GGR_is_on_the_workfloor_desc:0 "German industry remains unrivalled, and we must keep it that way to secure victory! Our factories are filled with strong, dedicated working men, but they slacken and grow restless as word of the war reaches them - this is unacceptable! The bosses must drive them to work harder than ever before, for every bullet that arrives too late could see another valiant soldier of the Reich murdered by the traitors. Failure to dedicate one's entire heart and soul to work in this crucial time is tantamount to desertion, and will be punished as such!"
 GGR_supplies_from_ukraine_desc:0 "An unfortunate but unavoidable side-effect of the Reich's recent expansion is the stretching of our supply lines and the shortage of vital resources accompanying it. The traitors have access to all the industry and resources within the lands they illegally hold, including those which are central to the war effort! Thankfully, with Ukraine secured for the rightful Führer, its vast supplies of oil, steel and grain remain available to us - a very useful thing indeed, with our lands once again riven by war. The Balkans remain secure and difficult for any invader to take, so our eastern supply lines will be redirected to travel through that region alone. We cannot afford further shortages now."
 GGR_is_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Our soldiers have fought long and hard, many for years on end. Still, we must demand one more great effort from the Heer. No matter how many officers and spoilt, ungrateful grunts have defected, the truest and noblest of the Grenadiers remain at our side. It is they who shall carry us to victory, and all possible measures must be taken to maximize their potential. Whether that is wages to keep them loyal, food to keep them happy or Pervitin to keep them awake and active, the loyal soldiery will have what they require, and give their all in thanks to the Führer! In this hour, no alternative to absolute dedication is permissible."
 GGR_soldiers_from_the_balkans_desc:0 "The Balkan Garrison is the hard core of the Wehrmacht. Cornwall might have been the best posting, but no amount of watching over shepherds and fishermen could make that garrison the match of the Balkan men! Those grizzled veterans have been fighting a ceaseless guerilla war against rebellious subhumans and Bolshevik partisans for nearly thirty years. More importantly, they have remained at arm's length from the political intrigues of Germania; they are a strictly loyal and obedient force of soldiers and airmen at the Führer's beck and call. It's a good thing that we have subdued all major partisan groups in the region, for men such as they are needed more now than ever. They will be recalled to the Reich and placed directly on the frontlines - the traitors will have a nasty surprise waiting for them if they expected green conscripts!"
 GGR_no_more_militarists_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the traitor Speidel has been a frequent topic of discussion within OKW. The answer, of course, is obvious: no talks with turncoats! The Führer recognizes that no military man ambitious enough to take independent action can ever be trusted. As though the simple act of treason were not bad enough, Speidel is an infamous crypto-Speerite who has time and again questioned the core tenets of National Socialism! Some say he even refuses to accept our deserved right to rule over the lesser races of the world! We will crush this German Judas and all who follow him, as we would any other enemy of the Fatherland!"
 GGR_talk_to_the_rat_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is a traitor, but he is nowhere near as dangerous as Schörner. Speerism is all but dead; he represents no ideological threat to us, only a minor strategic one. Perhaps his apolitical nature and dedication to the preservation of German lives can be turned to our advantage. Schörner represents a threat not only to our new order, but also to the Reich itself - his deranged ambition would see countless millions thrown into the meat grinder for no tangible gain whatsoever! Speidel is not a strong-willed man, and an appeal of equal parts reason and logic might sway him to at least refrain from attacking us and focus his forces on Schörner instead. We can ill afford a war on three fronts, after all..."
 GGR_drive_out_the_villains_desc:0 "The presence of traitors' feet on German soil is a grave insult to the honor of our race and nation. With every day that passes, more gullible fools flock to their banners, spreading the twin poisons of militarism and pacifism. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formulation and execution of a plan to push the renegades out of the Fatherland itself. This will be a legendary cleansing, the likes of which have not been seen since the Bürgerkrieg, to purify Germany of its ills and carve in history the eternal glory and righteousness of our one true Führer! No mercy will be shown to the bearers of this rot and decay, who threaten the very foundations of our world!"
 GGR_germany_under_one_banner_desc:0 "Our situation remains precarious, but the worst of the fires have been extinguished as the traitors have been driven from the Reich proper. Our forces have completely secured the German heartlands and are now busying themselves with mopping up the last holdouts and partisan cells. Speidel and Schörner have fled like the cowards they are, but their forces are already rallying in the Reichskommissariats aligned to their respective sides. Owing to the breadth of our conquests and the chronic disloyalty of the various Reichskommissars, they remain in possession of a great deal of land, resources and manpower. The fight must be taken beyond Germany, but it will be a long, hard road to victory from here on out."
 GGR_use_the_slaves_desc:0 "What is a slave but a machine made of meat, to be used and discarded as its master wishes? Even with our healthy surplus, we have historically placed too much value on the lives and wellbeing of slaves, thinking of them as a precious commodity - this lax attitude ends now! They are a resource to be spent as necessary, and there is no shortage of cheap fuel for war's furnace these days. We must purge the last vestiges of sympathy for these subhumans from our society and put them to maximum possible use; no more breaks, sleep, food or even water unless they prove their particular value. For every fleshy machine that breaks down, there are millions more available to replace it, so why fret over a few more bodies committed to the crematoriums every day?"
 GGR_punish_the_deserters_desc:0 "As the war rages on, the chaff separates from the wheat. Accounts reach us of entire battalions defecting, refusing to follow orders or even retreating without permission. The snake Schörner has always been right about one thing, at least - acts of supreme cowardice cannot be tolerated. Harsh punishments for deserters have been the norm for decades, but with the very existence of the Reich on the line, all disciplinary efforts must be redoubled! If a thousand must die to push a million forward, then so be it! Anyone who refuses to serve in combat will serve on the firing line!"
 GGR_harsher_quotas_desc:0 "Even citizen and volunteer workers continually fail to meet our requirements and expectations! It is shocking and disgraceful to see this kind of unpatriotic laziness in vital war industries, especially considering the stakes of the current conflict. Henceforth, proper military discipline will be employed in all industries, and quotas raised to the necessary levels. For a working man to give anything less than the entirety of his being to the national effort is just as treasonous as siding with the enemy! We'll instate 18-hour working days if we have to; nothing less than total militarization of the factories will bring us victory!"
 GGR_attack_the_pacifists_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of human nature that the common people never really want war. More often than not, they merely lust for the idea of crushing and dominating their nation's enemies. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? However, it is not the soft-hearted masses that dictate policy, but the Führer! The weakling pacifists infesting the Reich's heartland are as much a threat to the morale of our nation as deserters and cowards - thankfully, there is an easy way to turn the people against them and bring the populace to the Führer's bidding. All we need do is remind the people of this war's true stakes, which will expose the pacifists' lack of patriotism and endangerment of the nation. This has never failed us before, and once carried out will ensure that nobody will complain when those treasonous scum are dragged from their houses and shot as the cowards they are."
 GGR_men_on_the_frontlines_desc:0 "What do we even have men in the factories for? What value does a man truly hold if he will not don a helmet and carry a rifle into combat for the sake of his country? We face a life or death struggle for the future of the Reich - now is the hour for each and every true Aryan man to live up to the standards envisioned by the great Hitler! We need everyone to fight this war - from every floor of every factory in every Gau! Any who refuse to down their ploughshares for swords will be considered traitors to the cause and dealt with appropriately!"
 GGR_women_in_the_factories_desc:0 "The Aryan-Feminists bleated for years about wanting the opportunity to work in factories like their husbands; now, they shall have it. With the men shipped off to more suitable occupations, we have a skilled labor shortage that slaves cannot fulfil. True, these women are lacking in experience and the strength of soul that makes men superior workers, but this is Judgement Day for the Reich! Extreme measures must be taken at home just as readily as on the frontlines, and if that includes violating sacrosanct gender roles, then so be it."
 GGR_pows_in_the_camps_desc:0 "All these captured traitors are languishing in POW camps, eating our bread and occupying our guards. That bread should be going to the troops, those guards should be fighting for the Reich, and those prisoners should be making themselves useful! If they would claim to be the true sons of Germany, then let them try and prove it in the work camps! Perhaps their claims will be verified, or maybe they will redeem themselves through back-breaking labor - "Work will set you free", after all. While we're at it, perhaps the numerous civilians who have yet to prove their worth should be... redefined. Redefined as Schörnerite spies, for instance, rather than mere cowards and slackers."

 GGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "Once more, the Reich has fallen into chaos. Göring may have been our preferred stalking horse in the Reichstag but his gluttony and incompetence have cost us dearly. His economic mismanagement has sunk the Reich to a new low, his flamboyance and extravagance emptying its coffers and putting its slaves into open revolt. The German people have been infected with his laziness, his femininity, and his cowardice. Fortunately there is no character so low that righteous war cannot rectify it."
 GGR_stand_for_your_fatherland_desc:0 "Most of our citizens have sat idle these past few years, content to let slaves do the work. The Wehrmacht has become the only constant, always requiring more men to maintain the balance of our empire. It is vital that the people understand the importance of what we do, that they join us in our purging of the rot that has corrupted the Reich. Goebbels may be long dead but his lessons hold true - the people must be galvanised by propaganda. Let the posters and banners fly. It is better they make the choice to enlist on their own. It lets them think they still have a choice."
 GGR_war_in_the_factories_desc:0 "This is a total war. Goebbels understood the value of making the war felt by everyone, from the front lines to the fields to the factories. We must ensure our workers know the importance of their labour, and redouble their efforts to produce arms for the fatherland. The factory floor will be reorganised into a home front, with clear ranks established for every worker. Work squads will be directed at their tasks by floor sergeants, and every task will be timed down to the minute, ensuring when a mistake is made it will not be made again. When we are done, the production line will be indistinguishable from the front line."
 GGR_war_in_the_fields_desc:0 "Out here in the fields, you fight for your meals. All one can see for miles on end is the Reich. All one sees is the front line. Europe is consumed in warfare once more, and it is essential that the soldiers understand that.\n\nIf we do not hold Ukraine, whose bread will feed their families back home? Danish pork and butter are a staple at every table, Bohemian cars fill the streets of every city, Baltic farms are home to a cousin of every other man in this army. If we do not win this war, we risk losing everything the Reich has fought for for the past century. We fight for what is ours."
 GGR_war_in_the_mind_desc:0 "This war is perhaps the most important we have ever fought. If the Reich cannot be halted in its fall, if Göring and Speidel are allowed to continue to destroy it then all is lost and the Führer's dream will be dead. Our troops must understand this - they must not falter in their mission, they must show no mercy, and they must never surrender. Thus far they have been found lacking. The number of rounds wasted on deserters is too high when they could be put to use against the enemy. We shall require our troops swear oaths of loyalty, and officers instructed to keep a closer eye on their men. And every man will keep an eye on his comrades - for there are traitors around every street corner."
 GGR_volkssturm_desc:0 "To achieve a great future blood must be spilled. Just because one is not eligible for conscription into the Wehrmacht does not mean one cannot be of use to their country. The Volkssturm shall serve as a home for those too old for the Wehrmacht, those too infirm to drill with a rifle and those women who are called upon to serve the Reich in its time of great need. Though their equipment may be lacking in quality, their training substandard and their uniforms virtually nonexistent, they will fill holes in the line just as well as any Heer Soldat. It will serve as a useful means of disposal for critical of our way of thinking."
 GGR_all_traitors_shall_bleed_desc:0 "Our efforts have proven successful so far, with the flow of fresh recruits to the front line broadening into a torrent. There will always be elements of cowardice that must be rooted out however - the common soldier must be taught the value of discipline and diligence. Anyone attempting to undermine the war effort, by words or by actions, is a traitor and will be treated as such. The Reich is a machine of flesh and metal, and when a cog gets stuck or a spring breaks, you replace it. We have neither the time nor the inclination to waste our efforts with trials or prisons. Shoot them."
 GGR_those_without_desc:0 "We had hoped that Göring would prove a willing ally as Führer - while he may be vain and gauche he is a military man. Sadly it was not to be, his leadership limp-wristed, his monetary management ham-fisted and his policies ill-thought. He has proven truculent in our attempts to steer him and now he has bucked the reins and risks bringing the Reich we have fought so hard for crashing into a ditch. He must die, and those that followed him in life will follow him to the firing line.\n\nEnding that glory hound Speidel will merely be the cherry on top of the cake. From the battlefields of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line to the balconies of the Berghof he has followed us, always casting his shadow. He has hindered us for too long, and it will be a pleasure to see him swinging from a rope. "
 GGR_and_those_within_desc:0 "Examples have been made, and we have been patient enough. Soldiers linger away from their duties, eager to spend as much time away from the front as possible. They make excuses, hide in their barracks, spend time on frivolities like lunch breaks. No longer. Spare time is wasted time, and wasted time is dereliction of duty.\n\nThe newly issued 'Richtlinien für die Behandlung der Zeitverschwender' will crack down on these time wasters. Any soldier found away from the front lines without written orders from a superior officer will be hanged. Any officer who fails to carry out these orders will be shot. What more fitting punishment for those who refuse to defend German women and children?"
 GGR_no_retreat_desc:0 "This front is too vital to fall without a fight. No matter how many men they throw at us, no matter how many bodies we must expend, we will bleed for every second we must buy for our forces across the Reich to muster against the enemy. There will be not one step back for our men, not until they reach the very walls of [ROOT.Capital.GetName].\n\nOf course, the Reichsmarshall and his staff are too vital to leave to the enemy. They will evacuate when the time is right. "
 GGR_shorten_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Even we are willing to admit the Wehrmacht has become somewhat bloated since its glory days in the forties. Our ranks are filled with upjumped, inexperienced officers who scarcely remember the Second World War, let alone the first. They are more a hindrance than a help - what use can they be commanding men in combat if they have never seen the front lines?\n\nWe shall do them a favour and shorten the chain of command. Those without experience will be demoted to NCO ranks, those that complain will find themselves no different to the Soldaten they once commanded. Perhaps if they survive, they can work their way back up the ranks."
 GGR_slaves_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Slaves are one of the few things we have in abundance. They may be lazy and insubordinate, their work shoddy and substandard, but they provide the majority of the Reich's labour. They are many and individually quite worthless - it would be a mistake not to utilise them in our hour of need. Their blood is inferior but they take a bullet just as well as any Aryan.\n\nPromise them freedom, or food, or a day off - we have no obligation to follow through. March them at gunpoint and send them at the enemy barricades. Every one that dies is a German life saved, and maybe after the war there won't be so many of them to worry about."
 GGR_nowhere_left_to_run_desc:0 "A cornered dog is the most dangerous kind. Every man, woman and child here knows their duty, to defend this land to their dying breath, and with all avenues of escape cut off even the most desperate coward must stand and fight. When men are ordered to march, we expect them to march. When they are ordered to kill, we expect that they kill. And when they are ordered to die, we expect them to die. Any less is treason."
 GGR_a_lost_cause_desc:0 "The situation here has become untenable. The front lines are dissolving, with deserters fleeing faster than our blocking squads can shoot them. All the same, we can ensure the enemy gains nothing of value from this land. Land mines and indiscriminate artillery fire will slow their advance long enough to extract men and materiel, while we set light to the fields and salt the earth beneath with defoliants. Ammo dumps will be rigged with time delayed bombs, sending any would-be scavengers to kingdom come. There is always the next Reichskommissariat."
 GGR_exhaust_the_workers_desc:0 "Scorched earth tactics do not merely extend to the land itself. Blood and soil are inextricably linked - it would be ridiculous to burn the crops and leave those who tend them to replant them the next day. They must be wrung for every last drop of effort before we evacuate, every ounce of arms and armaments and supplies taken. If they must work in double shifts to ensure that we eventually take the helm, so be it. When we return they will no doubt be grateful we spared their lives."
 GGR_dispose_of_the_useless_desc:0 "Slaves have always been disposable - that is their purpose. If we cannot take them with us to the next front, so be it. Round them up and put a bullet in them before we leave. The work camps they once occupied are valuable assets and it would be foolish to leave them intact for the next contender. Shell them, bomb them, set them alight. There is no sense in evacuating those with no reason to live."
 GGR_burn_capital_desc:0 "A capital is temporary, for we are always on the march. If this one does not suit us we will find a new one, one more suitable for our needs. Of course, it would be hypocritical to leave this city intact and ready starve when we have demolished the factories and salted the earth behind us in the name of a better Reich. They do not even have slaves any more. It is kinder to set it alight behind us when we leave."

GGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The Madness of Göring and Schörner has collapsed like a house of cards. Now once again Germans are shooting on Germans. The failure of National Socialism in it's current state is evident. Now it falls to Speidel to restore the Reich to some semblance of sanity. If that means reform then so be it. Working with students, working with partisans or even abandoning RK's outright. The Reich will be reformed into something more reasonable. It doesn't have a choice."
GGR_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "If the German people as well as all the other people currently within the Reich want to see their chains broken and a measure of freedom restored, then they have no choice, but to stay with us. While our promises have to be vague at the moment, once we have triumphed over Schörner and Göring surely we will reform the Reich into something more "pleasant" than what it has been in the past."
GGR_rally_the_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the army still follows Schörner or Göring, even the forces that have joined us are still somewhat reluctant to accept Speidel as their new leader. In this critical situation we can't afford to let lingering distrust impact our effort to save the Reich. Let's remind them, that Speidel is the saviour of Germania during the first civil war, the vanquisher of Himmler's coup during the West russian War and that now he will save Germany once again. Unsere letzte Hoffnung heißt Speidel."
GGR_rally_the_students_desc:0 "The students of the Reich have suffered much in the recent years, between the first Civil War, Görings crackdown and being sent off to die in the various wars. Hence their distrust of any Wehrmacht general, even one that actually wants to improve their situation is natural. Speidel will have a lot of convincing to do to gain their support. However if they want to see reform of the Reich within their lifetime then they will have no choice but to support Speidel. "
GGR_a_united_front_desc:0 "It took a lot of talking, haggling and pleading, but finally the Students and the parts of the Wehrmacht that have sided with us have agreed to form a united front against our enemies. It's condition is still brittle, but with time and hopefully success it will form into a front of solid iron that will have the strength to do what it must: Save the Reich from its current self."
GGR_call_to_the_partisans_desc:0 "While dealing with the various collaborators that have supported Reich, Speidel has inevitably gotten contact with various groups that are willing to rise up as partisans, but whoms ideological composition is not so far away as to be untenable. Directly helping potential enemies of the Reich might not be the clean choice, but giving a hand to let these partisan groups rise up in our current enemies territory can prove very valuable."
GGR_the_iberians_desc:0 "Ever since Iberia fell to our invasion, the peninsula has become a mess of partisans and garrisons fighting it out. With the Civil War this situation only intensified. With the number and variety of resistance organizations very large, it is easy to simply support a few of those to rise up in pro-Schörner and pro-Göring controlled areas, but not in ours."
GGR_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Schörner controlled areas include many of the former and current slavic inhabited lands. Having them rise up in an attempt to liberate their lands is not only likely to happen with or without our help, if we give them a bit of support here and there, they will likely draw away a significant amount of hostile forces away from our current areas of engagement. And no matter who wins, we can just deal with them afterwards."
GGR_the_scandinavians_desc:0 "Scandinavia, especially the valuable mines of Lappland and northern Sweden have seen large influxes of slave workers recently. With the territory being lowly populated, vast in scale and difficult to control, it is a prime area for an uprising. A bit of help here and there can help this to come about quicker. Still the emptiness of the region will prevent the uprising from spreading too far into our own areas of control."
GGR_all_for_a_prosperous_europe_desc:0 "With various partisan uprisings as well as our own war effort underway, a glorious future for Europe might now be within reach. Speidel's Germany and its vision is clear: All of Europe shall become prosperous once more under our leadership, the leadership of the Einheitspakt"
GGR_know_when_to_fight_desc:0 "This war is not yet over! We may have been pushed back and delayed temporarily, but we will fight on from one of those Reichskommissariat loyal to us. And there are enough of those around that we can repeat that process time and time again. Still we will fight to the last for the vision that Hans Speidel represents: A Reich of reason and not of madness that can hold up to all challenges."
GGR_call_troops_from_overseas_desc:0 "The fight for the heart of the Reich is the most important front in this whole conflict, but where Speidel is also important. We should recall troops from overseas and those areas less relevant to our cause and concentrate on securing our central area of operations."
GGR_the_saviour_of_germany_desc:0 "He is the saviour of the West Russian war, He is the protector of Germania, He is our last hope for change in the Reich, He is Hans Speidel! His popularity has to be emphasized and used, if we want to have a chance in fighting this war. Lets use all available means for a morale boosting campaign. All hail Speidel saviour and regenerator of the Reich."
GGR_and_to_withdraw_desc:0 "It is no shame to withdraw when you have to. There are others on our side who can carry on the fight. And just such a situation is happening right now. We have to leave, before the situation becomes bad enough, that even an orderly evacuation is impossible. Speidel will leave, but rest assured that he will return."
GGR_evacuate_the_troops_desc:0 "While the struggle over here is turning out less than favourable to us, our friends and forces overseas are doing much better, especially if those forces that remain can be transported over to them. Thus that is what we will do. Ready the troops and ready the ships, it is time to defend Germany elsewhere!"
GGR_native_rule_desc:0 "Our conventional and symmetric method of warfare has failed in this region. We now have no choice but to retreat elsewhere to fight another day. The natives of the nation have no such luxury however, defeat or not they will fight to live another day. Leaving them some equipment we can't afford to evacuate in such a short time, surely will help them to continue their resistance against our mutual enemies, long after we have left."
GGR_evacuation_desc:0 "이제 끝났고 이 국가판무관부는 무너졌습니다. 만일 우리가 충분히 버틸 수 있다면 우리가 대피할 수 있도록 도울 수 있을 것입니다. 딱 84일. 84일만 버티면 우리는 살 수 있을 것입니다."

Yet.\n\nWhile we are strengthening our position, three targets have presented themselves to us The first of these is Iberia, which stands on a much coveted strategical position. The second is Turkey, which is famed for its vital chromium mines and dominance of the Bosphorus strait, as well as a land border with the Italians, which could prove to be most useful in the future. Last is the cursed Slavs to our east; the Siberian plains are rich in resources and enemies alike. We shouldn't neglect these flies, they must be crushed if we are to secure our eastern borders once and for all.\n\nOnce we have crushed and secured all of the aforementioned foes, we should be more than ready to tackle our rivals to our south!

And he insulted them as economists and monetarists who are as corrupt as the Jews.

Nothing to hold; nothing to bring up and shoulder; nothing to give him some measure of control, of safety. Just as sweat dropped down his neck.\n\nWhen the older man stopped speaking and returned to his seat, the soldier - an experienced rifleman who had served as the Fatherland saw fit for him to serve in whatever place, then serving once more to win the Fatherland for the new Führer - stiffened.\n\nThoughts raced through his head, as bullets once did by his ears. A nervousness rang as ruined bells inside his equally ruined mind. And the full measure of the past rose back up to the surface, tormenting him with the truths of war as these students seemed not to really comprehend anything at all.\n\nThis war of mine, he said to himself, reminding his conscience, is not theirs to thoroughly appreciate. He wished himself to will through and speak about his experiences as they were to him; raw, brutal, and traumatic. But the state would not permit it; war was a glorious thing, as the new Führer declared for a new Germany.\n\nHis left hand pressed against his thigh. And he began to speak, choosing to lie to them - to lull them into the dream of conquest and of power they wanted to believe.

The Feldgendarmerie will now directly attach teams to frontline units, monitoring the men's morale and ensuring that the threat of sedition is held at bay. \nNightly lectures on Mein Kampf!

They are armed with six spare MG34s rather than MG3s and crewed by eight men. The most modern armament is the mounting for a recoilless rifle on top of the vehicle to provide the Volkspanzer with an anti-panzer punch!\n\nSome vile, seditious wretches have suggested that the resulting 30 tonne, 20 kph vehicle is not really the vehicle that we need to win the war, and that we should be focusing on proven weapons of war.

Satisfied that he was as safe as he could make himself, he opened his desk drawer and slowly pulled out the small book buried underneath the mess of papers within.\n\n"All Quiet On The Western Front" it was called, by Erich Maria Remarque. It was about the life of a soldier in the first World War, the one Grandpa had fought in. Only, where all his other favorite books about that conflict had spoken of noble it was to fight, the glory of battle, and as always the shame of being stabbed in the back, this one told quite a different story. The soldiers lived horrible, filthy lives in the trenches. The rats alone were enough to make him queasy and all the horrible death. It didn't sound anything like what he had been taught in school. No wonder he wasn't supposed to be reading it. When Professor Herren had handed him the book some time ago, he had made Hans promise not to tell anybody about the gift. Of course, Hans had seen the title on the lists of banned books before, but it wasn't until he had actually read it did he realize why he had been forbidden to.\n\nA knock on the door made him freeze in fear.\n\n"Hans, are you asleep?"\n\nHe turned the lamp off, hid the novel, and darted into his bed.

In a terrifying case, a Battalion was issued Second World War era Kar98s that had somehow been assembled with the bolts from Russian Mosin-Nagants, leading to six deaths as the rifles catastrophically failed. This specific case is just one of many considering the deluge of reports about anti-tank rockets failing to launch and exploding a foot away from the launcher; hand grenades with faulty fuses exploding in our grenadiers hands; or panzer engines self-immolating the second they are moved from their railway wagons.\n\nMany generals are now pointing fingers at the Führer's removal of skilled personnel from the factories to form scratch battalions as a cause for these problems.

Göring had not had the chance to indulge himself in such a manner since before the Civil War, and this occasion was the perfect opportunity to present his grandeur as the new master of Germany to the people, and more importantly, to the military.\n\nNormally, the promotion of an officer, even an exceptional one as was the case here, would not call for such pageantry. Or at least that would be the state of affairs under Hitler, but Göring was not Hitler, and that was no secret. His passion for opulence and appearance was a critical factor in all that he did and now that he was free to do as he pleased, public events would become much more frequent and much more grandiose. Besides, the Führer wished to celebrate those officers who had served him so well against the traitors.\n\nHans Speidel called from a roll, "Johannes Steinhoff, step forward." Speidel's presence was supremely important. These were the officers that were selected to counterbalance Schörner's clique, whether for their support for Göring or Speidel didn't matter as long as they were not lackeys of the Chief of the OKW. The man that had just called up was one of those handpicked by the Führer himself. Steinhoff, like himself, had the blood of a pilot through and through, and Göring had already marked him as one to keep close by his side. This promotion would allow the much-deserving man to lead the Luftwaffe to glory as now that Göring was above personally directing its actions. More importantly, it would give Göring a much-needed reprieve from the duties of the office.\n\nThe Führer smiled as he placed the shoulder straps of a General der Luftwaffe on Steinhoff's uniform and gave him an almost paternal pat on the back as the newly-minted general moved to retake his seat. Göring would make the Wehrmacht his own, officer by officer. Speidel checked Steinhoff's name, and moved to the next one down."

When Adolf was alive he had envied the position of the leader of all the Reich, but now that he had it? Well he certainly didn't begrudge the authority, but he was not a fan of all the work.\n\nThe lisping voice of a man brought him out of his task. It was Steinhoff. Anyone else and Göring would have thrown them out, but if the head of his Luftwaffe wanted a meeting, then he could overlook the interruption.\n\nGöring gave one more look over of the baton before addressing the waiting general, "Yes, Herr Steinhoff? What brings you to my office this fine day? Does the Luftwaffe need more funding again? I told you, you don't need to come to me for anything else. All you have to do is take what you want."\n\nSteinhoff shook his head, pushed his sunglasses back up to fully cover his eyes, "Err, no my Führer, it's a matter of foreign affairs actually.

Still, I had the utmost faith in your skills as a commander and was not surprised to hear that you triumphed over the rat Maurice and the upstart natives and Jews.\n\nI understand that you must be very weary of being trapped in such a precarious situation and I am here to offer all the support of the Reich and reestablishing German order in Madagaskar. You and your garrison will be allowed back into the Pakt and granted full reprieve and rest after your great service to the Reich and its people.\n\nPlease accept Erhard, I would be delighted to host you for a time at Carinhall. Of course, should you refuse, I am afraid I cannot guarantee your safety at that point. The Reich requires the island, and it will have it one way or another. I would prefer it to be on friendly terms.\n\nYour old friend,\nHermann Göring, Reichsmarschall and Führer of the Greater German Reich"\n\nMilch read through the letter once more, hardly believing it.

Sure, it had been Göring who had gotten him stuck here in the first place, but at the time that had seemed like a mercy compared to what the racial purists had wanted.

His old friend had been quiet for most of the tour, only giving the courtesy-required greetings but nothing more. He looked quite tired and frankly malnourished, although Göring had decided not to bring it up for politeness' sake.\n\nThe reestablishment of Reichskommissariat Madagaskar had not gone entirely as smoothly as he had hoped to be honest. The XVI. Armeekorps had been dispatched to relieve the skeleton garrison and had immediately been set upon by rebel bands still active across the island. At least with the island's airfields retaken they could launch air raids against known hideouts but still, it was shaping up to be a long and difficult slog.\n\nMilch clearly had needed some time to rest, and so Göring had relieved him of his duties and placed his second-in-command Werner Goldberg in charge for the time being. Officially it was only going to be a temporary vacation but seeing Milch in person had made Göring doubt if the man would ever willingly return to the island.

The closest airfields are on the African mainland and we haven't had access to those since the South African War.

While most of the army's upper echelons are divided bitterly between rival cliques, most notably those of Schorner and Speidel, the "New Guard" as they have been nicknamed are much less factional. That is not to say they are apolitical, but it cannot be denied that most of the newcomers have chosen not to favor any one side too heavily.\n\nWhile this has been a blow to the clique leaders, always in need of more allies, it is hopefully a sign that the age of militarists leveraging immense political power may be coming to an end.

That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler.

"-has been bogged down for years under an endless weight of political obstructionism, corruption, and the creeping tide of unchecked Judeo-Bolshevik influence."\n\n"No more! The age of progress has returned to German science. With this new, centralized ministry that we have created to replace the bloated corpse of the Reichsforschungsrat, led by the watchful gaze of my esteemed colleague and good friend, Werner Osenberg-"\n\nOsenberg walked on stage, to loud applause. He waved to the crowd as he took his spot next to the Führer, who's smile spread across his face. "-Germany shall once again be at the forefront of technology! Drink well tonight, friends, for today we celebrate the founding of the GRWI!"\n\nThe room shook with cheers and applause as Osenburg and Göring shook hands, making sure to smile for the cameras."

What drove you to make such a large change to our scientific structure, hmm?" Werner smiled as he spoke, the words flowing as easily as the liquor.\n\nGöring returned the smile. "Well, my friend, there's a number of reasons. I was hoping that, with a new, organized scientific body, we could perhaps spend more time looking into some of the Heer's most treasured weapon ideas."\n\nOsenberg scoffed. "The Wunderwaffe? Have you seen some of those proposals?"\n\n"Oh, of course, some of them are quite ridiculous." Göring replied. "But every idea has some merit, and besides, the Heer has money and dreams. Why should I stand in the way of their hopes to fulfill them?" Both men laughed at that.\n\n"I'm excited for it," Osenberg began, "because we can finally have a centralized research body. Can you imagine how far ahead we could be if the militarists hadn't spent the last 20 years gutting our research capabilities with their political games? In fact, I thought that would be what you would say there- it's what you highlighted in your speech."\n\n"Oh, yes, of course. Centralizing the research body. Yes, that's a big reason, too." Göring stuttered out. Osenberg eyed him suspiciously for a moment before shrugging it off. "A toast to the new future of German science?"

Not a good sign for the future.\n\n"Generalleutnant Remer, I don't see why the Feltgrau we currently used must have such a sweeping overhaul. It has proven capable in the field. Such a motion seems like a simple waste of time to me." Mumbles of agreement rippled through the civilian side of the table, as Osenberg leaned back in his chair. Remer scowled and leaned into the table.\n\n"Do you not understand that we must advance in all fields, Herr Osenberg? The Reich must lead the world on all fronts, not just weaponry. If our men are not hidden, what use is their weaponry, or their machinery? No, we must forge ahead, no matter the cost. You look too much at the Reichsmarks and not enough at the materials, Osenberg. I know many of our highest ranking military men would approve of such a change, and they know the art of war more than you, if I may say so." Chuckles and clapping from the generals. Osenberg did not move.\n\n"Generalleutnant, I just don't see the point of it. Nobody except for the OKH and yourself is clamoring for a change.

However, there were two letters in particular that Göring was waiting on- a letter from the OKH, located in Germania, and a letter from the Kriegsmarine, located in Theoderichshafen . When the two came in one day, Göring sidelined all other priorities to read them.\n\nIt had been quite the pain to wrestle the two high commands into handing over their R&D departments. While Schörner's followers seemed more than eager to get started on their projects, Schörner himself was uncharacteristically cautious on the matter, attempting to convince his followers to not dive headlong into their projects. Göring sighed at the thought of it- it seemed Schörner had at least seen that there was something going on behind the scenes. Hopefully, thought Göring, his heart will win out over his brain.\n\nSimilarly, much of the Speidelite faction seemed happy enough to gain more control over research efforts, but Speidel seemed to be suspicious of such a blatant move to placate the military. Göring had to give credit where credit was due- Speidel was no slouch when it came to brains, and he could tell that Göring was not showing his full hand.\n\nIn any case, both branches had been quite evenly split on their support or opposition to the GRWI. Perhaps it was why these letters had taken so long to arrive. In any case, Göring hoped for the best as he tore the first one open.

Osenberg smiled, but one could tell it was a bit forced if they looked hard enough- Remer was Schörner's way of keeping his thumb on research, and was certainly going to be a pain to deal with. Nothing is perfect, Osenberg thought.\n\nWhen Remer's applause died down, Osenberg began to speak. "Our first topic will be on the subject of the standard infantry rifle. This is less on the quality of our current rifle and more on our quantity of them. Many of our frontline soldiers are still equipped with older models of rifle- I've even heard reports that some are carrying G43's. This is unacceptable, but the question is how we go about fixing it. My suggestion is that we transfer guns from the garrisons to make up the deficit, build some new ones, and replace the oldest guns with newer models to make up the gap. It won't fully solve our issues, but it will be economically sound. All in favor?"\n\nMumbling and debate rumbled across the table. Osenberg watched- he never expected such a suggestion to be a unanimous agreement- but he let out a small sigh when Remer got to his feet.\n\n"I must respectfully disagree, Herr Osenberg." Remer said with a grin. "We can't let our armies, the prides of the Reich, be equipped with suboptimal equipment any longer, in my opinion. We must be better armed than our opponents, shouldn't we? I propose that we devote as many resources as possible to rearming our soldiers with the best the Reich has, no matter the cost.

Brilliant agility, great speed, and the firepower to destroy anything the Americans and Japanese can muster. If the project goes ahead, I can guarantee that this will only bolster our armies." The scientist stuttered. Göring did not address these remarks, instead turning to Osenberg, who had still not moved.\n\n"Herr Osenberg, what do you make of this design?"

"No, no, Werner, I don't think you see the potential here. It's a blueprint- a prototype, isn't it?" Göring kept going before the man could answer. "Sure, there are flaws, but I see a lot of potential in this. Can you imagine the American reaction to getting run over by twin-gunned heavy tanks at 70 kilometers an hour?"

We've improved upon the engine- it's got more power, more speed, and can push the tank along at a quicker pace."\n\n"So what's the catch?" Osenberg asked. He had a feeling he could already guess, but he wanted to hear it from the man himself.\n\n"To produce this new engine, we'll need more time and more money. If you refuse, we'll do what we can to streamline the production of the old engine, but the speed of the tank may be a bit... less."\n\nOsenberg sighed again. He could already see it now- the Liger, an expensive money sink, a complete waste of time, and he'd catch all the blame for it. No matter that he was against the project from the start- Göring sure as hell wouldn't take the fall for him, friendly as the two were. Of course, perhaps the fundamental issues of the Liger could be fixed- or at least mitigated- with enough money and development. Who knows, perhaps it could become something workable. Asking for more time and more money would be a pain, but if it saved the project, maybe it was worth it.\n\nOsenberg turned back to the man, his mind made up.

The three men crewing the prototype watched closely as the Führer continued his loop around the tank, taking in every last bit of it. Finally, he motioned to his aides, and the party of officials departed for a nearby hill, from which they would observe the tests.\n\nIn a moment, the tank revved its engine and sped down the course. Göring watched intensely, gazing through the pair of binoculars he had been provided with. Occasionally, he'd make a side comment to one of the engineers, praising the speed of the tank or commenting on its majestic appearance. However, as the test went on, the praise began to fade.\n\nThe Liger, despite its beginning appearance, seemed to struggle as the test continued. The tank was only able to complete its shooting at a pace that barely trailed the Leopard, despite the twin guns' supposed strength. The engine, which once launched the Liger around the trials in a flash, began to pour black smoke. In a final coup de grâce, the Liger turned to fire upon its final targets, only for the first gun to be blown out of its mounting, flipping backward and tearing through the roof of the tank before slamming to a halt in the soft mud.

Inwardly, however, his mind was shot through and through with panic.\n\nThe plan that he and Göring had hammered out seemed to be going accordingly so far, but so many things could go wrong. If Schörner found out, the result could be catastrophic. If the plan was leaked, it would prove a massive embarrassment to Göring's administration. Even if the plan went correctly, what if Schörner and Remer managed to pass the blame themselves? It would eventually find its way back to the GRWI, if not Osenberg himself, and then he would have another mess to deal with. Besides, how much had keeping the Liger's poor performance secret from the military already cost the Reich? Bribing that many people paid a hefty price, and there was no guarantee that one hadn't snitched.\n\nOsenberg realized that the people around his chair were now looking at him, and he snapped out of his thoughts.

The whispers tore through divisions like wildfire, the theories as to what the drugs were doing growing more and more outlandish by the day. Suddenly, it was thought that Göring was trying to poison his enemies, that Osenberg was setting up for a coup, that Schörner was planning an execution of those who disliked him, that the Jews had infiltrated the highest ranks of the Reich and were planning a mass mind control campaign to destroy Nazism. All of these theories ran almost purely on conjecture and hypothesis, but that was all it took to buffett the conspiracy to even higher levels.\n\nWhen the first reports of the controversy hit Göring's desk, it was already far too late to stop the rumors.

It is unknown what the overall strategic goals of the mission was, in regards to the plans of the partisans. It has been suggested that it was some variant of a suicide mission, where a commando unit was to disable or damage the safety system in order to cause a chain reaction within the power plant. This would cause a type of reaction that would expel enormous amounts of radioactive energy into the atmosphere, leaving the surrounding area virtually uninhabitable. In the worst case scenario, these irradiated particles could reach Germania, in less than three months.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that the commando units were simply trying to disable the power plant as a whole, to cripple the energy supply of the Reichskommissariat. Whatever the case, the workers of the power plant managed to activate the safety systems, before a critical error could occur. The partisan group did not manage to defeat the reinforcements to the plant's security, however they could not be captured for interrogation. The current casualty count is six partisan commandos, three security units and fourteen workers. No men from the reinforcements were hurt in the fighting.\n\nWorkers of the power plant have reported that the safety systems did not perform to their recommended timescale, and were significantly behind the expected time schedule.

Was this really what Speidel had spent his time fighting for?\n\nHe was almost powerless now. In his assignment to Afrika Schörner had been able to act unopposed in his schemes at taking control of the Reich for himself. Speidel didn't understand why he needed to gain this much control. He was a militarist, after all, and the militarists had won the war. It was an enigma. It was an enigma that was now Speidel's superior. The thought of Schörner as his superior made Speidel want to vomit.\n\nAnd there was Göring, too. That petulant bastard. He barely knew how to command anything, much less a Reich. He had saved the Reich in Afrika and this was his reward? Going back to two idiots who didn't know how an economy is supposed to function? If Speidel just hopped on a plane to America on a "foreign military mission" he could-\n\nSpeidel stopped himself. He had a duty to the Fatherland, after all. He couldn't desert now. Not like this.

Speidel's clique has been dealt a heavy blow with the apparent failure by their leader to secure a victory on the ground and this has given Schorner's clique an opportunity to pounce. A bloodless battle has broken out amongst the officer corps as the various factions begin to maneuver in the wake of this disgrace. Luckily enough officers have expressed a commitment to inter-factional neutrality that Schorner's crew is unable to do much more than gloat but the dangers of Speidel's failure are readily apparent.

The media still tries to describe the ceasefire as a decisive triumph of the Reich over the Americans, but everyone knows clearly that no one is going to believe or even read such recovers.\n\nFor the military, much like the civilians, the morale of our army is not even affected by this event at all. While the militarists' faith in the Führer didn't grow stronger as we hoped, they are not very unhappy about it neither, which is at least acceptable for our current situation. Indeed, there is still someone murmuring about our performance during the war in darkness, but most soldiers aren't buying it.\n\nEventually, in the everywhere of the Reich, life continues as usual. Fathers are considering where they can have a better payment, and cheering for their favorite football club; mothers are worrying about their children's grades in school and preparing for the dinner that their husbands are about to have; children are still running over the streets, talking about how to make excuse for their late returns.

While such an victory cannot be compared with those great victories we achieved before, the first victory against the western powers after the civil war has still made people passionate about what we're going to achieve in the future. Retired old put on their old medals, and tells stories about their performance in the past; younglings are gathering in the conscription stations, wishing to win their own glory in such an unstable but exciting age. The Reich is now a sea of joy, and all doubts about our newly secured government have disappeared in the dust.\n\nHowever, there are still some troubling consequences coming alongside the good ones. Those militarists, who didn't like us from the beginning, has gained more popularity and prestige by this victory. They openly declared that the Reich need directly take out her enemies, so that we can become the ruler of the world through blood and fire.

His face was a dusky red, bordering on an unhealthy purple as every vein in his forehead protruded grotesquely. It was, however, the man's eyes that most stood out to witnesses. They were orbs, cracked with deep red lines and filled with an unnatural fire, some kind of primordial fury that threatened to burn the man who bore them inside out. Hüttig was not facing his approaching demise with anything close to dignity, but perhaps that was only fair.\n\nHe had been pulled after all, half conscious, from a makeshift brig in one of the Reich's ships that had fled the lost continent Africa. The continent that had been lost by him, or so the Reich had claimed, thus explaining his treatment. Still, if they had hoped to pacify the former colonial governor, they had made a massive mistake. The confinement had only given the man more time to reflect inward into his own dark, distrubed mind. For the days and nights he had spent at sea, only eating the meager rations his former allies had allowed him, he drifted further and further into a black abyss of madness. Every layer of mental safeguard, every justification for serving the Reich, every ideal he had devoted his brutish life to, each was stripped away in painful turn.\n\nAnd so at last when he found himself once more under the white hot light of the yellow sun, it was as a malignant husk of his former self. Capable only of hatred for his betrayers and the degenerates he imagined were surrounding him even now, coherent conversation was nearly impossible. Only the rantings and ravings of a man who had stared deep into the abyss, and had seen the abyss stare back."

goering.410.d:0 "Führer Hermann Göring watched as the jet-black helicopter came in low and loud as it approached the landing pad built for VIP visitors to the Reichskanzlei. It was not one of those marvelous and expensive machines the Luftwaffe had been toying with nor was it even as sleek as any of the private crafts the corporate big-wigs were so fond of. No, this was an older, but also far more durable model that had been built for use in the African Reichskommisars. This was the personal vehicle of Siegfried Müller.\n\nThe craft's landing was... not graceful by any stretch, bumping twice and skidding half a foot. Göring fleetingly wondered if the pilot was drunk. He hoped the former Reichskommisar was unharmed. Still, he reminded himself, if the man could survive the South African War and a run from the OFN for the past several months, a little jostling wouldn't be the end of him. He was brought out from his thoughts by the sound of the 330 Puma's cockpit door opening. From the pilot's seat hopped a man in the dress of a common mercenary, a Sturmgewehr 45 slung over one shoulder; it was Siegfried Müller himself! Only moments before the Führer had been annoyed by the mediocre landing, but that was all forgotten now. The Führer gave a non-formal salute that Müller did not even bother returning, but Göring didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n"Herr Müller, it is so good to finally see you in person again! I had no idea you had taught yourself to fly helicopters during your time in Africa. It was most impressive to watch you in the sky if I may say."\n\nMüller flashed the smile that had won him adoring fans all across the Reich, "Why thank you my Führer. Yes, I did pick up some skills in my time, mostly for the purpose of getting to hunting spots you see, but I am thrilled to have impressed the great Reichsmarschall himself."\n\n"Hunting, yes I did know you were quite an exceptional marksman. We ought to hunt together at Schorfheide. You will come to Carinhall and stay a while to rest won't you?"\n\n"If it's you asking me then I would be delighted sir.""

Such a move will serve both as a reminder for the three mainland Reichskommissars that they have an ultimate loyalty to the Führer even if that position may have changed hands, but at the same time will make an excellent snub to those pathetic nations that were utterly embarrassed in their efforts to back South Africa.\n\nThe question now is where Führer Göring should head. Siegfried Müller in Zentralafrika would no doubt be able to regale the leader of the Reich with tales of exotic hunts and daring mercenary adventures. Schenck's shared experience in the sky with Göring will surely make for many enjoyable evenings spent in nostalgia. Hans Hüttig of Ostafrika may not be much of a conversationalist or host, but he did do the most to achieve this latest victory for the German people and deserves proper congratulations.

The Führer reflected upon the fact that his host, who had been quite sullen and quiet up until this point, had almost seemed to come back alive when the topic of flying was mentioned. Göring had never considered himself a clairvoyant in matters of the heart, but even he was adept enough to recognize that the man was clearly more at home amongst the clouds than in an office. Perhaps, the Führer thought inwardly, he could have been such a man if things had gone differently.\n\n"So I've been told you were born here in South West Africa under the old Imperial colony?"\n\n"Yes my Führer, in Windhoek."\n\n"I see, I see. Did you know that my late father was the first colonial commissioner here? I suppose we both have our connections to one another, both in the lands we are tied to and the professions we have chosen."\n\n"You are no doubt right my Führer, but I must confess I believe I share nothing of your ability to lead others, much less a nation."\n\n"Perhaps," Göring mused, clearly appreciating the flattery, "but we cannot all be Führer material can we? We all must have our part to play in the hierarchy of life just and just as there is an apex predator in every food chain, I was simply destined to serve the German people as their leader." Schenck said nothing to the self-adulation billowing forth from his leader's mouth in a cloak of faux-modesty.\n\n"Er, my Führer," Schecnk seemed somewhat reluctant to speak, "perhaps some time soon we could discuss a possible change in my position? I must admit that I do not truly feel up to this most important of tasks any longer..."\n\nGöring nodded, but his attention was fixed on the trays of food being brought in by the native servants."

Yes, he was in charge of the Imperial colony of Sudwestafrika and much like you he had the burden of bringing civilization to this poor excuse for a continent."\n\nNothing. Not even an acknowledgement that he had heard Göring speak. If the man had not been responsible for the recent victory in the war the Führer would seriously consider having him removed and sent to wallow behind a desk deep in the Wolfsschanze. So far, Göring thought, the only thing that had made this visit even semi-bearable was the excellent cognac that Hüttig had provided. It was frankly astonishing to the former Reichsmarschall that a man with such an unpleasantly austere personality would keep such a collection. He made a mental note to carry off as much as he could upon his return to Germania.\n\nJust as the Führer was beginning to lose all hope of ever getting his "companion" to engage in any sort of discussion, the Ostafrikan Reichskommissar seemed to burst into a frenzy of animated movement and speech like a jack-in-the-box springing out.\n\n"My Führer! My Führer it is good to finally be able to talk to you in person!" Göring was about to return the compliment but Hüttig did not let up, "We must talk about the others... I have very important information regarding them... very important information!" His words came in staccato bursts like the fire from a sturmgewehr. Göring was completely taken aback.\n\n"Herr Hüttig, please, settle down. If you have something so serious to discuss, I am sure we can talk it over at some other time in a more official capacity."\n\nThe words seemed to snap Hüttig back to reality, or so Göring believed when the man stopped his infernal shouting. As the Führer handed his host a glass of the cognac and began to attempt to entertain him with old war stories, he did not notice the dark, almost glassy look that had now settled on the disturbed zealot. He similarly failed to notice the twitching of the man's eyes, or the curling of the man's fists."

While the two bon-vivants were carousing, General Wilhelm von Thoma took the chance to converse with his former superior, the now retired Generalfeldmarschall Rommel.\n\n"You know," von Thoma offered, his voice noticeably charged with emotion, "I never forgot what you taught us in North Africa sir, and I never let my men forget it either."\n\nThe words of praise clearly affected the old warrior. "Herr Thoma, it means more to me than you could guess to hear that I had some value to the future soldiers of my Fatherland. It brings me some comfort in my twilight years."\n\n"Herr Rommel!

Inspect the tanks again? No, he had done that too many times since the Civil War had ended and it was getting stale. Head to the opera? He liked that one but Schörner would be too furious to make it worth it. Design a new wing for Carinhall? Now that sounded enjoyable but what if...?\n\nHe sprang from his seat in a flash of inspiration and snatched up one of the many phones for the numerous important connections he had to call into on a daily basis. This particular phone was marked 'OKW Headquarters'.\n\n"Yes this is Führer Göring. Yes, yes, Sieg Heil. Is Rommel still there? Good, good, put him on quick."\n\nQuiet blanketed the room for a few minutes while the heavyset dictator waited with barely contained excitement. Then, a new voice came through the other end of the line.\n\n"My Führer," Rommel's voice was still professional as ever, even in retirement, "how can I be of assistance to you?"\n\nGöring's face pulled into an almost impish grin, "Herr Rommel, pack your things, I'm going on a tour of our African lands and I want you to join me."\n\n"I - I suppose I couldn't refuse such a request from my Führer, now could I?"\n\nGöring's mask of geniality collapsed for a moment.

Moving to the center of activity, occasionally giving a hurried "Heil Göring!" to a passing officer, Steinhoff advanced to where he knew the Führer would be.\n\nHe found him, his face a dark red, in a state more furious and terrible than he had observed since the close of the Civil War. He was on the phone, and he was shouting, almost screaming down the line.\n\n"Tell Puttkamer I want a cordon established around their ports by the end of the week! Nothing gets in and nothing comes out without our approval and knowledge, do you understand me?" Without waiting for a reply, the dictator slammed the receiver down, hanging up.\n\nSteinhoff adjusted his sunglasses back to position nervously, "So, I take it that the rumors are true then?"\n\nGöring almost snarled at his air chief, "They are! That fucking bastard Hüttig has betrayed us! He has killed Schenck and has driven Müller underground. That's not what's important right now though Johannes. What's important is that we destroy him, we turn his ridiculous fucking 'Reichsstaat' into dust and ashes.

I wish that I could stand before you today and say that the war ended with all of our noble aims fulfilled.\n\nI cannot say that however, because that would be false, and I have vowed to never speak an untrue word to the German people so long as I remain Führer. It is true, our battle has ended indecisively, without clear victory for our people. However, this does not mean we can simply give up now! Quite the opposite, we must redouble our efforts to the spread and preservation of our people and National Socialism across the world. Our outposts in Africa have been battered, but they still remain intact, our dreams shall not die until the last Aryan has perished from the earth.\n\nRest assured that those who have failed the Reich will be given their just deserts, and let this serve as an example to all those who serve the German nation: this is what happens when you fail! Even in failure however, we gain strength, just as we gained inner strength from the travesty of Versailles to embrace the truth of National Socialism, it is my belief that this momentary setback will be looked back upon in similar fashion. When future historians chronicle us, they will write of this as the moment a reborn German people, still scarred from the flames of civil strife, recommitted themselves to taking their rightful place.

After the parade, Göring congratulated multiple politicians from the victorious countries on their military strength, especially Ostafrika. The small number of Ostafrikan officials present received these comments well before hurrying off.

As per your orders, a band of our Werewolves was deployed to arrest their garrison at Hitlerstadt. Unfortunately, something or someone must have tipped them off, because they were ready for the attempt. Without even giving our soldiers a warning, they opened fire and killed three of our men in the first volley. I am told that they then commenced a running gun battle to Lake Viktoria where they captured some of our transports and made west for the coast.\n\nAfter tending to the wounded and taking some time to receive nearby reinforcements, the Werewolf unit attempted to head the fleeing Wehrmacht soldiers off at locations around the Dam, Brazzaville, and Leopoldville. Unfortunately, the unit proved unsuccessful at sinking any of the transports and inflicting more than superficial casualties while losing several men in the process. It seems that a major, fatal blow to the effort was struck when the Werewolf unit leader Hauptmann Friedrich von Tannenburg was killed in a skirmish at the Dam.\n\nUpon reaching the coast the small river transports headed north and we may yet catch them at one of the docks as they search for ocean-going vessels but I fear they have eluded us. I am aware of my failure in this important mission and greatly regret it.\n\n\nHEIL HÜTTIG!\n-KOLONIALWALVERWALTER OTTO FÖRSCHNER"

Patrol the African coast and prevent anyone from leaving or entering the Großafrikanischer Reichsstaat? Who would want to get into that hellhole? It wasn't like anyone was trying to do business with the madman in Quelimane. That much at least was certain; the crew of U-3122 hadn't seen even the outline of a foreign convoy yet.\n\nSchultz had gone to the captain with his questions, but the skipper hadn't been any more in the know than his crew. He had told Friedrich that the order had come directly from Grossadmiral Puttkamer himself. Well, Schultz wasn't an officer, but he wasn't stupid either. If the order was coming from that high up on the chain then it must have originated with the Führer. That still didn't get him any closer to the truth unfortunately, and it seemed like the mystery was going to remain as such.\n\nSchultz wiped the sweat from his brow again.

Göring began, sharply, though he was certain Gehlen already knew of the situation. "If he believes his 'Greater African Reich' can keep the savages in line without our help, he's more than welcome to try. Though he'll have a difficult time at it, if I have anything to say about it. This insult to National Socialism should not be permitted to stand, not for a moment longer than it has to." Göring continued. When he had first heard the news, Göring's mind had immediately flown to ousting the upstart and overtaking the dark continent with German boots. Surely, that was the route some of the militarists would have preferred, but Göring knew that at this stage, it was impractical. "Make the phone calls and payments you must, Gehlen. I wish to be sure that Hüttig knows what it means to make an enemy in Germania." Though he spoke calmly, it was easy to see the rage behind Göring's eyes.\n\nIn contrast, one could see nothing behind Gehlen's sunglasses as he curtly nodded towards the most powerful man in Europe. "Right away, my Führer." It would be a simple task, to capitalize on the many problems that already existed in German Africa. It would not be difficult for a man of Gehlen's talents to bring Hüttig's abomination to the ground.

The agent watched as Von Hassel deflated a bit, now more at ease now that the man's identity was confirmed. The Abwehr agent continued, undeterred. "Let us not mince words, Herr. What precisely do you require from my employer? Guns? Bombs?"\n\nVon Hassel paused for a moment. He had spoken with several Zentralafrikan generals, most unhappy with the SS's coup over Africa. Few had been willing to commit to anything solid, however. Von Hassel's career in the Abwehr meant little to soldiers, who were committed to following the orders of their fellows. The Belgian industrialists in the area, however, would prove much more tractable as an ally. Hüttig's authoritarian, strictly national style of rule had chafed them and hurt their bottom line.

He supposed he could endure the utter humiliation of it for a few months more, if it meant that the empire Hüttig had stolen was razed entirely to the ground.\n\nHis thoughts gathered, Göring listened as Gehlen spoke. "A group of men loyal to Germania, led by a particular Herr von Hessel, will work to subvert Hüttig at every moment." Gehlen did not smile, but the Führer imagined he was very satisfied with his own work. "Eventually, they will make a move against the government. Either we will have Africa in our hands once more, or the resulting chaos will lead to a total collapse of Hüttig's regime in the area."\n\nGöring was keen enough to pick up the implication that it would likely be the latter of the two possibilities.

Something was certainly up, although the Luftwaffe staff officer couldn't begin to fathom what would cause the Führer to appear as such. It hadn't even been a few months since the last meeting when he had been red with rage, his eyes burning with venom for the traitor Hüttig and the loss of Africa.\n\nIt was only when Gerhard moved in close enough to see the map halfway between the Führer and Feldmarschall Schorner that he understood what was going on. It was a battleplan map, with lines crossing every which way but all ending in bloody arrows stabbing into the heart of the continent. Gerhard suppressed a gasp. This was impossible, insanity. He wished he had possessed his superior's dark sunglasses to hide the doubt in his eyes, but with any luck he would just be ignored as usual as long as he kept silent.\n\nSteinhoff unfortunately had no such luxury.

Goring almost bellowed, exuberant, "After discussing the matter with Schorner, I have decided to put any attempts at reclamation on hold, for now. In return, the Generalfeldmarcshall has so considerately drawn up these plans for me. Aren't they grand?"\n\nGerhard attempted to feign disinterest, but he had the uncomfortable feeling that Remer could sense the deception from across the table.

This would've been the perfect opportunity to showcase a renewed German might following the pain of the Bürgerkrieg, and that idiot had Hüttig botched it. He had thrown thousands of German soldiers, precious resources in their own right, into the meat grinder. And this was what he had to show for it? Unacceptable! Göring paced around his office.\n\nThis was an international relations disaster. Thanks to Hüttig, would the OFN simply strike at the weakened Reich? Would it extend its Judeo-Bolshevik tendrils further into Europe? Africa had been lost; what was next: Italy? Sweden? Finland? His mind raced with nightmares of a surrounded Reich unable to reassert its power.\n\nWith slow, deliberate breaths, the Führer calmed himself. This was a temporary setback, nothing more. The OFN had won the battle, but not the Cold War. This was all explainable by the Reich's still fragile position thanks to the traitors, no need to overthink it.

Every last one of you who would treat a man who has devoted his entire life to the cause of the Aryan people like this."\n\nThe guard looked inquiringly at Goring, asking for permission to simply end the madman's ravings. The Führer shook his head, "Let him say what he wants Franz. It's not like he can do anything anyways." A slight smile crept across the Führer's face as he spoke the last line, sure of his absolute power.\n\nHüttig continued to rant as he was led towards the courtyard's wall, "You are the traitors here, not me. I served the Reich, the ideals of National Socialism, what do you serve Herr Goring? Whatever the generals want? Whatever fills your pockets? How can the Aryan people have fallen so low as to follow such scum? The Reich does not deserve to survive with you degenerates at its head!"\n\nGoring grunted, the man simply would not shut up.

goering.707.desc:0 "Göring sat alone in his chambers, with but a tumbler of whiskey in his hand, silently contemplating the latest fiasco which Iberia once again revealed to the world. With the Italians out of Algeria and the government in Algiers at tatters, the Caudillos thought they could finallyclaim this land as theirs- and who better to govern this new fiefdom than their long-time lackey, Yves-Guerin Seraç, as leader of a French-minority military government? Göring smirked- this arrangement could go wrong in so many ways. And go wrong it did: Seraç didn't even bother to get comfortable in his new post before he denounced his overlords and established the State of Algeria as an independent entity on world politics. The idiots- they really need to learn to pick their subordinates.\n\nNot that he was in too enviable a position either. His own "subordinates" were already encircling the young warlord like hawks, fighting amongst themselves as to how to deal with him. Some believed that Seraç's clique would prove a valuable lapdog for the Reich, safeguarding the region's oil deposits and providing fresh untermenschen to throw in the front lines that would otherwise have been pure blooded Germans; others yet are disgusted at the idea of once again allowing collaborators to partake in Germany's moment of greatness, and insist on crushing all resistance and setting a new Reichskommisariat that will ensure all affairs are handled by proper German hands.\n\nSo Göring was left with a decision to make; a luxury he didn't get too often anymore. Personally he had way more important things to tend to right now than another shithole in Africa- and in a way, that made the prospect of just collaborating with Seraç and letting him do the dirty work very tempting. And if the man has an ounce of self preservation he'll surely cooperate. On the other hand, self preservation didn't stop him from betraying the very people who put him in power. And no matter how disillusioned he had grown through the decades, even old Hermann had to admit that asking an arrogant asshole in Africa for help like they needed him was just plain wrong."

The voice belonged to a uniformed Pied-Noir, who then proceeded to bow and show the way to him and the disgruntled ministers besides him. But Scheller was calm; he knew by now why people like Seraç had to show they were "too busy" for people like him.\n\nIndeed, as they stepped into the grandiosely decorated room, one would think they were in a palace; just like one would think, as they looked towards the Lion of Algeria, Yves-Guerin Seraç, sitting in his designer suit with the air of a man who had won every battle of his life, warmly welcoming them with a sardonic smile, that this man had no doubts about this day. A lot of work and money was poured into this illusion, surely. But these men hadn't come all the way from Germania to stare at gold candelabras and fine paintings; and as the pleasantries faded away and the negotiations began, it soon became very clear to all involved that Seraç's deck was empty.\n\n...which makes it not only desirable, but integral, that the Ministry of Economy shall retain complete autonomy to dictate and direct its own budget, with the Dinar as its default currency, which shall remain pegged to the French Franc and not to the Reichsmark" was how the longly worded but in reality fairly short list of Algerian demands concluded, which included the retention of the established French-styled government and all French ministers within it, the sovereignty of the armed forces, with German garrisons in Algeria supplementing instead of guiding the Algerian command, as well as direct state control of at least 50% of the exploration perimeters of the national oil fields. The carefully crafted and practiced document that constituted another piece to Seraç's masterful bluff, described in the most intrepid light what his true goal -or pledge- was: to please be left alone and retain whatever authority he could over his small fiefdom. All this futile act confirmed Scheller's suspicion: Seraç had no way out, and had nothing to resort to but to beg. With the tiniest and rarest of smiles creeping up on his lips, he opened his own briefcase with calm, precise movements."

"I understand that the remaining deposits might fall short of your 50% goal, Herr Seraç, but Herr Göring is willing to offer subsidies upwards of 10 million Reichsmarks per year as reparation. As for the lands occupied by foreign investors, we are willing to aid you in their immediate eviction. After all, the Einheitspakt should offer you much greater return in investment regarding all your exports." What he failed to mention was that the trading policies of the Einheitspakt towards Reichsprotektorats mandated that any and all exports shall be controlled through Germania, from where they will be sold as German goods.\n\nAnd that's only a small footnote in the book of things that were not explicitly mentioned in the contracts. Like how the part about national-controlled oil fields did not mention endless nights of drinking with the President and major shareholders of Sonatrach, who had agreed to set the groundwork for a merger with IG Farben. Or how the part autonomy of the government did not mention the heavy handed deals that were scheduled after their arrival of German observers, or the unexpected... empty seats that would arise during their stay. Or how the support role of the German garrisons did not mention the astronomical bribes to several high-ranking officers. For Kirchmann and his business associates, this was what one would call a hostile takeover; for Seraç, this was the loss of whatever control he managed over his state, and the transformation of his perceived role as ruthless dictator into that of a powerless scapegoat for the colony's misfortunes.\n\n"I believe that will be all for now, Monsieur Seraç" interceded Scheller, standing up from the table as Kirchmann was packing his papers. "It is getting late. In the following week you will have plentiful opportunities to converse with us on the details." He gave a tiny smirk, a rare occurence.

Sonatrach was reporting lower than expected throughput in the Hassi Messaoud deposits, land reforms were meeting resistance in Tlemcen, while the 150 million raise in military budget still had to be funded from somewhere. He reminisced the days that his contribution to his people was through actual blood and sweat, not paper sorting duty. But someone had to keep the state afloat- and there was no other man he'd trust that on but himself.\n\nHis train of thought was interrupted by the sudden sound of an incoming telegram- directly from his Chief of Navy. "GERMAN SHIPS SPOTTED -STOP- TWO BTLSHIPS EIGHT DSTRERS FOUR CRUISERS -STOP- THREE FIFTY KM FROM ORAN AS OF DAWN -STOP-" As of dawn? This was 11 in the morning! Why was he only hearing of this now? He was about to call his secretary and demand an audience with the Chief when he was received a call from her first. "What is it Marion? And it better be about this sack of shit that calls himself an ad-" "Excuse me General but, you might want to check the TV. Now." The TV? Seraç quickly opened his TV to the Télévision Algérienne channel. "...got away with their boats unscathed, but their lines cut, and able to do little but hurl obscenities at the German ships." announced the reporter as the screen shifted to an unkempt bearded man. "Those bastards think they can just barge in as if this is their damn playground! How has the General allowed this?" The news ticker read: "Kriegsmarine violates Algerian sea zone, harasses local fishermen".\n\nSeraç closed the TV, and violently broke the remote on his desk. Useless! Useless! All of them! How could he, after all the pain and sacrifice he had gone through, have surrounded himself with such useless people? People that could only inform him of an impending invasion AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWS! Or was it not stupidity? Was his staff intentionally withholding this information from him until it could no longer be held secret? He could not know- he had lost too many friends to tell anymore- and did not care. All he cared about was that the Germans were coming. And if he could not get the damn news on time, how could he hold his line?"

We can now officially proclaim the creation of Reichskommissariat Nordafrika, the first German foothold in the southern Mediterranean, and commence the process of actually exploiting the rich untapped resources and the crucial strategic location of the region.\n\nFriedrich von der Heydte already departed by plane from Germania this morning to assume his new post as Reichskommissar, along with seven Generalkommissars and several replacements for the recently vacated general secretariat. Within the following week they will be followed by the appropriate Garrisons and border divisions, three military engineer detachments, equipment and representatives from IG Farben, among others.\n\nWhile the scheduled reinforcement of the colony is fairly heavier than typical of other RKs, especially ones of this size, and their absence from the Fatherland will be noticeable for some time, this will hopefully allow Nordafrika to serve as the coordinative and administrative center for all our future ambitions in Egypt and the Maghreb."

The culprit was the Pied-Noir who had initially welcomed them -Julien, was it?-, with a pair of handcuffs on his belt. "Monsieur Seraç has requested your immediate leave" he stated. "Please do not resist." Scheller looked outside the doorway to see the rest of his mission on the same situation as him. One of them was being unceremoniously dragged out, presumably unconscious. "Just let me light up a cigarette first" he announced, stoically reaching into his coat pocket.\n\n"What the hell is happening? I demand answers!" came a voice belonging to the youngest of the group, in handcuffs and short of temper. "I already gave you one, sir" responded the guard accompanying him. "The General decided that he no longer required your presence here." This only served to further infuriate the minister. "This is bullshit! Who does he think he is, bossing diplomatic envoys around like that?" He was now screaming right in front of the guard. "And the only one who gets to tell me when my work is done is my Führer, not a random negro lac-" his rant was interrupted by a loud bang, followed by the envoy screaming on the floor, blood gushing from his foot. "My name is Pierre" said his guard unfazed, as if he wasn't holding a smoking handgun. "My father lived his entire life in Bourgogne before your Führer came." He then turned to his shocked crowd. "Is any other of you distinguished gentlemen planning to pose a security threat? Non? I figured so."\n\nAs the mission walked their way to their exit, Scheller briefly eyed his guard, cigarette still in mouth. "You allowed your subordinate to discharge a firearm at an envoy of the Reich. But you didn't actually care about the slur. Not enough to stage a crisis over it." He looked forward again, waiting briefly for a response that never came. "Neither did he; his demeanor was too calm." He puffed a ring of smoke. "It was Seraç himself who ordered this. He wanted you to be violent and ruthless. He wants to show he fears no one. And you still didn't have the balls to do it without being provoked."\n\n"And what difference does it make to you?" growled Julien through his teeth, as his captive nonchalantly spit out his cigarette and stomped it on the hallway carpet."

They run the factories and offices of our empire, and the eruption of strikes recently has put a spanner in the works. Naturally, the first reaction is to send in the Orpo to have their way with the strikers and put the fear of the Führer into them, but perhaps a more diplomatic solution can be reached. Some token concessions should be enough to placate them before we tighten the reins once more.\n\nWhile we may not like to admit it, in many cases other hands can perform their jobs just as well as German ones do. Outsourcing their jobs to foreign workers would put the strikers in their place and ensure the work gets done. Alternatively the tasks could be delegated to the slaves - though we have no guarantee of how well they will perform them."

Naturally the massacre of innocent citizens of the Reich demands a response in force, the slaves once again shackled and reprisals taken, but there exist options on how this is to be achieved.\n\nThe Heer are always champing at the bit for their next fight and they are better equipped than anyone to deal with an armed uprising, but allowing them to take credit for another victory may do more harm than good, and set a dangerous precedent for the future. The Orpo have an opportunity to intervene and maintain their authority against the Heer, but this in turn would snub our glory-seeking generals.\n\nNaturally the local workers are enraged at the murder of their comrades, and in turn fear their own slaves will turn against them. They could be encouraged to take up arms and drive the rioters back to their camps."

 goering.803.desc:0 "The advantage of slaves is they don't require much training, just a firm hand. They don't cost much to keep, and you don't have to be nice to them. The disadvantage is they have little interest in mastering their craft - only avoiding beatings. This reliance on slaves is beginning to show - the quality of German goods has experienced a noticeable drop, and while unemployment and early retirement remains high there is an increasing drought of skilled workers.\n\nThis quality drop is a symptom of a problem that we are unable to directly address. We must patch as best we can, forcing a diversification of the economy by subsidising technical educations and discouraging our workers from resting on their laurels. Otherwise, this reliance could become a crutch."

The Wehrmacht have the right to secure their own contracts in times of need, which they take to mean they can buy an arms factory and give it to a retired officer. They are vital in procuring the Reich's resources, and use this leverage to acquire shares in mines and steel mills and positions on the boards of every company that goes east to the Reichskomissariats. These same companies extend down and down, allowed their influence to extend throughout the economic sphere.\n\nWhile the Wehrmacht is ostensibly loyal, their influence should be checked. Granting loans to smaller businesses outside the military's influence would give them a fighting chance against the oligopolies that dominate our industry. Alternatively we could grant the same contracts that the Heer and Kriegsmarine throw about so carelessly to a foreign company, and attempt to starve the Wehrmacht of their child-businesses."

Investment from Iberia, Scandinavia and Britain makes up a considerable portion of the same war machine that feeds the Wehrmacht, but they insist that foreign influences be driven out, and German businesses be left to German businessmen.\n\nBowing to the whims of our generals will no doubt deter any future investors, but their support is far too valuable to us."

Given the military's power, the possibility of actual economic reform is out of the question. We can either bandage the wound with affordable loans to the population, or ride it out and hope for the best. "

President Abs warns of the dire economic consequences if the banks are unable to raise the interest rates, complaining that narrow-minded men like Schörner have no mind for economics or the financial system.\n\nThough we are benefitting from the new interest rates, the growing control of the militarists is concerning, and perhaps President Abs' warnings of doom and gloom have some validity..."

Not one of the futile untermenschen causes that have plagued the Reich, but a heroic German Resistance. A resistance of heroes, relegated to the shadows. The Mähren-based resistance is led by one Rudolf Toussaint; a veteran of the First Great War who has since dutifully served his country during the Second World War, and this loyalty was unfazed by the succession of Führer Göring. He is the perfect candidate to lead our operations on the inside.\n\n"Herr Schörner. It is good to hear from you". Toussaint grimaced his peers in the room upon hearing the gravelly Bavarian accent on the other end of the line. Unsurprisingly. he found himself on the receiving end of a barrage of orders which his assistant hastily wrote down, whilst Toussaint could do nothing but agree. Eventually Schörner was done, and the call ended, without the resistance giving a single point of note back to the commander.\n\nThe room awoke in a calm, but passionate, debate. Toussaint's old guard emphasised caution in the face of Germany and wanted to toe Schörner's line, whilst the newer officers promoted after the fall of the garrison wanted to try and make contact with a general who would actually listen to the resistance. Nothing came of the debate. Everyone stuck to their positions, and Toussaint eventually dismissed the entire room. No good would ever come of divisions.\n\nQuietly sitting at his desk, Toussaint looked over his plans, then over Schörner's plans. Not much use in his own plans now.

There had to be something of worth in here, since there was nothing in the rest of the village; surely the SS couldn't have sent it all back to Prag?\n\nFor the next hour, he searched every drawer and found little. A few pictures; siblings? Loved ones? Could the SS even feel love anymore? He found one pocket watch, presumably an heirloom. Might as well keep that one, he supposed. There were a few books, mostly filled with the ravings of that lunatic Himmler. Rudolf put them to one side, so it would be easier to burn them later. These men lived with next to nothing; no cards, no memories of home, just their uniforms and their hatred. He was beginning to feel frustrated by the time he reached the last drawer, before tugging it and realising it was locked. A grin spread over his face as he took the butt of his rifle and slammed it into the drawer, which promptly burst open.\n\nInside the drawer was a wealth of jewellery, gold, gemstones, rings, every precious thing that man could create. Rudolf smiled. He had found what he came for."

Now he was dead, and for all his boasting over the strength of his SS, they had proven weak. Truthfully, Schörner loved being on the offensive like this. Petty despots like Daleuge would scatter before him as he swept through Europe, crushing all those who dared resist his might.\n\n'Herr Schörner'. His assistant's voice was firm. Schörner was always sure to pick out assistants that wouldn't fear him; fear was inevitably followed by incompetence. 'We've had a series of reports about SS partisans who refuse to give up the fight. Our divisions across Böhmen-Mähren are waiting for orders. Should we hunt them down?'\n\nThe wind on the balcony picked up slightly, rippling through the swastika that now hung above the headquarters. Schörner's face did not stir. Finally, he spoke.\n\n'Hunt them to the last man. Spare no one. Keep three of our divisions stationed here, assisting the garrison. Delegate them to another commander.' A slight trace of a smile crept over Schörner's face; it wouldn't be perceptible to most, but this was a significant display of emotion for the orthodox general. 'The rest of the divisions will leave the day after tomorrow, along with ourselves. We're moving onto the next target.' Schörner hesitated. 'If they find Daleuge, tell me. I'd like to see him. I think he might be able to tell us something about our friends in Burgundy.' The assistant nodded, and left."

 goering.904.d:0 "The despot of Ostland. The aspiring German. An unknown quantity through and through, Michel Vituska is not a man we ever wanted to deal with. But the reality is that he rules Ostland, and instead of simply agitating for a war, he has completely shocked our diplomats by coming cap in hand to the Reich offering to be our vassal.\n\nThe nerve! An untermenschen under the Reich? That would be a stain that cannot be wiped from our nation! The reaction from the hardcore militarists are one and the same. We cannot trust him, and the only way we should be even considering dealing with Vituska is with a bullet! With the new focus of the Reich being conquest to make us great again, it seems as though this would be in keeping with the policy we promised Germany.\n\nBut another band of less hardline officers has suggested the unthinkable; accept the proposal, undermine Vituska's authority, then eventually integrate Ostland again. While this seems a wild breach of the militarist belief that won us the civil war, there is an element of reason in their plan; we can spare Ostland from a second wave of destruction that would no doubt leave the colony far behind the rest of the Reich in industrial strength and Germanisation.\n\nThe final decision rests on the shoulders of the Führer. Will we take Vituska's offer, or is war the only way of dealing with such arrogance?"

Of course, this exchange will be far more useful for us than for Vituska, and his army is as much of an unknown quantity as he is so any information on their weaknesses will bevital for keeping him trustworthy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to undermine the militarists, the Führer's closest allies and his backers in the civil war. But Herr Schörner is beginning to believe he holds the keys to the Reich. If we were to reduce his officers to mere diplomats to Vituska's regime, it would reduce his power in the metropole and send a message that the Führer still holds the reins. Schörner himself does not seem shaken by rumours of this proposal; perhaps he has finally learned his place!\n\nAlternatively, we could simply send neutral officers to take part in the exchange. Vituska would possibly hand over better information if this were the case, as it certainly helps to negotiate with men who aren't openly calling for your blood; but Vituska is utterly unpredictable, so who can say what he truly wants. This would leave more power in the hands of the militarists, but isn't that what we fought for?"

This situation cannot continue.\n\nWe may not trust Vituska entirely, but he is working with us now. Ostland is his realm, and so he is the man who must protect it. If we sent his desperately under equipped forces weapons then we may be able to achieve true lasting stability in Ostland and root out the partisans once and for all.\n\nOf course, it isn't that simple. If we were to send Vituska as many arms as we can spare, his forces would likely be more effective and could even defend themselves against threats from Moskowien; it would also help build Vituska's trust for us. However, this is putting our arms in the hands of a dangerously unpredictable man, and perhaps it would be best if we only send enough arms to put down the partisan menace, not enough to defy our will."

Furthermore evidence suggests a conversion of the industrial base to both shipping equipment and equipment geared towards partisan warfare.\n\nFurther reprisals and massacres are expected and called for in the few pamphlets distributed.

While Germany had been busy tearing itself apart, the jackals in the SS had leapt onto the similarly stricken corpse of Ostland, and now a black tumor grew on the side of the Reich. Invasion was a no brainer- it had always been the plan to integrate Ostland into the Reich one day- but it pained Göring to need to waste German lives on a territory that was once an easy landgrab. He needed to make it easier- the less lives lost, the better.\n\nAn idea came to mind. Certainly not all Germans in Ostland were fans of Jeckeln's maniacal regime. After all, were they not just fighting him? They may not have much in common, but something that could generally unite Germans of all walks of life was their distaste for the SS. Certainly, Göring and his men could find some veterans brave enough to rally themselves for the return of order and the purge of the madness that the SS brought.\n\nThe idea crystallized in his head, and Göring smiled. Remer and his men would infiltrate the Ostland border, searching for militarist contacts. Once there, they would form their own units, ready to sew chaos behind enemy lines. These infiltrations would not only make the war a thousand times more manageable, but would shorten it drastically. Besides, Göring reasoned, even if the plan did not fully pan out, it would rid him of Remer for at least some time."

Should he ever turn against us, there is no doubt we can put him down. Along with undermining Vituska, the exchange has also been successful in cutting down militarist power, with Schörner's hardline influence notably diminished.\n\nDespite the success of our plan in undermining them both, neither Schörner nor Vituska seem to see through our plot. In fact, they are both enthusiastic about continuing the exchange, and Vituska has sent a request to keep Schörner's officers remaining in Ostland longer to supervise a new training program. This arrangement benefits us the most; but the wholehearted embracing of our plan by the people it should impact the worst has aroused suspicion amongst a few in the government."

The trade has also been mutually beneficial on the surface, with each of our armies now better prepared to fight together against outside threats.\n\nOur officers are returning home right now. Despite the fact we appeased them by sending neutral officers, Schörner's militarists are protesting the recall and stating that they could've retrieved more vital information and made Vituska even more vulnerable. It seems no matter what we do, they're going to protest. Perhaps it is time to stop feeding Schörner's beast, and instead start defying it?"

Perhaps we didn't see how he could possibly manifest an opportunity out of the small amount more influence we gave him; perhaps we even thought it would cut some heads from the hydra. Whatever we thought, we were wrong. Today Schörner's officers launched a coup in Ostland, attempting to seize power from Vituska and hand it over to the hardline militarists.\n\nPerhaps it was fortunate for us that Vituska was already a few steps ahead. He was able to put down the coup with remarkable efficiency, and now all the officers we sent are dead. Of course, Schörner quickly went to cover up the coup failure, so we have little information about the planning of the coup; but this has weakened him severely, despite also showing the flaws in the intelligence of the central government."

A perfunctory arm raise, and the feldmarschall is already in front of the desk.\n\n"Mein Führer!" he begins with his usual boisterous countenance, "the time has come to reclaim our rightful lands to the South!

As the general, now visibly incensed at being contradicted by his superior, opens his mouth to reply, the Führer closes the discussion: "Von Krosigk has always been a loyal servant of the Reich. By proclaiming his neutrality he has saved the Bohemian industrial core from being captured by the degenerate SS, don't you agree?"\n\n"Yes, but-"\n\n"Then, if you understand, there is no need for an invasion. I won't send Aryans to die fighting other Aryans while we can achieve the same result in a civilized manner.

Göring's voice was almost nostalgic, "you were still Finanzminister, weren't you?"\n\n"It must have been at least ten years, before I became Reichsprotektor" von Krosigk had the same tinge in his tone, thinking about different times, when political enemies were still that, and didn't try to have you shot for treason, or begin a civil war.\n\n"Indeed! How much time has passed, my friend... things have been tough, though I'm sure you too had your own enemies to fight in Bohemia... pesky SS, always trying to snivel their way in. You have been extremely competent, just as you have always been, a great resource for our even greater Reich!"\n\nHis guest nods politely, part sincere and part calculating, as he has learned to be. He knows, however, that reminiscing isn't the only reason for his presence at Carinhall, and he isn't disappointed.\n\n"This is why, despite Schörner's opinions, I've decided that you'll be appointed gauleiter when Bohemia is reintegrated into the Vaterland"\n\nOf course. That was the reason for the invitation: von Krosigk has known, ever since the end of the civil war, that the Bohemian industries would be highly coveted by the resurgent Reich.

The men we had posted in Ostland were bloodthirsty militarists; they do not wish for a reasonable approach to conquest, merely a thrilling ransacking of countries that brings them fame and glory. We must now keep them in check once again, and ensure their anger remains pointed at the enemies of the Reich."

############# GERMAN INTEGRATION OF OSTLAND

goering.908.d:0 "Naturally, the first and easiest of Ostland's territories to integrate have been those which were majority-German before we even arrived. The Baltic Germans were the most immediate and grateful beneficiaries of our rule and quickly adapted to life under the Reich. Natalist programs and family unifications, encouraged in the years following the liberation, helped greatly to expand their numbers to the point where they now comprise the majority of the population in Lithuania. With Balts reduced to a minority, the Führer has proclaimed these areas to be pacified and ready for complete integration into the Reich, further expanding the formal borders of the Reich proper into the former Reichskommissariat. "The legacy of the Teutonic Order," the Führer stated in a press release, "Has finally been fulfilled""

What followed the conquest of Belarus was the emergence of a distinctly colonial German culture: fierce, strong and hardy. The Ost-Germans have brought the virility of the Aryan race to this backwater, sowing the fertile seeds of the German people in the rich farmlands and verdant forests. With plenty of colonists present, the racially acceptable natives being rapidly assimilated and the remainder pushed to the fringes of society, the Führer has seen fit to formally integrate these parts of Ostland into the Reich. "The Ost-Germans are the truest children of the Aryan race in the east," he explained to a crowd of eager reporters today. "It is long past time that their efforts in bringing the light of civilization to the frontier are recognised.""

goering.910.d:0 "The question of how far the current efforts to integrate Ostland should go has been a matter of great contention within the colonial authorities. Today, the Führer finally stepped in, declaring that with the majority Baltic- and Ost-German lands integrated, the Reich's grip on these formerly troublesome lands is secure enough that there is no further need to worry about the possibility of further resistance from the Balts, Slavs and Estonians who remain in the colony. Accordingly, the aggressive pursuit of Germanization can slow down to a more measured pace. The Führer's reasoning is simple: with their will to fight repeatedly broken and a strong German presence established, the natives pose no threat at this point and their assimilation or displacement is so certain that the Reich can finally afford to ease up, redirecting resources to more pressing matters. The integration of the remaining parts of Ostland, be they majority-German or native, is to commence immediately and without hesitation. Our race will win out in these areas soon enough."

############# GOERING DRECHSLER INTERACTIONS

goering.911.t:0 "The Truth About Drechsler"
goering.911.desc:0 ""Speak," said Göring, eyeing his secretary over the great oaken desk in the Führer's office. Noticing the young man's trembling hands, he chuckled. "Erich, you aren't addressing me in front of the Field Marshal. I won't take offence from speaking your mind if you have my permission to do so."\n\nErich took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. "Yes, my Führer." He steadied his hands and adjusted his glasses, looking down at the mock-up headlines proposed to run in 'Der Sturmer' and 'Volkischë Beobachter'. "OTTO DRECHSLER - LANDRUT'S FINAL SURPRISE?" read one. "WHO BOUGHT THE GARRISON?" said another.\n\n"Good enough for the proles, my Führer," Erich said, scratching at a scab on his poorly-shaven chin. "But if you... uh, if you don't mind my saying, I'm not sure that the enlisted men will believe it." He shifted his gaze to the floor, awaiting Göring's violent castigation, but it never came.\n\nInstead, he heard the Führer's leather-backed chair creak as its occupant leaned back and tapped an idle finger on the desk. "Hmph. True enough," he muttered after a pause. The chair groaned as Göring sat upright with a sigh. "I didn't think it was much good myself, personally. Burn it, then arrange a meeting with the head of the Gestapo as soon as possible. Perhaps he has some ideas for how to deal with this nuisance of a man."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," said Erich, hastily turning and making his way out of the spacious office, heading straight for the small incinerator kept in the back of the archive room. The Gestapo would probably be a better bet, he thought. They were tremendously skilled when it came to finding dirt on people, real or imagined..."

goering.912.t:0 "Future Investments"
goering.912.desc:0 "Hermann Göring has never been a financially astute man, but any of his friends could tell you how good he is at spending money. Jewelry, ancient artifacts, tailor-made uniforms, gold-plated firearms, ceremonial weapons... and that's just the stuff that he can't eat or drink. An evening at the Führer's private residence, Carinhall, is a seemingly endless parade of the finest gourmet meats, pastries and desserts prepared by the Reich's most talented chefs. Should the Führer deign to bring up anything from his wine cellar, he could choose from thousands of bottles of the rarest vintages that Europe has to offer.\n\nToday, however, the Führer is taking less personal economic matters into consideration. Reichskommissariat Ostland has returned to the fold and its economy is recovering well, but many prominent Ostlanders have been petitioning Berlin for additional investment. A dose of cash delivered on the Führer's order would certainly help create more jobs and send a positive message to private investors, but there is another matter to consider: the loyalty of Drechsler's officer corps. A fair number have been brought on-side while nobody was watching following the civil war, but perhaps it's worth attempting to secure the loyalty of a few more. Many of them are contemptuous of Drechsler, a known coward. The more men personally loyal to Göring rather than Schörner, the more secure the current government will be against any future coup attempts.\n\nOf course, we might need those Reichsmarks for a rainy day, right?"

Though the media has no inkling of where the money came from, the people who leaked it - namely, a number of Schörner's underlings who apparently caught wind of the Führer's attempts to buy Drechsler's men - the Wehrmacht undoubtedly does. Gestapo surveillance personnel have reported that the Reichskommissar and Field Marshal met this morning, likely to discuss a punitive response to Göring's failed attempt at turning their men against them.\n\nGöring's blunder has deeply impacted his standing with his powerful allies. This minor incident might not come to much, but it has revealed the Führer's vulnerability and lack of political acumen. He has no need to fear the possibility of a coup over something so minor as bribery, but now the Wehrmacht will be on full alert for further attempts to corrupt its men."

This, your Führer is more than aware of. However, he is also certain that anyone reading this memorandum is equally aware of the reasons behind the decision to invade and depose the pretender Reichskommissar. It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Otto-Heinrich Drechsler was corrupt and in the employ of the same nefarious forces who reduced Ostland to a state of civil war. The fact that this man was a long-serving member of our great establishment does not excuse his betrayal of the Reich and the German race. Loyalty and trust is measured by one's dedication to the Führer and the willingness to obey unquestioningly. That Drechsler refused the Führer's direct order to stand down from his unlawfully claimed post should be reason enough for all to join in condemnation of his actions and purge his memory from the rolls of the NSDAP.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that nobody expected treason from such a widely-known and well-respected man - an ex-Gauleiter and veteran of the Sturmabteilung, no less. The Führer recognises the reality of Drechsler's popularity and wishes to ameliorate your concerns by assuring each and every one of you that he acted only out of necessity, not for any petty political gain. The Führer is above such temptations and has only the greater good of the Reich in mind when acting in his capacity as father to the nation. It is his sincerest wish that harmony and concord should reign amongst the armed forces - a wish that we can all work together to fulfil now that the dark days of civil conflict are past.\n\nHeil Göring!"

############# GOERING STAHLECKER INTERACTIONS

goering.921.t:0 "The Stahlecker Issue"
goering.921.desc:0 ""You haven't met Stahlecker, have you?" The question was muffled, with Erich, Göring's secretary, rummaging through a filing cabinet for the celebratory brandy. "The man's a dyed-in-the-wool National Socialist, loyal as they come." Göring didn't respond. He simply sat and stared ahead with hands folded, clearly lost in thought and oblivious to the one-sided conversation taking place. "I'm sure you wouldn't get along with him," Erich continued, "But that wouldn't matter. If you told him to jump off a cliff, he'd do it solely out of respect for your office."\n\nAfter a minute more of awkward silence, Erich returned to Göring's desk, grinning and holding up the 25-year-old brandy that the Führer had pocketed during a visit to Paris in 1940. Göring didn't seem to notice, continuing to stare past his secretary even as the bright-eyed young clerk poured out a glass for his boss. "My Führer?" he asked, noticing Göring's blank expression.\n\n"Hmm? Oh, thank you, Erich," Göring muttered, closing his worn fingers around the cool, hard glass. "No... no, I haven't met Stahlecker. He was an SS man during the war, so I never had the pleasure." A twinge of worry shot across his face, and he raised the glass to down his drink in a single go, savouring the memories of less complicated times that it brought up. Minutes passed, during which Erich could only stand in place, awkwardly fiddling with the bottle's cap. "Give me another, boy," he finally grunted. "The Field Marshal is coming to dispense some 'advice' soon. Let's make sure we're properly fortified for it, eh?""

Too stressed to celebrate, he can only lean back into his creaking chair and relax as the stress of the past 24 hours evaporates. Stahlecker, ever the loyalist, had accepted his offer to negotiate and allow aid into Ostland. The Führer's feelings - and the subsequent celebratory drinking - are mirrored throughout the Reich. The state media, still a muddled mess after the civil war, had been pushing contradictory headlines regarding the Ostland situation for weeks, but by the afternoon of the day in which the Führer put out a statement to the press, every paper, TV news show and radio broadcast delivered the same message: No More Civil War.\n\nHowever, far from the temporary warmth and peace to be found in Carinhall that night, OKW headquarters seethes with treasonous spite. Peace? Peace, with the great Otto-Heinrich Drechsler murdered and Ostland in the feeble grip of a Bormannite? Peace, with a man who would rather laze about and lord over idle subhumans? Peace, with a man who was by all accounts a coward, a traitor and an indolent old conservative?\n\nNot on the Field Marshal's watch."

There would, many realised, be a lot more shouting later in the day if that outburst was any indication.\n\nHours later, Field Marshal Schörner downed the phone, hooked directly to the Chancellery, with a satisfied smile. He had known, of course, about Göring's peaceful overtures towards Stahlecker. For a time, he had been concerned - it was an open secret that Göring had no interest in so-called 'pointless' wars or anything beyond enriching himself and enjoying the perks of his office. This, however, was the first step towards changing that. It would take some time, yes - but if he were to be pulled deep enough into the Field Marshal's machinations, he would soon find himself too bogged down to even think about defying the will of the armed forces again. Then, and only then, would the Reich's invincibility be ensured."

The few brave enough to attempt to eavesdrop in the thirty seconds that the men spent with the Führer heard no exchange of words; no indignant shouts or threats of arrest, nor snide, practiced military snobbery. When the officers left, the only apparent change was the absence of an envelope, stamped with the mark of OKW, that had previously been carried in a worn and scarred hand.\n\nGöring had been expecting such an outrageous move in response to his decision to pursue peace with Stahlecker, however. There had been no exchange of words for precisely that reason; the Panzergrenadiers had their orders, and Göring had been informed of their arrival hours in advance. With all the pieces so clearly laid out, there was no need for words - only a silent understanding.\n\nThe letter was clear in its wording. Cold, uncaring and professional - straight from the desk of Field Marshal Schörner. "Army High Command," it read, "Is deeply concerned by recent decisions made by the Führer. As the unquestionable defenders of the Greater Germanic Reich, we wish to express our hesitance to endorse the Führer's refusal to employ a practical solution to the renegade colony of Ostland. We recommend the immediate issue of an ultimatum demanding total submission and compliance to the self-proclaimed authority therein, under threat of military intervention. We expect that the Führer will wholeheartedly endorse this measure and carry it out post-haste.\n\nSieg heil!"

That such an ardently loyal National Socialist would defy a direct order from the Führer - any Führer - is an unexpected setback, but now a line has been drawn in the sand between the Reich and its rogue colony. Any action taken against Ostland, military or otherwise, will now be legally justified and much more palatable to the Reich's citizens. Now, Göring is under pressure not just from OKW, but from many civilians in his administration and cabinet. A self-proclaimed Reichskommissar has refused his orders and set his men on a belligerent stance against us - how can we possibly react with anything but swift and bloody retribution?\n\nWith rather pointed words, apparently. So claims Göring, at least. Still set on avoiding bloodshed despite Stahlecker's insult, the Führer has expressed his belief that the renegade can be brought to heel. His logic is sound, at least: Stahlecker, as a Bormannite, values Germanic unity above all else. The shedding of Aryan blood is anathema to him and it was a wonder that he even found the willpower to push through the Ostland civil war in the first place. Yet, deep down, he is no true soldier; he lacks a military awareness of war's realities. Demonstrate to him in no uncertain terms what war with the Reich would entail, and he will fold. The Führer has received a certain amount of support for this idea, even from elements of the Wehrmacht, but wonders aloud if it's worth the effort."

Concerns have been expressed by certain ill-educated economists that the demand for Ostland's economy to be placed in the hands of Germania's bureaucrats was a step too far and that it will have disastrous consequences for the colony, but the Führer is happy to be done with the whole messy affair. The Wehrmacht, too, has stated their gratitude to Stahlecker and the Führer for their admirable effort in overcoming ideological differences to ensure a better future for the Reich's favorite colony.\n\nAnd yet, there's a sense that we could have done better."

All he does, he does in the name of security, peace and brotherhood. If he must unleash the armed forces of the Reich upon Ostland, then he will not hesitate to do so, even if the burden weighs heavily upon his heart.

During breakfast, the Führer was interrupted by the arrival of a report from one of the staging grounds near the border with Ostland. Apparently, an entire Panzer battalion decided to conduct some 'reconnaissance' on their own initiative. They didn't report anything unusual upon returning to base, but one of our infantry patrols reported seeing smoke rising from a Lithuanian village just over the border. Recon aircraft quickly confirmed that the village of approximately 400 civilians had been razed to the ground, with no signs of life remaining besides some wandering cattle. This particular village had not previously been of any interest to us due to its lack of defenses - Schörner claims provocation by partisans and the Ostland garrison, however, stating that his men were defending themselves.\n\nThe Führer is outraged by this impropriety, but that may well have been the intended result. There is little publicly available evidence of our forces' involvement in the attack, so certain elements of the militarist cabinet are urging him to turn the incident into a propaganda offensive to aid a coup against Stahlecker which is currently in the works (which is the first that the Führer has heard of such a thing). The Führer, for his part, would rather just pretend the incident didn't happen at all, to avoid any disruption to his war of words with Stahlecker - he is certain that his plan will still bear fruit.\n\nThe army, however, makes no secret of the fact that they bear responsibility, and is pushing for the Führer to authorize a second raid to undermine Stahlecker further. Why Schörner would advocate for two different solutions at the same time is anyone's guess."

Our pilots fought bravely and with great skill, but were outnumbered by ten to two. A loss was inevitable, with Lieutenant Wilhelm Kurtz being shot down over hostile territory. Thankfully his wingman made it back to base, but the damage is done. Even as the Luftwaffe mourns this loss, their allies in the Heer are baying for blood, now that there is proof of Stahlecker's hostile intentions.\n\nThe Führer is now under immense pressure to issue the invasion order, as continuing with attempts to intimidate Stahlecker will now infuriate the Luftwaffe as well as the Heer.

How the Führer learned of the plot is unknown, but the assumption is that Stahlecker himself was involved.\n\nYet there has been no move on the Führer's part, nor a counterattack by the militarists. The officers were permitted to leave the building, thoroughly shaken but unharmed. Whatever they said to the Führer, it was enough to give him momentary pause. Could it be that he has resolved not to take action against the plotters, despite their gross insubordination and betrayal of one of their own? Or is he merely considering the options laid out before him?\n\nThe Führer alone knows the true stakes of his situation. The militarists are dangerous, yes, but their most recent plot may have gone too far even for their ambition.

Stahlecker has promised that mutual recognition of legitimacy is all he ever sought, and that he will serve the Reich "...faithfully, for life, and unto death."

The recent disagreements between the Reich and her colony are the result of unfortunate circumstances and the realities of the day. It is tragic that loss of life occurred as a consequence, but with this agreement a great deal more bloodshed has been avoided.

Piles of weapons, vacated bunkers and abandoned motor pools line every highway and no small number of garrison troops have simply vanished into the woods, either heading for home or abandoning their cause altogether. Their fate makes no difference now.\n\nStahlecker and his staff are now heading by plane for Germania, no longer employees of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Indeed, the Reichskommissariat no longer exists as of this moment; now formally dissolved as a separate entity, all Aryan Ostlanders are now full citizens of the Reich and the colony's treasury has been snatched up by the Führer's financiers. A number of economists have expressed concern at this seizure of the colony, claiming that it is 'unprepared for integration'. This is nonsense, of course - the Führer has great expertise in economic matters. There may be some teething issues, true, but give it a few days and the colony will be more prosperous than ever."

The invasion can no longer be stopped, despite Göring's best efforts. Any order to hold fast would likely fall on deaf ears, as Schörner is past tolerating attempts at 'peace' and 'unity' for the time being.\n\nWar returns to Ostland; it will be swift, brutal and merciless. Anyone who knows the lay of the land and the disposition of the Wehrmacht could accurately predict that tens of thousands are likely to die, innocent or otherwise.

While no doubt amusing to the rank and file, he has a surprising amount of sway; not over Stahlecker, who remains as stoic as ever, but over the people of Ostland. The last thing we want in the event of successful negotiations is for the Ostlanders to rise up against our rule and render the whole peace process completely moot.\n\nThe Abwehr has pointed out that with the chaotic situation in Ostland, it would be child's play to remove this obnoxious individual from the equation. Even better, we have a man in Riga - a survivor of Drechsler's cabinet - who has spent the past few months schmoozing with his former enemies, who are unaware of his past loyalties. By pulling a few strings, passing fistfuls of marks to the right people and disposing of the troublesome individual in question, the Abwehr is confident that we can get our man into Stahlecker's confidence and start chipping away at the resistance from within.\n\n"

Of course, it was apparently too little too late for the Wehrmacht, who have once again called for an invasion of Ostland.

Those few are now vindicated, as barring the reconstruction work going on throughout the city, Riga is more or less indistinguishable from how it was in those blissful days of peace. The same is true for the entirety of Ostland - everywhere, the garrison and Orpo are back on their routine patrols (though with fresh faces among them), farmers tend their crops and factories begin to churn out goods for sale back in the Reich. Even the non-Aryan natives seem mildly appreciative of the situation; they might be on the fringes of society, but at least they aren't being shot at by the SS or murdered by partisans for not being anti-German enough.\n\nIn his office, refurbished with new furniture from Germania befitting his now-official status, Stahlecker allowed himself to recline with a satisfied smile. This is what it was for - all the unpleasant things he did in the SS, the civil war, the tense negotiations with a Führer he had little in common with. This vision of peace and stability, so thoroughly devalued in recent years, made it all worthwhile. Perhaps Göring would drag the Reich through years of war and pointless attempts and conquest, but the Ostland Stahlecker had fought so hard for would endure. Of this, he was certain."

Things escalated substantially this week as he went on a long-winded and exceptionally crass rant while being interviewed by a Swedish journalist, with a number of choice insults, vile epithets and insinuations about the sexual proclivities of the Reich's leadership all being printed word-for-word in the Stockholm evening newspapers. He has apparently escaped any kind of discipline for this.\n\nThe Führer's response to this story was little more than a world-weary sigh. He had expected a phone call from Schörner demanding retribution to avenge the insult, but it was several hours before such a call came through. On the other end of the line was Schörner's aide, who hesitantly stated that the Field Marshal "...favors immediate military action to, uh... to avenge this insult and - what was it, sir? - uh, and the sullying of the image of the Reich's glorious leaders."\n\nEveryone is a little confused at this point. Schörner has called for war yet again, but with uncharacteristic hesitation. Perhaps even he recognises the inanity of going to war over some foul language?"

A large but inefficient gunpowder charge packed with shrapnel and nails, it had done just enough damage to the unfortunate mailmen that both would be crippled for life. The van was mostly intact, but several passers-by were hit by flying projectiles and left screaming and writhing on the pavement. Ambulances arrived promptly, but despite the relatively low number of casualties the attack has shaken the people of Riga. At this point, natives and Germans alike yearn for peace - why strike now? Who would wish for more bloodshed at this point?\n\nGöring is concerned that Stahlecker does not have the resources to handle the threat of an active terrorist cell. Allowing him to try and handle it independently might have disastrous consequences for peace, especially if key figures in the Ostdeal become the targets of assassins. To this end, the Führer has attempted to dispatch the Abwehr, only to be rebuffed. Stahlecker claims that the Orpo and the garrison can handle the situation, and that an Abwehr presence in Riga would constitute a violation of the Ostdeal. He's obviously just being stubborn, but might this be a sign of more trouble to come?"

A young Latvian, he refused to state whether he acted alone, how he acquired the bomb or who, if anyone, put him up to it. His stoicism endured even through enhanced interrogation techniques. With little more to do, the terrorist was turned over to the Ostland Orpo. The Abwehr wished to simply shoot him out of hand, but records show that he is an Aryan native, entitling him to a proper trial not too dissimilar from those enjoyed by full-blooded German citizens. A minor loss for us, but at least justice will be served.\n\nGöring is happy to have avoided conflict with Stahlecker over this, and the Abwehr is very pleased to have done their job well and without interference from the Ostland authorities, but every successful negotiation sets off another round of grousing from the Wehrmacht. The Ostdeal must conclude, and quickly."

Göring's response was simply to sigh, rub his temples and dismiss his secretary before taking a long, long swig of brandy. At this point, he has to wonder: does Stahlecker enjoy this? Beneath the neat spectacles and the stone-faced expression of a model Bormannite, is there some manner of Judeo-Bolshevik devil, seeking to torment and subvert the Reich at every turn? Why string the Führer along? Why make him sit through all these negotiations only to turn around and become a stick-in-the-mud over THIS of all things? Why not just let the people with the best of intentions do their jobs? Wouldn't that be better than just jerking them around and... and...\n\nGöring sighed again, downed the rest of the bottle, and awaited the angry phone call from Schörner."

This is by far one of the most confounding letters to ever cross Göring's desk- if we thought that nations like Poland had no chance, a nation as small and weak as Slovakia will fall within a matter of days to the German war machine.\n\nIn any case, such a response, though unexpected, was planned for. A Heer army lines the border, waiting on our word to invade and crush these rebellious upstarts for good. With the comical difference in size, training, and equipment between our army and theirs, this operation should take no longer than a week to complete.

Slowly, however, the sense of dread was replaced with confusion as Hermann continued to dance around the point, asking questions about his combat record, his experience, his education- it began to dawn on Foertsch that this may not be a punishment, but a job interview.\n\n"Well, Foertsch, I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you in here." Göring said, taking a drink from his glass. Foertsch silently nodded. "You know of our recent operation in Slovakia, yes? It's clear to me that the Slovaks are still too untrustworthy to entrust with running their own country. After all, that's what we did for years, and they split from us the first chance they got. I'm planning on setting up a new Reichskommissariat there, and you seem like a good man for the job."\n\nFoertsch sat silently. This was not what he expected.

It made no sense- decades of subservience, quiet obedience, and then suddenly they had jumped ship from Germany as fast as they could. All the way up to the Bürgerkrieg, the few reports that ever came from Slovakia were mundane- peaceful, quiet, boring reports nobody gave much mind to. Why would they?\n\nIt struck Göring like a lightning bolt. The reports were so incredibly wrong because the Slovakians had been hiding their intentions. While they had paid lip service to the Reich, they had been secretly planning their betrayal for years! It all fell into place- the sudden change in heart, the resistance to German control, all of it. As Göring figured it out, the plan began to fall into place.\n\nThe collaborationist government would be restored, as expected, but they would never again get so much autonomy. The Reich had taken its eye off the ball, and Slovakia had exploited it to the fullest. Now, the Reich's eyes would be glued to Slovakia, and the army would be ready to sweep in the instant a single piece of the puzzle tried to fall out of place.

It wasn't like they were any real threat to the Reich, but this festering sore on Germany's underside was taking a hundred German lives a month. What was wrong with the Slovaks? When God made them, clearly he had forgotten to put in the quit.\n\nThere was an easy way to solve this, of course- expanding ORPO operations to the Slovakian region. After all, could local forces be trusted with occupying their own nation? No, such an arrangement was begging for disaster.

On what seemed like every corner and every square, a German soldier watched over the crowds with rifle in hand. The people quickly learned to fear them, and soon the streets were quiet- no more demonstrations or furious speeches, only the sounds of cars and footsteps, all watched over by the Germans.\n\nThe people hated the Waffen-HG, but what could they do about it? They had been disarmed, destroyed, and overwhelmingly crushed by a monster far, far greater than any of them. Even if, by some miracle, they succeeded in expelling the German beast, they'd just come back with their tanks again, and this time Slovakia would never get another chance.\n\nSo the Slovakian people, by and large, gave up.

The driver slammed on the brakes, and the three men leapt out of their seats, chasing him into a dark alley.\n\nAs the man ran for the next road, he realized his mistake- the alley had nowhere to take cover, nothing to hide behind.

Surely you would know him by reputation, at least; the man is famously infatuated with the subhumans of eastern Europe in a manner that goes beyond mere academic fascination. His loyalty has been suspect for years, but the Gestapo were never able to find conclusive evidence to bring charges of treason against him. It is likely that his significant personal fortune was the means by which he evaded the law - were we to conduct a thorough investigation, we would likely turn up many a Gestapo officer with greasy palms.\n\nMeyer-Landrut is no military man, but his betrayal of Aryan ideals has wooed many Balts and Slavs, who now fight for him along with our traitor kin. More significantly, of course, he represents a serious ideological threat as the last holdout of Speerism. My Führer, it is this agency's concern that as long as this traitor to the Fatherland and National Socialism remains active, the legitimacy of the Reich is threatened. It is Field Marshal Schörner's view that immediate action against this final pocket of resistance within the Reich proper is necessary, before the poison of liberalism finds root within our society again."

Those who survived the war were all too easy to find. Often accompanied by their staff - no doubt indoctrinated into obedience - many were caught and arrested in their own homes or officers, desperately burning one document after another to try and protect themselves.\n\nWith the owners of some of Germany's biggest banks and businesses apprehended, it was a simple matter to rubber-stamp the paperwork necessary to seize their assets and transfer them to the Führer's personal control. The agents who brought in the snakes each received a commendation and a hefty bonus, cut from the wealth of their quarries. Doubtless we shall need such keen minds when the time comes to pursue such foes of the Reich once more.

Shortly after the news broke in the morning papers, the Wehrmacht's press office released a statement confirming that two squads of Pioneers from the 44th Grenadier Division stormed the empty factory at approximately 5:00 AM with orders to carry out the demolition of the entire structure. The factory was, according to 'reliable sources', being used as a hideout for a large SS cell. More importantly, it allegedly produced weapons for the traitors, with the entire workforce being implicated by the Wehrmacht's informants. Accordingly, the Pioneer units placed demolition charges around the factory in the hours before the first workers arrived, only detonating them once a majority of the workforce was confirmed to be on the clock. An attempt to dig for survivors in the rubble was repelled by the timely arrival of a large Feldgendarmerie contingent, who sealed off the site and declared that more Pioneers would soon be arriving to apply further explosives in order to 'collapse any subterranean construction'.\n\n"I don't understand," said a passing civilian when asked for comment. "That place was a brick factory. There aren't even any armaments factories in the whole of Riga. I've worked in both kinds of factories and I can tell you that there's no confusing brick-making equipment for gunsmithing tools."

"Your boy got back to you quickly, didn't he?" Despite their differing cultures, Dietrich and his family had been accepted with relative warmth. So far out from the major centres of civilisation and its tracts of arable land, there had been little objection to a lone colonial family moving into an abandoned woodland home. Someone had to keep the deer in check, after all.\n\n"He did." Dietrich motioned to the blasted tangle of steel and wood half-buried in the mud right in the middle of the road, where there had previously been a minor railway running through the forest. "He couldn't say what it was you wanted me to see, but it certainly speaks for itself."\n\n"Yes. I wondered, given your time in service, if you would know how this happened?" There was a pause as the German scratched at the graying stubble on his chin and went rummaging through memories of 20 years prior. Given the thoroughly wrecked state of the rails and three-foot-deep crater, it could only have been done with military-grade demolition charges.\n\n"Small but strong railbusting charges," he finally said. "Only Pioneer units are equipped with those. The soldiers who passed through yesterday must have been scouting for vulnerable points in the railway like this crossing."

His eyes were shrouded in shadow by the pillar of flame, and its wicked light glimmered on the brass buttons of the other soldiers as they turned to look at Armin.

They had burned their flag, they had invaded their nation, they had taken their pride. Could the Germans not leave him this one reminder of his father, and the people for whom he had fought? A boot smashed into his nose, and found itself caked in blood. A man yelled something in German, but Josep's ears were pounding too hard to hear it.\n\nAnd yet, Joseph did not let go. Perhaps, like his father before him, he was truly willing to fight for the Polish people. Perhaps he was simply tired of allowing these men to push him around. And perhaps, he was simply too beaten and too tired to open his fingers, even if it may yet save his life. Yet it could not last forever.\n\nAs he felt the cloth rip, Josep knew his cause was lost. That last memento that he had fought so hard for was torn away. The fire crackled and the Germans began to laugh. He could picture his father's red and white brassard amongst the shriveled ashen flags, burning amongst those other symbols of resistance.\n\nAnd yet, lying prone and broken on the ground, splattered with blood, mud, and his own vomit, Josep felt more a Pole than ever."

Facing the same enemies, an alliance was once built up between us during our last invasion. And now, as the European situation quickly changes, it seems the alliance need to be rekindled for our mutual benefits.\n\nLucky for us, their organization aren't difficult to find, and our spies were easily able to make contact with them. They showed little trust toward us at first, claiming that we had betrayed them when the Italians invaded their motherland and set up their own puppet government. regime. But after a few minutes, our agents successfully showed them that Italians are also our enemies and for now we indeed need each other to overthrow the Communist regime in their land and have their revenge against the Italians in the future. So, the proposal of an alliance finally got approved by the leader of the Ustase Organization at the end of the meeting.\n\nHowever, for Germany, there is still one fatal decision to be made. Of course, we can keep our words about an independent Croatian nation in the future and send them supplies they need in the upcoming uprising, for that will definitely make them loyal to us. But on the other hand, if they're so easy to trust us again, maybe some sweet talk and vague promises will be enough to get them on another side. Though it sounds dishonest, we can save a lot of materials for our own Aryan troopers for the invasion and get more freedom to deal the lands we're going to conquer according to our own wish should we betray the Ustase."

However, as we're preparing a invasion against the newly established Yugoslavian state, the Bosnian nation is a potential ally that we cannot ignore anymore. Thus, a special delegate has been order to get on to them and persuade them to join our side in the upcoming war.\n\nAs our Führer wisely expected, the negotiation went even more smoothly than our generals' imagination. The Bosnians quickly accept our offer, for the Yugoslavian communist regime is not only the enemy of the German Reich, as they said, but also an enemy of all Bosnian patriots. In order to win the independence of the long-oppressed Bosnian nation, they are willing to join our forces and take our orders in our invasion, as long as we can protect them from their evil neighbors.\n\nThe orders, however, haven't be given to them yet. The easiest choice is to just give them supplies and help them organize a great national uprising once our panzers start to march into the Yugoslavian lands, since it can greatly distract the Yugoslavian armies and make our invasion much easier. But some generals hold different opinion, saying the Bosnian nationalists will be quickly wiped out if they just declare a rebellion, and they can cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian government if they can keep underground and do some sabotage works. Regardless of which option our order will be, the Bosnian resistance organization is eagerly waiting for it, and we have to make our decision as soon as possible."

goering.1091.desc:0 "The Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, commonly known as the Chetniks, share a complex history with us. Originally a Yugoslavian resistance movement, their attitude towards us is always changing according to the Balkans international relations. And in recent days the situation in Yugoslavia has changed rapidly as the Croatian communists had seized power and incorporated the Serbian lands into their territories, which makes an alliance between us become possible once again. As a result, a meeting is arranged to discuss the details about the cooperation between us.\n\nThe beginning the negotiation was not easy. The Chetniks speak aggressively, claiming that they'll agree on nothing if we don't help them restore a totally independent Kingdom of Yugoslavia ruled by Serbs and provide them assistance much more than what we can accept. However, our delegates pointed it out that the entire Serbian land is dominated by the communists now and they don't stand a chance on their own. Finally, they had to admit that we are the only forces that can help them fulfill their dream and agreed on our terms, as long as we grant their restoration after the war.\n\nNow, it is time for us to decide whether should we keep words about assistance. It is true that providing them what they need and allow them have their monarchy will make them appreciated and loyal to us. But some suggest that what we need is only to have them distract the communist government, and since the Chetniks cannot even drive the commies out from their own land, they don't really deserve to have a role in our Balkan post-war order. And no matter what our decision may be, we need to make it quickly now."

Since we are also in need of someone who can help us launch our invasion against Yugoslavia, the old friendship seems to be about to be rekindled.\n\nOur terms are very simple: they take orders from us and do what we command, in exchange for our military intervention in the Yugoslavian politics. Because the communists are hunting them down at any cost, they currently have no other choices but to entrust their fate to us. Therefore, they easily accept our proposal, saying that they're more than honored to get the second chance to work with the Reich. At the end of our meeting, they told us that they had already organized some political dissents and ready to take our orders.\n\nNow, as we've successfully made connection with them, it's time for us to decide which role they will play in our invasion plan. The first choice is to let them organize a national uprising, which will greatly reduce the resistance on the front. However, we can also let them do some underground activities and sabotages. But no matter what our decisions will be, with the help of those old friends, the upcoming campaign will be much easier for us without any doubt."

And according to the reports from military commanders, what we've reclaimed is even more than the stability of Balkans.\n\nPrior to our reconquest of Yugoslavia, we have made a temporary alliance with the Chetniks, since the communists were our mutual enemies at that time. Though we never considered them to be our real allies, we still provided some assistance to them, hoping to make them trust in us and cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian governments. It's hard to say how much use they're during the campaign, since the Chetniks seem to be more skilled at burning and pillaging rather than actual battles. But now, all the weapons, ammos and medicine have finally returned to the right hands.\n\nThe materials have been checked and distributed into local garrisons to keep order and maybe even used to kill the remnants of Chetniks themselves.

Indeed, even as the guns began to roar a response to the Finn's attack, the admiral knew it was a doomed effort.

Indeed, all of our current Reichskommissariats were ordered to follow our lead and root out the worst offenders in terms of corruption, allowing their troops to get the equipment they deserve. Though most of our Kommissars have followed our orders, as they are supposed to, one in particular has the gall to defy us.\n\nDreschler, the militarist buffoon and staunch Schörnerite of Ostland, has presumably taken a single look at our request, panicked, and immediately ignored it. In fact, he has all but ignored every form of communication we have sent him in relation to the anti-corruption drive.\n\nThis complex situation would normally resolve in our government immediately dismissing the man from his post. However, nothing is normal in Göring Reich, and Schörner has personally stepped in to defend the man from any attacks on his job. This ridiculous scenario, which once would have been inconceivable, now leaves us in a serious bind. We are unable to remove the insubordinate Dreschler from his post, now that Schörner has stepped in behind him, but we are also unable to simply ignore this grievance from a Reichskommissar to his superiors. For now, the relations between Ostland and Germany reach a new low, as both sides uneasily watch each other from across the border."

Clearly, war was inevitable, and so the armies of the Reich prepared.\n\nEvidenltly, the Finns did not see it the same way.\n\nUnbelievably, the Finns have done the one thing we did not expect- they have given in, and offer now to join us with no questions or conditions. A stunned silence overtakes the Oberkommando, and permeates to the Führer's office. Out of all the things expected of the Finns, surrendering to us was not one of them.\n\nNow, there is an unfortunate problem on our hands. Though the Finns have, in all effect, joined us, the cost of readying for this war has been some of the highest so far. Tens of thousands of men had to be retrained, thousands of tanks had to be retrofitted, thousands of planes and ships brought north. For this to have all been for nothing is unacceptable to the militarist branch, who demands we invade anyway and take over directly.\n\nThis demand is complicated by the fact that we promised multiple benefits for the Schörnerites that would be obtained from Finland's resources, lands, and riches- all of which are now unobtainable. On the other hand, to invade a surrendering nation would undoubtedly look horrific to the outside world, and would severely hurt our odds on ever allying with anyone outside the Reich again. "

Of course, if he knew where that path would lead him, he never would have taken it.\n\nAnother place he could have changed was when the Nazi's left Norway. In the chaos, nobody would have noticed just another suddenly missing man from the rosters. But he stayed with the division he had based his career around, all the way up to when they needed a driver for a mission in the north, on a promise from the Führer himself.

It seems that Generalfeldmarschall Schörner has been using an elaborate system of fronts and patsies, along with a few well placed bribes, to siphon off large quantities of IG Farben's most potent pesticides. These pesticides could prove as deadly as other chemical weapons when used on humans, and this combined with the great lengths the man kept to keep his transactions hidden to not bode well for his intentions. While Josef Abs was initially suspected of aiding Schörner, further investigation has proven that he was not involved with any of the smaller-scale orders Schörner had his agents employ.

Losing him would be a shame but the man had through negligence allowed Schörner to procure chemical weapons-grade material. In any other situation Göring would likely have simply had the man shot like a dog, but he didn't need to alienate any more potential sectors of the government.

It was only when they entered into the supposedly empty depot that they realized how badly they had been mistaken.\n\nSchörner's men had been waiting for them, and a brief but fierce firefight ensued that left several of our men dead and over half wounded. Schörner's men were considerably better off, although their exact casualties are unknown. Of course Schörner denied ordering his men to fire on ours, claiming they had believed it was a partisan raid and only retaliated in believed self-defense.

They had been sent, deliberately into battle based on this association, and had died for it.

As the forces make ready, the officers commit to memory their objectives; drive an iron wedge between the core of Onega and its outlying territories in Finland and, once the first phase is completed, storm the encircled outlying regions before an effective counter-offensive can be organized. Helicopter reconnaissance elements have already identified priority targets during the blitz - barracks and makeshift forts - and close air support has been tasked with the destruction of these secondary elements to expedite the skirmish.\n\nThe rousing of the goliath is not something that goes unnoticed, and even with the element of surprise it is reported that our flyovers have set the enemy on edge.

Hundreds of bodies coat the cold ground, and as their empty eyes stare into the smoking horizon the only sight that looks back at them are the shocked survivors, themselves being rounded up by Heer reinforcements.\n\nWith the first strategic objective secured, we stand able to make ready for the total seizure of Onega. Enemy battalions at the periphery were able to withdraw beyond our operational range and regroup with what remains of their armed forces, though it will not help them. Now that they well and truly know that we are coming for them, they have no defense outside the calculus of war.

Debriefing - or interrogation - of surviving infantrymen describes a military folly of a magnitude painful to even consider. Enemy grenadiers and saboteurs disabled or destroyed dozens of vehicles, to say nothing of the now-smoking corpses inside of them, and were obscured from retaliatory airstrikes by trees and terrain. Further, past Luftwaffe bombings destroyed all roads and ingresses to vital areas, and intelligence did not consider this when creating the tactical plans causing entire armored columns to become stuck and having to abandon their vehicles for fear of enemy capture. The vehicles could not be secured by their leaving crews, so one officer ordered a bombing run on the valley to deny their use to the Russians, but poor communication resulted in targeting a separate - occupied - convoy instead.\n\nThe shame of being defeated at the hands of an untrained, ill-equipped, degenerate enemy in a backwater unlisted on maps is too much to bear.

As many troops as we could spare were thrown into defensive positions on the perimeter, and as the sun rose low in the east the battle began in earnest.

Oddly enough, this dream felt nearly lifelike, and he could not convince his mind to wake. He realized that he would once again have to endure this nightmare until it's end.\n\nThe roar of the engines quickly grew louder as seconds went by, until the roar became nearly deafening. Until the auditory assault felt as if it were coming from right inside his modest home. Seconds later, the ground shook violently as the earth rumbled with apocalyptic force. This is where the nightmares usually ended. With a mighty explosion. Yegor frightfully awaited his startling jolt back into reality. Another explosion sounded off, and yet another that made his head ring like an impossibly loud bell. Finally it came, a mighty explosion that swept him away with impossible force.\n\nHowever only this time, it wasn't a dream."

Secondly, we may send them to infiltrate the Russian army. This should allow us to sabotage their operational capabilities and may allow us to stir disobedience amongst their unruly troops.

Thus, we thought of f the Russian Liberation Army, or commonly known as ROA, who help us during the World War II and West Russian War. While the old ROA have betrayed us, a new unit was formed under that name, with the same duty to help us maintain stability in the occupied zone and suppress the local resistance. But now, we realized that it may be a mistake.\n\nReading the reports from the frontline, the Führer's face is dark with worries. It says that some agents found that many officers in the new ROA was just former members of the old one under Vlasov, who betrayed our trust and committed treason not too long ago. The Führer understands that those one cannot be totally trusted, for they've been working with that traitor for too long, and may have some not so welcome opinions about the Reich. And any risk in Russia could leads to a total failure there, which is the last thing he want right now.\n\nSo what should he do right now? Of course he can purge those officers, but is that enough? What if there are more suspect ones in the ROA than what we've found, and what if the entire ROA have been already poisoned by them? But on the other hand, if we just purge the ROA, where can we find other locals who can assist our war cause?

There's only one question in his mind: how the hell could this happen?\n\nThe report from Russia states that, after arresting and executing those officers who are former members of Vlasov's old ROA which betrayed the Reich, the entire ROA was in great shock. No one could be sure about why did we purge those who came to our side during the war, and neither could they be sure about their own fates. Fearing they could be our next targets, a bunch more officers fled from our barracks. And the worst part is, most of them just went to the Russian States and joined our enemies' side with all equipment and information they hold. In one word, we screwed everything up.\n\nBut the Führer understands that there is not enough time for him to regret. He must find a proper solution for current situation as soon as possible. Those who defected to the Russians are just some officers, and the left soldiers are still in our sides, waiting for our more orders. And more importantly, the war is still going on, and if we can win this war in the end, no one will remember some defecting officers, right?\n\n"

The map was of course hopelessly outdated, but Göring thought he could see the direction the conversation was being steered.\n\n"-and the conclusion of the whole operation, uncompleted until now, the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line, to complete the separation of Russia from Europe and ensure Germany has enough Lebensraum for centuries to come."\n\n"And let me guess, you want to refortify the A-A Line." Göring maintained a neutral expression, lacing his fingers together." He tried to quantify the manpower and resources required to finish the project but gave up rapidly. Schörner was unfazed by his plan's predictability, and ploughed on.\n\n"Indeed, my Führer, the plan is self-evident in it's value. Had we completed the fortifications rather than resting on our laurels prematurely, the Soviets would never have been able to regroup and push us back, and Himmler's failed coup would have never even begun. Late as we are, completing the line is the only way to ensure the Russians never have a chance to retake Moskow."\n\nThe Führer thought that Schörner's concern had little to do with the ideology or national security, and much more to do with the influence he would gain with the troops on the eastern frontier. The line may have some strategic value, but it would likely be outweighed by the colossal cost of building a wall across a whole continent. Not to mention the cost of refusal - he could see the spiteful look in Schörner's eye even on the best of days, and had no desire to annoy him further."

Do we really need to waste high quality concrete and steel on a wall the Russians will never reach? We could stand to dilute what Schörner's boys get, they'll never be in a position to notice the difference."\n\nPerhaps Stuckart did have a point - while Schörner himself would almost certainly make note of the change in the supply situation, and he'd have to have that conversation with the bastard, the chances of the Russians pulling together enough to pose a true threat to the A-A Line, pure concrete or aggregated, were miniscule.

The icy Russian soil refused to give in easily - the constant movement of cart wheels and caterpillar tracks had churned up thick, wet mud, that over repeated cycles of freezing and thawing had created half a dozen layers of frozen ground that was closer to rock than dirt. A little extra strength would be appreciated, preferably that of a jackhammer or one of those excavators he'd seen on the back of the German trucks, but those were too valuable to be risked in the unskilled hands of a conscript such as himself.\n\nVadim allowed himself a brief moment to catch his breath and wipe the sweat from his brow, which had gathered there despite the cloud his breath produced in the cold. As he breathed, he surveyed the horizon. From his section of the would-be trench, half sunk into the earth, he could see but a small segment of the fortifications extent. He had never seen anything like it. He'd heard tales of distant China, where a great wall separated the civilised world from the barbarians to the north. This was the only comparison he could even consider relevant. For as far as the eye could see, and from what he'd heard a thousand times further and yet more, Russians like him laboured digging trenches, cutting down forests, draining swamps, hanging barbed wire, installing bunkers, fortifying choke points - building a wall the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\n"What's the holdup, Russkie?" His reverie was interrupted by a bark in German - outside the trench, the soldier supervising his group was looking down at him and idly playing with the action of his rifle.\n\n"Just catching my breath, sir," he replied in rudimentary German. Vadim swallowed as the soldier walked to the lip of the trench. Seeing his discomfort, the German chuckled and spat into the trench, narrowly missing Vadim.\n\n"Back to work. No unsanctioned breaks."

Well, it was mostly mud - the digging of latrines had been deemed a secondary priority compared to the main fortifications, and there were few Russians willing to leave the trench at night, when a trigger-happy German might take a simple toilet break for an escape attempt. If Vadim poked his head out from under their tarpaulin, he could see the corpse pile. He could smell it no matter where he was.\n\nThe Germans kept separate from the Russians in their tents, but Vadim had been able to overhear a few words while on duty - most of the soldiers assumed the Russians were incapable of understanding their language, despite the fact around half the conscripts were Muscovite, and many of the others had picked up smatterings of the trade language that had built up around what used to be the border between Moskowien and Russia. Despite the brutal punishments that were being dealt with increasing regularity to the "lazy" workers, work was apparently proceeding according to schedule. Once the work was done, Russia would be split in two, with a border not nearly so porous as that that preceded it. What would become of him then? Shipped out to another conflict, to dig holes and live in his own shit, or just disposed of, another face in the corpse pile? There must be some way out, some path between the sentries that would take him away. They wouldn't bother searching for him once he was out, he was all but worthless - that much was clear. But which way? Back west into Moskowien, and hope to remain unnoticed by the authorities? Or east into Russia, where who knows what awaited him? He'd heard the Soviet Union was restored in the far east, but then he'd also heard of bandits masquerading as Germans who would slaughter anyone they deemed too Russian.\n\nThe crack of a distant gunshot reached the trench, and a few of the others shifted in their sleep.

He and his Russian comrades, for all their hard work, had been awarded respite, a chance to lean on their shovels and gaze at the miles of trenches they had dug by hand. Vadim could have done with one of the beers the soldiers were passing round, but for now he was just grateful to have good, clean water. The radio was blaring out some patriotic German song, immediately following a speech by Führer Göring congratulating the troops and labourers - the German labourers, of course - on the completion of what he referred to as "Eighth Wonder of the World", the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line.\n\nThe division of Germany and Russia was now a sharp line on the map rather than the blur it had once been, in what many other young Russians considered a small golden age of enterprise compared to the Union and Reich that sandwiched them. The only enterprise getting done these days certainly wasn't sending the profits his way. He sipped his water, for the moment content. His shoulders no longer ached. He surveyed the wilderness expanse to the east, nothing but fields as far as the eye could see - no cover. Nothing but easy shooting should some young asshole look up from his drinking and back to his duties. But still, there was no time left, they'd be moving out soon. The best thing he could see was a gully, a few hundred metres away leading southeast. If he could reach there in a couple of hours, when drinking and darkness had dulled their senses, he might be able to crawl out of sight.\n\nThe rumble of a truck interrupted his thoughts, and he turned. The truck was backing up to the trench, where his comrades were enjoying their rest. Soldiers, their rifles shouldered and looking much more sober than their drunken friends were accompanying it.\n\n"Russkies, in the truck! Next project."

The first issue plaguing our newly-established Reichskommissariate is logistics: months of bombings and fighting have left the Iberian infrastructure - not the most developed one to begin with - in a pitiful state. Roads and railroads are filled with holes and craters, bridges were demolished by the retreating Iberian forces, and the docking facilities were abandoned after we enacted our embargo.\n\nWith this sorry state of affairs, our garrisons lament delays in supplies, while partisans and rebels strike from forests and hills to steal weapons from our convoys. Should this keep going, we might face worse problems than a couple terrorist attacks, therefore a comprehensive initiative must be taken in order to improve the state of Iberian infrastructure.\n\nWe have several choices, each with its caveats. On one hand, we can concentrate on Reichskommissariat Kastilien and make it the infrastructural hub of Iberia: with its central position, encompassing the former capital of Madrid, it would be a cheap solution with great potential results, but Reichskommissar Hitzfeld is known for supporting Speidel, which could further aggravate the infighting among the Iberian subdivisions. On the other, we can equally spread the development efforts between all administrative units: this would be more costly and less efficient, but no one would complain about lack of funds. Finally, we can simply forego land infrastructure and have everything delivered from Germany by ship, by improving the Northern Iberian port facilities: this would be the safest choice, but also the most expensive, and our finances aren't exactly looking good at the moment..."

Another choice could be to split the costs between all the Iberian Reichskommissariate, just the way it was when Iberia was united: this would be less controversial, but all Reichskommissars would complain at least some.\n\nFinally, we can simply take responsibility for Hitler's dreams and shoulder the cost on our own.

Glancing at the dam for the last time, no one feels upset because they know that this is only a small chapter in our long struggle against the Germans, and they'd written it well.\n\nNow, as our soldiers have done their duties, it's we politician's responsibility to decide what we should do next. The radicals suggest that we should immediately mobilize our navy to escalate the current crisis, since it took us a lot to get the Dam and it has important strategic values. And we all know that what they really want to say is the time to openly confront with the Germans has come. However, others say that it is still too early to start a total conflict with them and any rash act may lead to some disastrous consequences that no one would like to see.

And then came the Germans. After sweeping over the whole peninsula, they came to our Gibraltar. Though almost no one believes they can hold their positions, they did complete a mission impossible in the end.\n\nAt the very beginning, the Germans were confident that they will easily break our defense since their force was several times bigger than ours in Gibraltar. But then, our boys broke their ignorance with leads and bombs when they walked into our sights carelessly. After hours of fighting, the battlefield was filled of our enemies' corpses. At the shinning sunset of the great ocean, our soldiers returned to their barracks with joyful song, talking about what the history books in the future will records such a epic of great heroism.\n\nHowever, in our capital, there's not too much time for us to celebrate. The conflict is only a little interlude in our international political strategy, and we must decide what we're going to do next. While some suggested that we can take this chance to further weaken the Germans, and smuggle important materials to destabilize the different RKs in Europe. Others, however, believe such a move is too risky that may anger the Germans and even lead to the third World War. They suggested that we should work on strengthen what we've achieved.

Obviously the SS was never going to share their own weaknesses, given what they seem to have been planning for years now. The Ordensstaat is considered an impenetrable "secret state" for a reason, even at the height of our power we were never able to maintain the level of communications blackout that they have achieved. To me, this does not bode well for finding any active resistance cells. Of course, hard to find does not mean nonexistent, and the Abwehr will search every nook and cranny in order to further the goals of the Reich. We have two leads currently on French and Belgian contacts but we will need further time to verify their authenticity lest we fall into a Burgundian counterintelligence.\n\nAs for potential informants within the regime, we do at least know the names of some, but the list is from before the Burgerkrieg and given the high rate of turnover amongst the Burgundian officials coupled with possible changes in willingness to cooperate, we cannot rely heavily on this information. We have agents in the field conducting check-ins on the names to confirm or not the status of these potential assets. As of this report, only - REDACTED - has been located and has been confirmed as deceased since 1965 during one of the apparently infamous purges carried out on Reichsführer-SS Himmler's direct orders. Our best guess is that - REDACTED - and - REDACTED - have also been terminated in the meanwhile but this cannot be confirmed at this moment.\n\nAs always my Führer, you will be updated when any new information has been discovered.\nGeneralmajor Reinhard Gehlen, Abwehr"

Burgundian purges successfully eliminated dissident movements from within the Waffen-SS several years ago, and since then has maintained an extensive suppression campaign.

It is only a matter of time before these whispers turn into an outright rebellion, and something must be done. In order to ensure utmost stability and loyalty in these trying times, it has become paramount that we remove the traitors who conspire against us. While Schörner has influence in the navy he is not the only one, Hans Speidel has also managed to get some loyalists among the many admirals and while he is not outright hostile yet we cant exactly trust him. We must act quick if we are to maintain control of the navy.\n\nHowever, we must carefully choose who we are going to remove, as time is running thin and we cannot hope to antagonize the entirety of the Kriegsmarine.

There was an air of excitement around these men, feelings of excitement to better Germany and to serve their nations cause. This would be the start of something truly great for Germany.\n\nSuddenly, a bright light erupted across the barracks, as the deafening sounds of an explosion rocked those once excited men to the ground. Soon, the ground was engulfed in tendrils of flame and smoke, as agonizing groans could be heard amongst the wreckage. Men once radiating with excitement were now writhing in pain on the ground, covered in shrapnel and soot.\n\nReports across Germany have labelled the bombing on the Friekorps barracks as an act of terror towards the German people. Leaks of the Freikorp barracks whereabouts were apparently leaked by members of the navy, and many are suspecting that the raid was conducted by individuals seeking to undermine the authority of the Führer.

As such, transfer of several key positions within the Kriegsmarine to Luftwaffe officers was seen as a necessary and much needed course of action, in order to maintain order within the navy and to ensure the German war machine stayed well oiled.

According to special intelligence, areas of Germany heavily under the control of Speidel and Schörner have very limited air support loyal to them, and as such has provided us a unique opportunity to scout on our opposition. By using our aerial superiority to discover and locate the bases of the enemy, we would obtain a strategic advantage which would provide our Luftwaffe with a tactical advantage should any conflict break out within the Reich.\n\nThe plan, while sound, does come with a few flaws. If one of our scouting missions were to somehow be discovered by the enemy, it could potentially lead to an early unforeseen conflict and the loss of any strategic advantage we may have had. The decision is entirely in the hands of the Führer, as such a large decision should not be undertaken lightly."

However, the sheer number of new guard generals within the navy poses a problem, as it will be quite difficult to bring all of them to our side.\n\nFocusing on securing a majority of the generals would provide us with a large array of support within the navy, preventing a widespread mutiny. While this method would in theory be the most effective, it would be difficult to carry this out in actuality. On the other hand, focusing on a few key generals could prove to be more beneficial.

The Field Marshal is swamped with allegations of corruption which he has so far been able to charismatically talk himself out of, and the snubbing of more senior members of the old guard will surely agitate many.

It was to the Führer's understanding that Müller had understood the situation, and was willing to encumber the task set before him. Why the hell would he suddenly resign, fleeing the nation entirely? None of this made sense to him.\n\nYet, the pieces began to come together. Seemingly within moments of Müller's resignation and flight, Feldmarschall Speidel began to pick up the pieces that were hurriedly left behind, almost as if he expected this series of events to occur. Speidel has now reached out to the Führer about taking up the mantle of OKW chief to swiftly seal the vacuum that has suddenly appeared once again, and has already begun issuing directives amongst several military elements as if he were already in-charge.\n\nWith a fast deteriorating situation, it is clear that Speidel has assumed more effective control over the armed forces than any other man has to this point, and the Führer does not see many other options laid out before him."

Ever since Speidel delayed what Göring sees as his rightful ascension into Germania in 1963, the Führer has severely distrusted the veteran Field Marshal. Yet, as the crisis began to unfold throughout the reich as the military sat without a central commander, Göring knew that he must set aside the distrust he held in order to preserve his own increasingly fragile reign.\n\nSpeidel's re-ascension to commandership over the Wehrmacht comes at an ever increasingly trying time for the Reich, reminiscent of the opening days of the Bürgerkrieg years ago.

Could the Führer really have been so bold as to appoint his family into the highest post achievable by a member of the German military?\n\nThe eyes of the nation did not deceive them. Heinrich Theodore Göring has been appointed by the Führer as the head of the Wehrmacht in this time of crisis. A former second world war luftwaffe pilot turned career officer, he has had a long career in the armed forces, but not as fruitful a career as many other candidates that stood in line for the military's top job.

For being a militarist, as he so claimed, Göring was taking quite the turn towards Bolshevism- at least, that's what the protestors claimed.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Speidelites applauded Schörner's removal. However, this approval has quickly turned into fear of their own. Whispers of Schörner attempting another coup rippled through Speidel's supporters, and soon they became as paranoid as the Schörnerites. If Schörner truly was trying a second coup, would Göring stop him? What would happen to Speidel? What would happen to them?\n\nFrom this moment on, perhaps the consequences of such an earthshaking push was inevitable. Divisions reported to headquarters more and more infrequently, strange new "exercises'' were scheduled and rescheduled- most importantly, Herr Schörner headed east to give a "speaking tour", and Feldmarschall Speidel headed north for "administrative duties." All of these actions were viewed with suspicion, but nothing could be done about them- nothing would rock the boat harder than arresting Schörner and Speidel.\n\nAs it turns out, one doesn't need to rock the boat when it's already sinking.\n\nAs of now, Schörner and thousands of soldiers march on Germania, determined to right the wrongs that Göring has pushed onto them. Their intentions, while not outright stated, are beyond clear. To the north, Speidel marches south on Germania, presumably in a coup attempt of his own, or perhaps solely to stop Schörner from completing his own. Germania itself is in a state of chaos, as thousands flee into the countryside from the impending battle. The Führer's only hope now is that his new Feldmarschall remains loyal to his side..."

The troops there are demoralized, undersupplied, underfed, and totally unmotivated. Native resistance has skyrocketed to almost unprecedented levels. He reports that his situation is untenable, and he has made the choice to withdraw-"\n\n"Which Kommissariat is this?" Göring cut in, smoke swirling from the tip of his cigarette. The secretary looked back down at the letter for a moment.\n\n"RK Turkestan, my Führer."\n\n"Turkestan, huh? Where is this?" Göring responded, a hint of confusion in his voice.\n\n"Central Asia, my Führer." The secretary responded. Göring sat quietly for a moment, as if he was trying to remember something. Finally, he chuckled softly. "I swear, I had almost forgotten we'd ever gotten out to Central Asia. Must have slipped through the cracks of my memory at some time, with all of the recent events."\n\nThere was another silence.

Finally, while as Führer, the most numbers that Göring ever saw at once were the numbers of casualties from the army's campaigns against the enemy.\n\nThe numbers today, though, were for the Führer's eyes only. Not because he had any specific knowledge about them, but because the result of their leaking would be a catastrophe.\n\nThroughout the Ukraine, thousands of partisan rebels had taken their opportunity and revolted against the regime. Ukraine burns as their natives leave the farms to join the fighting and the Garrison retreats, barely holding it together as is. Other, more pressing numbers and graphs detail food production and grain storage in Germany. With the revolt tearing through the breadbasket of Europe, the food that the Reichskommissariat provides burns with the rest of it. Without the production that the Ukraine provides, there's no way that Göring- or any of the contenders- will be able to feed every German. Grain storages provide some leeway for now, but sooner or later, those will run out, and what then?\n\nGöring slides the paper to his right, out of sight.

No materials, no workers, no outputs... in fact, barely anything are getting produced in these days. What a healthy economy it is!\n\nBut for now, there is nothing we can do about our economy. If they didn't betray the Reich and rekindle the fire of civil war, none of this would happen at all! And all we should do is to focus all resources we have now to eliminate the enemies of Germany, otherwise our nation cannot be saved at all."

But today, when reading the reply from Hans Speidel, he finally felt that fortune starts to stand on his side.\n\n"Considering the great dangers that Schörner has brought to our fatherland", in that reply Speidel says, "I agree that he is our common enemy for now, and to eliminate this threat, I'll immediately allied with you, just like what we did in the last stage of the First German Civil War. And I hope, with the combination of our forces, we can end this war as soon as possible."\n\nWhile for now, the future of this war is still too hard to predict, with Speidel's support on his side, Göring's faith is strengthened a lot. For now, he can focus all his troops on the fight against Schörner while Schörner must divide his forces to deal with two enemies. But more importantly, as a revered war hero, Speidel's support will be a perfect example for the people which makes them believe that Hermann Göring is the rightful Führer of the German Reich and the one who will win this war in the end.

But the worst part is, it seems that everything he attempts turned to useless in the end and his bad luck won't have an end forever.\n\nYes, today in Speidel's reply, he rejected Göring's request for an alliance against Schörner and declared that he will not trust Göring, at least for now. Such a result means that, while Schörner is the common enemy for Speidel and Göring, any kind of military cooperation between their two factions is impossible and Göring has to deploy some of his division to guard against Speidel, making his strategic situation even more dangerous.\n\nAnd more terribly. Speidel's rejection will have a very bad influence over Göring's reputation in Germany. Many people are already hating Göring since it has been proved that he is not able to maintain peace and stability, which is what they need most at present. And since Speidel, the old hero who helped Göring and restored peace in the last war, has turned against him, it seems that Göring has already lost his quality and legitimacy to rule Germany in future.\n\nFor now, while the future of this war is still too hard to predict, Göring feels that his prospect is becoming darker and darker each day.

 goering.2062.desc:0 "Labour camps have, for decades now, been the punitive norm in the German Reich. What is unprecedented, however, are the reports that have been flowing in from our men who have been fighting alongside Göring's forces.\n\nReports indicate that, rather than holding prisoners of war from this conflict in conventional holding camps, as would be befitting of fellow German combatants, those captured are rather being forced into intensive labour camps under horrific conditions. One camp was reportedly so overfull following the surrender of an enemy division, that the conditions described within the camp beckon to the treatment of captured Soviets in the 1940s. The prisoners in these camps were described as being made to do industrial labour, being forced to meet quotas. Most in the camps wear the tattered uniforms of Heer conscripts. The occasional officer is also scattered about the prisoner populace, bearing his old uniform, but none of the dignity that once came with it. Some prisoners, oddly, suspiciously brandish no uniforms at all, and drag about in seemingly civilian clothing.\n\nYet, most concerning to us, is that one battalion of ours that was passing by one of Görings camps was recognized by the prisoners inside the camp, who began frantically calling out the names of the soldiers in our passing battalion. For those prisoners were of the same battalion, captured weeks ago by Schörners forces. Demanding to know the meaning of the imprisonment of his soldiers, the battalion commander and his men forced their way into the camp, liberating all those who belonged to their forces. It appeared that those men were placed into a prisoner of war camp when captured by Schörners forces, only to be liberated by Görings armies days later. But rather than liberation, they were hushed and placed into another camp. The Führer's labour camp.\n\nSuch criminal treatment of our soldiers is intolerable, and all those in our general staff agree. Outraged, many are calling for us to sever our ties with Hermann Göring entirely, citing that he has gone too far and treated our men as if they were Jewry. On the other hand, we may not be able to afford the loss of such an alliance, and simply placing an ultimatum that the Führer halt these actions may suffice."

He was clearly not interested in such. He had an ultimatum to give.\n\nApparently, a battalion underneath his command managed to force their way into one of our prisoner of war camps. Within, they claim to have found several of their men among the prisoners, and proceeded to break those men out of our camp. Dumbfounded after being confronted by a friendly force, our guards did little to prevent the chaos.\n\nThe fact does remain, however, that prisoners are not vetted to determine who they fight for. All prisoners of war encountered are simply determined to be hostile, and are rounded along into the labour programmes. Such programmes are essential to the war effort, and it may not be advisable to set a precedent of granting freedom to any prisoner that some unruly commander decides to bring into his ranks. Furthermore, allowing factionalists to make demands of the Führer would be an unacceptable degradation of the Führerprinzip. However, Speidel is a valuable ally. A collection of cool headed generals suggest that we allow the release of these prisoners back to Speidel's custody as a gesture of goodwill and the continued alliance between our forces."

Not only has he refused our reasonable demands that allied soldiery be freed from his labour camps, yet he has also demanded that we subdue ourselves beneath him.\n\nIt has become apparent that the Führer sees Generalfeldmarschall Speidel as little more than pawns upon his chessboard.

The land where the Finnish people reside in is frozen, but no more frozen than their heart now. After being independent for fifty years, the land of thousand lakes finally falls into another foreign power's hand. And now, we Germans shall decide the fate of their nation.\n\nUnlike their Swedish neighbors, the Finns cannot be seen as our Germanic brothers due to their inferior bloodlines, which means we need to be more careful when establishing our own administrations. Meanwhile, their fierce resistance against Russians in 1940s has proven that their heart of fighting is far hotter than their living environment. If we want to use their abundant natural resources and industries as well as suppressing local guerillas, we need to find accountable for such a task. Let's hope that general Heinz-Gerog Lemm and his Reichskommissariat can do their duty toward the fatherland.\n\nEven in the far north part of the Europe, the Wehrmacht's marching boot cannot be stopped, and the aurora in the high sky bears the greatness and vigilancy of the German nation."

Such a meaningless act was doomed to be vain, for our Nordic brothers can never protect themselves without the Reich's benevolent rule. The only problem is, it takes many of their bloods and lives to realize such an easy fact when the Wehrmacht returned to their land, and now, their fates is on our hands once again.\n\nIt is obvious that the previous administration of Norway established in 1940 proved to a total failure, for the Norwegians never truly acknowledge our regime as well as the Reich as their fatherland. Such a mistake cannot be repeated anymore. The newly established Reichskommissariat Skandinavien led by Heinz-Georg Lemm will ensure that Norway stays a inseparable part of the German Reich forever.\n\nNow, another Germanic nation is reclaimed by the Reich, and under the genius leadership of our Führer, soon we shall bring unity and glory to the whole Aryan race.

The tragic irony that will no doubt be observed and opined on at length by international observers in the coming weeks is that while Bulgaria could have had the capability to put up a fierce fight were it fully mobilized, its decades long reliance on its ally Germany left it completely unprepared when its former master came calling. Still, even with all of its military's weaknesses, reports on the ground indicated that the soldiers of the Royal Bulgarian Army fought as well as anyone could have given their equipment and manpower shortages that would end up fatally compromising them. The fall of Bulgaria represents the latest domino to be knocked over by the whirlwind force of nature that has been the German war machine under its bombastic new leader. Governance of Bulgaria's territory has been given over to the Reichskommissariat Balkanhalbinsel as was the case with its fellow Balkan victims, including the Kingdom of Romania."

The Iberian Federal Government, the Basque, the Catalons, the Portuguese, all of these and more fell beneath the advancing boots of the Wehrmacht and the falling bombs of the Luftwaffe. With every contender eliminated Goering has ordered the region once under the domain of the Iberian Union to be balkanized into some half a dozen Reichskommisariats, most of whom are led by members of Hans Speidel's faction or members of the "New Guard" of the military high command.

Today he was adorned in his blue Luftwaffe uniform, its medals clanking as he took his position behind the podium. Behind him stood his most loyal advisors: the bespectacled Ferdinand Schörner, the sneering Otto Ernst Remer, the smartly suited Wilhelm Stuckart.\n\n"Members of the Reichstag," Göring spoke after a few moments of silence, gripping the podium tightly with his jewelled fingers. "I have humbly accepted the Führer's offer to become his official successor. Many of you will know that such a proposition has been enshrined in our law since 1938. I am proud to say that the strength of our relationship has only grown in this time." His eyes, blue and narrow, dragged themselves across the brown masses of the Reichstag. "The Reich, however, has only weakened! As your Führer, I promise to drag us from the marshy swamp of our own making and into a glorious new era!" His voice grew slightly strained as he continued the speech. "I shall deliver us into an age of absolute military domination over our foes. Make no mistake. The Führer's vision for Europe must be completed!"\n\nA sporadic wave of applause swept through the crowd, emanating largely from the militarists and Wehrmacht officers, but also from a few conservatives. Göring gave an uneasy smile and glanced behind him, where Schörner was watching on eagerly.\n\n"To strengthen our beautiful Vaterland," Göring continued, "we must save our economy from the clutches of those who wish to exploit it for their own selfish purposes. You know who I'm talking about!" Göring's voice grew more energetic, and he puffed out his chest in excitement. "I'm talking about the parasitic German bankers! I'm talking about the Swiss! Let us revitalize our economy, let us re-energize the German workforce, let us abolish wasteful spending on useless projects that plague the Reich!""

 goering_successor.2.desc:0 ""Let's try one with a far-off look," Göring instructed the young photographer. He looked dramatically to the side, brow furrowed in stern thought. The camera clicked multiple times. He was wearing his personalized dove-gray uniform, complete with medals. He turned back to the photographer. "Bernhard, was it? Ah, Bertold. My apologies. Show me yesterday's photograph. The one with the blue Luftwaffe uniform." Bertold brought the printed photo over. "Hmm... I want that one destroyed. This is going in the newspapers, remember. I must look my best."\n\nSchörner arrived in the doorway with a small document tucked under his arm. Göring beckoned him over and examined the papers. The Feldmarschall had drafted a plan to violently suppress the student protests that had broken out since his appointment as successor. Bertold was prowling around the room, experimenting with different angles and muttering to himself. The young photographer had probably been a student himself, not so long ago. Göring gave a heavy sigh. He handed the document back and nodded his approval. Oh well. The students had been growing more and more unruly. It was time they were taught a lesson.\n\n"Reichsmarschall Göring," the photographer whispered in a shaking voice, drawing Göring from his thoughts. "I took a photograph of your plan. The one ordering Heer troops to use brutal force against the peaceful student protests. I will leak this photo unless you cancel this order immediately. Is that understood?"\n\nGöring stared at the young man in shock, but said nothing. He simply rose to his feet, thanked him for his time, and walked over to the waiting Schörner. The officer noticed his glum expression, and looked over at Bertold with suspicion."

Wilhelm Stuckart lowered his fork and frowned in confusion.\n\n"No need to worry yourself, Wilhelm," Göring grinned as he inspected the photo. The image was of Göring sitting down on a chair and inspecting a document. One of the papers was hanging loosely in full view of the camera, detailing much of Schörner's plans against the student protests. "We'll get back to matters of policy in a second."\n\n"I regret to inform you that our good friend Bertold took a nasty fall from his apartment window," Schörner shook his head in mock grief. "He was quite high up, I'm afraid."\n\n"He must have been taking photos of the sky!" Göring roared with laughter, slamming the table in his hand. He wiped a tear from his eye and turned to Stuckart. "You haven't got a lighter, have you?" He plucked the lighter from his advisor's palm and lit it underneath the image with glee. The bright yellow flames licked across the photograph, contorting the image as it folded and blackened. Göring watched on with satisfaction, the flames reflected in his pale blue eyes."

That didn't stop him from getting on his nerves.\n\nSchörner arrived at the doorway. Göring strode over him with a thunderous expression and swung his baton, hitting the Feldmarschall in the side of the arm. The officer looked more shocked than hurt.\n\n"You useless fucking idiot! I told you to exterminate that little rat Bertold! Why the fuck is he still alive to leak photos of our plan? The protests have tripled in size!" Göring was about to throw his baton to the floor in fury but stopped himself at the last moment. It was too precious to risk breaking. "That agent you sent to deal with Bertold? The one who got fucking caught? I want him liquidated immediately."\n\n"Is that necessary, Hermann?" Schörner responded with gritted teeth, rubbing his sore arm. Any other day, he would have exploded with fury. "Does it matter what the students think? They weren't going to support you anyway."\n\n"Have. Him. Liquidated. I won't ask again.

There were several chants, disparate and sporadic, but the loudest without question was: "Down with Göring!"\n\nClaus gripped his rifle tightly and looked towards his comrades for assurance. He was 18 years old and fresh out of training. He had imagined being sent to the beautiful expanses of the snowy eastern front, or down in the exotic jungles of Afrika. He did not expect to be facing down fellow Germans for his first assignment.\n\nSoldiers were pushing forwards, screaming at the protestors to disperse. The closest cluster backed away instantly, apart from one girl who thrust her anti-Göring sign forwards and screamed back. One of the soldiers walked up and smashed her in the face with the butt of his rifle.\n\n"Disperse!" Claus yelled. His voice cracked. He raised his rifle at the students, who dropped their signs and darted. He saw a group of soldiers tackling a pair of brick-throwers to the ground and smashing them to a bloody pulp with their boots. Another comrade fired a shot into the papier-mâché head, which exploded as the crowd nearby broke apart with a cry. Claus did not let the fear overtake him. He was a soldier of the Reich. Sure, these were fellow Germans... students, around his age... but they were protesting against the next Führer, against the Reich. Anyone who protests against the Reich protests against the German people. One of the demonstrators lobbed a brick towards him, missing the young soldier by a few inches.

He had ordered a display of power on a grand scale not seen since the glorious celebrations following the triumph of the Second Welktkrieg. It had been expensive, of course, but his revitalization of the economy following the Führer's inevitable demise would more than make up for it.\n\nA sense of pride surged through him as the Hermann Göring Division marched onwards to lead the procession. The splendor of those uniforms, the synchronization of their steps, and sheer beauty of those mechanicals creatures rolling forward... it was almost too much to handle. He was enraptured by his own propaganda! Göring chuckled softly. Perhaps he would build a statue of himself in Germania? One for Hitler too, of course, but maybe ever so slightly smaller than his...\n\n"Stop prattling, Feldmarschall!"

"I still haven't decided on Heinrich Müller. He's a Bormannite, yes, but many of them will flock to my cause when I'm declared Führer."\n\n"He stays on the list. He's too much of a risk." Schörner was strumming his fingers against the table. "As for Speer's supporters, we should start with his merry band of Bolsheviks.

It was one of Hitler's many speeches to the Reichstag. "Ahem. 'Should something happen to me in this battle, my first successor will be party member Göring'. Make sure this one is released first."\n\nNewspaper and speech extracts. Quotes by esteemed Party members. Newsreel footage of Hitler and Göring shaking hands, or standing side by side on the Reichstag balcony, or deliberating over war plans. Audio recordings of Hitler praising Göring.

Once they had received his blessing, they would all be sent to the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment and spread to the German people.

 goering_anti.1.desc:0 "The war machine of the Reich rages anew across Europe as [GGR_Defender.GetName] has become the next step in the Reich's march to European domination. Already, Panzer divisions stream across [GGR_Defender.GetName], and fighting has broken out rapidly as [GGR_Defender.GetName] makes its stand against German aggression.\n\nHope for [GGR_Defender.GetName] seems scant. No matter how powerful its military, they stand against what is perhaps the world's mightiest. Only a superpower seems destined to survive the battle against another superpower-at least until one considers nuclear weaponry. Even then, Germany may be more posed than any to win the ground war, boasting what could be the largest military the modern world has ever seen and the technology to use it.\n\nThis leaves [event nation] in a poor position. It is doubtful that the war drums will go silent even after [GGR_Defender.GetName] falls. With that in mind, we should prepare for the inevitable onslaught, but others argue our efforts should instead go towards preventing it from ever coming here. Those who argue for this strategy in our government propose we send gifts of men, arms, and training to [GGR_Defender.GetName], to do our part in holding the tide before the waves inevitably crash upon our people."

Striking at their shipping would provoke another war, which at the moment we can not afford while [GGR_Defender.GetName] is still a threat.\n\nThey can be sure, however, that they will soon taste the might of the German war machine."

Already, the press has reported of terrible crimes done against the natives, of the brutality and ferocity of the German war machine, and of the desperate struggle to retain the nation's freedom.\n\nWhile many in America are still exhausted from the debacle in Africa, our military prepares its arms and chomps at the bit for the possibility of striking at Germany close to home. Many in the government have proposed sending material aid to [GGR_Defender.GetName], as many in the international community have done, in the interest of aiding their military. Many of our generals however favor a much more direct approach, and have requested permission to send not only guns, but an expeditionary force of 'advisors' to help halt the German advance, much as we had seen in Africa."

American aid, in a move similar enough to South Africa to raise several eyebrows, has already begun to rapidly spread across [GGR_Defender.GetName]to the detriment of the Germans.\n\nThe precedent is set.

Much as they had done decades ago, when we failed to end their madness at the root.\n\nDespite this, however, the Americans remain silent. No ships come from the US offering men or weapons. Many in our government sigh in relief, seeing this as the avoidance of yet another adventure, tugged forward by an American leash. Still, others decry this, demanding we send support despite America's neutrality in the conflict. Still, without the American's backing, would our support just be a waste?"

Just as they had done decades ago, the Germans strike with fury, hoping to rapidly destroy and annihilate the country and people's that they call enemies.\n\nThe Army has been very clear on what they propose. Soldiers should be sent to 'advise' the weaker armies of [GGR_Defender.GetName]in their war, and to strike a brutal blow against the far inferior men of Germany on the ground. The Navy's proposal is also to harm the German war machine at its source, but in a manner less blatant. They propose that we simply send arms instead of men, and allow our guns to do the work for us.\n\nStill, some worry about the costs associated with such an action, and the annoyance that would inevitably come from poking at the Germans. The issue has been ultimately left up to the choice of the Prime Minister."

While often not as cutting edge as the technology of the Germans or Americans, it is nevertheless only what we'd expect from a nation claiming to be a superpower, and will doubtless be useful in the days to come.\n\nWith the Empire's help, perhaps we stand a chance against the scum that infests our home."

While this has set the general's staff into an uproar, Führer Göring has just barely managed to stand them down. Striking Burgundy, he argues, is just what Himmler wants. A chance to strike into Germany's heart while our back is to them, and attempt to take power as he has desired for so long.

France, once a great part of the Einheitspakt, brothers in arms with the German Reich, is now under the sphere of influence belonging to the Italian nation. Their disgusting ideas creep into France, corrupting the people, corrupting the land itself! You, Führer, have been supplying us, and we thank you. We have been strengthened, and our position has been built, with the great French people's advancement within our grasp. However, it still lies but barely out of reach. Should the Reich supply your loyal allies with additional weapons and arms, we shall be able to oust these traitors, those Italian dogs, and make France loyal to the Pakt once more.\n\nGöring stared at the letter. Yet another rebel group asking for guns, the French this time. To be honest, it was quite the irritation when the French sided with the Italians, in that Great Game of theirs. It would be quite the boon to the Pakt, the Reich, and National Socialism should the French be allied with the Einheitspakt once more. On the other hand, how loyal could these groups be? There was still much resentment from the French towards the Germans regarding their actions in the war. Additionally, it can't even be guaranteed if this coup of theirs would even succeed."

Firstly, almost nobody likes the Nazis in France. In what must be an utter shock to the Führer, genociding a nation makes the people there have a particular distaste for you. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the Germans just didn't send them enough guns. It takes a lot of support to overthrow a proper, stable, functioning government like our lovely friends in France, and the German aid just wasn't up to the task. This has added up to these armed forces "controlling" France to actually be a handful of fascists in fancy uniforms with some scary-looking guns walking around the street with no real ground-level control.\n\nBecause of this situation, we are in a prime position to take action.

The Nazi collaborationists were no proper army, barely even a militia, and they were cut down like wheat by a scythe when a proper trained military marched in. Bordeaux, Marseille, and the rest of the important cities were under the control of the Italian-backed government, and the Italian hegemony has returned to the French.\n\nThe police are now sweeping from door to door, searching for the traitors to the Italian state. This attempt at Nazi hegemony, while incredibly flimsy and doomed from the start, was an absolute terror to most of the inhabitants of France. Many were refugees from territory brutally occupied from the Reich, and everybody remembers the horrors of Burgundian-controlled France.\n\nFor once in their lives, police officers were cheered on as they dragged people out of apartments and put bullets in their heads.

Dens were found, raided, and those within were sometimes arrested, sometimes shot, but never escaped. News channels reported of the great success in the French state in resisting the German imperialism. Politicians spoke out against the coup, praising the success of the armed forces in keeping France free. The traitors were despised, their names spat on, their memory to become forgotten.\n\nThere were but a few scattered cells left.

Letters separated from themselves, and then, with another rip dividing the letter into four pieces, became hardly readable.

Upon closer inspection, the Orpo agent located a series of bugs across the local HQ, and immediately suspected foul play. The agent prepared false information for BLACK EAGLE, and upon leak of false information (and the contained ink-cartridge), BLACK EAGLE was revealed to be [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] was immediately arrested and eliminated. No personal effects were noted in possession of BLACK EAGLE at time of arrest.\n\nUpon search of an apartment inhabited by BLACK EAGLE at [REDACTED], Buxtehude, an information cache and radio-communications systemed codenamed "EVIL EYE". Much of EVIL EYE is deeply encoded and largely unusable without the proper knowledge of how to operate the fairly esoteric, specialized equipment (BLACK EAGLE is known to our government as the son of an SS radioman), though through careful analysis of EVIL EYE, we have managed to garner significant knowledge of the norms of Burgundian information gathering programs.\n\nWith your authorization, we shall pass the knowledge of EVIL EYE onto Wehrmacht leadership.

Unfortunately, we believe that at the time of DIREWOLF's arrest, they were carrying sensitive documentation that may have exposed the operational norms of SIDEWINDER. If the Burgundians do in fact have possession over DIREWOLF's SIDEWINDER files, it is certain that they will have a massive leg up in this so-called "Shadow War" and any potential military operations to follow.\n\nDIREWOLF's mission was to locate and eliminate BLACK EAGLE, a known Burgundian intelligence asset that fled to Nord-Paris upon an Orpo agent locating a series of bugs in an Orpo HQ. The status of BLACK EAGLE is currently unknown, but it is suspected that DIREWOLF was captured before being able to carry out their mission. This is a major failure in German intelligence, and may ultimately jeopardize the entirety of Fall Schwartz, though that is obviously a decision to be made by Wehrmacht leadership.\n\nDeutschland über alles."

The two assembled groups could not be more disparate - the locals were swathed in loose white robes, the visitors already becoming uncomfortably damp in their grey and black woolen suits. The only aspect in common was their penchant for dark sunglasses. At an unspoken signal, the representatives broke from their packs and approached one another.\n\nReichsminister Artur Axmann responded to the "Assalaam 'alaikum" with a jumbled and stilted "Wa 'alaikum assalaam". With foreign pleasantries out of the way, he more confidently extended his hand and switched to German. "It is a pleasure to finally reach your great kingdom. Führer Göring extends the hand of friendship to King Faisal and all of the Arabian people."\n\nThe Arab diplomat nodded graciously. "And likewise, the King and all of his family send their best wishes to the Führer and his Reich. We trust your landing was not too rough - the King Abdulaziz International Airport is still under construction, but by its completion it will be the greatest airport in all Arabia."\n\nAxmann cast his gaze around. Indeed, it seemed as though the hand of god had lifted construction equipment from Germania itself and dropped it into the middle of the desert. The scale of construction was vast, sprawling into the edges of Jeddah itself. The town was expanding at the rate of knots - even from the air, one could see the pace of it's growth, spilling over its boundaries like a flood. Yes, the House of Saud could prove a valuable ally, if they could be appropriately wooed. He had his doubts about the Führer's choice not to use a show of force to cow the Sauds into submission, but he did as Göring thought best.

"Indeed, Germany's assertion of it's sphere of influence has been deeply impressive - however, the question of our own Kingdom's role in the area must be raised. While Persia is indeed a naturally Aryan domain, there exist states in the Persian Gulf, formerly under Italian dominion, that have long yearned for independence.

Axmann was discussing the great scale of construction in Germania at length, though strategically failing to mention it's advanced decrepitude in the less desirable areas. Muhammad Abdullah laughed politely, and brought his own anecdote to the table, smoothly flowing into a request.\n\n"I do wish to one day see the great city of Germania, for its riches are told of across the globe.

The former Italian client state has realigned itself with the Reich, becoming an equal partner and avoiding the grim fate of its neighbours. With the treaty signed, there was an official exchange of gifts. To the Reich was presented a beautifully ornate scimitar, upon which was inscribed many blessings and prayers towards the Führer's health and wellbeing.

An end to negotiations meant an end to his stay, and an explanation for his failure to reach terms. Of course, there always remained the possibility of badmouthing his hosts - more like than not an invasion had been inevitable, he had always said so.\n\n"I thank you and King Faisal deeply for your hospitality, Mohammed Abdullah.

Once the entirety of Asia separated us from the Reich's Eastern Front, now Mongolian border patrols regularly encounter their Russian counterparts enforcing the boundaries of the All Russian Military League, the Reich's stalking horse in Siberia. The constant conquests of the Reich will inevitably reach the Co-Prosperity Sphere in a matter of months, and Russia will be the front line.\n\nThe Russians however are no more eager to take part in this conquest than we are to attempt to repel it. Whilst the All Russian Military League is nominally a collaborationist state, control over this vast area is weak and true collaborators are few and far between given Germany's reputation. The Reich considers them little more than cannon fodder at best and unworthy of life at worst. Messages have travelled across the steppe, carried by Russian and Mongolian horsemen, that suggest the League would be much happier working with Japan than Germany.\n\nTo steal Russia from under the Reich's nose would no doubt be considered an act of war, but war is all but inevitable. With Russian aid the front line would be much further from our own border, slowing the Reich's relentless advance and hopefully bogging them down in the Russian Hell once more."

It was not to be, however - word has reached us of efforts by the All Russian Military League to contact the Japanese government through their shared border in Mongolia. Naturally they are forbidden from all foreign communication, so this can only be an attempt to curry favour and secede to the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nNo Japanese reply was recorded - evidently the Asiatics are smart enough to see the foolishness of stealing from the Reich. Nonetheless, this treason demands punishment. These Russians really never learn."

 goering.1703.t:0 "베히모스와 레비아탄 사이에서"
 goering.1703.d:0 "Johannes Steinhoff entered the office to the drum of soft flesh on wood. It was the Führer of course, his thick fingers restlessly bouncing against the surface of the table over and over in an erratic rhythm. The veteran pilot noted that each digit was crowned with at least one jeweled ring. The value of the man's hands must have been worth more than an ME262. The 262; thinking about the jet had been a mistake. He felt himself once again in the cockpit, the sickening drop, the blinding flash. Then the fire, the awful flames that he could feel even now.\n\nIt took a supreme effort to regain his bearings. That was the past he reminded himself. That was the past and this is the present that must be focused on. If the corpuscular despot noticed the inner monologue, he didn't announce it. Instead, he gestured to a chair. Once the ace had seated himself comfortably, he plunged into the question that had been hanging above them this whole time.\n\n"My Fuhrer, while I deeply appreciate the trust you seem to place in me, I am still unsure as to why you want me specifically to lead your Luftwaffe."\n\nTo his surprise, Fuhrer Goring smiled, "Ah straight down to business, eh? I like that in a subordinate you know. Always good to get right to the important parts and leave small talk for later, yes that's just what I require."\n\nHe began to say something else, but stopped himself, looking to Steinhoff as if he might be nervous about something.\n\n"The truth is General Steinhoff..." he was quieter now, almost conspiratorial, "the truth is that I need someone who isn't beholden to either the butcher or the pissant by my side."\n\nSchorner and Speidel - the realization dawned on Johannes, the Fuhrer was apparently not fond of his top officers it seemed.\n\n"It will be a tall task no doubt, but I offer to spare no expense for my Luftwaffe you understand. Anything you want, you'll have no questions asked. Nominally of course you'll have to report to Generalfeldmarschall Schorner at OKW really you'll be answerable to me and me alone. Just send him some paperwork every now and again and I'll keep him off you. So, what do you say?""
 goering.1703.a:0 ""I suppose I don't have much of a choice.""

 goering.1704.t:0 "The Pencil Pushing Admiral"
 goering.1704.d:0 ""So, what do you think, Admiral Puttkamer?" The Führer studied the face of his guest, looking for a hint of the demanded decision. As usual, Puttkamer kept his poker face. Or maybe it was just indifference? In all their years together the old Reichsmarschall had never been able to parse out how much of the inscrutability Adolf's old adjutant exuded was a matter of personal policy or as simple disinterest. He briefly wondered if he had born a similar expression in those days when he had taken to the morphine needle. No, he decided after a little thought, even in the worst of his stupor he had always had the flame of ambition and the will to carry it forward. Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer was nothing like him.\n\nSo why then was he giving such a man the reins of the Kriegsmarine? Rather, what was left of the Kriegsmarine following the defections and the blow of Dönitz's mutiny anyhow. Göring could have given a dozen public-ready answers at that moment: the man had served Adolf impeccably, he had a long and distinguished career, on and on. The truth however was far simpler. The man had no ambition whatsoever. Even the humblest of clerks in the Reich's government knew that the new Führer was, to put it politely, not very interested in the functioning of the navy. That meant it was best left to someone else to manage, and better a man with little desire to abuse his authority than one hungry for more power. Never another Dönitz, that was Göring's sole criteria when he began his search, and it was the criteria he followed when he landed on Puttkamer.\n\n"I just want to remind you," the heavy-set dictator said softly, noticing the lack of response to the ultimate question, "that I do not intend to bother you on your duties. Nor will General Schörner be given free reign either. You will of course report to him, but that doesn't mean he has any more desire to manage your affairs than I do. Frankly, I'd consider it a great favor for you to remove the navy from all this factional bickering once and for all."\n\nPuttkamer nodded slowly, almost... thoughtfully.\n\nThat was all Göring needed, an acceptance, whether Puttkamer had realized it or not. With profuse thanks he escorted his new Grossadmiral to the door. For his part, Puttkamer put up no resistance, seemingly consigned to his new role. Good, Göring thought as he closed the door to his office, he hated when things were made difficult."
 goering.1704.a:0 "Who even needs Dönitz?"

 goering.1705.t:0 "The Hard Sell"
 goering.1705.d:0 ""My Führer, I must again insist that I do not feel as though I would be the best candidate to assume the position, especially in light of who my superior would be."\n\nGöring glared at the old war hero. Hours of this damnable stalemate was making him frustrated and irritable. Not for the first time he considered directly ordering Speidel to assume control of OKH, but then that would have to be an absolute last resort. He needed the general to agree to take the position and needed him to, if not enjoy his place in the new regime, be a check against Schörner.\n\nSpeidel must have thought that ended it, he began to rise from his chair. That made Göring snap, "Damnit general, do you not understand the stakes at play here? Do you think this is all about personal pride and pleasure? It isn't!"\n\nSpeidel's annoyance was written across his face. He clearly resented this lecture. Göring knew he had to make an all or nothing attempt if he wanted to salvage the situation.\n\n"Listen general, if you wish to serve the Reich and its people in the most effective way, then you must accept. Do you wish to see the entire Wehrmacht in the hands of Schörner? I certainly don't but it seems you do, if you'd simply walk away at this opportunity to limit his influence. Accept, and we can work together to make sure he isn't the only voice in my ear."\n\nThat got Speidel to stop. He responded slowly, thoughtfully, "If I were to accept, and that's only an if at this point, I would need some guarantees of non-interference from Schörner if the goal is to actually be effective in my position-. Would that be possible?"\n\nThe Führer smiled; he had Speidel hooked. "I can't guarantee a miracle but I should be able to wring out some concessions for your autonomy."\n\nSpeidel sighed, nodded, "The things we do for the Reich...""

 goering.1706.t:0 "A Proposal at Carinhall"
 goering.1706.d:0 "Gaspard had delivered a meal as splendid as always. The Führer made a mental note to reward Carinhall's resident chef, maybe he would even give the slaves who assisted him a day or two off. He was feeling magnanimous after such a lovely dinner. But enjoying his meal, even an excellent one, was not the purpose of the night. No, the purpose was the two men who flanked Göring on either side of the table. On his right sat Albert Bormann, the loyal brother, and to his left was seated his nephew Heinz Theodore. The pair also seemed to be savoring the experience.\n\n"Uncle, the roast beef is exquisite, I've never had it served so well before. Your cook will have to give mine the recipe one of these days."\n\nGoring smiled, "Thank you Theodore, but the food can be discussed later, I think. Right now I need to ask both of you," he motioned for Albert to join the conversation, "to prove your loyalty to me."\n\nAlbert, always trying to make up for his familial shame, was predictably quick to respond, "Of course my, Führer, whatever it is you need we will provide. I swear we are both your devoted servants."\n\nTheodore lamely nodded along, never one for having much in the way of independent thought. That would actually help in this case however.\n\n"My friends, the Reich is at a crossroads. We may have triumphed in the civil war but I must still contend with the Wehrmacht. They believe I owe my position to their efforts alone! Knowing that tenacious bastard Schorner, they will never let me forget it. That's where you two come in. I need men I can absolutely trust within the high command, men willing to keep me updated on everything the generals do. Gentlemen, can I count on your service?""
 goering.1706.a:0 "There could only be one answer to the Führer."

 goering.1707.t:0 "King of the Abwehr"
 goering.1707.d:0 "As he strutted into Hermann Göring's office, Reinhard Gehlen noticed the Führer seemed somewhat nervous. It was a rare state to see him in, and Gehlen wondered what had occurred to induce it. He would have his men look into it. Before he could further ponder it, however, the Führer addressed him. "Herr Gehlen. Welcome. I trust you mean to accept my offer? The Abwehr is in need of a new chief soon, and if you do not intend to take the position, I will need to begin searching for a suitable alternative immediately."\n\n"There is no need for that." Gehlen responded, curtly. "I intend to take the position, of course." He noticed the Führer's eyes wandering towards the door, so he glanced over his shoulder. There was no one there. His attention turned back to Göring, who had begun to focus rather intently on Gehlen instead. "However, if I may ask... is there a reason this promotion was not offered to me by Feldmarschall Schörner? The Abwehr is within his purview, is it not?"\n\nGöring looked as if Gehlen had slapped him. "I am the goddamn fucking Führer, and I appoint who I please." His voice was a quiet hiss, as if he did not want any outburst to be overheard. The Führer glanced at the door once again, before continuing, more calmly. "Schörner may cut your checks and take credit for your work, but as long as I am Führer, you report to me first. Is that understood?" Göring's eyes bored into the spymaster, a mix of domineering and desperate. Gehlen, suddenly having gained a much clearer understanding of what was occurring, quickly nodded."
 goering.1707.a:0 "Yes, my Führer."

 goering.1708.t:0 "From the Homefront"
 goering.1708.d:0 "The air screamed with the sounds of the machinery as production line upon production line produced the weapons of conquest and death. Jon hadn't heard the Dresden factory shriek out this much for almost a decade now. Even during the civil war, the factory had been quieter. What that meant for the future, the slave shuddered to imagine. He had seen the horrors of war firsthand, as his beloved Poland was crushed under the Nazi boot all those years ago. No one deserved such a fate.\n\nThe conveyor belt sent more half-assembled grenades his way, waiting for final assembly. It was then that the idea came to him. It was a foolish, brazen idea. But Jon had always been a daredevil in his youth. It was the memories of those days in the streets of Lublin, getting into mischief with tinkering with the watches in his father's shop that drove him forward. A modification here, an adjustment there, and the grenades would detonate much sooner. WIth any luck, they'd take whatever Nazi bastard was throwing them to Hell.\n\nThey had made the factories to be as efficiently possible, producing as much material as they could wring out through slave labor. For the first time since being sent to the damned place, Jon was happy about that fact. He was producing the defective explosives at a truly prodigious rate. Even the foreman seemed impressed, granting him an extra hour of rest for his efforts. Jon almost laughed out loud, but kept his composure and facade of submission.\n\nJon had long ago abandoned his faith, but he prayed to God now, for the nations of the world. He prayed his contribution to their defence would be felt; one life saved was all he asked for."

Goering_ostland_category_kovner_desc:0 "오스트란트에 최악의 상황이 닥친 듯 합니다. 연합 파르티잔 유격조직(UPO)를 이끄는 미친 놈 아바 코브너를 보십시오. 우리가 서두르지 않는다면 그는 손에 닿는 모든 독일인들을 도륙할 것입니다. 우리는 오스트란트의 독일인들이 학살당하기 전에 이 미친놈을 막아야 합니다!"

Goering_ostland_category_jeckeln_desc:0 "오스트란트 내전은 SS가 승리한 것 같지만, 예켈른과 부르군트의 그놈이 자축할 날은 별로 남지 않았습니다. 우리가 아는 SS는 독일 밖에 있는 반역자들의 집단으로, 총통보다 검은 개 하이드리히와 힘러에게 더 충성을 바치고 있습니다. 우리는 이들이 국경에서 소요사태를 일으키지 못하도록 할 것입니다!"

Goering_ostland_category_vituska_desc:0 "미할 비투쉬카는 확실히 오스트란트에서 싸운 모든 경쟁자들 중 가장 이상한 놈입니다. 그는 수십 년 동안 충실한 부역자였지만, 그는 비아리아인이며 오스트란트의 독일인들과 싸웠습니다. 우리는 그러한 반역죄를 신속히 짓밟을 것이지만, 우리와 협력하려는 자의 손은 잡아줄 것입니다..."

Goering_ostland_category_drechsler_desc:0 "오스트란트의 혼란은 가라앉은 것 같으며 운 좋게도 우리의 남자 오토 하인리히 드렉슬러가 정상에 올랐습니다. 국방군은 이를 축하하고 있으며 오스트란트는 라이히에 조속히 복속될 것으로 보입니다. 하지만, 드렉슬러는 군국주의자이며 엄밀히 말하면 총통의 사람은 아닙니다. 아마도 미래에 쇠르너에게서 장기말을 빼앗으려면 차라리 지금 그의 분노를 사는 것이 나을지도 모릅니다..."
Goering_ostland_category_stahlecker:0 "오스트빈트 작전"
