 CHL_idea_social_question_desc: "The Social Question refers to the issue of widespread poverty in Chile. A problem that has bedeviled the Republic since its inception, it has yet to show any sign of improvement.\n\nSince independence, successive different governments have sought different solutions to this intractable problem. Though there have been successes here and there, none of them have been enough to drive the problem away. As a result, poverty in Chile is a constant, grim reality visible in stark relief no matter where you go: from clustered apartments in cities to the poor, hapless peasants in the countryside, you cannot escape it. And that is not the end of it. It causes all sorts of societal ills: internal migrations, widespread illiteracy, and a constant need for investments to even prevent the issue from worsening.\n\nNo government, present or future, regardless of its political leanings, will be able to escape having to deal with this problem. If they do so, the consequences will be terrible."

 CHL_idea_political_fragmentation_alessandri_1_desc: "The Republic of Chile has been going through an incessant political crisis for the past twenty years, ever since the collapse of the last Radical governments.\n\nBetween the consolidation of mighty opposition blocs leading to a constant state of political siege and obstructionism, the militant inaction and inertia of the powerful Liberals, and, worst of all, the rapid and unparalleled growth of political extremism and violence has left this country paralyzed seemingly forever. In fact the youths of today cannot even remember the last time this country was stable.\n\nThe election of the technocratic reformer Jorge Alessandri to the Presidency of Chile and the initial stages of his mandate inspired the hopes of many Chileans: perhaps the crisis was coming to an end. But the political crisis after the Valdivia earthquake disaster only exacerbated it, and now Alessandri is left with a grim reality: He has polarized the FDC in his attempt to reform the country even slightly, and the unity of the Coalition is now barely hanging by a thread after the disaster that was the 1961 parliamentary elections."

 CHL_idea_economic_subservience_desc: "Since the late 19th century, the export-dependent economy of Chile combined with the long-standing foreign control over its markets have meant that the political and economic fate of the country are often tied to the whims of external, often unfriendly parties.\n\nBe it the British in the past, the Americans, or more recently the Japanese, Chile is being pulled in multiple directions by opposing forces that threaten to break apart the country like it has been so many times beforehand."
 CHL_idea_agrarian_timebomb: "Agrarian Timebomb"
 CHL_idea_agrarian_timebomb_desc: "The South of Chile has been described with many adjectives: \"diverse\", \"populous\", \"unique\" come to mind given the presence of countless ethnicities and people in a way not heard of even in the immigrant nations of America and Canada. More recently, however, analysts have taken to using a rather negative metaphor to describe this same region: \"ticking timebomb\". These words soft-pedal the reality that the South of Chile is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nBetween the rising discontent of the destitute peasantry forced to live in quasi-feudal conditions on haciendas straight out of the old colonial age, the increasing cries for agrarian reform, and the increasing strength of political extremists in the region, the South seems to be only a spark away from being figuratively and possibly even literally immolated in the fires of discord and anger."

 CHL_idea_rural_collapse_desc: "Fire. Fire is the only constant for Southern Chile. Larded with fire, engulfed in smoke, the curt chuffs of choking livestock can't be heard for the gunfire. The burning forests release extremists who lynch and sack to the noise of percussive explosions. The fields burn, food is scarce; the red haze is a suffocating blanket that smothers the South - a diet of hate. The only surviving political discourse is assassination, and any government action should be taken with great caution, lest the collapse creep north."

A close friend of his from their time together in the cabinet of President Fernando Alessandri, he is the serving Minister of the Interior. As a medical doctor, del Río has had a lifelong trajectory of public service in medicine and its assorted related fields. Returning to Chile in the late 20s after studying in Europe, del Río became Minister of Social Wellbeing under President Montero after the collapse of the Ibáñez government and the anarchy that followed it. His brief term mainly focused on setting up soup kitchens and shelters until Montero was overthrown and a series of coups followed it.\n\nThe passage of a decade found him in the same spot in the cabinet of President Ríos, wherein he built up hospitals and did his best to help destitute children and youths. During the administration of Fernando Alessandri, he served as Minister of Health and got to know and befriend the then Finance Minister, Jorge Alessandri. Now he serves as Minister of the Interior and his friend's second-in-command.\n\nDespite their personal closeness, however, Alessandri begins to feel doubts about his friend. Sótero del Río is altogether too combative for his own good, making mountains out of molehills with his anger and managing to create unending bureaucratic nightmares and political controversy, forcing Alessandri to clean up after him and causing increasing doubts in his superior's mind.§!"

While the Liberals had desired the Ministry of Economics, Alessandri refused to countenance any reduction in Julio Philippi's role in that office. Therefore, Maschke acts as the main man of the establishment in the government. Of course, that may not be forever: for better or for worse, positions in the Alessandri administration are constantly subject to change.

 POLITICS_ALESSANDRI_DESC: "Jorge Alessandri has always said he didn't want to be President. Indeed, it wasn't his fault that he was born the son of Arturo Alessandri, and brother of Fernando Alessandri, both men famous Presidents in their own time, inheriting all the baggage it entailed. It wasn't his fault that he spent part of his youth in exile, ruining what should have been a blossoming social side to his life. It wasn't his fault that the most powerful earthquake in recorded history hit in the middle of his administration, snapping his plans in two. If he had it his way, Jorge would have been an architect, or at least led a quiet life- and it could have been so, if not for pressure and incredible chance.\n\nIt started with a favor to his brother, President Fernando - sitting at the bottom of a steep collapse in copper prices, begging Jorge to take over as Minister of Finance - not just for him, but for Chile. His successes saved the economy, but infuriated the unions - massive protests broke out, shattering Liberal dominance of the Democratic Convention. Even after his brother left office, Alessandri remained as an advisor for President Coloma, his Conservative successor - again, a favor for Chile, nothing more than that. It's that same logic that made him take up the battle for the FDC's next leader, despite his distaste for politics - for Chile needed a compromise leader to turn the radicals back, and who was better suited for it than him?\n\nDespite his protests, though, the state of Chile today is Jorge Alessandri's fault. It's nobody's fault but his for refusing to bow out to the Conservatives in 1958, splitting the coalition and destroying his own power base. It's nobody's fault but his that his apolitical, technocratic stabilization programs, while successful on paper, have only kept the citizenry poor and angry towards the FDC's status quo. It's nobody's fault but his that the FDC's apparatus wheezed its way through the 1961 elections, suffering a terrible defeat and forcing further compromises.\n\nTwo years remain on Alessandri's reign, and the country is as polarized, poor, and chaotic as ever. He sits on a throne made of molten glass, crackling and burning away at him, scorching hot as he doggedly fights back against the creeping resignation to fate he feels. No matter how he complains, though, he refuses to make another mistake - one ignorant error means Chile's throne will shred him with its flaming shards, and may just take the country with him. After all, what was the point of all this, if it was not for Chile?"
 CHL_Julio_Philippi: "훌리오 필리피 이스키에르도"
 POLITICS_PHILIPPI_DESC: "In 1959, being Jorge Alessandri's hand-picked successor would mean certain victory. In 1963, it seemed to mean humiliating defeat. Yet, as the Alessandri administration packs its bags, it leaves with that very same successor in charge - Julio Philippi, once the Minister of Justice, now President of Chile.\n\nAlessandri and Philippi share many similarities, when one looks at them together. Neither men are driven by political desire, both being independents and generally uninvolved in parliamentary games. Both are stoic, quiet men, shying away from grand speeches in favor of muted policy proposals. Both see the Presidency not as a grand personal achievement, but as a service they take for the good of the nation. It's no wonder Alessandri has stuck behind his Minister for so long.\n\nHowever, these men are not the same, despite the opposition's attempts to paint them otherwise. Philippi, in contrast to Alessandri's cold demeanor, is a friendly and approachable man. He is both passionate and deeply knowledgeable about the subjects that interest him, like botany, ornithology, geography, and other academic pursuits. Most importantly of all, Philippi's management of the Valdivia Earthquake's recovery earned him great favor with the people for its smooth competence.\n\nDespite his differences, though, it will take great effort for the new President to escape his predecessor's shadow. His independent affiliation and general disconnect from party politics cuts both ways - giving him freedom to make his own decisions, based on what he thinks is best, but stoking fears of yet more inaction and gridlock if he can't build bridges. Similarly, his technocratic leanings were a major part of earning Alessandri's endorsement, but those measures are controversial at best. With his demeanor and positions, many fear - even expect - that Philippi will soon be swallowed up by the whirlwind of Chilean politics, disappearing below ideologues far more committed to their cause than he is.\n\nPerhaps it is telling that, in the furor around the ascension of a new President, nobody seems to be bothering to ask the President himself what he thinks. For what it's worth, he enters office with a dogged determination to prove something long considered an impossibility - that an honest public servant can succeed in Chile's highest office. Whether his assertion is correct remains to be seen."
 CHL_Hugo_Zepeda: "우고 세페다 바리오스"
 POLITICS_ZEPEDA_DESC: "When he was young, Hugo Zepeda found himself in a difficult position. He was an independent representative in a time where the Liberals dominated Chile, and a rare opportunity presented itself - an offer to switch sides, join the Liberals like his father before him had. Yet, something struck him as wrong about the whole situation. It was not that the seat he was running for was too hard to win - indeed, it was too easy. So easy, in fact, that Zepeda couldn't help but question the legitimacy of the whole charade, rejecting the offer out of hand to remain neutral.\n\nThe irony of leading the Liberal Party thirty years later, in a similar position as it was then, is not lost on many. It's certainly not lost on the new President.\n\nIndeed, his path here was as convoluted as any. He joined the Liberals only when the Radicals fell out of favor, reluctantly supporting Fernando Alessandri as he reluctantly supported his father years before. It was his influence that swung the Liberal Party to Alessandri's side, guaranteeing his victory and the FDC's ascension. Not only did this make him a major player in party politics, but it led to his ascension as President of the Liberal Party, which he would use to its full effect.\n\nChile, however, had no interest in peace and calm . The chaos of 1957 led to Zepeda replacing the assassinated Senator Raúl Marín Balmaceda, granting him undisputed control over the Liberals, and his considerable influence over Jorge Alessandri led to many favorable compromises - at least, until Alessandri's stubborn intransigence finally tore the FDC to pieces. The disparate right wing of Chile, left rudderless in the hurricane, cried out for leadership to guide them - and, just at the right time, Zepeda was there.\n\nLeading Chile in its current state will be no easy feat. Poverty rates are still sky-high, polarization is tearing the nation apart, and the slow creep of restrictions on civil liberties moves ever closer. Zepeda plans to use his stern, dignified manner to tackle these problems, but such measures are easier said than done - Alessandri's glass throne waits patiently for its new occupant, as charged and dangerous as ever."
 CHL_Salvador_Allende: "살바도르 아옌데 고센스"
 POLITICS_SALVADOR_ALLENDE_DESC: "One of Salvador Allende's favorite jokes was that his gravestone would read \"Here lies Salvador Allende, next President of Chile\". Looking at his bad luck when it came to national campaigning, that sense of fatalism seemed well placed. A handy defeat in 1952 and a brutal mess of parliamentary scheming snatching his victory away in 1958 attest to it. Today, though, next is now.\n\nAllende's views were self-developed, breaking away from his wealthy background to pursue the ideals he would fight for throughout the 20s in student activism as Chile tore itself apart. He carved a path through the Chilean left's greatest moments, starting in Marmaduke Grove's short-lived Socialist Republic and follow-up Socialist Party, which Allende has run under in each of his campaigns. Next came Pedro Aguirre Cerda's Popular Front, whose electoral campaign Allende helped manage to success, earning him a position as Minister of Health - at least, until Aguirre Cerda died halfway through his term, collapsing the Front and ejecting the Socialists on their own once more. Now with governmental experience, Allende's star rose higher, to a point - he could not get over the hump of the Presidency. A coalition was formed with the Radicals, forming the FRAP in an effort to win in 1958. Allende will always say it should have been him who was elected, thanks to his slim majority in the popular vote, but fate and Parliament said otherwise.\n\nThis time, though, no back-room deals could deny Allende his due. In a total political upheaval, Allende has finally emerged victorious, ready to implement the Chilean Path to Socialism that he has promised for decades. His supporters cheer him as a political messiah, the man who will finally break the cycle of chaos and poverty that has consumed Chile for as long as anyone can remember. His opponents, on the other hand, see him as someone closer to the Devil, who will drive Chile into the grave in pursuit of a socialist dictatorship. Above the radical polarization in the streets, the Army watches and fractures, polarization tearing into its solid apolitical foundations.\n\nSupporter, opponent, military - all are armed, paranoid, and readying to kill and die for their idea of Chile. The Sword of Damocles hangs over Don Chicho's head, but he holds a weapon of his own. Everything he ever dreamed of is in his grasp, but he will need to fight to keep hold of it - maintain his power, prevent the nation from total collapse, and even protect his own life."
 CHL_Eduardo_Frei: "에두아르도 프레이 몬탈바"
 POLITICS_FREI_MONTALVA_DESC: "Eduardo Frei is no stranger to the spotlight. He's reveled in it for decades now, part activist and part politician, constantly showing up at Chile's most crucial moments. It's just like him that, as the nation reaches some of its most fraught years yet, Frei is there to take power as the next President of Chile.\n\nFrei's name first became relevant three decades ago, a critical student leader during the overthrow of the Ibáñez dictatorship. In the chaotic aftermath of the revolution, he used that earned influence to form dissatisfied conservative youths into the National Falange, which, after briefly flirting with Spanish-style national syndicalism, drifted towards Christian democracy. He would then briefly join the collapsing Rios cabinet as Minister of Public Works in 1945, before breaking with him during the deepening political crisis that same year, only further boosting his popularity. His break with the Radicals would lead to the approach of the Falange into the Conservative wing of the FDC, in which he would slowly gain influence and power over the next decade. With his reformist, Social Christian views, all seemed set for his nomination and victory in 1958 as their champion - had Jorge Alessandri and Jorge Prat not intervened, collapsing the FDC and slicing Frei's political legs out from under him. Furious, Frei became one of Alessandri's harshest critics - a fine position to be in as the unpopular President's administration crashed and burned. With general consensus among Conservatives, centrists, and even some Liberals behind his next campaign, Frei would finally get his due, sweeping into office in 1964 at the crest of a wave of change.\n\nFrei has no intention of letting his spotlight slip away, of course. How could he, now at his greatest moment? As he forms his cabinet and solidifies his connections, debates echo through the streets as to what the new leader has in store. Is he just another lukewarm conservative reformist, or does he truly mean what he says? Is he a progressive who will be remembered positively, or will he ignore the problems that plague the nation? Will he conform to traditions, or forge his own path? These questions can only be answered by Frei himself, and he's committed to answering them as well as he can."
 CHL_Jorge_Prat: "호르헤 프라트 에차우렌"
 POLITICS_PRAT_ECHAURREN_DESC: "Before Jorge Prat, there was Arturo Prat. His heroic death at the Battle of Iquique during the War of the Pacific made him into a national icon, a martyr for Chile who has been enshrined with a holiday, and endless glory in the eyes of the citizenry. Jorge Prat may never be able to live up to the bar his grandfather set, but it will not be for lack of trying.\n\nUnlike figures like Allende and Frei, Prat's experiences in the 20's struck him in a much different way. He saw a nation divided and helpless, at the mercy of foreign powers, unable to move forwards thanks to petty squabbles. It was this inaction that would lead him to the National Socialist Movement, but their incompetence and their leader quickly disillusioned him, and he defected to the much more mainstream Conservatives. His name certainly did him favors, leading the youth wing of the party through the turbulent 40's. His unique blend of corporatist, portalian, and apolitical rhetoric gave him a loyal base of followers as he pushed for a uniting figure to lead Chile, eventually earning him the Ministry of Justice under the Coloma administration. While his standard plank appealed to conservatives, his push for women's suffrage during his post earned him the support of many influential women in Chile, including his now key ally María de la Cruz, turning him into an attractive successor for the conservatives in the FDC and for the progressives outside it as Coloma's administration shook with instability. It was here, of course, that the fateful battle with Alessandri and Frei broke the coalition apart, and Prat was left with little more than his supporters to push him forwards.\n\nPush they have, however, and Prat's opposition to Alessandri's administration left him in prime position to unite the right wing and take victory from his challengers. For the first time in decades, a true Conservative holds the reins, and Prat has no interest in letting his opportunity go to waste - already, he stumps for new solutions to old problems, promising that reform in Congress, unity, and order are what Chile needs. It will be difficult, taking on the great powers that make up the establishment of Chilean politics, but when Jorge Prat looks up at his grandfather's portrait, he knows it's what the old hero would want."
