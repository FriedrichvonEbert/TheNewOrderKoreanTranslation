 POLITICS_SOBHUZA_II_DESC:0 "Having inherited the throne when he was merely months old, Ngwenyama Sobhuza II of Eswatini is one of the longest reigning monarchs in the history of the world. He helped see to the full independence of Eswatini in 1953, and today rules skillfully, aligning his interests with those of South Africa against the Germans. Sobhuza II has seen other monarchs be born, be crowned, and be buried, and still he leads his people into one decade after another. It is likely that he will continue to reign for many years to come."
