 POLITICS_TROFIM_LYSENKO_DESC: "트로핌 리센코는 한때 소비에트 연방에서 사회주의 과학의 금송아지같은 존재로 칭송받았습니다. 마침내 미천한 프롤레타리아 과학자들이 부르주아 체제가 만들어낸 반동적 \"교육 체계\"를 무너트리는데 성공했습니다! 그는 마르크스주의 원칙이 인간 사회뿐만 아니라 지구의 과실에도 적용된다는 사실을 입증해 냈습니다! 그의 이론은 농경학을 혁명화하고 소비에트 연방을 세계 농업계의 거물로 변화시킬 것입니다!\n\n적어도 약속은 그렇게 했었죠.\n\n정책이 상당히 실망스러운 성과를 거두던 와중에 전쟁이 터져버렸고, 이로 인해 그는 손쉽게 심각한 결과에서 벗어날 수 있었습니다. 소련군 전선이 박살나자 리센코와 그에게 충성을 바치는 과학자들의 파벌은 자신들이 이룬 \"필수적 연구물\"이 파시스트의 손에 들어가는 사태를 막기 위해 제22 NKVD 차량화소총사단을 이끌고 동부로 도망쳤습니다. 연방이 해체되자 리센코 자신은 현재 지지자가 없다는 사실을, 22사단은 아무런 명령권자가 없다는 사실을 눈치챘고 두 집단은 빠르게 동맹을 체결했습니다. 리센코는 22사단 지휘관들을 설득해 만에 하나 연방이 실제로 존재하지 않는 국가가 되었다 하더라도 자신의 실험이 연방을 유지시키기 위해 반드시 필요하며, 이를 위해서는 새로운 연구 시설이 필요다하는 신념을 심어주었습니다. 서러시아 혁명 전선을 위해 일하던 와중에 (나중에 혁명 전선을 떠나기는 합니다) 자신들만의 천국이자 버려진 공업 도시인 마그니도고르스크를 발견했고, 한때 황폐했던 검은 산을 연구와 과학적 혁신의 중심지로 변모시켰습니다.\n\n하지만 리센코는 진화에 관해서 사이비 라마르크주의적 시각을 포기한 적이 한번도 없으며 자신의 신념이 맞다고 증명하기 위해 시간과 자원을 계속해서 쏟아부었습니다. 그리고 연방이 이렇게 무너진 상황에서 그의 이론이 인간에게도 적용된다는 사실을 증명한다면 군사 부문에서 이득을 취할 수도 있을 것입니다..."
 POLITICS_STEPAN_BUNKOV_DESC: "제22 NKVD 차량화소총사단의 대체할 수 없는 지휘관 스테판 미하일로비치 분코프는 소비에트 연방이 독일 탱크 아래에서 박살난 이후에도 계속 모국을 충성스럽게 섬겨왔습니다. 그가 향하는 길이 리센코가 걸어온 길과 정확히 어떻게 교차되었는지는 거의 알려지지 않았지만, 크렘린에서 분코프 동지에게 모스크바 함락 직전에 과학기술분야의 인텔리겐치아를 우랄로 대피시켜 러시아의 심장이 침략자의 발 밑에 짓밟힌 이후에도 조국을 위해 노동할 수 있도록 하라는 명령을 받았다는 설이 가장 유력합니다. 여행의 결과로 소비에트 연방의 후계자를 자칭한 이들에게 절대 환영받지 못했던 리센코는 마침내 추방된 과학자 집단 사이에서 지배권을 확립했고, NKVD사단을 자신이 마음대로 휘두를 수 있는 억압과 공포의 무기로 만들어 버렸습니다.\n\n마그니토고르스크게 도착항 이후로 분코프는 리센코가 최선의 판단을 내리라고 믿으며 리센코의 명령에 따라 수많은 잔혹행위에 가담했습니다. 하지만 리센코의 실험이 날이 갈수록 잔인해지고 미쳐가자 분코프는 리센코가 소비에트 방식을 회복하는데 장애물이 된다고 생각할 정도로 마그니토고르스크의 과학자 엘리트 집단에 대해 의심과 반대 의견을 품기 시작했습니다. 분코프는 이전 상관에게 조치를 취했고 리센코를 축출해냈습니다. 짧은 통치 기간 동안 분코프는 리센코주의자가 가져온 악몽을 대부분 끝장내고 리센코 치하에서 계속되던 무정부상태를 끝내기 위해 옛 소비에트 체제를 재건하려 시도했습니다. 하지만 그가 국가에서 통제력을 확실히 잡고 있다면서 반대파를 다루는데 잔인한 방법에 의존한다고 비난하는건 적절하지 않습니다."

 MGN.608.desc: "Objective: Create a viable specimen adapted to low-level oxygen conditions, with an emphasis on survivability against chemical weapons.\n\nSubject: One (1) male, aged 16. Extracted from XXXXXXXXXX, near Svetlogorsk.\n\nProcedure: Subject's oxygen supply was reduced over the course of ten hours, at a rate of 7% per hour. Subject was initially calm after being placed in the testing chamber, though after two hours began to show signs of distress. This distress can likely be attributed to a lack of human contact and anxiety stemming from confinement. After four hours, subject began to complain of lightheadedness and fatigue. Around the six hour mark, subject shifted repeatedly between consciousness and unconsciousness, and preparations were made for the second stage of the test. Subject fell unconscious after roughly XXX hours (Although XXXXXX was observed in this state), and did not resume consciousness until retrieved from the chamber. Afterwards, subject was exposed to a nominally lethal dose of phosgene gas. Subject reported symptoms in line with baseline exposure and subsequently expired 26 hours after exposure. Autopsy of the subject revealed the lungs to be filled with fluid, in line with nominal exposure to phosgene gas.\n\nResult: Experimental regime failed to create a specimen capable of surviving common chemical weaponry.

He also mentions all the equipment they have that make them the best, from their various up to date rifles (outdated, but better than most other factions' rifles) to their explosives and their few vehicles.

 MGN.132.t: "The Super Soldiers rebel"
 MGN.132.desc: "The New Russian program has turned out to be a complete failure. Hundreds of tests, experiments, and conditioning have been shown to be a failure when we released them outside of their cells without proper understanding of their allies. It seems that our psychological conditioning with its brutal conditions were not the best way to have human Russian males fight on your side. When the New Russians rebelled, they were able to overpower and kill all the guards helping them with their transformation, before breaking through the prison section of the Mountain and spreading all over the facility. With the New Russian subjects turning against us, our facilities are on high alert. Already, some New Russians have had firefights with our guards, resulting in heavy casualties for our side with death rates higher for us than for the New Russians. Dr. Lysenko is currently in the main office chamber with our troops and makeshift gun nests ready to prepare for fire. We do not know if it will be enough, due to unconfirmed reports that the New Russians have acquired explosives from both sympathizers and outright break-ins through some of our scattered armories in the Black Mountain. If the New Russians are confirmed to have them, the chances of survival of Lysenko and the research and officer team are slim to none."

 MGN.133.desc: "\n\nWhen the old Union shattered in blood, flame, and German brutality, some of its shards fell further than others. One of those shards, what remained of the 24th NKVD Motorized Division, fell headlong into the choked darkness of Magnitogorsk. Under the leadership of the mad scientist Lysenko and his cronies, it closed itself off to the world. Trade convoys who entered the shadow never left, people disappeared from the fields and the trading posts. Whatever was going on in the Black Mountain stayed in the Black Mountain, almost certainly for worse, and we averted our eyes out of fear. But the time for wishful blindness is over.\n\nBorder patrols report a disturbing series of events; the noise of trucks, the popping off of rounds, even the occasional dull thump of an explosion, near our border with Lysenko. Shadows in the night appear and disappear on the border, and our scouts report disturbances in the local wildlife. Last night, under the fog, one of our guard posts went silent. No one has seen the man assigned to that post since before the incident, and volunteers for guard duty on that post have been...lacking in the aftermath.\n\nThe conclusion is clear; the beast on the Mountain is rousing from his dread slumber. And he looks to the West to satiate his hunger. Our generals recommend increasing defensive fortifications on the border and an upswing in training regimens to counter whatever Lysenko's clique is planning. But it's clear that the peace we once enjoyed can no longer be kept. When the Mountain moves, Muhammad must be ready. And so must we."

 MGN.134.desc: "Black Mountain, the pseudo-Communist pseudo-scientific state led by Trofim Lysenko has approached us. Sending a heavily armed ambassadorship in starched uniforms, they declared themselves the rightful successor to the Soviet Union's science program, a tenuous link seemingly fuelled entirely by the madness of a man who does not believe the Union ever fell, and demanded that we give them a tithe of men, women and children. After inquiring why, they stated that the people would be serving the Soviet Union, their rightful government, in advancing the cause of 'Socialist workers everywhere, by ensuring the continued advancement of Soviet science and advancement for use against the great enemy in Germany'. When further pressed to elaborate on what that actually meant, the soldiers, seemingly members of the NKVD, admitted this meant that they would be participating in 'scientific experiments' in order to make them stronger. To better fight the Germans.\n\nWhile these demands are patently ridiculous, and while any sane leader would refuse this outright, the soldiers of 'Comrade' Lysenko seem quite formidable. Still polishing the buttons on their khaki uniforms twenty years after the last order was given to do so.\n\nWe could refuse, should we choose, but are the lives of a few peasants truly worth such conflict?"

 MGN.200.desc: "The Committee's findings are summarized below. For a more in depth analysis of the background of the personnel concerned and disciplinary action inflicted on their units, refer to the attached disciplinary report.\n\nWeapons and military equipment secured by NKVD personnel must be requisitioned for use in training and storage. However, it has come to our attention that violation of this rule has been more widespread than previously believed. The incident on -DATE REDACTED- involving 130 NKVD personnel, a company in strength, has shown proved our initial estimations have been wrong. A communal punishment-rehabilitation is currently being carried out in holding facilities across our controlled lands. we are confident that more incidents will be revealed to us.\n\nSoviet-era military facilities, as noted in earlier reports, have recorded reduced yields from scavenging activities. It is now clear that this is due to widespread personal acquisition of equipment on a level beyond the individual. In some cases entire stocks of explosives and ammunition, sufficient to arm a battalion for a week, have been siphoned off for personal use and profit by NKVD personnel.\n\nMost disturbing is the testimony of Private -REDACTED-, involved in the incident mentioned above, on whom disciplinary punishments were carried out concurrent with questioning. According to him, his company received explicit sanction from an officer to carry out pilfering activities. This has disconcerting implications on the decay of morale within our own ranks, and structural reforms and disciplinary actions are recommended to ensure adherence to regulations in future events.\n\nFor a list of proposed disciplinary actions, refer to addendum 1.a.viii.

Others have more pragmatic arguments, specifically that the implementation of small arms with differing specifications will make squad-based combat less coordinated, with requirements of officers to consider the ability of individual soldiers' weapons rather than the whole squad.

 MGN.300.t: "The Elimination of the Southern Obstruction"
 MGN.300.desc: "Reports of resistance from forces identifying as the Dirlewanger Brigade (a.k.a the Black Bandits) have been steadily decreasing following the total collapse of their central leadership in the face of our offensive. Since the initiation of hostilities the unorganized nature of the bandit forces made them vulnerable for well coordinated assaults (for more information see after action reports on operations l-438 and z-19). This allowed the forces of the 22nd Motor Rifle Division to halt their attempted offensives with an 82 percent success rate and launch their own counter offensives into bandit territory. Bandit resistance increased measurably as they retreated further south, in all likelihood due their increasing proximity to their power bases and centers of command. This increase in resistance peaked during the fighting around Orsk (see population center file: Orsk) the unofficial capital of the bandit territory and the site of Dirlewanger's personal headquarters. Conflict was particularly intense within the urban center, but the disorganization of the bandit forces still proved their downfall as the city was surrounded and all resistance within was isolated and eventually terminated.\n\nWith the exception of several hit-and-run raids by isolated bandit groups (see patrol reports 1235, 7532, and 0192) all resistance within the region has come to an end and order is being reestablished. Members of the bandit command have been detained and are scheduled for transport for Magnitogorsk where they will be quarantined assigned to special testing procedures (see special test subject experimentation protocol guidelines). The remaining bandit prisoners are to be held until they can be examined to determine their suitability as potential test subjects. Though heavily damaged by the bandit occupation, the industrial resources of Orsk and the surrounding region will make useful additions to our own industrial base, and reconstruction is scheduled to begin soon."
 MGN.300.a: "Understood."
 MGN.301.t: "Removal of the Western Obstruction"
 MGN.301.desc: "Despite significant initial resistance, the Ural League has been eliminated as a source of opposition within the region. Following the efforts of the Ural Guard (see opposition force information files 7 and 12) to obstruct the retrieval of testing subjects from the western population centers, their removal was deemed necessary to continue pursuing multiple vital avenues of research. Due to their advanced training (see sub file 12-1 for details on Ural Guard training regimen) and the unfavorable combat conditions of the Ural mountains (see attached elevation map) the initial offensive operation did not prove as successful as hoped, with only 48 percent of units reaching their designated targets within the opening weeks. However, the superior manufacturing base and greater manpower pool of the greater Magnitogorsk area (see most recent census documents) proved decisive, as the Ural Guard were unable to keep their forces sufficiently reinforced and resupplied in periods of extended engagement. As the conflict progressed they were forced back until eventually all significant population centers in the southern Urals were secured and the Guard lacked any functioning command structure.\n\nThe newly acquired territory is low in both population and industrialization. The capture of large numbers of former Ural Guard members has made the conflict a net gain, despite heavy losses (see casualty record filings and equipment loss reports). It has been observed that the average Guard member displays significantly higher strength, stamina, and dexterity than the average inhabitant of the region(see experiment 1961-4-i for specifics). These qualities make them ideal testing candidates for many of the most important experiments being conducted at the Black Mountain involving physical and genetic manipulation. Already approximately 12,000 former Guard members have been identified and detained for transport to testing facilities. Acquisition teams have begun searching the former territory of the Ural league, as it is probable that large numbers of Guard remain in hiding."
 MGN.301.a: "Understood."
 MGN.302.t: "Acquisition of the Southwest Population Center"
 MGN.302.desc: "Resistance within the region surrounding the city of Orenburg (see population center file: Orenburg) has been successfully terminated following the defeat of the militias within the city itself. Despite numerical superiority of opposition forces, the equipment and experience disparity between the communal militias and the 22nd Motor Rifle Division made most attempts at resisting our advance towards the city futile, with 92 percent of offensive operations succeeding in meeting 50 percent or more of initial objectives. (See report collection z-81 for reports of successful defensive actions by communal forces during the conflict). Upon approaching the city, large-scale defensive measures were encountered, including conscripted peasants and hastily constructed barricades and trench networks. These measures, while effective in slowing the offensive by 33 percent, proved insufficient to halt operations entirely; the city was secured shortly after the former government disbanded and fled. Acquisition teams have been dispatched to locate and secure prominent members of said government (see specific testing subject objective list: Orenburg).\n\nThe city is the largest population center in the region (see population estimate files pending replacement by a census), and will allow for a much greater number of testing subjects to be acquired relative to previous measures. This is expected to allow for at least a 45 percent increase in overall testing due to increased subject availability. Additionally, the manufacturing and infrastructure of the region will prove a significant asset to the production capabilities of Magnitogorsk and the southern Urals as a whole as soon as integration and redistribution programmes are completed."

Some officers even knocked on Lysenko's office door and entered with requests to return to the older USSR roots, if only because they were sentimentally significant. If we pick the old USSR's methods, we would please our officers, but it would be at the expense of the effectiveness of the troops, and of the division's fighting capability.

Subjects were exposed to the following conditions: immersion in water at following extremes for XXXXXX on end, alternating between these for 10 sets; 66 degrees Celsius, followed by -XX degrees Celsius. Following this, the subjects were induced to run 40 meter sprints in a closed environment, and do jumping jacks in counts of 5. They were then injected with tetanus germs. Two months later, the experiment was carried out again. For the control group, no tetanus was injected.\n\nRationale: Muscle contractions and spasms are known to be great sources of strength; see attached our Medical Group's research on the phenomenon of tetanus cramps and their possible utility in our own physical experiments. It is theorized that if exposure to tetanus accompanies physical challenges, this will result in improvements to the physical capabilities of the subject due to the bacteria being induced to cooperate with physical systems while retaining its own capabilities to enhance temporary physical strength.\n\nResults: Following the 1st experiment, 2 subjects died of complications traceable to hypothermia and/or exposure to extreme temperatures. Following injection of tetanus, remaining subjects followed predicted physiological behaviors associated with early-stage as documented in medical research journals retrieved from existing research corpus, i.e. involuntary muscle cramps, paralysis, choking and so forth.

Surveillance teams have estimated a force from a minimum of 5,000 to a maximum of 25,000 hostiles. Combat teams under no circumstances are allowed to leave their post. If any unit is found to have violated this order, a small regiment will execute Section 4 Chapter 8 of NKVD disciplinary protocol. The 22nd division is ordered to mobilize any remaining reserves and wait for further instructions. No enemy must reach the Black Mountain.\n\nCommuniqué ends."

The Ural Guard are estimated to pose a significantly greater threat than the communal units due to their extensive combat experience and advanced training. Units stationed along this front are to temporarily receive priority for resupply and reinforcement over units that will be engaging forces from Orenburg. In addition, the unusually high stamina and endurance often displayed by members of the Ural Guard makes them priority targets for live capture.

Plan a.9 \"CARROT AND STICK\" would issue a number of units equipped with loadout and combat uniform c89-2b (see attachment page 1-5 for the list of unit battalions and equipment to be issued) to the Magnitogorsk frontier, near the Dirlewanger Brigade zone of actual control. Unit battalions would be instructed to fraternize and familiarize with members of Dirlewanger's brigade. This opportunity of fraternization would then be exploited and expanded to espionage operations (see historical information on espionage and techniques in the handbook). Unit members will be instructed to gather strategic information on command structure weaknesses in the brigade (see rebellious subdivision command structures on page 9).

As a new day dawns over the Black Mountain, the inhabitants of Magnitogorsk have cheered the death of their hated former master, but as the NKVD isn't exactly well liked either, the most pessimistic among them wonder if this is really a change for the best - some even insinuate that one day they might even remember fondly the days of Comrade Lysenko..."

Bygones of Lysenko's corrupt technocracy, they have no place in a civilized communist society like ours.

With a clear voice, he began to denounce Lysenko's crimes, while at the same time explaining the reasoning that brought him and his men to support him at first, before removing him from power. The pursuit of the NKVD was noble, Bunkov said, as they were convinced they'd aid the cause of science, progress, and socialism - however, Lysenko, a traitorous dog who went mad with power, turned the endeavors of his scientists and soldiers against the people, in vile crimes against the people of Russia and the communist cause.

For this reason, if we hope to maintain a peaceful and stable rule over the region, we must convince everyone that we do not intend to follow Lysenko's footsteps. Our rule will be just, fair, benevolent - we saved Magnitogorsk from Lysenko. We are the protectors of the people, of the proletariat and of the communist cause in the Southern Urals - we carry on the torch of Lenin and Bukharin in the struggle for freedom, equality and peace for all.

This stain will weigh upon Bunkov's new government as long as any trace of Magnitogorsk's vile recent past exist. Officers of the NKVD have received the order to collect and burn the vast majority of Lysenko's disgusting creations, turning them into nothing but ash and smoke.

In many cases, these men, women and children have been kept locked up in dark, cramped cells with poor hygienic conditions, scarce food and brutal treatment. Now that Lysenko has been dealt with, we must free the poor souls imprisoned in the Black Mountain, providing them with the medical assistance they deserve and preparing to deliver them back to their home.

Some of his experiments could provide us with some genuinely useful insights that can improve the lives of our people, although some of them were obtained with methods best left undescribed. At the same time, many of the scientists who worked with him were neither mad nor evil, and would be more than willing to resume their activities without having to answer to a madman.

As men of the NKVD patrol the industrial facilities and the outlying villages, with soldiers and trucks moving back and forth to discourage banditry, our commissars' reports are starting to come in from the population. While many are glad that Lysenko is gone, there are others who don't fully trust us. It seems that some subversive elements are even openly agitating against us. They may even be potentially planning an insurrection against us. While few of these reports can be confirmed, we should still keep a close eye on our own people, unless we want the situation spiraling out of control."

With our grip on the state threatening to become weaker, we could easily create an very pervasive network of surveillance and control of our population using the data collected in the archives as a starting point. Some in the NKVD command have argued that such a measure would be unethical and would a step back towards the reign of Lysenko - but it could be necessary to provide our people with the protection they so desperately need..."

 MGN_NKVD_spies_in_communities_desc: "The largest threat to stability and peace in Magnitogorsk is not located on the Black Mountain itself, where our forces are concentrated, but in the outlying villages and towns. The workers and peasants living there have often shown to resent our rule, and in many cases would rather opt for independence or autonomy. Infiltrating spies and agents of the NKVD into such communities would provide us with eyes and ears on the ground, granting us the ability to react to dissent before it becomes a problem. While this move could be helpful, it could easily backfire, since if our spies are discovered the population will not take this kindly."

 MGN_NKVD_village_commissars_desc: "The government of the territories surrounding Magnitogorsk is, at present, somewhat disorganized. Several of Bunkov's advisors have proposed setting up a network of local political commissars stationed in villages and hamlets under our rule, appointed by central command. They will act as representatives of our authority over all of our territory, and will be provided with all the resources and men they need to ensure peace, security and stability in their assigned jurisdiction. However, the villagers and peasants are likely to resent this further layer of bureaucratization and centralization, and there's a few of Bunkov's close officers who feel that leaving the communities a degree of autonomy would be in our best interests."

 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_lysenko_desc: "For years, Black Mountain created atrocities and committed cruelties beyond the wildest dreams of even the Black Bandit. After the collapse of the mad scientist, we have filled the power vacuum his collapse left and gave the residents of Magnitogorsk a peaceful life. Lysenko's collapse was instigated by his cruelty towards his subjects, and after we liberated his poor lab rats, they showed us nothing but contempt, biting the hand that fed them. We will remind them of why we are here. Expeditions into Lysenko's old lair will be carried out in order to remind them what they escaped a fortnight ago. Fear will keep the local population in line, fear of the Black Mountain. Dissected peasants will be publicly displayed, grisly experiments paraded through squared, and Lysenko's diaries will be read out for the whole world to hear.

The ghost of Lysenko will not harm them anymore, we have seen to that. The very real, and very present danger are bandits. Our guns will smash the raiders and our bayonets will pierce their rotten heart. When the people's fields will be salted, their sons' skulls crushed, and their daughters enslaved, we will be the ones who will stand firm to defend them. If they couldn't defend themselves from Lysenko, what chance do they hold against the monsters to the south? Perhaps, the mind of a man is forgetful and needs to be reminded of the past, and grounded in reality. The people must acknowledge our role in their survival and security, through love or through fear."

Our only way of surviving in the harsh environment of Russia is to join together under the guidance and care of our leader, and we love him for that.

Yet, there are still many idealists who insist that it is for their sake that we must endure in our struggle.

It is imperative that we deal with the bandits currently scourging the region once and for all, while attempting to entertain diplomatic relationships with Orenburg and the Ural League.

The terrorized commoners around the Black Mountain would have accepted essentially anyone over the mad scientist Lysenko, probably even Adolf Hitler himself, and so the NKVD is far from the worst they could have asked for. While the villages may not be happy with NKVD rule, they more or less trust their new rulers, and believe that at the very least these people will refrain from kidnapping them under the cover of darkness and will do their best to protect them."

Feeble-minded as he may be, Malenkov nevertheless should be able to comprehend just how much of a threat the Brigade is to the continued survival of socialist thought in the Urals. It is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\n\nA group of ambassadors have been sent to Orenburg to negotiate with Malenkov and his underlings directly, hoping to draft some kind of official strategy as to how we will both work to contain and eliminate the Black Brigade. Negotiations, however, have been slow-going. Malenkov agrees that the Bandit King of the Urals needs to be dealt with at some point in the future, but he has been reluctant to fully surrender strategic control or give command primacy to NKVD troops in the field. He is an idiot in many regards, but at least he is smart enough to guard what power and sovereignty he has. We must be content with vague promises and empty handshakes for now, and focus more on finding ways to fully alleviate Malenkov's doubts about us."

It is highly likely that the bandits are intercepting radio communications in the whole region, and we simply cannot risk them becoming informed about our defensive plans and the locations of our troops and fortifications.

One admires the night sky for a moment, the other simply steps further out and digs his hands through his pockets. They reconvene after a moment, and light a flimsy cigarette. Silently, save for the occasional restrained cough, they make it burn.\nBehind them, the truck explodes, painting the world orange and red and gray. The soldiers recover their footing, and turn around in shock and worry. Into the night, a single silhouette sprints away. One man pulls out his gun, and fires at the diminishing shadow, but to no avail. The figure has disappeared into the night as soon as it came.\n\nPerhaps it was some vengeful civilian, angry for the loss of a loved one, or an ideologically-enraged partisan, but whatever the motive, the fact remains that the soldiers' truck is gone.

The boy struggled to make his way through the breadline that, like a long snake of people chattering, coiled around a building - at a corner, a uniformed guard holding a rifle broke up a fight between two drunkards. Kirill waved to a girl he recognized, who smiled at him while holding her coughing mother's hand. The building used to be a storehouse for industrial materials - after the NKVD took control of the Black Mountain, it became a centre for distribution of food and medicines to the people who couldn't afford it. The walls were now adorned by the hammer, the sickle and the sword of the NKVD soldiers' uniform. Kirill crossed the street and turned left, passing by two soldiers laughing and smoking cigarettes. Behind them, a freshly glued poster picturing Bunkov watched over them; the solders didn't seem to mind the silent observer. Finally, Kirill walked along the footpath before reaching his home. He knocked and was greeted by his mother and little sister. Just a few metres ahead, a soldier standing on a watchtower turned to look at them, before sighing, adjusting his blue cap and going back to look towards the sunset.\nThe sun would dawn again, and another soldier would still be there, on the watchtower - and when the sun would fall again, someone else, still wearing the same uniform, would still be standing on that watchtower, observing Kirill returning home after school. Being watched by the NKVD is something the people of Magnitogorsk are getting used to, and soon enough living under their watchful eye became a habit. In time, most would never have experienced life without frequent visits from commissars and soldiers. Still, some say that it doesn't have to be like this, that it shouldn't be like this - but those who say such things too carelessly usually don't last very long."

While defenses are necessary to our survival, especially in Russia, there is a point where they devolve into mad paranoia. Soldiers of the NKVD are forces to walk down the mountain in complicated serpentine patterns to avoid landmines or stake filled pits, and navigating the deeper recesses of the mountain require us to trace our route with string like the Theseus of legend, lest we get lost in the purposefully winding labyrinth of the structure.\n\nDemolition and dismantlement has begun, with engineer teams carefully trying their best to ensure the safety of every man who dares walk down the mountainous slopes or steps out of his barracks to relieve himself.\n\nAlready, six have died in the efforts. Either from poorly constructed traps and explosive devices releasing and detonating at the slightest touch, or by stumbling upon traps that had been long lost to record. Several traps seem to have even be constructed at some point by those outside of the NKVD, and without our knowledge, seemingly built explicitly to kill any poor fool chosen to disarm others.\n\nProgress is slow, but it is sure.

But now, on this sunny, idyllic day, he was being hunted like the rabbits he ate. Out of the corner of his right ear, he heard the shot of a handgun, and then a scream. Then, to his left. Another shot and another scream. His hand shook so much as to drop the old revolver he held in it. He would not go silent into that good night. Back in the years before the war, his loving father had been taken by the NVKD. He would not fall to the same fate. His own bullets would go into his own brain before he let himself surrender to those mongrels.\n\nIt had all begun when a beggar on the street threw to him a small booklet. What he had expected to be a little pamphlet calling for prayer was a scathing criticism and expose on the nature of the new NKVD ruled government. It must have been intended for another man, a braver man. But the man who hid in the thorn bushes was intrigued. He stayed up reading it all, the little booklet printed on thin paper and held together by flimsy rings. Then, he hid it as deep as he could under his bed.\n\nThe next thing the man knew, he had become a member of a small resistance group. Fighting for the freedom of his settlement and from the tyrannical government that lorded over him, he distributed leaflets, set traps, and generally undermined authority. Everything seemed to be looking up, until the ambush began.\n\nNow, the man's friends and comrades were dead, and he had reverted to his cowardliness.

It became especially clear during the times when Lysenko waged an open war against his own people for his anti-humane experiments. Even though Lysenko is gone, the people are still reluctant to obey the governmental orders and continue to regard any state interference as an act of violence towards them.\n\nIt is clear that in such situation we can't afford to rely on terror and coercion as measures to keep the population in line with our order, as long as the memory of Lysenko's nightmare is still fresh in memory. Thereby, we give to the residents of Magnitogorsk all liberties they need but were deprived of for so long a time. We won't allow the situation in the countryside to ever fall to the anarchy of the past as long as we stand, and we shall not interfere with their lives as long as they faithfully perform their duties and do not stand against us. Seeing our benevolent nature and convincing themselves in our well-meaning intentions, the population of Magnitogorsk will cease its attempts to topple our rule and will be dutifully working for the good of their new nation.\n\nWithout a glance at the lands of milk and honey of Orenburg or the safety of the League, they instead will be laboring to build a better future here, around the Black Mountain.

Reintroducing lists that would state civilian names and would serve to limit freedom of movement within our territory and generally restrict civilian life to those on a list. While some urge strongly against a return to Lysenko's insane tyranny, others state that to maintain the safety of not just the leadership, but the civilians, these restrictions must be put into place.

The other is offering the communes autonomy within our greater state and letting them keep their anarchist lifestyle in their settlements in exchange for troops and taxes. The second option is better for us, it would mean not having to deal with the problems of annexation and would provide more benefits than a friendship agreement.

Some argue that the move is a rather blunt one and there are some suggestions that, should we act too hastily, we should expect resistance. Our motives are pure, however, and surely we have nothing to fear."
 MGN_NKVD.1201.a: "We must pursue order aggressively."
 MGN_NKVD.1201.b: "We must not be heavy-handed."
 MGN_NKVD.1202.t: "We were Misguided"
 MGN_NKVD.1202.desc: "Our efforts to maintain power following the removal of Lysenko has met a significant roadblock, mainly in that much of the population still remain wary of our men, whilst many more remain utterly uncooperative. To counteract this, Bunkov has declared his intent to address the issue of our involvement with Lysenko directly through radio address, hoping that even the far flung villages would have at least one functioning radio. The details of this speech have not been fully planned yet and debate has raged over to what extent our NKVD played in assisting Lysenko, and how much of this we should relay to the population.\n\nEventually, after exhaustive arguments made by both side of the argument, Bunkov made his decree clear..."
 MGN_NKVD.1202.a: "We must downplay our role."
 MGN_NKVD.1202.b: "We must tell the truth."
 MGN_NKVD.1203.t: "Payment is due"
 MGN_NKVD.1203.desc: "Perhaps the most convenient, surviving part of Lysenko's regime was the man's obsession with lists upon lists, records upon records, and more copious details than we initially knew what to do with. We have the names of every living former experiment and we know how to find them. As has become increasingly clear over time, the tendancy of these former experiments toward dissent and disruption has become increasingly clear and we must make sure they understand under who they work.\n\nThe last few days has seen extensive and rapid action as per our leader's orders, as NKVD regiments hunt down and corner these potential threats, wherever they might have scurried to. Now rounded up, they are to be told that..."

 MGN_NKVD.1204.t: "Threatening Loved Ones"
 MGN_NKVD.1204.desc: "Dissent persists within the ranks of the citizens, those who do not understand their place now, especially amongst the former experiments. Our latest order ensures that their loyalty to the regime is tied to something tangible and, more importantly, something which will not allow them to become matyrs. This insignificant display of resistance ends now, so that we may focus on other matters."
 MGN_NKVD.1204.a: "Thank you for your cooperation."
 MGN_NKVD.1205.t: "Conscription in the NKVD?"
 MGN_NKVD.1205.desc: "It is no secret that many within the high command predict that the upcoming battle against the League will be costly for us, especially in manpower. Thus, fierce debate has raged over whether our current conscription laws are sufficient, or whether they should be raised in preparation for the battles ahead."
 MGN_NKVD.1205.a: "Manpower is of upmost importance."
 MGN_NKVD.1205.b: "End this debate, our men are more than capable!"
 MGN_NKVD.1206.t: "Rogue State of the League"
 MGN_NKVD.1206.desc: "A historical tangent, previously extensively written reports from the dastardly Lysenko and our own scout sightings have given us the necessary information concerning the strange army with a state, the so-called protectors of the Ural steppes, the League. And as some of the senior NKVD commissars sat together on a cool wintry night, rereading and brooding on those reports it suddenly became very apparent that the League needed to be exterminated if the NKVD security state is to persist in this harsh world without a clear challenge. A mortal rivalry between the two militaries was bound to occur otherwise. After all, the guards represented everything wrong with the treasured Union that fell to the degenerate nazi onslaught, the weak, the traitors, the criminals, the church. A cold fury descended onto the commissars as they finished reading, every day that bastard nation continues to exist, and so close to their core territory, was a stain of disgrace on the NKVD legitimacy and reputation. The soldiers were not to find out about who it was they would be killing, it would be a sweeping operation with no survivors."
 MGN_NKVD.1206.a: "Natural order has to be restored."
 MGN_NKVD.1075.t: "Dawn Reaches Magnitogorsk"
 MGN_NKVD.1075.desc: "Dawn stretches across the smogs of the Black Mountain, and, on occasion, pierces, landing upon the stones below. The Technocratic Order has reached it's end, and in it's stead shall be built a society guided by the Luminary of Bolshevism. The People have been drawn from their mines, the Subjects freed from their chambers. In shambles, yet no longer in chains.\nBeneath the dawnstruck stones, an unfamiliar smoke begins to mundanely rise into the smog of the Black Mountain."
 MGN_NKVD.1075.a: "It is done"
 MGN_NKVD.1076.t: "Under the Dawnstruck Stones"
 MGN_NKVD.1076.desc: "Deep within the belly of the Black Mountain, those few administrators, scientists, and yes-men who have yet to find themselves mingling in the smogs of Magnitogorsk remain. They are there for one of two reasons - their minds and bodies are still needed for the extraction of information, or they deserve far worse than a single, quick and meager death.\n\nThey are left in a stark, black, silence for most of the day. Occasionally they are drawn from their chambers in short intervals for intelligence extraction or to be tortured. The two are very often one and the same, a fitting conclusion for the men who converted thousands of lives into digits and charts. Only when they have outlived their use, or become incapable of experiencing any greater an agony, are they then added to the smokestacks.\n\nIf you wish to see what justice looks like, look to the black smoke from a nameless facility south of Magnitogorsk. There, rising in greasy fumes to the sky, is where true penitence is, and boundless, boundless sorrow."
 MGN_NKVD.1076.a: "Let there be nothing left!"
 MGN_NKVD.1077.t: "The Greatest Threat"
 MGN_NKVD.1077.desc: "The threat posed by Dirlewanger's brigade is enormous; an insane group of lunatics more unhinged then even our previous dictator is something rarely found. If we sit still any longer without taking action towards the existential threat posed by those fascists, we risk perishing ourselves. Therefore, it is imperative that we take action as soon as possible to repel, or, more optimistically, destroy Dirlewanger and his Nazi bandits. The high command has discussed a number of battle plans that have been constructed in an effort to settle on one military action that can be taken, even seeking a possible alliance with our neighbors to deal with the issue. Currently, a strong spearhead into the chief camp of the Brigade seems to be the optimal option, but even something like this could fail in the face of Dirlewanger's hardy bandits. For now, we can do nothing but wait and plan as fascist rats fester on our borders."
 MGN_NKVD.1077.a: "Our time will be coming soon..."
 MGN_NKVD.1078.t: "The Enemy Of Our Enemy"
 MGN_NKVD.1078.desc: "The 22nd motor division might be one of the strongest professional army divisions left in the former Soviet Union, but to face down the accursed Dirlewanger brigade it might not be enough. We lack the manpower to both defend Magnitogorsk itself from a possible invasion by the Germans and their pet Russians and also deploy men in the field to defeat the Brigade decisively.\nIn the west stands the loose confederation of communes centered onto Orenburg city. The local don't stack up very well to a proper army, or even to veteran bandits like Dirlewangers men, but the communal militias are certainly numerous and quite desperate. If we could ally with even a fraction of the communes we would have the men to cut off any easy path of retreat west of the Ural to Dirlewanger. If the city of Orenburg itself was to join other communes in an alliance with us, the combination of our army with Orenburg's guard and a bunch of smaller militias could be just enough men on the ground to defeat the black brigade.\nAs the Ural League has learned to its frustrations, the people of Orenburg are skeptical of centralized groups in general, especially a well armed one such as ourselves. Negotiations to get them to fight with us will be difficult...But Magnitogorsk is not without a certain quantity of resources that various factions and political groups in Orenburg city covet. A deal might still happen if we play our cards right."
 MGN_NKVD.1078.a: "Let's see what these anarchists have to offer us."
 MGN_NKVD.1079.t: "Our Friend Malenkov"
 MGN_NKVD.1079.desc: "It seems that we are not as alone in the Urals as we once thought ourselves to be. Georgy Malenkov, a politician of prominence back in the days of Bukharin, has come to power as the premier of Orenburg, and it seems that he is of a far more centralized mindset than his comrades. While hardly a great luminary of the Soviet era, he can nonetheless be of great use to us as an ally. And seeing how we are surrounded by degenerates and counter-revolutionaries on all sides, we will need all the help we can possibly get, so we cannot afford to be too selective.\n\nPreliminary ambassadors have already been sent, and discussions have begun concerning things like military equipment and material that we could generously donate to them. They seem to be receptive to the idea, though it very well might be that they're simply desperate for whatever firepower they can get their greedy little hands on. But what other choice do we have to win them over?"
 MGN_NKVD.1079.a: "They have chosen the right person."
 MGN_NKVD.1090.t: "The Traitor Burba"
 MGN_NKVD.1090.desc: "Aleksander Burba was not the man we wanted in charge of the Orenburg Communes. He does not believe in Communist values, nor is he aligned with the interests of the NKVD. After all, we didn't overthrow Lysenko simply to bend to another degenerate technocrat's will. However, with the growing strength and aggressiveness of Dirlewanger's brigade, we may be forced to align with Burba, at least temporarily, in order to destroy the bandit \"king\" and euthanize his pack of rabid animals.\n\nWe need to decide quickly, lest we give Dirlewanger the chance to strike first. Do we preserve our integrity as the true protectors of Communism, or will we sacrifice our values for the sake of survival and the Orenburg peasantry?"
 MGN_NKVD.1090.a: "This was not the outcome we wanted."
 MGN_NKVD.1091.t: "The Dirlewanger Question"
 MGN_NKVD.1091.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger and his gang of fascist bandits continue to be a thorn in our side, raiding our border territories and slaughtering villages there for their own profit and amusement. Thankfully, we are not the only people he has chosen to incite - he has long been a pestilence on our brave comrades in Orenburg. Feeble-minded as he may be, Malenkov nevertheless should be able to comprehend just how much of a threat the Brigade is to the continued survival of socialist thought in the Urals. It is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\n\nA group of ambassadors have been sent to Orenburg to negotiate with Orenburg directly, hoping to draft some kind of official strategy as to how we will both work to contain and eliminate the Black Brigade. Negotiations, however, have been slow-going. Malenkov agrees that the Bandit King of the Urals needs to be dealt with at some point in the future, but he has been reluctant to fully surrender strategic control or give command primacy to NKVD troops in the field. They are an idiot in many regards, but at least they are smart enough to guard what power and sovereignty he has. We must be content with vague promises and empty handshakes for now, and focus more on finding ways to fully alleviate their doubts about us."
 MGN_NKVD.1091.a: "Better than nothing."
 MGN_NKVD.1092.t: "The Science"
 MGN_NKVD.1092.desc: "In the aftermath of Lysenko, we have to find something to do about the madman's so-called \"science\", and the science of the Black Mountain.\n\nTwo choices are presented to us. For one, we could throw it all away, getting rid of all the mad scientist's disturbed beliefs and outright untrue and harmful \"socialist\" beliefs in the field of science. This would result in a subsequent purging of all of the documents of Lysenko, and all of his advisors, we must\n\nSecondly, we could make our way through all these documents in an attempt to find something that will be of use. This will probably end as a useless waste of time, but will result in Lysenko's comrades getting out alive. What should we do on the matter?"
 MGN_NKVD.1092.a: "There's no use in his foolish escapades."
 MGN_NKVD.1092.b: "Perhaps, under all the failure, there is truth."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.t: "Wake up call"
 MGN_NKVD.1060.desc: "Perhaps a gun can defend a man's family. But a starving man can't hold a gun, and a gun can't build itself. Our workers and peasants must know their vital role in our society through any means, we will not tolerate provocative behavior that would risk our workers' morale and motivation to work and produce for their people. We will impose harsher quotas, and promote productivity within our society by setting up commissars and bureaucrats in the workplace and establish proper control and order in the fields and in the factories. It's time to deal with \"demoralizing\" elements of society more accordingly."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.a: "This should motivate them..."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.b: "No. We have faith in our people."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.t: "재판"
 MGN_NKVD.1061.desc: "Since we rescued former League citizens from the terror of Lysenko we have brought a potential danger into our newly liberated society. We can't walk in our own streets knowing that some of our very own citizens and comrades are conspiring with the man across the Urals. To secure our people from these traitors and traitorous sentiments, we must work in an unconventional, yet familiar manner. The 22nd will work swiftly and efficiently. Conducting secret trials, Interrogations, exiles and executions on suspected \"League associates\" will assure the loyalty and cooperation of our citizens in the face of Uralic aggression."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.a: "Back into the cage."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.b: "They suffered enough already."
 MGN_NKVD.1062.t: "The Speech"
 MGN_NKVD.1062.desc: "A poster at every street corner, at every factory and at every train station. Radio stations will be set up, buzzing with speeches from Stepan Bunkov. The common man of Magnitogorsk will be flooded by depictions of the NKVD's brave struggle against the bandits and Lysenko, by bombastic speeches and by parades in the streets.The people must hear the word of their friends and guardians, and as long as a single man could go through a day without seeing, reading or listening to our message, we have failed our mission."
 MGN_NKVD.1062.a: "Turn on the printers!"
 MGN_NKVD.1062.b: "This is unnecessary..."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.t: "The Fate of the Communes"
 MGN_NKVD.1063.desc: "We press ever forward, and now that the communes are under our watch, we have encountered a dilemma. Orenburg being the largest city in the southern urals, we now have a large and unruly populace unaccustomed to our... variation of rule. Our choices are simple. We imprison the angry masses, execute the dissenters, and send our own settlers, or we spare the people, brave the storm, and create unity between the mountain and the city."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.a: "They cannot be controlled."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.b: "A solution for the future is in order."
 MGN_NKVD.1064.t: "Adjustment"
 MGN_NKVD.1064.desc: "Life under NKVD watch isn't as different as some would have thought. There are trucks of soldiers roaming the streets, and rationing is a little stricter, but other than that, life is fine. There are even new civilians from the east moving in. I think that, eventually, we can learn to coexist with these people. Unless, of course, you're a dissenting opinion."
 MGN_NKVD.1064.a: "And so, life goes on..."
 MGN_NKVD.1065.t: "Internment"
 MGN_NKVD.1065.desc: "They come on trucks, in bands of 5 or 7. They wear black wool masks, with a red star on their olive green rags. They knock, they enter, and they take. Nobody asks questions because they fear they will be taken too. If there is no response on the other side, they enter anyway. Nobody knows where they come from or where they go. They take, and those taken do not return. They are relocated, but to where is uncertain. Some say they are shot out of town. Some say they are used as slaves. But nobody truly knows."
 MGN_NKVD.1065.a: "We did what was necessary."
 MGN_NKVD.2000.t: "붉은 여명 - 디를레방어의 붕괴"
 MGN_NKVD.2000.desc: "Some fights happen once. Others are reflected once and twice and thrice, down the narrow alleyway of history, in scuffed mirrors and twisted reflections. This is the price of a broken world; endless fights for justice that smolder on, even when the fire gutters out.\n\nSome of the last remaining operational units of the Red Army's internal security and intelligence division have managed to destroy a group of bandits by the name of \"Dirlewanger's Brigade\", one which clings to the Organization of an SS Brigade.\n\nThe NKVD's victory over Dirlewanger sends both good and ill omens to the citizens under the reign of the New Red Black Mountain. On one hand, the psychopathy and outright madness of Dirlewanger shall no longer be a threat to all who cowered under his heel, and his banditry and the many crimes of his cronies shall be brought to justice. On the other hand, the NKVD is an ominous black space, even if it shrouds itself with the insignia and symbolism of the Red, and who knows how far Lysenko's shadow has been purged from its system?\n\nThe Urals tremble. A new Red Dawn descends upon the old hills. Little knows what it might bring."

 MGN_NKVD.2001.t: "붉은 여명 - 그늘에 가려진 우랄"
 MGN_NKVD.2001.desc: "Many said it was inevitable; the militarised, interventionist Ural League and the militarised, revolutionary NKVD in Black Mountain would eventually be at each others' throats. Even so, it was shocking to see how quickly relations between the two powerhouses degenerated into terrible conflict.\n\nNow the Red Flag flies on the remains of Ust-Katav and the League is scattered to the hills. The struggle has concluded. Menviks himself is nowhere to be found; NKVD statements and press reports claim he is dead, but the rosary he was known to carry was not found on the battlefield they claimed he fell on. Given the huge amount of respect and affection he received from his citizens, it is likely he was smuggled out to some other obscure corner of Russia to spend the rest of his pious days. Perhaps a hooded county priest will look up from his duties every so often and think of the land he once called home, weeping.\n\nAs for the fate of the former League's inhabitants, no one can say for sure. The NKVD has taken great pains to paint a reassuring palette of its policies, portraying itself as a Great Vanguard bringing civilization and revolutionary justice, but no one forgets their complicity in Lysenko's atrocities, and the question of just how much iron lies behind their silken rhetoric is something no one likes to think about.\n\nNo matter what the future holds, one thing is clear; the Red Dawn now kisses the Ural Mountains themselves, and the balance of power is forever changed. The Revolution smolders on."
 MGN_NKVD.2001.a: "One bear has clawed another to death."
 MGN_NKVD.2002.t: "붉은 여명 - Left Unity"
 MGN_NKVD.2002.desc: "The Communes of Orenburg were always a contradiction, a state built around an ideology requiring its dissolution to be fulfilled. And there were many problems with how it was run, and the endless tightrope of popular consensus it had to navigate to get legislation into the books. But as the gunfire from the last militia outposts dies down and the Councillors scurry into exile and anonymity, it is clear that this experiment, flawed or successful, is now over. In its place stands a new Red Vanguard, and the bloody truism of Socialist Unity.\n\nThe Communes have fallen apart utterly; their Council (and Chairman) scattered, their local infrastructures supplanted or destroyed by purge, the ramshackle system which supported Orenburg is now gone, and over Orenburg itself a new red flag now flies. Lists are being drawn up with the methodical, scrupulous brutality inherent to the NKVD, and slowly those deemed as Revisionists and Traitors to the Socialist Cause are interned, tried and rehabilitated. Some disappear off the lists entirely, and it is best not to think too hard (or loudly) about their fates.\n\nIt is unclear if the residents of the Communes will acclimatize to their new Socialism, run from Black Mountain, and if they prefer their new Commissars over their old fractious Councillors and representatives. The NKVD reports are all positive in their confidence, of course; and they will continue to stay positive. No matter what. Time will tell if the residents of the ex-Communes feel the same.\n\nAnd observers in neighbouring lands shake their heads sadly, knowing the old truth; that the Red Banner, in spreading, will always smother its own."
