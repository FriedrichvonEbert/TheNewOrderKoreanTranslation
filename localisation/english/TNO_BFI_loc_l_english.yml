 # Issue 15 - Italy
 bfi_ITA_independence_issue_15_dec:0 "Increase Funding for SIM"
 ITA_BFI_increased_SIM_funding:0 "Increased SIM funding"
 bfi_ITA_independence_issue_15_dec_desc:0 "The SIM has been an integral part of our government for decades, and to abrogate its duties to foreign intelligence agencies would be a betrayal of Italian interests. Therefore, we must increase funding for the SIM to allow it to maintain its competency alongside the CIA and KPT."
 bfi_ITA_USA_influence_issue_15_dec:0 "Foster Ties with the CIA" 
 bfi_ITA_USA_influence_issue_15_dec_desc:0 "During the last war, the United States' Office of Strategic Services was one of the most effective components of the allied war effort, and the CIA carries that legacy on. Its reach extends across the globe, from Germania to Cape Town and New Delhi. Increased cooperation with the CIA would improve our ability to counter Germany's aggression on the world stage, and train our agents for a variety of theaters."
 bfi_ITA_anti_JAP_issue_15_dec:0 "Rebuke the Kenpetai"
 bfi_ITA_anti_JAP_issue_15_dec_desc:0 "The Kenpetai are one of the most feared organizations in the world - and for good reason. On their hands lies the blood of tens of thousands of innocents who dared to challenge Japan's authority. We will show them exactly what we think of them, and rebuke their efforts to integrate our intelligence networks."
 bfi_ITA_JAP_influence_issue_15_dec:0 "Foster Ties with the Kenpetai"
 bfi_ITA_JAP_influence_issue_15_dec_desc:0 "The Kenpetai originated as a military police unit in Japan's occupied territories, and have decades of experience in policing colonial holdings and defusing unrest. If we want to govern our empire more effectively, we should learn from the Kenpetai, and increase the SIM's ties with them."
 bfi_ITA_anti_USA_issue_15_dec:0 "Rebuke the CIA"
 bfi_ITA_anti_USA_issue_15_dec_desc:0 "Despite serving the world's last great democracy, the CIA has been nothing but an enemy of human rights and freedom abroad. It its pocket lie despots, communists, and thuggish mercenaries who have terrorized millions in the name of fighting fascism, and we will let the Americans know that we have not forgotten their misdeeds. We will rebuke the CIA's attempts to foster ties with the SIM."

#Battle For Italy Events#

BFI.19.t:0 "A Light in the Darkness" # ( Italy Event ) We're opening ourselves up to the world as a democracy! If foreign people want to come help us, come along, its great to be independent ! :)))
BFI.19.d:0 "Now that authoritarianism is buried under Italy's soil, we must show ourselves to the world as we have become. In Europe Italy is a light in the darkness, a democracy among so many despots, and evidence that freedom is possible even in the shadow of the German Reich. If people of talent and energy from the world over should wish to come to this country and help build it anew, we will welcome them with open arms and a spirit of discovery. For it is not enough to bury Fascism. Now we must build everyday what it means to be independent and free, and reap the benefit from opening up to all those of goodwill. Whether this light will survive in so much darkness is another matter. But to have tried to build something beautiful is in the Italian spirit, and the whole world will see us do so."
BFI.19.a:0 "A Renaissance dawns."

BFI.1.t:0 "Offers from Rome" # ( Japan Event )Democratic Italy's appeal to Japan! Our former ally could serve us well in the cold war, footing in Europe and trade connections there.
BFI.1.d:0 "In recent months following Italian democratization, we have been approached by Italian envoys with overtures of friendship and cooperation. While we have enjoyed warm relations with the Italians ever since their break with the Nazis in the '50s this latest development represents a golden opportunity to bring the Italian Empire firmly into our sphere.\n\nWith control over the Suez, dominance over the Mediterranean, and a Colonial Empire that stretches from Tunis to the Horn, Italy would make a valuable addition to the Co-Prosperity Sphere, turning the Sphere into a truly global organization. Furthermore, the effects of gaining an ally right on the borders of the Reich cannot be overstated. Every available effort should be made to bring the Italians into the Co-Prosperity Sphere, lest this opportunity slips from our grasp, or worse, fall into the hands of our enemies."
BFI.1.a:0 "Get me the Ambassador!"

BFI.2.t:0 "Offers from Rome" # ( USA Event )Democratic Italy's appeal to the US! It could be very useful to have a democratic ally within the doorstep of germany 
BFI.2.d:0 "In recent months following Italian democratization, we have been approached by the Italian diplomatic envoys with overtures of friendship and cooperation. While we have spent years courting the Italians since their break with the Nazis this latest development represents a golden opportunity to bring the Italian Empire firmly into our sphere.\n\nWith control over the Suez, dominance over the Mediterranean, and a colonial empire that stretches from Tunis to the Horn, Italy would make a valuable addition to the Free World, and the effects of gaining an ally right on the doorstep of the Reich cannot be overstated. Every available effort should be made to bring the Italians into the OFN, lest this opportunity slips from our grasp, or worse, fall into the hands of our enemies."
BFI.2.a:0 "Get me the ambassador!"

BFI.3.t:0 "Reports from Washington" # ( Japan Event ) The US seems to like the idea of getting Italy as an ally as well, this is worrying
BFI.3.d:0 "While we have begun efforts to woo the Italians into our alliance, we have recently received information that the United States is doing much the same, hoping to bring the Italians into the OFN. This cannot be allowed to pass. Italian entry into the OFN would be a major boon to the Americans, granting them a foothold in Europe and heralding a massive victory for the so-called "Free World". Every available resource must be used to bring the Italians into the Co-Prosperity Sphere, or at the very least, to prevent the Americans from bringing them into the OFN."
BFI.3.a:0 "We cannot let the Americans one-up us!"

BFI.4.t:0 "News from Tokyo" # ( USAEvent ) Japan seems to like the idea of getting Italy as an ally as well, this is worrying
BFI.4.d:0 "While we have begun efforts to woo the Italians into our alliance, we have recently received information that the Japanese Empire is doing much the same, hoping to bring the Italians into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This cannot be allowed to pass. Italian entry into the CPS would be a major boon to the Japanese, granting them a foothold in Europe and transforming the Sphere into a truly global bloc. Such a result would be unacceptable. Every available resource must be used to bring the Italians into the OFN, or at the very least, to prevent the Japanese from bringing them into the Sphere."
BFI.4.a:0 "We cannot let Tokyo get a leg up over us in the Cold War!"

BFI.5.t:0 "The American Swan-Song" # ( Japan Event ) The USA affirms their stance once more, we'll take action by persuading italy! 
BFI.5.d:0 "The United States and their lapdogs in the OFN have made several overtures towards the Italians to woo them into their alliance, including offers of technology, and favourable access to key resources. We'll need to take more action to bring Rome to our side, or at the very least prevent those dastardly Americans from bringing them into their sphere."
BFI.5.a:0 "Where's the ambassador!"

BFI.6.t:0 "Tokyo's Siren" # ( USA Event ) Japan affirms their stance once more, we'll take action by persuading italy! 
BFI.6.d:0 "The Japanese and their puppets in the Sphere have made several overtures towards the Italians to woo them into their alliance, including offers of technology, and favourable access to key resources. We'll need to take more action to bring Rome to our side, or at the very least prevent those damn Japs from bringing them into their sphere."
BFI.6.a:0 "Where's the ambassador!"

BFI.7.t:0 "The Battleground" # ( Italy Event ) Looks like we're a diplomatic battleground, well, we don't hate either side, but its best we assure our own diplomatic autonomy.
BFI.7.d:0 "Whilst this was not necessarily our expectation or desire, it appears Italy has become the battleground for a fight for influence between the United States and Japan. We would like to build ties with both, for the good of economic development and matters of diplomacy, but to remain autonomous in the face of such pressure will not be simple. For Japan and the US, despite their assurances of benevolence and friendship, are clear in their intent. Both see themselves as a first rate power attempting to gain influence over a second rate one. And as tempting as it may be to be flattered by such intense interest, we cannot allow our freedom of action to be threatened. Italy is a sovereign nation. She will be treated as such."
BFI.7.a:0 "Foolish indeed to threaten our pride. "

BFI.23.t:0 "We'll go it alone" # ( Italy Event ) We're calling off these diplomatic battles and making up our mind on how to proceed!
BFI.23.d:0 "The diplomatic battles are no more. Having witnessed a series of increasingly intense communiqués from the American and Japanese governments (addressed as much to each other as to Italy herself), we must make it clear that Rome makes up its own mind. How this will be taken is not our concern, for God forbid our sovereignty be constrained by the pretensions of insecure powers."
BFI.23.a:0 "No more foreign intrigues."

BFI.9.t:0 "이탈리아가 OFN에 가입하다" # ( Italy Event ) Italy joins the OFN! Very nice for us!
BFI.9.d:0 "Today will be remembered throughout history as the day the Italian Empire officially became a member of the Organization of Free Nations!\n\nThough Italy was wooed by both the Organization of Free Nations and the Co-Prosperity Sphere, it was ultimately felt that the OFN was the best partner for Italy's interests. Italy has gained a powerful ally against any possible German aggression, and the Free World makes a dramatic comeback on the very doorstep of the German Reich."
BFI.9.a:0 "America was named after an Italian, after all"

BFI.10.t:0 "이탈리아가 자유세계에 합류하다" # ( USA Event ) Italy joins the OFN! Very nice for us!
BFI.10.d:0 "Italian-American communities across the United States erupted in celebration today as Italy officially signed legislation to join the Organization of Free Nations as a member, despite immense Japanese pressure.\n\nWith this move the Italian people have struck a valiant blow in the OFN's efforts to contain the dual menaces of the Einheitspakt and the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere. The OFN has gained an important foothold in Europe, access to the Suez Canal, and access to some of the world's largest oil reserves in the Middle-East.\n\nWhile the Cold War is still far from won, there is still a widespread feeling among the population that things may finally be looking up for the forces of the Free World."
BFI.10.a:0 "Another shining light in a sea of darkness."

BFI.11.t:0 "이탈리아가 미국과 손을 잡다" # ( Japan Event ) Italy joins the OFN! FUCK
BFI.11.d:0 "Tokyo in shock today as news broke out that Italy has officially joined the America-led Organization of Free Nations, despite the best efforts of the Sphere's diplomatic corps.\n\nWith Italy occupying an important position in the global cold war between the world's three superpowers, its loss to the OFN is a stinging slight that may carry major diplomatic repercussions for the Sphere going forwards..."
BFI.11.a:0 "Such an opportunity, slipped through our grasp"

BFI.12.t:0 "이탈리아가 공영권에 가입하다" 
BFI.12.d:0 "A massive shift in the global balance of power occurred today as Italy has officially signed the treaty bringing it into the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\nWhile many were perhaps betting on OFN winning the Battle for Italy due to its closer distance, it seems that the recent historical ties between Italy and Japan, as well as the need for an ally to protect Italy's vital Middle-Eastern interests, have won out over American lobbying and closer proximity.\n\nDespite the vast implications of this move, both nations could briefly forget their cares in revelry. Celebrations in Tokyo and Rome included the Japanese Prime-minister watching a special performance of Verdi's 'Otello', while in Italy officials were delighted to view a skillful display of Japanese 'Noh' theatre."
BFI.12.a:0 "Unlikely friends in the East"

BFI.13.t:0 "이탈리아가 일본과 손을 잡다" # ( USA Event ) Italy joins the CPS! FUCK
BFI.13.d:0 "Shock in Washington today as the Italian government has officially snubbed American overtures in favour of an alliance with the Japanese-led Co-Prosperity sphere. \nWith this move America has lost a major opportunity to gain a foothold in Europe, while Japan has been considerably strengthened by gaining an ally in the very centre of the Mediterranean.\n\nItalian-American communities have reported being especially devastated today with some interviewed Italian-American bitterly joking about possible 'Italian-American internment' in case of war."
BFI.13.a:0 "Damn..."

BFI.14.t:0 "공영권이 유럽에 발을 딪다" # ( Japan Event ) Italy joins the CPS! Very nice for us!
BFI.14.d:0 "Celebrations broke out in cities across the Sphere today as Tokyo and Rome officially signed Italian entry into the Co-Prosperity Sphere\nWhile some analysts feared that Italy might instead join the America-led OFN, the Sphere's perseverance and close ties with Italy seem to have won the day.\n\nWith this move the Sphere's interests in the west are one step closer to being secure. The Sphere not only gains a large foothold on the Einheitspakt's very doorstep, it also guarantees the Sphere access to some of the world's most vital trade routes including the Suez Canal. Not to mention important Middle-Eastern oil supplies.\n\nThe announcement of the alliance has led to a small surge of "Italiamania" among the population, with Italian music records selling faster than stores can import them and language schools being inundated with requests for Italian lessons."
BFI.14.a:0 "They made the right choice"

BFI.15.t:0 "Italy maintains its independence" # ( Italy Event ) We maintain diplomatic freedom! We aren't joining any faction!
BFI.15.d:0 "The Americans and the Japanese circled us like vultures to a fresh corpse, but we stood strong. In the interests of enjoying our independence, and in the name of every Italian, we have announced that we shall not join any faction championed by the powers of the West and of the East. Our diplomatic freedom allows us to decide on issues as they come, not facing any undue pressure due to our ties, and to act always in the best interest of Italy."
BFI.15.a:0 "We remain free."

BFI.16.t:0 "Italy remains non-aligned" # ( USA Event ) Italy remains non aligned, well at least they didn't join the OFN
BFI.16.d:0 "Despite the efforts of American diplomacy, replicated with ferocity by the Japanese Empire, Italy has announced that it shall not be joining any factions and remains neutral between the OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is not what we hoped for, and yet it could be much worse - God forbid the thought of the Japanese seizing the heart of the Mediterranean for their own purposes."
BFI.16.a:0 "Let them be neutral, then."

BFI.17.t:0 "Italy remains non-aligned" # ( Japan Event ) Italy remains non aligned, well at least they didn't join the OFN
BFI.17.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, and the swan-song of the United States, Italy has announced that it shall not be joining any factions and remains neutral between the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the OFN. Whilst this is not the ideal scenario, we can at least rest easy that the Americans have not gained another lapdog to abuse."
BFI.17.a:0 "It is what it is."

BFI.30.t:0 "Italy Chooses Her Future" # 
BFI.30.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, both the OFN and the Co-Prosperity sphere were entangled in a bitter fight over the heart of the most beautiful maiden of Europe, the sweet Italian Empire.\n\nTears were shed, bouquets and gauntlets were thrown, but in the end, both suitors received the cold shoulder for now. The lady just isn't ready to commit yet - no, she needs some time to find herself and forge her own path for a while.\n\nThe decision to abstain from choosing a side may not be as unexpected as initially assumed. Both the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the OFN seem extraordinarily interested in bringing Italy to their side, so holding out might move one of the two sides to come up with a better deal. Few love triangles end up with a clear winner, but this one might just result in Italy getting the upper hand."
BFI.30.a:0 "We make our own destiny."
BFI.30.b:0 "At least they didn't choose the Japanese."
BFI.30.c:0 "At least they didn't choose the Americans."

BFI.31.t:0 "America Wins the Issue!" #
BFI.31.desc:0 "Following weeks of intense negotiations between American, Japanese, and Italian officials in Rome, we have received word that the Italian government is receptive to the American proposal at hand and will align themselves closer to the United States on the current issue.\n\nIn Washington, State Department diplomats breathe a sigh of relief as Italy draws one step closer to the OFN and the free world, while their counterparts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo curse under their breath at the setback. In Rome, government ministers nod solemnly for themselves, knowing that their decision will play a pivotal role in deciding the future of the Italian Empire for generations to come.\n\nThe Battle for Italy continues, as the OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere await the next summons from Rome to discuss the next item on the agenda."
BFI.31.a:0 "Closer to the Eagle."
BFI.31.b:0 "For Liberty and Justice."
BFI.31.c:0 "We must redouble our efforts."

BFI.32.t:0 "Japan Wins the Issue!" # 
BFI.32.desc:0 "Following weeks of intense negotiations between American, Japanese, and Italian officials in Rome, we have received word that the Italian government is receptive to the Japanese proposal at hand and will align themselves closer to the Empire of Japan on the current issue.\n\nIn Tokyo, Japanese diplomats breathe a sigh of relief as Italy draws one step closer to the Sphere and their historic alliance, while their counterparts at the State Department in Washington curse under their breath at the setback. In Rome, government ministers nod solemnly for themselves, knowing that their decision will play a pivotal role in deciding the future of the Italian Empire for generations to come.\n\nThe Battle for Italy continues, as the OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere await the next summons from Rome to discuss the next item on the agenda."
BFI.32.a:0 "Closer to the Rising Sun."
BFI.32.b:0 "We must redouble our efforts."
BFI.32.c:0 "For Japan and The Emperor."

BFI.90.t:0 "Choosing our Future" # 
BFI.90.desc:0 "As Rome opens its gates to the world's superpowers, they in turn have opened their doors to us. Foreign investors eager to access a market brimming with potential as ours will scarcely waste time injecting capital into Italy's economy - capital which we may then use to fund projects otherwise overlooked for their immediate cost.\n\nNevertheless, our reentry into world affairs must be slow, measured and deliberate; recklessness invites only a destabilized regime. We shall thus select five issues on which Italy's prospective allies may assist her, that Washington and Tokyo may know where their money is best put to use."

BFI.91.t:0 "Choosing our Investment" # 
BFI.91.desc:0 "Having chosen the issues at hand, we may now decide how much support we shall dedicate to each. Our investment is proportional to the returns which we shall acquire once negotiations conclude. Maximizing investment on academic exchanges, for example, entails an equally large expansion of our academic base, whereas offering token investment to weapons sales returns profit just as minuscule.\n\nBut we would be fools to expect passivity out of superpowers. Washington and Tokyo have their own plans for the peninsula, and may assign their investments contrary to our wishes. This is no issue provided we maintain an independent course throughout the negotiation period; should the scales ultimately favor either superpower, however, then we can only accede to the terms and benefits they have offered.\n\nNote that no two issues can share the same level of investment. Boundless Rome's glory may be, but its coffers are not so well-endowed."
BFI.91.a:0 "Everything in it's right place."

BFI.92.t:0 "Tipping the Scales" # 
BFI.92.desc:0 "The gears of diplomacy turn unceasingly, no matter the day or hour. Ambassadors from around the world mingle with Italian high society for every occasion its socialites permit. As America and Japan continue courting the Empire's favor, their notables have taken center stage in the recondite games Italy's rich and powerful play.\n\nLeft untouched, as always, is the lay Italian. And yet they are easier influenced by our hand than the petty nobles of Rome, Milan and Naples. With some effort, we can convince the masses to spurn the foreigner's wiles... or, should we so desire, prepare them throughly for one of Italia's many suitors."
BFI.92.a:0 "We can't choose our enemies, but we can choose our friends."
