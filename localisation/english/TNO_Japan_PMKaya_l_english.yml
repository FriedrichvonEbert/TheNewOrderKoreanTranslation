 JAP_prime_minister_kaya_desc:0 "In the chaos of the collapse of Ino's government following the Yasuda Crisis, Kaya Okinori of the Technocrats has emerged to secure his position as Prime Minister of Japan - And has taken charge of a government in crisis that is unpopular with the public, faces a deeply divided military, and must contend with the aftershocks of the Yasuda Crisis. Each of these challenges and problems he must solve if he is to stabilize Japan.\n\nEven within the Technocrats, two factions have emerged to compete for influence and vye for his support, each with their own vision for Japan: the New Bureaucrats, headed by Fukuda Takeo, and the Reform Bureaucrats, led by Shiina Etsusaburo and Kishi Nobusuke.\n\nIt will be up to Kaya to decide whose vision to enact - and in so doing, determine the future of Japan."
 JAP_the_new_cabinet:0 "The New Cabinet"
 JAP_the_new_cabinet_desc:0 "The first task of any new Prime Minister is to form a new cabinet. Close associates and talented individuals alike will be selected and week-long discussions shall be held to understand the position we've been placed in.\n\nWe must act quickly to garner support and root ourselves in Japanese politics, as the other factions of the Yokusankai look down on our fledgling government with disdain in their eyes. Should we show any vulnerability, they will decimate us without hesistation.\n\nOur Emperor has given us a chance, but they will not. We shall prove the vultures wrong."

 JAP_appeal_to_the_hardliners_desc:0 "It is perhaps a difficult choice to make, but there are few other acceptable options. With these constraints in mind, it is determined that the support of the Technocrat \"Reform Bureaucrats\" is what is needed for Kaya to succeed.\n\nHeaded by Shiina Etsusaburo and Kishi Nobusuke, this clique of the Technocratic faction are supporters of the Keynesian technocracy, a style of governance that brought the Empire to prominence, but has since fallen out of style as Japan has fallen into a stagnant status quo.\n\nKaya will meet with both men for the purposes of gaining their support for his cabinet, and aligning their roles to the restoration of this Keynesian technocracy - and perhaps with it, the revival of Japan itself."
 JAP_rub_our_back:0 "Rub Our Back"
 JAP_rub_our_back_desc:0 "As was expected, both Kishi and Shiina had their terms to give us in exchange for their support. They have requested appointments of specific individuals throughout the government, all of them either part of the Reform Bureaucrat clique, or economic officials with connections to economic hubs throughout the Sphere - all of whom have connections both obscured and obvious to Kishi.\n\nIn addition to these appointments, promises have been made specifically to Kishi for supporting and strengthening the Ministry of Commerce, particularly in relation to Manchuko's affairs, as well as other markets within the Empire and wider Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nThe price for their support is high - but if we wish to succeed, this will be the price we need to pay."
 JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours:0 "And We Will Rub Yours"
 JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours_desc:0 "Both Kishi and Shiina are well aware that if we are going to grant these favors to the Reform Bureaucrats - there are certain expectations. We will require their support for a few key policies.\n\nSpecifically, the reformation of the Cabinet Planning Board.\n\nFor Kaya's government to succeed, the powers and responsibilities of the Cabinet Planning Board must be reformed and empowered to accomplish his vision for Japan. On his own, Kaya knows that these efforts will be unsuccessful. However, with the support of the Reform Bureaucrats as well as the Ministry of Commerce, his chances are much better.\n\nIt will be a test of Kishi and Shiina's influence - as well as their willingness to come through for us."
 JAP_a_new_face:0 "A New Face"
 JAP_a_new_face_desc:0 "As the cabinet continues to be filled, an unexpected candidate has been brought forward by both Kishi and Shiina for the position of Foreign Minister - the former Chief Executive of Guangdong and prominent Greater East Asia minister Teiichi Suzuki.\n\nSuzuki had previously resigned in disgrace following the Yasuda Crisis and the subsequent economic crash in Guangdong - all of which had been a very public affair. While his failure had little to do with foreign policy, Kaya is uncertain that he is an appropriate choice, especially when there are safer options.\n\nHowever, choosing someone else would risk displeasing the Reform Bureaucrats, and might risk souring the alliance at this early stage. Yet a choice must be made - and made carefully."
 JAP_deal_with_the_devil:0 "Deal With the Devil"
 JAP_deal_with_the_devil_desc:0 "The cabinet is complete.\n\nComposed of innovationists and state-centric bureaucrats, it is a true technocratic cabinet, one which has representation from all wings of the faction. To make such a deal with the Devil of Shōwa came with risks - but thus far, these risks have been tempered with early successes.\n\nHowever, the problems must be tackled one at a time, and our focus for these first years will be a dedicated focus on the military. If we are to bring Japan into a new glorious age, it will require a military to match this ambition.\n\nFor it was the military which secured our dominance once, it was they who helped build our Empire - and now it will be necessary to ensure they can maintain it."

We are the ones in control. We shall not give in to those who oppose us. We were elected for a reason. It is our right to lead this nation and guide it to victory.\n\nWe shall spearhead the rejuvenation of Japan and its people, all on our own."
 JAP_forge_our_own_path:0 "Forge Our Own Path"
 JAP_forge_our_own_path_desc:0 "Fortune favors the bold, those that glance upon the beaten paths and take the risk to carve one for themselves; the world is changing at a breakneck pace, and Kaya's best hope towards his vision of Japan is not with a split cabinet, but one that shares his very own vision, and managed to tame the beast called Bureaucracy in the '30s, Aoki Kazuo?\n\nBetween Kishi's Hardliners, and a diluted compromise, an independent cabinet is the best hope towards true, proper progress for our nation."
 JAP_standing_tall:0 "Standing Tall"
 JAP_standing_tall_desc:0 "As expected, our decision of a cabinet raised many eyebrows and scoffs through the diet, mostly from Kishi and his own clique. However, politics is not a game one should aim to please everyone, lest one indulge in the blandest exercise of futility. However, fortune is a fickle mistress, one that can take away as much as she gives, and abandons rationality in a misplaced belief of invincibility. Our next steps will be very careful, for we must assure Kido and the diet that we will withhold the traditional pillars of power our nation stands on.\n\nOf course, how much we will is up to debate in the future, but once the Rising Sun shines as brightly as it did thirty years before, not much will be up to debate, after all."
 JAP_leading_by_example:0 "Leading by Example"
 JAP_leading_by_example_desc:0 "Like a well-written mathematical function, our cabinet needs one last factor before it can be put into practice, one shining gem that shone dully without the proper spotlight. Fukuda Takeo, a fiscal expert, protegé of Takashi, and fruit of the '30s economical miracle, hand-picked by our closest associates and Kazuo himself, will be the final piece of the crown of the new, developmental line of thought of Kaya's government."
 JAP_rule_by_our_view_or_none:0 "Rule by Our View or None"
 JAP_rule_by_our_view_or_none_desc:0 "With a final stamp of approval, the new cabinet is minted, to the polite approval of the Diet, the support of the bureaucrats and Takagi's faction, and the scorn of Kishi and his clique. Politics is an emotional beast, but much like a beast, it can be controlled, fed, or starved carefully, until it is tame, docile, and most importantly, obedient.The new Japan under Kaya will not be one that will cause awe by saber-rattling, or endless compromises and backroom deals, but the ones that can propel her to heights only seen in the early century.\n\nThe new path has been carved, and it's time to pave it, unimpended."
 JAP_realpolitik:0 "Realpolitik"
 JAP_realpolitik_desc:0 "The Yokusankai is a ravenous beast, one that spits and chews all those that think they can fully control it; a cloaked stage of backstabbing, gossiping, and betrayals mark its history, the names of those foolish enough to face it head-on painted on the walls, like Hirota Koki.\n\nWe will not commit the same mistake. It is time to cash in some favours."
 JAP_talk_with_ikeda:0 "Talk With Ikeda"
 JAP_talk_with_ikeda_desc:0 "Masanosuke Ikeda has a vast influence over a clique of powerful corporatists, it is a resource that, once tapped, could bring immense political capital to Kaya's government. An appointment will have to be made in order for Ikeda to be assured that his present and future concerns are to be well heard.\n\nKawashima Shojiro will therefore be assigned to the task of managing the Home Ministry. The Yokusankai's principles are surely to be dutifully followed by the government."
 JAP_listen_with_kido:0 "Listen With Kido"
 JAP_listen_with_kido_desc:0 "Kido and his group of nobles are another faction which must be dealt with to preserve the stability of our government. Fortunately we should be able to satisfy them easily enough; promises of protecting the power of the Jushin from future reform will likely be enough to keep them on our side for the foreseeable future.\n\nHopefully then we'll both be able to mutually keep an ear out for each other's interests.  "
 JAP_bend_to_pressure:0 "Bend to Pressure"
 JAP_bend_to_pressure_desc:0 "Aoki is a man who is both blessed with a keen understanding of the inner machinations of the Yokusankai and I seat amidst the heart of the government. He has made his presence felt, urging Kaya to follow the lead of the various Yokusankai think tanks, pacifying Ikeda in the process.\n\nIt would be wise for the Prime Minister to give into the pressure."
 JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme:0 "Pragmatism Reigns Supreme"
 JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme_desc:0 "The art of compromise is an incredibly delicate one, this is an assertion which has been proven by the disappointing lukewarm response expected once the new cabinet has been minted. It will be a cabinet restricted by the various compromises made in order to create it, yet the Prime Minister remains confident.\n\nWhether it be through the bureaucracy or the ministries, Kaya will overcome the limitations of pragmatism and he will get his way."
 JAP_begin_the_reforms:0 "Begin the Reforms"
 JAP_begin_the_reforms_desc:0 "The Prime Minister is headstrong in his belief that economic growth must be driven, primarily, by the state; yet, despite all of his confidence, his beliefs are not widely popular with the rest of the powers that be. There is no avoiding that a Lot of convincing will be needed in order to unite the government behind a return to the economic policies of the 1930's.\n\nFor now, only tentative steps can be taken in expectation of the leaps and bounds to come."
 JAP_intergrate_the_military:0 "Intergrate the Military"
 JAP_intergrate_the_military_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the military remains a beast that is difficult to wrangle. On the one hand it must learn to work with us, however, on the other it cannot be completely brought to heal for fear of wrecking the status quo.\n\nSenior commanders will therefore need to be enticed with policies which make the government appear tough and firm against any threat. From there a steady stream of change will guide the military closer into our control."
 JAP_court_the_generals:0 "Court the Generals"
 JAP_court_the_generals_desc:0 "Though the top brass of the imperial army is deeply divided against itself, Kaya remains optimistic that a majority of officers can be brought on to his side. To achieve this, a strong policy toward the security of Manchuria and Korea is to be proposed. Furthermore, continuing to  preserve the stability of these key regions will be crucial to maintaining the army's goodwill."

 JAP_dine_with_admirals_desc:0 "The admiralty is no less concerned over the possibility of Japan letting its commanding position on the world stage slip than their counterparts in the army.

 JAP_the_civilians_will_learn_desc:0 "The effects of our promises to the military have started to set in. Slowly the army is re-asserting itself over Korea, Manchukuo and Guangdong as more funds begin to pour into the military aligned bureaucracies and companies. On top of that, fresh soldiers are being deployed across these regions, the people of these places will remember their place soon enough."

 JAP_the_might_of_our_military_desc:0 "With the military assured of its position in the regime, the Prime Minister can continue to pioneer his vision of state driven reforms back home, safe in the knowledge that the might of the armed forces is on his side; or at least too busy in other places to challenge his authority. Time alone will tell how long this arrangement can hold."
 JAP_political_cleansing:0 "Political Cleansing"
 JAP_political_cleansing_desc:0 "With the cabinet assembled and the twin branches of the armed forces tamed, the rival factions within the Yokusankai must follow suit. By the carrot or the stick, there can be no opposition to the Prime Minister's rule.\n\nOur targets range from the reformists led by Takagi, the conservatives led by Ikeda and the hardliners ruled in part by Nobsuke Kishi. Any one of these factions can be eliminated through concessions or confrontation, however assaulting a faction that makes up a significant portion of our cabinet will doom the Prime Minister's tenure."
 JAP_preserve_the_kotukai:0 "Preserve the Kotukai"
 JAP_preserve_the_kotukai_desc:0 "It once again appears that the perverted ideals of socialism have been introduced into our nation through the use of foreign intervention and influence. These disgusting concepts must be torn out from Japan, root and stem, before too many of our citizens are corrupted.\n\nA federal propaganda initiative encouraging the reporting of suspected socialists and the reinforcement of national autarky has been proposed to the cabinet, and should certainly pass without too much trouble. Surely none of our senior politicians would side with such filth."
 JAP_take_names:0 "Take Names"
 JAP_take_names_desc:0 "It is hard to tell whether the relic bureaucrats from the Ino administration are truly enemies of the Prime Minister, but it makes no difference. Japan is a nation of the future, and our bureaucracy should represent this fact.\n\nThese aged professionals shall be removed from their positions so that they may not damage our regime further with their antiquated practices, and if they happen to be supporters of our enemies' factions, all the better."
 JAP_make_lists:0 "Make Lists"
 JAP_make_lists_desc:0 "Somehow, anti-government organisations still remain within our nation, be it socialists or any other kind of filth. No dissent can be allowed in Japan, none at all.

 JAP_move_quick_desc:0 "Speed and flexibility are all important in this nation of decadent stagnation.

 JAP_crush_dissenters:0 "Crush Dissenters"
 JAP_crush_dissenters_desc:0 "Dissent within the constituent nations of Japan, especially the peoples of the Korean peninsula and the island of Taiwan, has recently surged. While the threats to Japan are minimal, a rebellion within our nation is unacceptable.\n\nLocal police are certainly well equipped, especially for a mission of this scale, but may not pull through entirely on their own. We may choose to use military units and their accompanying police, however such measures may prove overzealous."

 JAP_baptism_by_fire_desc:0 "The elements within Japan preventing our progress have been curbed. Popular dissent has been quenched, and the political establishment has been tamed.

 JAP_untangle_the_economy:0 "Untangle the Economy"
 JAP_untangle_the_economy_desc:0 "Waste is the nemesis of efficiency in all things. The excessive economic bureaucracy of the Empire must be culled, cleaned out of venal interests and parochial fiefdoms. Some might say that paring the state down to size runs against our interest in state-led economic development, but what good is a tool that cannot do exactly what its master intends? Under a renewed Cabinet Planning Board - the coordinating force of Japan's wartime economy in the 1930s - we will marshal Japan's economic resources towards our glorious ends."
 JAP_cleanse_the_corruption:0 "Cleanse the Corruption"
 JAP_cleanse_the_corruption_desc:0 "Personnel is policy, or so the saying goes. Simply integrating the various economic planning agencies and bureaux into a new Cabinet Planning Board will not drive away the agents of graft and political interest that have burrowed so deep into the Empire's body politic. Under Aoki Kazuo's watch, we will vet each individual candidate looking to secure a position in the new CPB, and ensure that incorruptible men of loyal caliber are chosen to serve our interests."

 JAP_prepare_our_tools_desc:0 "No man would charge into battle without ammunition - and so too in the world of policy can we not be left bereft of knowledge. The tools in our battle with the opposition in the Diet are statistics, reams and reams of printed facts and figures pulled from the depths of the Finance and Commerce Ministries' archives to prove our point: that we are the only ones who can do best by the Empire. We will support new think tanks and policy research with generous budget allocations; anyone that dares to challenge us will be found sorely wanting for an argument to prove their point."
 JAP_start_digging:0 "Start Digging"
 JAP_start_digging_desc:0 "By the nature of our constitution, our Army and Navy have a privileged voice in politics, at times both a benefit and a nuisance. But no organization's attention span is infinite and all-encompassing. In the years since the end of the Greater East Asian War, the military has had to minister to the safety and the prosperity of the Sphere at large - and reaping handsome profits in the process. A few more mining licenses in Korea surely would do no harm - to them, and to our own aims in Tokyo."
 JAP_by_any_means:0 "By Any Means"
 JAP_by_any_means_desc:0 "The Cabinet Planning Board, by virtue of lacking competition, has significant powers to direct the functions of the economy at a whim. But whim is a precious and intangible thing, and to base the authority of our programs solely around it is hardly a sustainable solution. We must enshrine the primacy of the Cabinet Planning Board - with our men at its head - in national policymaking in law, so that none can question the provenance of its decisions. The Diet will surely see reason."

 JAP_the_premiership_secured_desc:0 "There were many who doubted that a technocrat, a bureaucrat, could ever scale the heights of politics in the wake of the Yasuda Collapse, coming out on top of the political quagmire birthed by the fall of Prime Minister Ino. How wrong they were! Everyone has a price, if only it could be quantified - and Prime Minister Kaya excels at just that.\n\nThe nobles, the Yokusankai politicians, the reformers, and the military - some showed their hands too early, and others too late. Under Prime Minister Kaya, 'politics' is a solved game - its actors dancing to honeyed promises or cowed by the nightstick."

On closer inspection, we see the several problems menacing Japan, from the daily tussles within our own economy, to the intense staredown between our armed forces.

They hope to more effectively manage the economy and organize it in a way in which the Empire can gather the entirety of its strength in handling threats from abroad. With tensions escalating in Southeast Asia, and civil control quickly slipping out of our hands, it is clear their anxieties are not plucked from thin air.\n\nThere is an awful convenience in what they propose, however. Their grand reorganization proposed will cordon off and regiment the business activities of the bickering Zaibatsu. There is no doubt it will raise eyebrows and voices, outraging those who take their money from under the table, but it's a line we're willing to walk if it means drawing the line for the troublesome corporations. The Prime Minister's signature on the bill will be the first step to bringing the Zaibatsu to heel."
 JAP_a_new_economy:0 "A New Economy"
 JAP_a_new_economy_desc:0 "The proposed plan describes the preferential funding for the \"New Zaibatsu\" in a striking clause - one that has drawn the attention of many in the Diet. It draws attention to conglomerates making swift profits in the industries, such as Mangyo in Manchukuo; their rise to prominence in the region has seized the minds, and greed, of many in Japan. Moreover, Nichitsu and other chemical intensive firms are believed to have climbed up to the bill's attention.\n\nHigh-tech heavy industry, industrial chemical production, and electrical hardware corporations are rising to prominence in the new Japanese economy - we rob ourselves of economic successes to come by not securing them a place in the future of Japanese development. These industries will be the prime order of the new system we construct in the future of the Empire."
 JAP_oil_sufficiency:0 "Oil Sufficiency"
 JAP_oil_sufficiency_desc:0 "If the Americans were rightfully obsessed with anything at all, it would be their love of fuel that powered their ravaging economy. After all, the oil beneath the soil and shores powers great machines, railways, and tanks - enough for us to continue our administration of the Empire and her allies. It is the black-as-night blood that trickles down every vein of the national economy, and what will ultimately make secure our position in the world.\n\nMoney is to be diverted away from wasteful adventures and into expanding oil development facilities in Manchuria, where the industry has taken root in recent years. Resources must be allocated into expanding oil prospecting in Borneo, where we expect huge deposits lay dormant and untapped. With enough access to fuel, Japan will never thirst in her reign as protector."

Led by Admiral Takagi, they have been closing their ranks in the house to resist our advances in reorganizing the economic performance of the Empire.\n\nOpposition of key policy issues challenge every government, however, and we are not without methods to skirt around their clear defiance. A careful manipulation of parliamentary procedures, as well as the exploitation of other quasi-legal bill-drafting techniques, will be deployed to the floor. Eventually we will be able to easily navigate confrontation altogether, and submit the bill to the House of Representatives for review."

It is time we gag their wailing; obstruction to our agenda will cost the Empire more than enough in limited time, wealth, and resources.\n\nWith a rider in expanding previous anti-corruption laws, which tackle head-on think-tanks \"adhering\" to the Kokutai and state, we may draw the knife to gut Takagi's ranks of intellectuals and sophists by catching his think-tanks in the net. They will certainly decry that we wield political power like a weapon against criticism, but congruency and convenient agreements have fattened previous governments before our own.

As such, we will offer soft words and amicable assurances to those in authority of both Mitsui and Mitsubishi Zaibatsus, but nothing more. Our speech must dance the line between kind warning and half-truths.\n\nAlthough we will not show the same mercy to Sumitomo, we hold the seat of government at the end of the day. The Zaibatsus should be thankful we would be so kind as to coordinate with them in our efforts to reorganize the Japanese economy.

The Kaya government has had a similar revelation; there exists a trail of paper crumbs implicating the Zaibatsus Mitsui and Mitsubishi in accounts of corruption and money laundering. It is only a matter of time before the two trip over their own feet, and leave themselves exposed to incriminating charges.\n\nRather than pounce now, It is best we stay still and watch for them to leave behind enough evidence to pull them up in their shady dealings with the Navy and those in Takagi's camp. With the thread left open and left to unravel, the Zaibatsus and their pawns are bound to ensnare themselves in the corrupt web of connections they have spun for so long beneath our noses."

However, despite their usefulness, it is imperative they do not challenge the government in governing the country. In recent years, some Zaibatsus have grown greedy and unruly, even fattening themselves in moments of government neglect and growing in influence without moderation.\n\nThus, there is no other option but to cut out their tongues and pockets, and it is only acceptable that this government holds the knife. Mitsui and Mistubishi's influence in the political economy, stretching from realms of economic domination of entire regions to preferential administrative treatment, and their raspy voices in the Diet, must be cut down from where they are seated."

Both facing government crack-downs, there is a chance, although slim, that they make to scurry and defend themselves in collaboration.\n\nIndeed, they share a mutual interest in resisting attacks on their economic dominance and perfidious influence over the Japanese political machine. Thus, it is of the paramount interest that disagreements, bickering, and strife arise between the two, so that we may eliminate any interest in corporate partnership. It may require that we invest in the use of inappropriate means to do so, but the line must be drawn. After all, when the gavel is struck, it will be the corrupt businessmen who will face the hate."

It is in their best interests, and in the best interests of our government, to collaborate and coordinate on the production of heavy industrial chemicals.

A little humiliation from time to time was worth it if it meant progress for his beloved nation.\n\nSeated across from the table was Shiina Etsusaburo and Kishi Nobusuke. The former shook his hand, and the latter smilied, gesturing towards a seat. A seat a little too low for Kaya's preference. \n\n\"I need your help, gentlemen,\" Kaya said. \"You two have proven yourselves efficient bureaucrats time and time again, which we have dire need of. I would appreciate it if both of you were to publicly, and privately, support my new cabinet. Your reputation would give my cabinet a certain legitimacy that it currently does not have.\" Kaya straightened his back, even as both men smiled and nodded. Here come the demands, he thought.\n\nShiina started. \"We would be glad to give our support, Prime Minister, but...\" \n\nKishi now took over. \"But we would both prefer that you could... well, throw us a bone, so to speak.\" The man chuckled at his own joke, waiting for a response.\n\n\"Very well. I had it in mind to revive a few retired agencies and ministries,\" Kaya replied. \"They were powerful institutions that boosted our nation to the spot of a global superpower. I thought both of you could lend a hand in reconstructing these agencies and ministries, controlling them after the fact.\"\n\n\"That would suit us wonderfully.\" Shiina said, a broad smile across his face. Kishi, on the other hand, did not look as pleased as his counterpart. Another round of bribes would be coming, Kaya thought. Hopefully, he did not ask for too much more."

In our career, there are rarely second chances; we'll grasp this one with both hands, and I, for one, will not let go until my death,\" Kishi replied. \"The work we will be able to accomplish... well, it's indescribable.\" \n\n\"It's good that we could finally come to terms with the New Bureaucrats too.\" Shiina thought out loud. \"We wouldn't have been able to maintain a rivalry within our faction, so I'm glad that's been sorted away. Giving them those lesser cabinet posts has worked rather nicely.\"\n\n\"I would not have thought anybody in the Yokusankai would have supported us after that whole affair with Tojo, twenty years ago,\" Kaya sighed, poking at his own food.  Fear had taken his appetite away, whereas it seemed to only have enhanced Shiina's. It was only lunch, yet the man had almost consumed a whole duck, half a loaf of bread and various spreads besides. \n\n\"Shit scrubs off.\" Shiina said, chuckling."

Tons of these same bureaucrats have been assigned to high level positions in Manchukuo, and almost all of them hold or held a position in the Ministry of Commerce.\"\n\nThe two journalists had a sizable stack of recent government bulletins laid on the desk, outlining bureaucratic shuffling, government reassignment, public service reworks... and all of it seemingly involving either the promotion of the so-called Reform Bureaucrats, or someway enhancing their power within the bureaucracy or the government.\n\n\"I suppose it's not hard to argue that Kaya has made a deal with Kishi's lot?\" Kane chuckled.\n\n\"I suppose it isn't, but I'm just not sure of what any of this means. What it will lead to.\" Aoto shrugged, rubbing his eyes. His day had been long enough just gathering notes on all of these damn pamphlets. And that wasn't even to mention the deal with Aoki Kazuo and Fukuda Takeo.

The Prime Minister sipped at his water, wondering which schmoe would stand up next to frustrate his plans.\n\nShiina Etsusaburo, it would seem. \"The Cabinet Planning Board aches for reform,\" he began. \"Our practices of the past are just that: of the past. Old ways are nothing more than obstacles for progress, and the people that defend them only a little less so. I say yes to these reforms, and so, I am sure, do many of my colleagues.\" \n\nShiina smilied, and looked to the Prime Minister. \"My only question is when Minister Kaya might get out of our way, and finally allow the rest of us a little work for a change.\" The comment elicited the laughs of his aligned Reform Bureaucrats.\n\nIt seemed Shiina's show of support was as much of a shock to the rest of the Yokusankai as it was to Kaya. Murmurs and whispers flowed all throughout the assembled politicians, which exploded into loud displeasure as Kishi Nobusuke stood, agreeing with Shiina's points and voicing his approval for the reform. If those dimwits in the Yokusankai didn't clue into Kaya's deal, they certainly would've now.\n\n\"56 to 44!\" The vote counter called out in a bellowing voice. \"The Cabinet Planning Board has passed!\" The man's voice was answered by applause from Kaya's side and utter bewilderment by the opposition.

Close acquaintances then, Kaya thought, entering the office.\n\n\"The foreign minister,\" Kaya said. \"My cabinet is not complete until we have one, so I have a mind to run my choice by you two: Arita Hachiro.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister looked from Shiina to Kishi. \"It's a good choice.\" Shiina said. \n\n\"But we have a better one.\" Kishi added. \"Suzuki Teiichi.\"\n\n\"Suzuki Teiichi?\" Kaya said with a frown. The man was a political outcast ever since his failure in Guangdong. He did not hold an enviable position, managing that chaotic little nation. Perhaps there was something to the man after all.\n\n\"Suzuki Teiichi.\" Kishi smilied. \"Less likely people have held the Foreign Ministry before, you know.\"\n\n\"Who has?\"\n\nKishi smiled again, then frowned. \"Well, I can't remember their names off the top of my head... But I'm sure there were one or two.\"\n\n\"Suzuki could fit the role.\" Kaya thought. His failure in Guangdong was a domestic issue, not an international one, yet assigning him a minister could attract a fair bit of negative attention anyhow. Arita Hachiro would not have that effect, but his appointment could risk the relationship Kaya had only just formed with the two men in front of him. He had to be decisive, though. Kaya opened his mouth, and gave the men his answer."

All of these men understood the need to force Japan to progress, be it through the carrot or the stick, from his own cabinet to the hand picked innovationists and some state orientated bureaucrats. He could see an issue with Kishi Nobusuke coming down the line, but as long as he kept the man happy, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\"We have already made incredible progress, especially with help from our friend Mr Kishi Nobusuke. Now is the time to capitalize on our work, take the initiative, so to speak. We shall press forwards with a new direction, and I myself already have a thought in mind. To advance our nation, the military must be enshrined and made great.\"\n\nHis cabinet sat silent, nodding along, smilies on each and every one of their faces. They, at least, understood. The innovationists and bureaucrats seemed less keen, but that could be worked over with time. \"I must say, Mr Prime Minister, that I could not put it any better than yourself. The military defends our nation and our allies. To forget them, well, that would be an outrage.\" Kishi said, a great beaming smile across his face.

The Prime Minister's old bones were aching, his hands nearly shaking. Administration was proving difficult.\n\nIt was six by the time the meeting concluded with a final thought from Kaya. The cabinet was at least a little more active by then, with the benefits of coffee boosting their energy. \"Policy cannot be allowed to be dictated by the party. Any party, be it the Yokusankai or the opposition. The elites of this nation too; none can be allowed to flaunt and avoid our laws. This is just the beginning of our work.\"\n\n\"It shames me to have to chip at my colleagues' success, but to encourage unity within the party, some of our newly made friends will have to suffer lesser cabinet positions. The Reform Bureaucrats will be rewarded in due time, but unfortunately, that time is just not now.\"\n\nThe cabinet was dead silent, listening on in fearful anticipation. \"Those are my final thoughts, gentlemen. Take on board all I have said today, and we can begin to start building this nation back to greatness.\" The Prime Minister chuckled and added, \"Hopefully without the all-nighters.\""

He trusted few factions to act not in their own self interest, and fewer still he could trust to act for the benefit of Japan. It was clear the politicians were waiting for him however, so Kaya began his speech.\n\n\"I want to keep this brief, but I have a few words I am sure some members among us would benefit from hearing. This party cannot remain divided. The disasters of the past have proven this fact to us, and each level of our government is somewhat responsible for this division.'\n\n'What is best for Japan, what is best for its survival, is the preservation of the Kokutai. Such division only weakens these structures, and I for one will not stand by and watch this happen. I will yield the floor back, but allow me these final words: only united can this government stand strong.\"\n\nFaint applause came about as Kaya stood down, but not from the leaders of said factions - Ikeda and Takagi in particular. Each gave the Prime Minister an icy stare, and scoffed with disdain as Kaya met their eyes. It did not matter. If they stood in the way of progress, Kaya would crush them."

The chamber was alive with activity, yet the most important motion was yet to be passed: Kaya's motion.\n\n\"All in favour of the Prime Minister's motion, please raise your hand!\" The speaker called out. Neither Takagi's clique nor the status-quo politicians within the Yokusankai decided to raise, although Kaya hadn't expected them to. It was his own clique and the Reform Bureaucrats he needed. With grunts of disdain, they, to a man, raised their hands. It would be good enough.\n\nShouts of disapproval came from across the aisle as the speaker's voice rang out across the room: \"The proposal of Mr Okinori passes!\" It seemed the opposition hated his government almost as much as they hated each other. \n\nNothing new, Kaya thought. This was what politics was about; playing the enemies off of each other. Power would not come from begging for scraps, it would come from making enemies.

In my opinion,Prime Minister, you give him far too much power as it is.\"\n\n\"Both the liberals and conservatives are growing within the Yokusankai,\" another said. \"And if they think our government weak, they would most certainly band together to oppose us, and bury us.\"\n\n\"Every government in this country has faced the same problems, gentlemen!\" Kaya bellowed, silencing the cabinet. When they quietened, he allowed his voice to level. \"From yesterday to the Taisho era, this has been an issue. The factionalism, the backstabbing, the asslicking. Yet, we can manage this.

He had told the minister to keep an eye out for the press' reception of the government's new agenda. The front page headline 'Kaya Okinori: A Guiding Light to the Future' informed the Prime Minister that this reception had been a positive one. Littered throughout the paper were more encouraging headlines and articles, all showing a genuine interest and cautious hope for Kaya's newly made government.

Kaya held a true belief; that his government had a plan that would bring Japan into another age of prosperity, a plan the Yokusankai would have no choice but to toe. That was true self belief: the belief in your own competency.\n\nKaya was the Prime Minister of Japan. All doubts must be expelled. He was entrusted by the Emperor himself to lead his nation. He would not fail now.\n\nThe Diet had assembled slowly today, and even now, the chambers echoed with idle chatter. Kaya's voice quietened their murmurs, the chamber speaker officially calling the session. All eyes turned to Kaya, burning into him. This is leadership, he told himself. This was the burden of ruling, and he would not succumb to it.\n\n\"My colleagues. My cabinet and I have crafted a plan for prosperity. Some of you amongst us have aided us in doing so, whereas some of you have only hindered us. That does not matter now. As servants of Japan, I expect every one of you to toe the party line, to help my cabinet in whatever way you can to ensure this plan can be fully implemented across the nation. The time for petty grievances is over.\" \n\nEven Kaya impressed himself by that line, spoken with a leader's voice - finally, he thought. \"Whatever you may think of my government, the time for argument and debate is over. I will not suffer anymore hindrances. I will not suffer factionalism. I will not suffer cliques. From hereon, I expect the Yokusankai's full cooperation to see my plan brought into fruition.\" Kaya squinted. Perhaps he had been too rough.

Then he would start again, and repeat the exercise, each time coming to the same conclusion: the technocrats alone could not carry the government.\n\nKaya ran a hand through his hair and sighed. How much easier things would be, if he could throw caution to the wind! He'd been chosen as Prime Minister; did he not have the right to determine policy as he wished? And Kishi's hardliners were more than dependable in a legislative scrap, even if they asked a high price for their services.\n\nBut politics was the art of the possible, and right now, it was impossible to see a way out without the YSK's other factions. The technocrats would not survive long without either the public cover provided by the conservatives, or the aristocratic networks of the Kidoites.\n\nThe last thing Japan needed, Kaya mused, was for the YSK to be consumed by infighting, when it needed stable leadership most of all. Even if it meant forcing the hardliners - most notably Kishi Nobusuke and his protege, Shiina Etsusaburo - to accept minor cabinet positions as a peace offering.\n\nSo be it.

I'm impressed you could find this many insiders so quickly.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, the YSK has many qualified experts within its ranks,\" Kaya said, smiling politely. \"Factions don't count for much when you look strictly for expertise.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Ikeda nodded appreciatively as he weighed Kaya's verbal supplication, but Kaya said nothing. Ikeda wasn't going to agree to cooperate for free, the other shoe had to drop -\n\n\"Of course, I have a few suggestions for the less prominent posts.\" Ikeda crossed his legs languidly, smiling like a cat. \"The Ministry of Commerce, perhaps?\n\nKaya pursed his lips, immediately discerning the intent of Ikeda's 'suggestion.' He'd already given the Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs prime place in his cabinet, sidelining his own hardliners' supporters in the Ministry of Greater East Asia. Now Ikeda wanted to claim the Ministry of Commerce - Kishi Nobusuke's alma mater - for himself.\n\nIt didn't take a genius to understand the anger that would provoke - which was exactly the point."

I expect to hear these complaints frequently in future Diet sessions, in fact.'\n\n'But know this. We are no longer living in an age where such appeals to emotion or to ideals will suffice to deal with the problems Japan faces. Our issues will not be solved by instituting arbitrary levels of economic freedom or social permissiveness. They will not be solved by politicians invoking the Emperor's name in the cause of pedantry or their own special interests. They will not be solved through political theatre.'\n\n'Our issues will be solved through utilising our constitutionally-granted power to guide Japan in the right direction. They will be solved by forcing our institutions, by hook or by crook, to work in the national interest. They will be solved because they will be regarded as problems to be solved, rather than issues of contention between the ambitious and greedy. Though this may not sound pleasant to many sitting here, it is necessary. And if you value Japan in your hearts as much as your oaths would imply, you will do what is necessary to see Japan through.\"\n\nKaya looked around the room. The liberals were silent, as could be predicted, while the technocrats were almost howling with applause, Kishi almost bouncing in his seat. The conservatives clapped, as politely and uselessly as always. Entirely expected outcomes. Despite what the movies said, grand speeches were never enough to truly sway opinion."

 japkaya_tree_one.21.desc: "The military was an odd beast, thought Kaya. One with two heads and orders of magnitude more internal cliques and contradictions. A supremely important and necessary pillar of national strength, yet a corrupt financial drain, constantly spending more time at each others' throats than at the enemy's. Something which needs to be brought to heel, for its own sake and for that of the nation, but one which would almost rather destroy itself than submit to oversight.\n\nKaya supposed part of it owed to the traditional views of military officials towards civilian administration. Never mind that Kaya himself had managed to bankroll their great crusade across the Pacific in the thirties and forties, nor the need to budget and finance armies in general. To generals and admirals the world over, men like Kaya were little more than pencil-necked bureaucrats standing in the way of their great ambitions, or skewed visions of necessity. But the truth of it all - one that the smarter military men recognised - was that they needed each other. Kaya was far from too proud to admit it. The armed forces were the only institutions capable of mustering the strength to deter the threats from outside, and disciplining the threats from within. But for them to understand this, a bone would have to be thrown.\n\nFortunately, the generals liked to consider themselves men of force and action, exactly what they would soon be required to deliver. They would need funding for this. Thus, to give them what they wanted was a matter of simply directing them to where they were needed. A few tense evenings and a few misunderstandings cleared, and this could be set in motion. Perhaps even Takagi could be brought on board."

One slightly pickled general was holding a fork into the air like a spear, glaring daggers at the men around him. \"Politicians treat fronts and armies like they treat cars, to be adored for a time, and then thrown away when a new, shinier model comes by, regardless of utility and spirit,\" he continued. \"The Kwantung Army has been steadily ignored for decades now, while Tokyo gawks southward. Don't let the fatcats in Hsinking fool you: the partisans are very much still active, and Russia's growing less chaotic by the day. When they come for Urajio, how long will it take your men to march from Shonan-to?\"\n\n\"It was my understanding that the Kwangtung Army was supposed to hand over responsibilities to this highly competent and motivated Manchurian Imperial Army I keep hearing about for years now,\" countered another, with puffy red cheeks and a tortured, mangled pile of seafood below him. \"We don't have the time or money for your speculations or paranoia. You won in the north. Savour your victory. Down south, meanwhile, we still have real wars to fight, and a real job to do.\"\n\n\"Why you-\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, please!\" Glaring heads whipped round towards Kaya, smiling serenely. \"The failures and indiscretions of previous administrations may have caused you to forget that we have the economy of a superpower behind us, one which promises to only grow further still as we put it towards a healthier direction. Nobody will be left behind, and we are more than prepared to meet each of your needs.\""

He had half expected them to conduct their own little mock exercise over his table, with knives and fish heads in place of bullets and shrapnel. The IJN, it seemed, were content to leave such brutish behavior to the open seas, if it existed at all.\n\nTheir requests were simple, and could easily be granted. More funding, of course, that much was obvious. Key bases would be strongly reinforced and key shipping routes protected more vigorously. Resources would be allocated to help build the maritime forces of Japan's loyal allies in Southeast Asia. The future would be accounted for in equal measure with the present: new naval technologies, grants for the study of tactics, increased observation on the changing nature of ocean warfare around the world, all would be keenly considered. Nothing would be forgotten, no stone left unturned. A comprehensive, full package, for Japan's brave defenders on the waters.\n\nJust then, Takagi slowly rose to stand, making Kaya's heart skip a beat. Pleasant or no, the admirals were deeply connected to the YSK liberals, and so a man like Takagi's opinion counted as double here. Would this be enough, to cooperate on at least this one issue?\n\n\"As we all well know,\" Takagi began, \"me and the Prime Minister disagree on a wide variety of issues, and I expect we will continue to do so in the future. However, I must admit I find myself impressed with his proposed plan for the navy. Whatever misgivings we may have then, I would like to express my admiration for what we see before us now.\""

It was all printed right up on the great map of Asia in his office. Slowly, but surely, the marks representing the activities of various consulates, development agencies, joint projects with Cultural Affairs in various nations, all were drying up. What they were being replaced with instead was garrisons, attaches, joint training camps, naval bases, things of that sort. From Kwantung to Kuala Lumpur, civilian authorities were fading into the background, and as various jurisdictional scuffles were sorted, the army and the navy were moving in. Shunichi looked around his cozy little office, and wondered if it would be so cosy this time next year.\n\nFar away, in a much grander, less cozy office, [GetJapHoG] turned to Kaya. \"The ministries are growing less than pleased, you know. Every day, more mail comes in, going on about overreach, or abuse of power, or the 'complete impossibility' of working together productively with whatever branch of the armed forces are encroaching on their perches. If things continue this way, we may have a serious problem.\"\n\nKaya's expression remained blank. \"We always knew something of this sort would occur. Fear of poking the hornet's nest is what lead to our current predicament. We can no longer afford such placations. The integration goes ahead as planned.\""

The numbers didn't lie. Efficiency was improving across the board, the military presence was finally driving some much needed discipline into civilian administration, and the armed forces themselves were finally beginning to be equipped and act as soldiers of Japan, rather than a mass of brutes with firearms. Japan's institutions, at last, were learning to put aside their feeble, pointless squabbles, and move ahead in a unified direction. Things could soon be set right, and the future could mean something once more.\n\nThe economy could grow again, unlocking all kinds of new possibilities. Asia would be secure once more. Be the threat from armies, partisans, corruption, rot, natural disaster or nuclear hellfire, the Sphere would stand ready. Ready, together and united, Japan would finally be able to stand as the noble vanguard of the Pan-Asian cause, enveloping the East in mutual cooperation and technical proficiency. And in doing so, their enemies would tremble.\n\nKaya, for his part, felt a little like trembling at that very moment. His doctor would surely say that now was no hour for a man of his age to work, Prime Minister or no. But Kaya knew that this was foolish, when one considered all the work yet to do. His body and mind ached in equal measure, yes, but they also burned with the satisfaction of a job well done."

Fortunately for us, most of the worst offenders also the most opposed to the aims of our government.\"\n\n\"How surprising,\" Kaya mused. \"All the better for us.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Fukuda added. Everyone seemed content with it as well - that was, until Shiina spoke up.\n\n\"So long as this is only the start,\" Shiina said. \"We have only scratched the tip of the iceberg. This corruption has spread far outside the Diet, and we will need to purge it from all parts of the nation if we are to restore her national character. We cannot only cut half the rot while leaving the rest to fester.\"\n\nThe room went quiet at that declaration. Aoki nodded in silent agreement, while Fukuda frowned. \"And what does that entail? The military? The schools? Where would such actions stop - and would it be warranted?\"\n\nNone of them seemed eager to speak after Shiina and Fukuda, and Kaya became aware of the gulf that existed on where they each wanted to take this. It was Kishi who finally spoke. \"Such discussions are premature until the passage of the anti-corruption bill. Beyond it, I see little harm in discussing the merits of all proposals - including Shiina's.\" Kishi's eyes tracked to each of them, both wary and authoritative."

Caught him stuffing money into a sack in the middle of the night, mistress and everything. Like something from a newspaper cartoon!\"\n\n\"No shit?\" Honda raised an eyebrow. \"Thought even that bastard would have been more careful, or at least had some kind of backup plan for this. How the hell did a guy like him get through Yasuda otherwise?\"\n\n\"I guess he must have had to call in all his favours back then. In any case, he's gone. Him and thirty others, from what I can tell. Hashimoto, Sato from Hokkaido, Sekiguchi...\"\n\n\"Wait, Sekiguchi?\" asked Honda. \"I thought you two were in business together, in a manner of speaking.\n\n\"We were, but I did it the smart way,\" said Arukawa. \"The kind that's protected under riders and compromise. For now, at least, no matter what Kaya wants, I remain a free man.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd be more careful if I were you,\" said Honda. \"Next time, you might just end up like Yasutomo.

It may bear the name of anti-corruption, but it only takes a cursory read of the fine print to determine the act's real purpose - the silencing of all opposition to the Prime Minister. If you are aligned with this relic of the Tojo era, and you are certain, absolutely certain, you stand no chance of crossing him or being otherwise turned to nutrients in order to feed the renewed national defence state, then by all means, vote aye. But if you any ounce of sense or care for Japan and its institutions, then I don't need to tell you what to do.\" The liberal representative sat down.\n\nOther speeches of this ilk followed, and when the time to vote came, the results were not pretty. Kaya did not know it was possible for him to feel twenty years older, but the sensation streaking through him must have been the equivalent. Despite the use of the fullest extent of the Prime Minister's cleaning tools, the filth had not been cleared from the heart of Japanese politics. Not one inch. As it piled up more and more, it would threaten to turn to blight, creating a rot so deep only complete destruction and rebuilding would suffice to make Japan whole again.\n\nBut they had not made it to that stage yet, and Kaya would not let it happen. He still lived, he still breathed, the fire remained within, and most importantly, he was still Prime Minister. The worms had not escaped his attention, and they would not escape his wrath. He began to make his way back to the Prime Minister's Residence. There were files to look through, reports to write, contingencies to be made, and as always, much work to be done."

Honor, duty, filial loyalty - replaced by the division of liberalism and the false utopia of socialism!\"\n\n\"And your solution is to browbeat citizens and businesses into compliance with penalties?\" Aoki shot back, disdain dripping from his words. \"The economy plunges to new depths every day, and you want to spend time on indoctrination rather than work! It's unenforceable - and it's a mistake.\"\n\n\"If you're that set on political education,\" Fukuda pointed out, barely hiding a sneer, \"we already have the national broadcaster. Why not -\"\n\n\"I don't see why this is so controversial,\" Kishi said, cutting Fukuda off briskly. \"We all memorized the Imperial Rescript on Education as schoolchildren. It's our first duty as Imperial subjects.

His influence will be broken tomorrow.\"\n\nAll of them nodded. Ino was by far the most corrupt official of their generation, and if they wanted to show they were serious about removing the corruption in the government, they had to start with his cronies. \"Easy to justify to the public,\" one of the officials said.\n\nHe was correct. This was not an operation that Kaya was expecting public pushback on - at least at first. Kaya then lowered his voice, almost to a conspiratorial level. \"A final note - do not overlook those who may also be opposed to our government. I expect that those opposed to our agenda may find themselves in this net we are casting.\"\n\nA few smirks around the room at the clear implication.

Kaya went to sleep, and while he slept, [GetJapSecMin] and the security forces acted.\n\nThe next morning, the papers were awash with bolded headlines and frantic commentary. The scope of the bureaucratic purge was extensive, and many were excited at the developments, seeing the deep corruption finally starting to be dealt with.

Politicians would blather about the state instead of the emperor, but he'd still be there.\"\n\n\"Well, that's exactly it, isn't it?\" countered Miyuki. \"It's not enough to simply cite Lenin or Luxembourg's comments on bourgeois democracy, especially given their distance to Japan, we must examine the Japanese tradition more thoroughly. Consider, we constantly hear invocations of the Emperor, but when has the Emperor acted in any real kind of independent fashion. When Minobe proposes to subordinate the emperor's position to that of a symbol of the state, does this not reflect the unsaid reality of the present?\"\n\nBefore Ryunousuke could respond, a knock came at the door, followed by Akira walking in slowly. \"Fuck's sake, man, it's been twenty minutes! Were you followed-\" began Miyuki, who was interrupted by Akira levelling a Tokko badge at the reading group.\n\n\"I'll give you one chance to surrender,\" said Akira, if that was indeed his real name. \"You have three seconds.\" Before two had passed, however, Ryunouske rushed towards Akira, fists balled.

The only thing that kept his attention was the rhythmic drumming of Fukuda's fingers, the incessant tapping worming its way into his busy mind as he struggled further to assess the situation his gamble had so unceremoniously cast him into.\n\nAcross him sat two men, men who had warned him that his compromises with the Hardliners would be nothing but a frivolous expenditure of much needed political capital, their eyes flicking upward to face the Prime Minister's distraught expression.\n\nWords did not float between the Prime Minister and his associates, not words in the verbal sense anyway. Within Kaya's eyes was something that had not been present before: regret. He could only blame himself, not those who surrounded him, for the death of the Higher Education Regulation Act. He had been swayed by the Hardliners, enticed by their support in the infernal gauntlet that was the game of Japanese politics, and they had brought him nothing but ridicule and mockery.\n\nThe press, growing in number upon the bustling streets, chattered endlessly about the humiliation Kaya, and most importantly his government, had faced at what was to be their most prestigious moment. Here he sat, puzzled at his own foolish choice as the walls of the room seemed to swirl with the same confused agony that blasted through his thoughts.\n\nKaya sighed, a certain stress present in his tone.

The Hardliners had reached too far, and for this Kaya had elected that they would be taking the fall for what could have been a failure entirely his own.\n\nThe Higher Education Act had failed, but the rejection of his bill would not be attached to Kaya's reputation, but that of the faction that had sought to worm its way into a comfortable position beside him. Like a parasite they had tried to cling to his cabinet, and like a parasite Kaya and his government had seen fit to see them dealt with. Their influence would wane, and his would only take a slight dent at the end of it all.\n\nKaya wondered if he would soon see steam pouring from Shiina's ears, musing silently to himself as he basked in the success of his plan. However, his thoughts would soon turn to the next issue at hand, the press and their damned ungrateful prodding. He had bent to the demands for a free vote, he had submitted to their morality, and even yet they questioned the sincerity of his actions. Could he not win?\n\nAnd as he continued to wonder, and Shiina continued to grumble in his rage, he came upon a certain fear now lodged in his mind."

Oh, how he had courted them with lavish gifts and silver tongued promises. Yet it seemed, by the incessant deafening ringing of the phone seated across from him, that neither had been enough to satiate the ambition and worry of the generals and admirals alike. Reaching over, Kaya unhooked the phone receiver from its crimson resting place, heaving it up toward his ears with the strain of a man lifting a weight much heavier than he could bear to lift. \n\n\"Prime Minister Kaya, I'm afraid there is something that we must discuss. I'm sure you've heard of the unrest building within-\" His Minister of the Army, Hori Eizo, rambled on, but Kaya slowly grew deaf to his words, letting the receiver pressed to his ear drop and clatter across the desk. Kaya knew what Eizo had come here to ask, and he knew what his answer would be: no deliberation was needed to assess that the army and the navy's ambitions needed to be placated with another carrot, on a fresh stick.\n\n\"Grant them an expansion of the mining efforts in Korea. Give them enough, but not all of it. We still need something to bait them if they elect to reach deeper into my pockets,\" Kaya curtly responded, a venomous distaste in his tone as he snatched the battered receiver from its place upon his desk, crudely interrupting Eizo with his order.

By the time you see the letter, I have ended my life voluntarily for a cause. Please, before you weep my departure from the tangible world, heed my words and take a moment to think about it as I have always asked you to. Since the passing of the act, 23 professors at our university have been removed from their position. Needless to say, their views were incompatible with the path of our administration. They did nothing but follow the pursuit of academic freedom. Yet, their acts out of intellectual curiosity and justice for the masses earned them cold, unforgiving fists from the Home Ministry.\n\nA friend of mine and maybe yours, Professor Kouyama Iwao, was one of those who lost their tenure. He was the sole breadwinner of his family and a firm believer of Asian Co-Prosperity through equality and fraternity between nations. Yet, not only did he lose his job, he also received a hefty fine from Tokko for \"unpatriotic acts\". In what world would a just, kind man like him suffer like this? In what world could a man be punished just for siding with good? In what world would calling for fraternity between peoples of Asia be a crime? While there is little I can do in the tangible world, I hereby leave my worldly inheritance to his family, and I sincerely plead to you all to assist innocent scholars like him if it isn't a burden.\n\nAs a humble student of Zen Buddhism, I know well enough that ending my life prematurely is in no agreement with Buddha's teaching, and I strongly advise you against pursuing my path. I believe, however, that my death can be of benefit to you as a message and a plea to our government. If my failure to achieve nirvana can bring forth an era of academic freedom and equality among people of the Sphere, then so be it. "

One attorney who defended a group of students reported, \"I was not permitted to present my defense; it took the judge 5 minutes to sentence 20 students to 8 months in prison.\"\n\nNever has this nation seen brutal suppression against its populace like this, and needless to say, Kaya's action was met with attacks from all sides, including diet members who initially supported the bill. Even conservatives led by Rep. Ikeda Masanosuke and reformists led by Rep. Takagi Soukichi put aside their differences, making a joint announcement that any bill submitted by Kaya would not and never would gain their support. Following this was another statement, co-signed by 25 prefectural governors, declaring that local law enforcement would not comply with any arrest order associated with the Act.\n\nFacing this unprecedented opposition against the government, PM Kaya and his cabinet insisted that the act is a success.

Fukuda Takeo and Aoki Kazuo, both men who planned to unite the Diet with proposals emphasizing the role of the private economy in the wake of the Zaibatsus' past domination. Kaya had to admit, their backgrounds as Ministry of Finance bureaucrats muzzled during the war showed in their proposals. They echoed the ideas of the 1920s and early 30s. However, these were Kaya's best minds on the subject, and their proposals were well-developed. Kaya looked up at the two men and asked, \"These proposals are strong, do you have any other resources that we can turn to?\"\n\nAoki was the first to respond, \"The Cabinet Planning Board and Home Ministry still have many of their predecessors' documents for us to refer to,\" he paused briefly, \"However, many of the actual specifics still need to be worked out,\" he added with an acidic tone. Fukuda nodded in agreement.\n\nKaya sighed as he looked back to the proposals. Even though their details were somewhat vague, they were all they had. In the wake of the tremendous failures of Yasuda and the 40s establishment, these proposals might just be the solution to Japan's problems.

There were two incompatible proposals sitting in front of Kaya.

Explain your proposal.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Prime Minister. My proposal is simple: A state-led program for economic recovery and social organization. It's built upon the well-founded principles of bureaucratic planning and stability that lead our nation to prosperity in the past. My proposal will also help us gain the support of the more conservative members of the Diet.\"\n\nFukuda quickly cut in, \"Those principles have clearly failed us once, let's not give them a second chance,\" he turned to Kaya, who motioned for him to continue, \"Yasuda has granted us an opportunity to rebuild Japan's economy from the ground up, we should seize that opportunity. An expansive investment budget and Keynesian spending will revitalize Japan's economy and help fortify it against any future crisis such as this one. Clearly-\"\n\nAoki interrupted him, \"Like anyone would support such a proposal!

If Kaya had invited Fukuda here alone, then Fukuda was clearly trusted by the Prime Minister, a good sign for the events to come.\n\nAfter an exchange of greetings, Kaya cut straight to the point, \"I have decided to back your proposal to revitalize Japan's economy. Tomorrow we will put together your proposed investment budget.\"\n\n\"Thank you for this opportunity, Prime Minister. I assure you that you've made the right choice,\" replied Fukuda. He was glad to hear Kaya agreed that the Japanese economy needed to be revitalized under its own power.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Kaya spoke again, \"You should keep in mind that you'll need to keep the other factions of the Yokusankai in line.\"\n\nFukuda was quick to reply, \"Of course, Prime Minister. I'll begin contacting faction leaders as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"You'll also need to keep Aoki informed. His proposal may have been rejected, but he's still Cabinet Secretary-General, and his input should not be ignored,\" added Kaya. Fukuda nodded in response.

And the only way to do that, is by stepping on the toes of the landlords who got us into this mess.\"\n\nKaya sighed. \"I don't disagree with you in principle, but we have to pass a bill here, through both houses. I don't need to tell you how much land the average peer holds, and they're not going to vote for something they see as a challenge to themselves. If we can't present this as a boon to landlord and tenant alike, we will achieve nothing. And we simply can't let that happen.\"\n\n\"But this will just be another stopgap, we can't just keep kicking the can-\" Fukuda stopped himself. \"No, you're right. But all the same, we can't just give landowners money and equipment and pray it'll be put to productive use. Any bill we draft here is going to have to be very precise, and very carefully worded. Otherwise, we won't have simply done nothing, we'll have done less than nothing."

Finally, the fatcats in Tokyo were doing something for the little guys, in the forgotten prefectures. Aomori was back on the map. He would have to get his accountant to look at the numbers more carefully, but already he was marvelling at the possibilities. New fertilisers, machines, cash grants, all at no or next to no expense to Ozawa personally. There was so much that could be done. Yield and profits were going to rise sky-high. He was going to be rich, then he could expand his holdings, so much more to do, so much more.\n\nStill, he thought, shaking himself out of his giddy frenzy, government allowances didn't grow on trees. The new resources he had been provided with would have to be allocated very carefully indeed. The tenants he could trust, naturally, would be getting first pick of Ozawa's fancy new toys. No point in spilling out money on wastrels, who would only waste it on frivolous things. He pulled up a list of names, and circled a few. Never let it be said that loyalty goes unrewarded. Or that complacency went unpunished.\n\nAll of that said, he thought, looking around the room, appearances are also important in developing this new enterprise. How would he and his family be taken seriously as businessmen if they didn't look the part? The wallpaper in his house was a ghastly relic of the fifties, and they couldn't expect to be taken seriously in their new endeavours with it still haunting the family home. And his wife, he loved her dearly, but she didn't exactly look like the Japanese farming magnate's spouse of tomorrow. But that could be fixed. With this boost, all of that could be fixed."

He drank moderately and never gambled. He even watched his brother's kids! Yet, it wasn't enough. No matter how hard he and his wife worked in the fields, no matter how much they harvested, his landlord always took every coin from his pocket. And whenever Oda trekked up to the landlord's big house to complain about his broken tools and the lack of seeds, the man had the gall to complain about the government. It wasn't him stealing Oda's money and doing little in return, the landlord whined in his fine clothing, but the government. Then he cried about some bill and the Diet and reminded Oda he was behind on his rent.\n\nThere were days when Oda and his wife Hina wondered if life could have been better. Maybe, they muttered while eating rice, they could have moved to Manchuria while they still had the chance. Maybe they could have ignored the stories about bandits and poor soil and made a life for themselves as the first settlers of a new territory. Whatever the hardships, at least it would be without bastard landlords.\n\nBut those were just dreams. He did not live in a world where he could stop being a tenant farmer. He lived in one of constant toil, interrupted only by regular visits from the local policeman. The visits seemed to be more frequent month after month. Perhaps, it was a sign of worry, an expression of fear by a government that could not help its people, that could not make basic changes to help people like him.\n\nWhatever the reason, Oda said nothing as the officers rooted through his small house without asking. He had always done everything he was supposed to, even as a rage built in his heart."

No more was the Finance Ministry there to dictate its law, and no more was the Yokusankai's word absolute. For what felt like the first time in forever, the current meeting was one ruled by competence, and not by connections.

For how long had the bureaucrats been relegated to the background, while military men and career politicians were the ones to have the Prime Minister's attention? In fact, many of the Empire's problems, most notably the Yasuda crisis, could be traced back to exactly that, which made Kaya's accession to power even more of a victory.\n\nAnd now, here they all were, in a room, on a bright day, ready to bring their solutions to a country that so desperately needed them. Everyone in the room was, if not fully happy yet, enthusiastic, and to Aoki that was the most important: they would talk for hours on end, agree on some issues and argue on others, and it would be the dawn of a better tomorrow."

Fukuda, something to answer?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I do,\" calmly retorted the Minister of Finance. \"While I do understand the concerns of the opposition, I have to say that I find them to be mostly unfounded. Indeed, the Yokusankai still holds sway over the rural areas, and we only need to be wary of problems in urban centers, such as strikes or protests.

Now, he only needed to make good on his promises, and pass the bill into law: this hopefully wouldn't prove too much to handle for the astute parliamentarian, however.\n\n\"Thank you, Fukuda.\" resumed Aoki, who seemed to have gotten slightly distracted as Fukuda's speech continued on.

He had heard of and seen for himself the phenomenon of towns, cities, and entire prefectures being left behind to languish in economic stagnation as industries failed and fled the region, leaving the area to be a shadow of its former self. Hinata was glad such a fate might not yet reach Nagoya.\n\nLooking outside the window, Hinata could see a city, once moribund, slowly roaring back to life. The streets were no longer filled with beggars but bustling with commuters and families; the factories' smokestacks bellowed dark smoke once more - the fruits of the fire of industry. The skies were painted gray with storm clouds and smog; yet, it was a city more vibrant and colorful than he had seen in several years.

Nearly forty years ago, the Great Depression ravaged Japan's economy, leaving mass poverty and unemployment in its wake; the lethargic and ham-fisted response of partisan kleptocrats, in conjunction with petty political gridlock impeding the government when they did attempt to respond, taught a valuable lesson to all, but especially to the technocrats and bureaucrats. A lesson of why party politics inexorably leads to incompetence and failure, of why Japan needs the guiding hand of the state - of the bureaucracy - to function perfectly.\n\nYet, in a painfully ironic twist, the House of Representatives has blocked Kaya's and the New Bureaucrats' Light Industrial Development Bill. The squabbling factions of the Yokusankai - little better than the Minseitō and Seiyūkai of the interwar period - have cited reasons ranging from fiscal concerns to lack of support for larger corporations for voting against the bill. They are myopic fools, seeing not the bigger picture of the urgent need for our recovery program at any cost, blinded by ignorance at best and corruption at worst.\n\nRegardless of our grievances with the Diet, the bill's failure is more or less final. We must move on, and only glance back in shame as we see a Japan in decay, her cities stagnant with hundreds of thousands of jobseekers all while the businesses who have weathered the storm rush to cannibalize the unfortunate in a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions. Will the economy move on and right itself, eventually?

The disorganized policymaking of the old order became replaced with new, bloodless systems that valued evidence more than emotion, metrics over abstractions. All those unnecessary components in the machine-those hardliners, junior lawmakers, and Manchukuo-raised national defense state advocates-found themselves pushed away, isolated from the core. Their outrage went unheard beneath the shifting of cogs and gears.\n\nThe machine's chugging continued. Lights turned on. Roadways filled. Workers returned to their factories and CEOs returned to their high towers. The Japanese economy was back-still run by a few men and companies-but there was a certain comfort in that stability. People could learn the patterns and signals and come to master them. Perhaps it did not matter that nothing had changed, that reformers still muttered about half-measures and half-freedoms, so long as the people had food, homes, and a steady income.\n\nSo long as the machine continued to whir, all would be well.

 japkaya_tree_two.28.desc:0 "MINISTER OF FINANCE FUKUDA: The Corporate Stabilization Act may appear to be throwing good money after bad. We are fully aware of the general public's suspicions towards the zaibatsu after Yasuda's collapse. But having witnessed the damage of said collapse, it is of utmost importance that the flow of money in the economy - and confidence - be restored as soon as possible.\n\nIn exchange for state funds, the government has secured agreements with Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo that they will promote the development of the Empire's economy as dictated by government policy. And may I remind you that this government's priority is to ensure the fruits of economic growth are now spread tangibly to the Empire's subjects: in roads, in power plants, in schools and in hospitals.\n\nThis is the only way that public trust in our system of governance, which has served us since before the war, will be maintained...\n\nTAKAGI SOKICHI, MP: I ask the government: how is this any different from the state-directed economic planning that created a conduit of graft leading up to the Prime Minister's Office? A lighter touch, the Minister says; to me, this looks like half-measures.\n\nSHIINA ETSUSABURO, MP: How does the Minister expect the people to trust in our leadership by rewarding those who defrauded them? Our priority must be to punish those who subvert the needs of the state and the people for selfish gain, and to reorient the economy once again towards a common goal: the advancement and prosperity of our Empire."

 japkaya_tree_two.29.desc:0 "Kameda Masayoshi felt a spring in his step as stepped into the elevator, having slept soundly for the first time in months. Securing funds, slashing costs, burying secrets, reassuring Mitsui's investors - all of that would come to an end, now that the government was coming to the rescue at last.\n\nMaybe he would even be able to see Sachiyo at home over dinner, rather than in the office lobby holding his change of clothes. She'd been threatening to take the children back to the countryside -\n\n\"Get out of the way! If you're free, hurry up and get the rest of the files we want!\"\n\nKameda froze as an unfamiliar, suited man bellowed at him as the elevator doors opened, pushing two employees holding cardboard boxes inside. He opened his mouth to shout back - who the hell do you think you are - but the man had already hurried away, yelling at a beleaguered secretary further down the hall.\n\nThe scene was no less hectic in his office, with the space occupied by a cadre of unfamiliar men haughtily haranguing his subordinates, reducing them to running errands. Kameda's deputy scurried over with an apologetic bow.\n\n\"Ministry of Finance audit, sir. The government's demanding a full accounting of our operations, if they're going to bail us out -\"\n\nKameda pushed past the man, his footsteps hastening as he approached his desk. The drawers were all removed, their contents strewn across the floor, all files of value taken - including the one he'd kept hidden from his deputy.\n\nKameda felt a tap on his shoulder, sending his heart plunging into his stomach."

 japkaya_tree_two.30.desc:0 "\"When you said you were confident you could get the Corporate Stabilization Act through the Diet, I expected you to deliver,\" Kaya remarked icily, keeping Fukuda standing in front of his desk. \"It's one thing to cast votes in the Diet; quite another to canvass and count them.\"\n\n\"I have no excuse,\" Fukuda said, looking Kaya in the eye. He said nothing else, pride rooting him in place.\n\n\"I still think it was a good idea, by the way.\" Kaya lit a cigarette, allowing the words to hang in the air as he inhaled deeply. \"But you have to know that good ideas and good intentions don't count for much in the Diet. It's disappointing, frankly.\"\n\nThe phone on Kaya's desk rang, sparing the two another awkward silence. Kaya picked up and turned in his seat, while Fukuda remained at attention.\n\n\"Yes...The head of Mitsubishi? About the bill and the lack of a bailout. I see. Patch him through.\" Kaya turned back to Fukuda with a glare, holding his hand over the receiver and pointing at the door.\n\nFukuda, catching the silent dismissal, bowed once before striding out of the room, all while listening to Kaya offer his sincerest regrets over Fukuda's failure."

 japkaya_tree_two.31.desc:0 "\"Retail sales, steel production, stock prices - all indicators for the zaibatsu have been on the up for the past month.\" Aoki turned over the last page of the Cabinet's economic report with a contented sigh. \"I'm cautiously optimistic we've turned the corner.\"\n\nKaya nodded approvingly, leaning back in his seat to look at the scene outside the Prime Minister's official residence. The crosswalk in front of the front gate had returned to life, with the unceasing rumble of car engines framing the sight of men and women waiting patiently at the traffic light. The midday sunlight suffused Kaya's office, bathing its occupants in a lazy light.\n\nAn entirely normal, placid day - the first in a very long time.\n\n\"The zaibatsu are cooperating with our audits.\" Fukuda crossed his legs in his seat, tapping his hand idly on the armrest. \"No more talk of hostile takeovers or retrenchment. The money is starting to flow again.\"\n\n\"Well done,\" Kaya stated plainly, allowing his praise to settle in the room. \"Hopefully they realize that their time is better spent following state guidance, rather than squabbling amongst themselves.\"\n\nThe three nodded, savoring their victory - before turning their eyes to the next batch of folders on the table before them. Agricultural statistics, factory throughput, employment statistics - the real work of the economy itself, of the world outside Tokyo's rarified financial district, the livelihood of the Empire's subjects, still remained unaddressed."

The minor ministries were uncontroversial, and the crowd bided their time until the real power players emerged.\n\n\"...the government is confident that a judicious fiscal policy, as a means to incentivize economic activity, is the key to economic revival in the post-Yasuda period.\"\n\nAs Fukuda, the Minister of Finance, wrapped up his prepared speech, Shiina Etsusaburo - the hardliners' front man - was on his feet with a rebuttal.\n\n\"An economic revival means nothing if those responsible for the Ino crash suffer no punishment!\" Shiina minced no words in his criticism. \"By rewarding bad actors, the people will lose even more faith in the Empire's politics. The system needs to be rebuilt, not reset.\"\n\nThe hardliners surrounding him made their own dissatisfaction clear, a chorus of disgruntled heckles and aggrieved assents to Shiina's words. The other members of the technocratic faction stared them down with steely glares, and the air bristled with tension before Kaya raised his own voice.\n\n\"Gentlemen, this is a discussion of means, not ends. Would anyone be happy seeing Takagi's liberals emasculate the Empire, or the corruption and privilege of the conservatives and the Kidoites go unchecked?\""

 japkaya_tree_two.33.desc:0 "\"I don't have many words to put it in, Prime Minister, but I don't understand how I am supposed to keep our allies in line with this budget. It hasn't been that long since the war in Mongolia, and Mengjiang still hasn't recovered. And that's not to mention the issues in Russia and southeast Asia. Even if you could only increase our budget to that of the navy's, I believe that would be sufficient. Threats are beginning to resurface, especially in Russia and China.\"\n\nKaya nodded. It was all understandable. And, unfortunately, the Army Minister was completely correct. \"I share your thoughts, Hori. I increased the naval budget to ensure our superiority in Southeast Asia, for reasons I'm sure you would understand.\"\n\n\"I sympathise,\" Kaya said after a pause. \"And I will take your thoughts on board. Give me a bit of time, and let me see if I can't whip something else up for you.\" \n\nTo that, Hori Eizo simply smiled, bid Kaya a pleasant morning, and left his office."

 japkaya_tree_two.34.desc:0 "The Army was the proudest institution of Japan. It had liberated the western colonies in Southeast Asia, it fought alongside Indian freedom fighters in Burma, Assam, and Bengal. It oversaw the conquest of China, Japan's ancient rival. A glorious institution; the pride of the nation. At least, that was the view of an outsider looking in.\n\nTo Ogawa Teijiro, the army looked like an unfunded relic of the past.\n\nThe barracks he was summoned into was barely functional, looking as if it dated back to the 20s. A layer of rust had gathered underneath every metallic object in the assembly hall, and a small family of tanuki had settled in the upper floor. One of the dog racoons, in fact, sat atop the highest floor, looking on as the milling group talking amongst themselves.\n\n\"Recruits!\" A booming voice called out to the crowd of assembled conscripts as the doors opened, with finely dressed soldiers beckoning them inside. \"Boots!\" One called out. \"Utensils!\" Another said. \"Study equipment!\" \"Clothing!\"\n\nWhat a shambling wreck - why did they decide I have to serve in this shit stain, Ogawa thought, while waiting in line for his boots. \"No no, I'm size 25.5, these are too small,\" he said when it was his turn, except the man that had handed him the two pieces of black leather was already talking to another recruit. He almost got a word out in complaint, but one of the uniformed soldiers had already pushed him aside.\n\nAs Ogawa walked back into the main hall, he heard the shrill call of the tanuki. He looked up, seeing those two black-brown eyes looking straight back at him. It made another squeak, a long squeak that went up and then down, and then up and down again. He was laughing at him, the bastard."

 japkaya_tree_two.35.t:0 "Morning March"
 japkaya_tree_two.35.desc:0 "The rice gruel tasted as disgusting as it looked. This shit has barely been fried, Ogawa thought. His comrades were having similar thoughts: barely anybody had touched their bowls. Perhaps being woken up at four in the morning was doing a number on their stomachs. Somehow, Ogawa fancied that those tanuki were still laughing at them all. Ogawa chucked the bowl aside. \"Let them have it,\" he muttered.\n\nIt was barely ten minutes later that they were told to strap on all of their equipment. Ogawa wore his helmet, a backpack full of gear, and those boots he still hadn't gotten replaced. When the recruits made it to the course line, each man was given a mock rifle, seemingly weighing as much as an actual firearm. Then, the company was set to marching.\n\nThe march was long and hard, up and down the hills of the northern Japanese countryside. It had been raining the night before, and his fucking boots had a hole in them, saturating his socks. He'd have to find a way to get rid of them, lest his toes freeze.\n\n\"Hold up! We'll rest for food. We're turning around in ten minutes!\" At the call, Ogawa pulled another man aside, almost as breathless as he was. \n\n\"Kane, do you have a spare pair of boots? These ones are fucking killing me! I would've rather strapped two garbage bags to my feet.\"\n\n\"No, sorry. The officers ordered the equipment from some shady manufacturer.\" Kane whispered. \"They did it so they could pocket the rest of the money for themselves. At least, that's what the others told me. Eat up, we've gotta leave soon.\" \n\nIt wasn't long until the march resumed. With his soaking feet and his sore stomach, Ogawa trudged off behind the rest of the company."

 japkaya_tree_two.36.desc:0 "Ogawa had heard all the stories, watched all the movies, seen all the posters. All of them had hyped the Imperial Army into a nearly mythological force that swept aside the opposition like leaves. It was the stuff dreams were made out of. If only those dreams hadn't been sucked out of his mind by his miserable experience at their training camp, he might've just taken veteran Kane Miyazaki at his word.\n\n\"The navy had shipped us just east of the port. The Australians hadn't yet been alerted to our arrival, but the Papuans on the island told them soon enough. A gunfight had broken out along the New Bismarck hill line, and artillery pieces had already begun shelling our positions...\"\n\nMiyazaki kept the room silent, yet Ogawa couldn't help but be disinterested. There was no glory left for him, or anybody else in the room. There was barely any half decent food to be found in the whole barracks. Where the fuck would he find time to win a battle, or earn a promotion?\n\n\"...yet the rest of the battalion had yet to arrive along the shoreline. The captain called it in, and suddenly we had the Australians trapped between us and an allied battalion. We made short work of them then.\" The man grinned a toothy grin as the rest of Ogawa's class applauded him. It pained him to clap along. An ancient tale for ancient men, he thought. Let the past be the past; the sooner he finished training, the better."

A small bundle of company representatives milled amongst themselves at the front of the factory, shaking hands with the new employees making their way to work for the first time. Surrounding them stood a large crowd of suited journalists, asking questions and jotting down notes.\n\nAs [GetJapEcoMin] walked out from his motorcade, he was instantly assaulted by the very same journalists and company representatives. He barged through them, shaking hands and answering questions until making his way to the podium, centered at the very center of the facility. Pulling a speech out from his pocket, [GetJapEcoMin] began to speak to the crowd.\n\n\"National defence remains as important to this nation as it ever was.\"  [GetJapEcoMin] smiled. \"Well, maybe not every time, but certainly a lot of them. However, I am of the belief that Japan grew alongside and as a result of its industry and the cooperation between all its citizens, whether it be the soldiers abroad in China, sailors living on the Pacific Islands, or our brave factory workers, right here in Tokyo.\"\n\n\"I am proud of this cooperation, and I am proud to stand here, addressing you all about the prosperity of our nation.

You know, it's good to dress in something that actually fits you.\" Ogawa Teijiro replied.\n\n\"My uniform was all fine. Shirts, pants, tank tops, everything fits very well. Except for those fucking... pieces of underwear. I swear, my genitals have actually shrunk during my time here.\" He groaned, and grinned at Ogawa. \"But I have finally been liberated. My genitals can roam free once again.\"\n\nOgawa had to admit: the new boots felt good. He could feel all five toes, and he could wriggle them one by one. The socks were not the scratchy pieces of fabric he had become so accustomed to, but soft pieces of wool that actually comforted his feet from the boots, rather than adding to the misery of Ogawa's old shitty boots.\n\n\"Marching practice.\" Kane groaned. Ogawa could hear the siren too. But perhaps with the new boots it would not be so bad. \"Come on, let's go. We don't want to keep Officer Hayao waiting.\"\n\nThe march went well. Very well. Ogawa led the group of jogging men down the course, smiling all the way. Each step felt like justice. Justice for his poor, purple, abused toes. When the men sat down for a break, the food was not pig slop, but carefully prepared pork and rice, topped with soy sauce, and all of it came in large proportions. And for once, it was warm.\n\nBreak ended with Ogawa leading the marching group again. He joined in with a smile as the men sung their way down the marching course. Ogawa knew that something would let up. His expectations were too low to not know that. But for the time being, he was happy. How could he waste such an opportunity?"

But he had good reason to be; the Type 21 Chi-Ru was truly a tank from the modern age. The trial run, insofar, was proving very successful. \"With this vehicle, we can finally match the Americans and Germans in the field!\" Hongo exclaimed, smiling wildly.\n\nHayao remembered meeting the researchers. \"The best suspension Japan can offer,\" one of them had told him. \n\n\"The most powerful gun; it can rip apart any bunker and any tank,\" another had said. \n\n\"The steering, the speed. You will be most impressed with what we have cooked up, General Amari,\" the commander had told him. And he had been right.\n\nHe watched as five of the Chi-Ru's lined up. Each of them fired, one after the other, at a mock enemy five hundred meters away. Each shell smashed through the dummy tanks, slamming into the hill behind. But that was not all. The tanks reloaded in quick succession, and fired shot after shot at a speed Amari had not thought possible. Each tank hit their mark five times over. General Hongo seemed on the verge of tears after the final shell hit the mock targets.\n\n\"What are you thinking, Hongo?\"\n\n\"That a certain research team needs a pay rise.

Ogawa knew why they had come. They had come to graduate. Basic training was complete.\n\nAtop the four walls that surrounded the drill square stood a collection of generals, training camp officials as well as the Minister for Defence himself: Hori Eizo. The man smiled as the company was ordered to march around the square, and smiled even more as they came to a stop, all in perfect order. He stood up to the podium, and gave his speech.\n\n\"It is good to see you all. The military was in a sorry state not a few years ago, and for that I give you my apologies. The blame lies on me. I hope that you can forgive me, and I understand if you cannot. To see you all standing here... it feels like justice.\" Hori stopped, and sipped at a glass of water. \"I want you all to know that I have immense respect for your hard work, for your perseverance and your courage. I want you all to know that you will not be abandoned again. Serve with pride. Serve with dignity. Serve with passion.\" He smiled, and clapped. \"Thank you for your time.\"\n\nAt that, the company was ordered to march from the drill square to the shout of the officers and commanders. The parade awaited, and a thousand hungry eyes would watch on. Officials and notables all across Japan had come to see what the army had become after its reformation.

But the Navy Minister, Mitsuo Fuchida, and the Army Minister, Hori Eizo, seemed to contain none of this same resentment, at least to the Prime Minister's ear. So far, they both had sat through the meeting amiably.\n\n\"If Hori would allow me to speak, I would be most interested in pursuing development into a new line of carriers. The carriers the Navy currently has are not quite up to scratch. Most cannot service modern jets correctly, and modern jets are all that the carriers currently carry. An investment into nuclear submarines is something else I would think would prove fruitful. The Americans excel in that field. It would not do to let them have the leg up on us.\"\n\n\"I have little more to say than I already have, Prime Minister. You know my concerns about our allies' commitments to us. Modern weapons in the army will help us keep them in line. No modern weapons in the Army will do the opposite, and right now we have no modern weapons in the army.\"\n\n\"You two raise concerns I have myself,\" Kaya remarked.\n\n\"Not concerns. Reality,\" Hori said firmly.\n\n\"Reality, yes. It will take a bit of time to draw up the paperwork, but I can grant an increase in funding for the Army and the Navy.

It is the consensus of the Imperial Navy that such measures are nothing but bureaucratic red tapes that do no good, and true interservice coordination can only be improved by communication between the services free from extra interference by the civilian government. Earlier today, Minister Fuchida has expressed the Navy's willingness to work with the Army Chief of Staff, and he expects that this effort, on the Navy's own initiative and independent from the government's bill, will work out well.\n\nUnless the government consults the Imperial Navy in revising this bill, I shall respectfully decline to support the bill proposed by the government.\""

Yesterday he was informed by the supply officer that the meat supply was running low; those idiots from the Guangdong supply station clearly miscalculated the ration for each solder. And now he is invited by those traitorous navy guys to dine on the ship? Kayaba thought to himself-- is this some kind of mockery? As he set his foot on the deck, he saw that on the mast, and for the first time during Yakumo's service, an army colonel's flag was hoisted. Seeing the flag in surprise and feeling a sense of weird warmness, Kayaba stepped into the bridge and made his way to the officer's dining room\n\nThe moment Kayaba stepped into the room, he was welcomed by a firm handshake by Captain Sakyo, commander of the Yakumo.\n\n\"I'm so glad you came,\" said Sakyo, \"here, try this curry.

After all, this wasn't supposed to be anything more than a standard, dull, and technical report. One that merely stated that the convoy had left successfully for North Borneo.\n\nGood. If all went well, it would be a simple trip. No issues, no drama.\n\nKaya hoped so, anyway. He was concerned that there would be some unexpected disaster, intentional or otherwise, that would derail this. However, there had been no indications of it, and so he allowed himself to breathe.\n\nEverything would be fine.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the long and bitter rivalry and competitiveness between the military branches, this was a small, almost miniscule event that was taking place. It was a single step, one on a long, long road to repairing the divisions that had only worsened since the Second World War.\n\nBut a step nonetheless.\n\nWith increased spending across the board, and his own efforts to help foster a more cooperative environment, Kaya believed that they were already, slowly, starting to bear some fruit. He was under no illusions as to the time and investment it would take. It would be years, if not decades, and he was aware that it might even persist beyond his own lifetime.\n\nHowever, that did not bother him overmuch. He was secure in the knowledge that his efforts had laid the groundwork for a more stable, secure, and prosperous Japan."

 japkaya_tree_two.50.desc:0 "Monumental decisions were ones which defined legacies. Kaya was acutely aware that the next weeks and months would be crucial for cementing his own legacy, while also driving forward the future of Japan.\n\nAnd all of it was balanced on a knife's edge, as it often was in the cutthroat realm of politics.\n\nFukuda Takeo, the man who would be his successor, was silent as he waite for the Prime Minister to speak. He also knew the consequences if they failed here and now. The hardliners of Kishi and Shiina remained a threat to them, and if Kaya was to secure his legacy...they needed to be dealt with.\n\nKaya finally spoke. \"What is your suggestion?\"\n\nFukuda took a few moments before he answered. One might wonder if the question was serious, but Kaya had decided he was to be his successor - and because of that, Fukuda knew that whatever he said would be given serious consideration. Thus, he did not rush his response. \"I believe that Kishi and Shiina are too entrenched to remove directly. Not yet. Doing so would tip our hand too early. Their support base should be weakened first.\"\n\n\"Which lies in the Ministry of Commerce,\" Kaya grunted. He'd identified that as an option as well. Still, if both Kishi and Shiina were able to be dealt with early, it might throw the hardliners into disarray. It was an option on the table - along with another, which was to simply do nothing at all.\n\nThe latter option was perhaps the most risky, as it would rely on the support of the hardliners, who were far from reliable. However, if he was to move against them and fail, rolling the dice on their support may be the safer option. After a few more moments of consideration, Kaya spoke."

He dabbed his face with a cloth. He wanted to just stay in his office, and for long minutes stared sightlessly at the door to his office. A barrier between him and consequence. For now, he could pretend that everything was normal. That it was fine.\n\nHe couldn't stay here forever though. He took a deep breath.\n\nHe'd miscalculated.\n\nHe should have listened to Fukuda, and exercised caution when dealing with the hardliners. But no, he'd thought that decapitating the head of the snake was possible. Such a direct and drastic move against Kishi and Shiina had immediately caused a reaction. He had expected that the hardliners would be too disorganized or capable of doing anything. But he had been wrong.\n\nVery, very wrong.\n\nThe bureaucracy had revolted, or enough of them that threatened to paralyze the government. The technocrats had instantly split, and too many were aligned against him. Kishi and Shiina's influence was still too great; and now, stronger than ever. All that Kaya had achieved with this attempt had been to ensure that he would have no successor.\n\nThere could be no going back now. He didn't expect his government to last much longer, and now he knew what his legacy would be. That of another Prime Minister who would retire in disgrace, to be reduced to a single, sad footnote in history."

They have no reason to do so.\"\n\n\"And no good reason to oppose you either. Outside of that, their reasons are stability and unity,\" Kaya responded, though inherently understanding the limits of that reasoning. \"Some parts of the faction will object, but most will understand that it is far more beneficial for the succession to proceed smoothly than risk a government collapse.\"\n\n\"If we expect them to be rational actors,\" Fukuda's face showed what he thought of that idea. \"Kishi is not a rational actor. Shiina is little better.\"\n\n\"Kishi won't risk his influence unless forced,\" Kaya stated. \"If he elects to throw our faction into chaos, we will lose the government, and subsequently, his best chance to influence it. Kishi may be willing to risk that - but I believe that his selfish desire for power will keep him in check. Shiina is much the same.\"\n\n\"For concessions,\" Fukuda said. \"They will never back me without it.\"\n\n\"We will deal with that when it becomes relevant,\" Kaya said, while knowing that he was likely right. \"Until now, we prepare - and start bringing as many of them to our side as possible.\" Fukuda knew from his tone that this was decided, and they were committed to this course of action."

I humbly accept this prestigious offer.\"\n\nActing or genuine? Kaya couldn't tell. The man wasn't especially bright, or perhaps he was smart enough to not openly defy the Prime Minister in his presence. Not that it mattered now. As the man signed his name consenting to the acceptance, it was done. With a final smile, he had the man escorted out.\n\nOnce the man was gone, he sat down alone, in a very good mood. He'd had many meetings like this over the past few days. He and Fukuda had drafted a list of the most prominent or influential hardliners, and together with the rest of his allies, systematically neutralized them. Most were easy enough to deal with. Many were \"promoted\" to useless positions overseeing what was little more than busywork. Others were more direct reassignments, as after all, no one was foolish enough to challenge a direct demand from the Prime Minister.\n\nA select few were pressured to \"retire\" earlier than they had planned. Kaya made sure their replacements were quickly selected and staffed, before Kishi was be able to respond. By now Kishi and Shiina no doubt knew what was going on - but already too many had been removed for them to do anything about it.\n\nKaya took great satisfaction in imagining the look on their faces, as they realized he had outplayed them. Their influence was far from gone, but both men were now in a substantially weaker position. Kaya held all of the cards - soon it would be time to deliver the coup de gras."

Someone could have overhead something, an aide could have leaked, I..\" he trailed off, swallowing as Kaya held up a hand, demanding he cease speaking. He lowered it slowly, his voice low and furious.\n\n\"This is a disaster.\" He said as a statement of fact.\n\nCalling it a disaster was arguably an understatement. Somehow - and Kaya would find out how one day - Kishi, Shiina, and the hardliners had learned of the planned de facto purge of the bureaucracy of their allies. Now they were screaming in the Diet about \"sabotage\" and \"political purges.\" That it was actually true was a problem, because if Kaya went through with it, it would potentially turn the Diet against him and end his government.\n\nAnd this was something Kishi and Shiina were counting on. If he continued with his plans, he risked losing the government. If he didn't, then he effectively strengthened the hardliner position. He was in a bad situation that only had one true option - he would have to gamble. He had no choice.\n\n\"Review the names,\" Kaya finally demanded, and Fukuda immediately whipped out a notepad and began writing. \"Find the worst performers. The neoptists. The incompetent. I want our plans to be presented in the best possible light. As a necessary restructuring of the bureaucracy. We go on the offense. We have the Diet back our plans.\"\n\nFukuda wrote it down, and looked back up, hesitating slightly before asking, but finally went through with it. \"And if they do not back us?\" Kaya's face was grim as he met the eyes of his would-be successor."

 japkaya_tree_two.55.desc:0 "Representative Kon had always considered himself a prudent man. The world had lit itself on fire countless times since he was first elected in the early thirties, and when he was the same age. The Diet had been a constant cyclone of scandal and crisis, making and breaking political careers in the blink of an eye. It was tough to survive. But Kon had survived it all. Because Kon was careful, and Kon was prudent.\n\nIn the days of Tōjō and the height of the national defence state, Kon had sung the praises of the military and the Manchurian lobby, at a measured, even pace. Never too quiet, never too loud. And when the YSK decided that Tōjō's hour had passed, Kon quietly but noticeably accepted a necessary change in direction, and all those which had followed. His constituencies got the money and projects they needed, and Kon continued to quietly do his job, cordial to all, but enemy nor ally to none. He was careful to never seek higher office. The benefits of a cabinet position were like those of amphetamines, a short, sharp rise, followed by a sudden, irreversible drop. Better a stable and placid position. If all Japanese politicians felt the same, the country would be a better, more honest place.\n\nOf course, it took far more effort to be prudent than most people realised. Kon made a point of avoiding factions wherever possible, but on some days, the floor of the Diet became that of a casino, one where only betting customers could remain. Today was one of those. The old technocrats and the new, both alike in dignity, were butting heads for the future of the YSK. One had prime ministerial support, the other formed from some of the oldest bulwarks the party knew. A difficult choice. Kon would have to be prudent. But, in this case, what was prudence?\n\nJust as he was mulling this over, a group of prominent peers walked into the Representative's Chamber, voicing support for the Prime Minister. Kon shrugged."

 japkaya_tree_two.56.desc:0 "As Kaya sat back in the bench, watching both factions of representatives duking it out, he felt as if the stale air of the Diet chamber was boring new wrinkles into his skin. When would the peers arrive? He took a glance over at his opponents. He saw an aide handing a note to Kishi, followed by a small smirk. Unlikely to mean much. This song and dance had been going on for hours, no, years now.\n\nKishi stood up. \"I am Kishi Nobusuke, representing Yamaguchi's second district,\" went the familiar refrain, which Kaya had long found this statement almost indistinguishable from background noise. \"It appears our noble house is at something of an impasse regarding the Prime Minister's proposed restructuring. I doubt any representative wishes for this stalemate to continue. Hence, I have sought counsel from our sister chamber. They were so kind, in fact, to bring me a letter and signatures. I would like to read it, if the House pleases it.\"\n\nKishi did not allow time for the House to respond before he began. \"It is the express opinion of this group of peers that the proposed ministerial restructuring by the Prime Minister is not in the interests of Japan nor His Majesty. It is highly unlikely that such legislation would achieve its supposed aims of improving efficiency and tackling corruption, and is instead a transparent attack against the Prime Minister's political opponents. In accordance with the preservation of parliamentary values, we cannot accept the proposed bill at this time.\"\n\nKishi put down the letter. \"Given such a hostile reception by the Diet's other half, I do not believe it is in the interests of the House of Representatives to continue discussing this matter.\" He and his colleagues stood, and promptly left the chamber. Most of the remaining members followed afterwards, leaving a stunned Kaya and his allies."

Besides, now was not the time for any serious celebration. A battle had been won, but the war was far from decided. It was all well and good to reorganise the ministries, but as long as Kishi and Shiina remained in positions of prominence, no permanent gains could be made.\n\n\"We need to press our advantage,\" said Fukuda. \"The pieces are in place now, so we need to move against Kishi without delay. As long as that relic of the thirties stands in our way, we will still be resisted at every turn, bureaucratic restructuring or no.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that's a bit too hasty?\" asked Kaya. \"We've been lucky even making it this far. If we go full steam ahead against Kishi, we run a serious risk of overplaying our hand. Shiina's a much easier target. Less politically experienced, less connected without Kishi, and if we remove him from the picture, who will Kishi have to succeed him?\"\n\n\"Respectfully, I disagree.\" said Fukuda. \"Both men are united against us, so for our purposes, Shiina's connections are Kishi's connections. Going after Shiina will just give the hardliners time and cause to regain their strength, and take us down. The only surefire way to save our movement is to cut off the head of the snake while we have the upper hand. We were always taking a risk when we set along this path, and at this crucial moment, we cannot allow for an overabundance of caution.\"\n\nKaya paused to think about this for a moment, and then spoke."

Kaya carefully watched Shiina's reaction. Had things been different, it was possible it would have been him, and not Fukuda, who would have risen to take his place. Shiina knew that, which was why Kaya was expecting a reaction.\n\nTo his surprise, there wasn't one.\n\n\"I suppose this was inevitable,\" Shiina finally mused. \"Fukuda was always the favorite. The writing was on the wall, perhaps I simply chose not to read it. Your point is made, Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"It is much appreciated,\" Kaya said warily. \"I'm glad you agree.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Shiina said in a strange voice. \"It is good to have clarity on these matters.\"\n\nThe conversation continued a little longer, and turned to different matters. Kaya was surprised by how little resistance Shiina put up. Suspiciously little resistance. As much as he would like to believe that it was as simple as that, he was skeptical. However, there was nothing more he could do right now. If Shiina was genuine or not, it would be proven - sooner or later. One thing, however, was very clear to him.\""

Both of them knew what they were here for. \"I intend for Fukuda to take my place and lead the technocrats,\" Kaya finally said. \"It is not final, as I wished your consultation, as a valued member of our coalition.\"\n\nIt was a lie, intended to appeal to ego, though one that Kishi did not seem especially flattered by. He chuckled dryly. \"Now you ask for my consultation? Rather strange, as you did not ask my 'consultation' before you purged the ministries.\"\n\n\"An unrelated matter,\" Kaya retorted. \"That was within my purview as the Prime Minister of Japan. I do not need to consult you on matters that do not relate to the technocrats.\" A deflection, and one Kishi would see through, but keeping up the narrative remained important.\n\n\"I am not naive, Okinori,\" Kishi dismissed in an almost bored voice, his eyes turning almost disappointed. \"But if you wish to give excuses, then so be it. What will be your next excuse, Prime Minister? By what argument will I be persuaded to support your candidate?\"\n\nNow would be the most crucial moment, one which would need to be chosen carefully, based on the strength of the hardliners, his relationship with them, and his knowledge of the man himself.

Kaya could sense the mood change when he walked in the Diet and capital. He knew what the rumors were saying. Rumors that he had lost his mind, that he was incompetent, that he and Fukuda were worse dictators than Tōjō. It mattered not that it was false.\n\nWhat mattered was what it was working against him. The support for the hardliners was growing every day, and he'd seen his support in the technocrats slip rapidly. It hadn't taken long to figure out that Kishi was behind this, using his money and influence to badly wound him, even if it risked the stability of the government. He'd tried to reach Kishi to talk this out, but there'd only been silence. Until now. And now, Kishi was conveying one stark message: Knock it off.\n\n\"If you wish to support Fukuda,\" Kishi continued. \"That is your prerogative. You will not make final decisions on your own. You will not sideline us simply because we disagree on the best candidate. We must be a unified party, one respectful of our ideologically differences. Am I making myself clear, Prime Minister?\"\n\nHe was making it all too clear. For anything to happen, Kaya would need to work with the hardliners, not against them. It was over. He had lost.

His motivations might not be purely ideological, but even if it was influence and power, Kaya knew he wasn't offering Kishi anything near what Kishi enjoyed leading the hardliners.\n\nKishi seemed chronically disinterested and bored, merely content to listen in silence as Kaya tried making many of the arguments showing the superiority of the New Bureaucratic platform - all arguments Kishi had likely heard before. Even Kaya's own voice was devoid of passion the longer he talked, once he saw that Kishi was just waiting for it to finish.\n\nAt a break in the conversation, Kishi leaned back, his face unimpressed and eyes filled with a dismissive contempt. \"You are saying little I have not already heard before. I have considered everything you have just said, and found it lacking. Such debates take place daily, and I have chosen my side. Until now, you have remained ambivalent, but I see where you fall now.\"\n\nHe glanced at a nearby clock and stood. \"This was an enlightening discussion, Prime Minister, but we both have other important business to attend to.

He was just as experienced, just as knowledgeable, and more importantly, was not intimidated by the fact that Kaya was Prime Minister. Kishi knew his position was precarious, and that the leverage Kaya held was not absolute. Kishi would not be intimidated by anything less than absolute proof his position was untenable.\n\nProof that Kaya simply didn't have.\n\n\"Do not speak to me as if I am a child,\" Kishi interrupted in a tired voice, stopping Kaya from continuing his push that the hardliners were the weaker party. \"If what you say is true, we would not be speaking right now. You need my support if you wish to succeed. Do not insult me by pretending I do not speak for many of your peers. It is beneath you.\"\n\nKaya wasn't certain how to respond, because he knew that Kishi was right - and Kishi knew it. Kishi didn't have the influence to control the technocrats - but he could absolutely make trouble if he wished, and Kaya simply could not ignore that. Every insinuation and veiled threat fell flat, as Kishi saw through his bluff - and outright called it.\n\nKishi apparently decided that the conversation was over, and abruptly stood. \"I trust my point is made, Prime Minister,\" he said coldly. \"It is a shame it had to end this way.\" With nothing more to say, he turned and left, leaving a defeated Kaya alone, uncertain what would come next."

Yet he had been around Kishi long enough to tell when the man was listening - or humoring the speaker. Kaya's voice slowed, and he finally ceased speaking.\n\nKishi appraised him. \"Poetic words, Okinori. Unfortunate that you believe nothing of what you say.\"\n\nKaya blinked. \"Do you believe I am lying, Nobusuke?\"\n\n\"I do not know, but your actions show me the truth,\" Kishi's tone was mellow and eyes unblinking. \"You say it is time for men like us to move on, but if you believed that, you would not have taken the Prime Ministership. You would not be engaged in these games of power and influence. You would not be working to secure your own influence after you leave the scene.\"\n\nHe lifted a hand, to cut off a retort. \"Perhaps you have changed, now that you sense victory. I understand. Politics can change the most immutable of people, such is its nature. But I have no reason to indulge you now. It is a valiant attempt, but I am afraid you will not sway me.\"\n\nKishi stood, deciding that the conversation was over. \"Farewell, Prime Minister.

He was thinking of every possible way he could turn this to his advantage. Each scenario running through his mind. And Kaya knew he was coming to the same, inescapable conclusion: He couldn't win.\n\nKishi could follow through on his threat - and it would be a setback, but Kaya also knew that Kishi simply didn't have the numbers anymore to make his departure matter. If Kishi left, all the influence he had now would be gone. They would both lose if he walked out - but Kishi stood to lose far more.\n\nWhen Kishi spoke again, his voice was slow, reluctant - but accepting. \"This infighting is not useful, for us or the technocrats.\" he pursed his lips. \"Your point is made.

Both of them were of a similar age; each of them had grown up in the same period. They'd experienced Japan when she was at its height, they had watched the Empire become a world power. They held the power of nations. Theirs was a perspective that few others could dream of.\n\nAnd both of them were old. Japan was entering into a new era now, and in a sense, they were relics. The world around them was changing in ways none of them could have imagined when they were boys, or even men.\n\nKishi had surprised him partway through, speaking a little on his own. His eyes had been unfocused while he'd spoken, as if speaking to himself. On some level, what he was saying resonated with Kishi. They were both old men, and their time was coming to an end.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" Kishi mused, almost to himself. \"I do not think I will...fully let go, as you seem to wish. This is where I belong, but perhaps it is time for the younger men to enter and prove themselves.\" A thin, humorless smile crossed his face. \"It is perhaps best if they learn not to rely on us.\"\n\n\"We have shaped the world, both of us,\" Kaya said. \"Few can say that. We have earned the right to rest, and the men behind us earn the right to make mistakes - and learn from them.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Kishi admitted. \"I have my doubts about the man you wish to replace you, but perhaps he deserves a chance.\" Kaya nodded, and with those words, knew then that he had won."

A day he would always celebrate, even if there was only one who could share in the celebration.\n\n\"A masterwork, my friend,\" Fukuda said with a smile, as he raised his glass of champagne. \"No others could have dealt with Kishi in such a way.\"\n\nNo, Kaya thought to himself, there likely would not have been any others. He would have preferred a more extensive celebration for today, one larger than just sharing a drink with his heir apparent. But that would come at a more formal time; a time when Fukuda ascended to properly take his place. It was certain now, and so for now, he was content.\n\nWith Kishi dealt with, Shiina had crumbled nearly the moment he had been confronted. With no one left to back him, he had privately conceded to his allies that he was abandoning his push to lead the technocrats. Kaya didn't know what excuse had been given, and it wasn't important. What was important was that he had won.\n\nKishi, Shiina, they had been neutralized. There was no one to stand in the way of Fukuda taking his place, and continuing the work that had been started. \"I expect that Kishi's coming absence from politics will be taken poorly by some of the Peers,\" Kaya mused as he sipped his wine. \"But they are few, and unimportant.\"\n\n\"And there is little we can do outside the technocrats,\" Fukuda agreed. \"This was last gasp of an old era. One which has finally been struck its death blow.\"\n\n\"That it has,\" Kaya nodded. \"The future is bright, my friend, and I will retire well, knowing my work will be continued. You will do well, my friend.\" The man who would soon take his place bowed his head in thanks."

The rest of the ministers filed out of the cabinet room quietly, leaving Shiina and Fukuda exchanging awkward glances at the table.\n\nKaya paid them no heed, allowing them to sit in silence for several more seconds while he lit a cigarette, impressing his authority with a prolonged exhalation of smoke. \"Both of you have been quite busy aside from your official duties, I hear. There's enough backbiting and gossip that I've even heard of it.\"\n\nFukuda and Shiina didn't respond, knowing well enough that making weak excuses would only worsen their position. Kaya regarded them both cooly, before nodding once and crushing his cigarette into a half-filled ashtray.\n\n\"I've never hidden my intent to hand things over to a successor. But - \" Kaya lowered his voice, steepling his hands. \" - I intend to announce my successor at a time of my choosing. No matter who succeeds me, we must remain united. Meaningless maneuvering only weakens us.\"\n\nShiina and Fukuda both nodded wordlessly. Kaya pushed his chair back, raising a hand towards the door."

 japkaya_tree_two.68.desc:0 "Kaya poured another glass of champagne for him and his guest. He had no idea when was the last time he properly sat down and had a quiet drink with someone. Japanese politicking seemed so loud, so abrasive and technicolour - the moments of silence that did come were fleeting and all too precious.\n\n\"Kanpai,\" Kishi said. \"Long live Japan, Prime Minister Kaya.\"\n\nKaya winced; ever so slightly. Prime Minister of Japan. To the outside world, he was one of the most influential people on the planet. Inside...inside was an all too different matter. Japanese politics was like climbing a mountain. One false move and he was dead. It was at least a wise move to have someone to help you up.\n\n\"Long live Japan, Nobusuke Kishi,\" Kaya clinked their glasses together. \"Have you seen what Fukuda has been doing? The House of Peers has been more tortuous than usual - the bastards can smell blood in the water. Even when it's his.\"\n\n\"Yes, it certainly is. Fukuda seems to want to die, kicking and screaming. Not literally of course. I'm not such a monster that I would murder anyone around me, eh?\" Kishi chuckled to himself. \"But still. He wants the entire YSK to know what we've done. So be it, I say. What can he do?\"\n\nWhat could Fukuda do? Kaya wondered to himself. The Technocrats was a wounded animal. Not dead, yes. But wounded. The Technocrats would need help from the outside. From who, that remained to be seen. But one thing was for sure. They wouldn't offer their services for free.\n\n\"I shouldn't be concerned, but w-\"\n\n\"Then don't be,\" Kishi interrupted. \"Remember that we're still the ones in power here. I cannot promise that the next few months will be clear waters, but we have still won, Kaya. This is just maintenance.\"\n\nWith that, Kishi took a sip, closing his eyes to savour the flavor. Kaya followed. Japanese politicking was a lot like mountaineering﻿ indeed. The mountaintop is a beautiful sight to behold. The only thing made better than one person witnessing it - was two."

Rumors were just as much to mislead as much as they were to inform. The savvy could learn from rumors and deduce truth from misinformation, and the gullible were useful for the former.\n\nHowever, of late the rumors had all consolidated around a specific narrative. In the technocratic faction, there were those who had noticed that Shiina and Kishi's reform bureaucracy had gradually had their presence reduced. It was a subtle thing, and only the attentive noticed the gradual shunning of both men. No longer were many present in meetings, and Shiina - and subsequently Kishi - appeared to have lost sway with much of the faction.\n\nAnd if Shiina had fallen out of favor, to many that could mean only one thing: Fukuda Takeo had been the man Kaya had selected to be his successor.\n\nWhen that narrative had taken hold, more rumors swirled around. People who spoke about how Fukuda and Aoki had been seen often visiting the office of the Prime Minister, and taking more and more responsibility within the faction.\n\nLearning of this had triggered a number of reactions, overt and subtle throughout the YSK. Many of the technocrats, themselves cut out of the high-level politicking taking place, were simply watching and waiting. All of the other factions were not so restrained, scrambling and plotting in preparation for the inevitable announcement.\n\nIt remained to be seen if Fukuda would have the support to succeed Kaya - but the stage was set, and soon the future of Japan would be decided."

With the state and the people united under one purpose, the military's budget will be expanded to properly reflect the gravity of the task before it. Due attention will be paid, of course, to preferred and trusted suppliers - for quality is the objective, not cost.\"\n\nShiina's address to the military's leadership, a sea of medals and uniforms in a pastel conference room, was met with polite applause - and Kaya cast a wary eye to see if there was any apprehension amongst them. But the generals and admirals knew well enough to keep their own feelings private - even if they appreciated the favor of the Prime Minister, and his successor.\n\nAt the same time, politics in Japan was a subtle and delicate art, no matter how brazen and grandstanding it appeared.\n\n\"Of course, we respect the prerogatives of the peers of the Empire.\" Shiina was on his best behavior, being as congenial as possible before the members of the House of Peers. \"We will continue to keep you informed of the government's deliberations, and we would appreciate your continued support.\n\nIt was the fourth 'luncheon' that week, and both Kaya and Shiina were too busy to eat any of the food the Peers were so deliciously devouring. If not by favors, then Kaya and Shiina would win the Peers over through their stomachs.\n\nSuch was politics in Tokyo, and the price to pay to secure Shiina's succession."

Ikeda and Takagi were studiously, scrupulously polite - smiling, but without a hint of warmth or sincerity. Their factions joined them in measured applause - many of them frowning, even scowling. Shiina's program was anathema to both groups - the reformists for obvious reasons, the conservatives for having been left out to dry.\n\nThe Kidoites? They were more animated, chatting amongst themselves as they acclaimed Shiina's proposal - no doubt strategizing about how to present the Five-Year Plan to the House of Peers. He would have to have a word with them, Kaya mused.\n\nThe loudest applause and widest smiles came from the technocrats, to nobody's surprise - and the hardliners were visibly cheered by Shiina's unspoken ascension to the height of political power. The New Bureaucrats amongst them had sour looks on their faces, perhaps imagining what might have been had it been Fukuda at the podium.\n\nBut their loyalty could be counted on, for they were nothing without Kaya - and soon, Shiina.\n\nHe couldn't say the rest about the rest of the YSK.

What do you request of us?\"\n\n\"I have come to request your support in my efforts within the House of Peers, your majesty,\" Fukuda answered. All of them knew the reason he was here, but formalities were important.\n\nHigashikuni's face was unreadable. \"And why should we support you?\"\n\n\"For the future of the Empire, your majesty,\" Fukuda answered. \"I am confident that the public will be in support of these measures, they are supportive of a less overbearing government. I can assure you, these plans do not interfere with the interests of yourself, this body, or the military.\"\n\nThe Prince inclined his head. \"And what are your own interests?\"\n\n\"The stability and prosperity of Japan,\" Fukuda answered. \"As you are invested in the Empire, so too am I. However, I understand that words are not enough - and  I will ensure that the budget also reflects the interests of this esteemed body.\"\n\nHe could see the Prince and the other aristocrats considering what he said, but many of them remained impassive.

Simply trying to cure the symptoms is insufficient for what the Empire requires. Half-measures are insufficient, hesitance ensures our decay. We must be bold, and more importantly, willing to take major steps to do what must be done. What I propose is not a simple fix to that which plagues our nation - but a renewal.\"\n\nHis eyes swept the crowd. \"A renewal of not just the government, but all of society. For too long we have made the mistake of believing only the government can solve the problems of our nation - and this false assumption has cost us.\"\n\nFukuda gripped the sides of the podium. \"We have our limits, and we must acknowledge them unless we wish to one day collapse under our own weight. We can only manage and command so much before corruption, graft, and stagnation creeps in. Our overbearingness has strangled our economy, and if we wish to thrive - this must change.\"\n\nThere were some nods from the gathered crowd, and Fukuda pressed on. \"Times have changed, and the United States has shown that we must adapt, or fall behind. We must focus our efforts on national defense and critical industries to achieve ascendance - and it should be done working with the economy, not controlling it.\"\n\nThis did seem to have made the impact he wanted.

Tying up loose ends, micromanaging his policy staff, a few phone calls where a note would have sufficed: Kaya marveled at his own productivity, even if nothing of substance had been done.\n\nBut now, as Tokyo slumbered, Kaya was faced with this final act of state - and he still resisted, even as he held his hand-carved ivory seal in hand.\n\nPart of him wanted to get it over with - a growing part of him, in fact. His supporters and allies had been shocked when he'd succeeded Ino, warning him about the stress of the job - something he understood all too well now. But to step away was, inevitably, to surrender control, even if he had moved heaven and earth to secure his succession.\n\nKaya stared pensively at the ivory seal, remembering each time it had been used: to get the economy back onto its feet, to win over the stubborn generals and admirals, to prosecute the corrupt. To set the foundations of the Empire's intellectual future, and then its economic future, all per the state's design.\n\nAs per his design. As per - he hoped - his successor's design.\n\nWith a single, deliberate motion, Kaya pressed his seal to the document, the vermillion ink glowing warmly in the cold moonlight."

The effects of the Yasuda Crisis would continue for years onward, but because of his own work, the worst was passed, and Japan was stable. His retirement would be in triumph, knowing that Japan was in good hands.\n\nA knock on his door interrupted his reading. Fukuda, most likely. \"Congratulations, my friend,\" Kaya said as his successor entered. \"You did it.\"\n\n\"With your support,\" Fukuda answered with a smile. \"There remains much work to be done, but I will work to ensure that the Empire is prepared.Our best days are to come.\" That they were, Kaya was certain. Domestically, internationally, he was certain that Fukuda would succeed.\n\n\"I have something I've been saving,\" Kaya said, as he walked to his desk and pulled out a bottle of champagne. \"Something saved for a celebration,\" he continued, pouring two small glasses. \"I am glad to pass this burden to you.\"\n\n\"One I humbly accept,\" Fukuda said, slightly inclining his head as he took the glass. \"I will never forget what you did for me and the nation, and the people will not either.\" He lifted the glass slightly into the air. \"To the Empire.\"\n\nKaya smiled, and lifted his own glass.

Kaya had succeeded. He had successfully done what had been needed to stabilize Japan, and would be able to retire in well-earned triumph.\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Kaya said, shaking Shiina's hand as he welcomed the future Prime Minister and Kishi inside, along with Kishi. \"I know that both of you will do well.\"\n\n\"We will strive to do our best,\" Shiina agreed. \"It will not be an easy road - the path to get here was difficult, but it will pale in comparison to what comes next.\"\n\n\"For certain,\" Kaya agreed. \"But I trust you to build upon the foundation I laid.\"\n\n\"Which shall be done,\" Kishi affirmed. \"As Shiina says - correcting the road that our nation has been set upon will be difficult. There will be many who oppose our vision and decisions that will be made, even more than now.\"\n\n\"But rest assured, Kaya,\" Shiina promised. \"We will succeed. Japan will not fall to ruin on our watch.\"\n\nKaya believed them. They had demonstrated enough skill to at least maintain what he had built, and he felt confident leaving Japan in their hands.

They had not decided on a candidate, and until they did, the Prime Minister would continue to serve at the Emperor's pleasure.\n\nThe news was a hammerblow to Kaya's ambitions, grinding any hope he might have held into dust. With every passing day, Kaya felt his body drain of life, processing the actions demanded of him while devoid of spirit. An empty nod here, a mechanical signature there, repeated from dawn to dusk until he was dismissed in favor of his enemies.\n\nSome of the backbenchers in the technocratic faction still believed, a faint hope or a wild wish that the Jushin truly were just taking their time, proceeding with due caution. Kaya knew otherwise, even if the rejection had been a wordless one. No words were necessary, when Kaya's last wish had been spurned so blatantly.\n\nEven as Kaya's body filled empty political space, his power ebbing away with every hour, the YSK's other factions rushed in to seize the moment. Takagi's reformists and Ikeda's conservatives had resumed their attacks on Kaya's technocrats in earnest, presenting themselves as alternatives to a faction fallen out of favor.\n\nJapan would go into the future without Kaya, on a different path than he had hoped - all while Kaya could do nothing but stamp papers, passing the time in sullen disappointment."

The Higher Education Bill had passed, but the cost of it...it had been far and it had been deep. It had been important, no - necessary, for it to consolidate the bureaucracy under the government. It had been a fear that had driven it, perhaps against his better judgement. He'd sworn he'd not make the same mistakes Hirota did.\n\nHe'd succeeded, but it was a pyrrhic victory. One which had cost him the support of the public, many colleagues in the Diet, and even some in his own faction. It had been a hellstorm that he wasn't sure how to recover from. He picked up the phone, feeling the need to talk to a friend. \"Prime Minister,\" Aoki said after picking up. \"What can I do?\"\n\nKaya was silent for a few moments. After all, what could be done now? \"That is something I wish I knew.\"\n\nBrief silence at the other end of the line. \"The Act passed.

It seemed, in some small way, that if they pretended otherwise, it would not come to pass.\n\nThey both knew better.\n\nBut in the end, Kaya had no fancy words or speeches to give, and his well of meaningless topics ran dry. Aoki spoke first. \"Is there nothing that can be done?\"\n\nA rhetorical question, one that both of them knew the answer to. Too much political capital had been burned by the Higher Education Act, and the blame for it was laid at his feet. He had few allies now - and his tenuous hold on power was now largely supported by Kishi, Shiina, and the innovationists - and his rivals were now forcing them to lie in the bed that had been made.\n\nKaya shook his head. \"No.\"\n\nAoki nodded slowly. The little hope that there was another answer, a hidden plan Kaya had, dissipated from his eyes. There was no master plan, there was no contingency. Still, Kaya did not intend to simply give up.\n\n\"Our position may be dire,\" Kaya finally said. \"But we are not defeated yet. No matter what has happened, we may yet salvage our legacies.

Kaya's government - their government - was barely a few months old, and they were already scrambling to put out fires. No matter how much of a loose cannon Shiina was, on this point everyone agreed: whatever disagreements existed between themselves paled in comparison to the threat of the reformists.\n\n\"I suppose we can thank Takagi and his ilk for coming out of the woodwork this early,\" Home Minister Nagayama remarked blithely. \"We have some leads concerning Takagi's lieutenants' connections with Mitsubishi.

The Tokkō were frighteningly effective, and if they had this much on Takagi's people, they likely knew just as much about himself, even if they weren't planning on doing anything with it.\n\n\"Give me the short version,\" Nagayama coughed, while reaching for Nakasone Yasuhiro's file. \"Takagi's protege.

We are not children here.\" Kaya's eyes flicked to Kishi, who had largely been silent. \"It is rich that you are attempting to tie Takagi to this, when we know your own vast connections to Korea and Manchuko, Kishi. I trust that we are not going to pretend you have clean hands when it comes to the corporations?\"\n\n\"All the same, we are talking about Takagi now,\" Nagayama insisted. \"This cannot go unanswered.\"\n\n\"No.\" Kaya shook his head. \"If you wish to pursue this another way, then so be it.

Corruption in Japan was well-known, but corporate coups against the government were a red line - and at least publicly, were unprecedented. Aoki was the first to speak. \"With all due respect, Prime Minister - what proof do you have of such a conspiracy? That is a serious charge.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Kaya said. \"And I did not come without proof.\"\n\nFor the next half hour, Kaya went through each piece of evidence with Aoki and the Board. Some pieces were stronger than others, but when it was all put together, even the most skeptical would be hard-pressed to deny that there was a vast conspiracy afoot. The evidence did generate some debate - but the argument against it did not last long. \"This is unacceptable,\" one of the Board finally stateded. \"This must be dealt with.\"\n\n\"It must,\" Aoki agreed. \"The only path forward is the Diet.\"\n\nThere was some debate over that, but most - Kaya included - ultimately agreed with the proposal. Only legislation, enforceable by law, would be enough to restrain the corporations. Their power had been unchecked for too long, and now it would be dealt with.

He was rather bleary-eyed and not even certain he'd open up, depending on who it was. Adrenaline shot through his body when he saw who was outside his door. He had learned the uniforms very well when he had been on the Board of Yasuda.\n\nThe Tokkō. The Special Higher Police.\n\nThe Tokkō were never sent to merely talk. They were here for him. They were here to arrest him.\n\nAnother knock. Harder this time. \"Konda Tsutomu! Open the door!\"\n\nHe knew the game was up. There was only one thing they could potentially after him for. Maybe if he cooperated, he would perhaps escape with this with his life. With a trembling hand he opened the door, and faced the officers outside. \"Yes, officers, how may I help you?\"\n\n\"You are under arrest for conspiracy, and illegal insider trading,\" the officer said as two more grabbed his arms and cuffed him behind his back. \"Search the building,\" the officer ordered as Konda was led out. \"And take him to interrogation!\"\n\nKonda was only one of many ex-Yasuda board members caught in the conspiracy to be arrested that day. It did not take the Tokkō long to confirm their involvement - and that of the wider web of Takagi and Mitsubishi players. As Kaya read the compiled report when all was said and done, he was struck by one simple fact about the conspiracy. One that had been proven, without a shadow of a doubt."

There were questions of who would lead the departments the arrested had held, but those with questions were assured that it was under control.\n\nKishi reviewed the list of approved individuals, and the positions they would hold. All of them were departments in the financial and shipping branches, and he had no shortage of reliable people he would nominate - all with the guidance of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, of course.\n\nAnd all such postings were, obviously, temporary.\n\nFor every crisis, an opportunity. Better yet, crises engineered for opportunities. Kaya would be displeased, or irritated by his actions, but Kishi had no sympathy for those who were too slow to act. If he had not taken advantage of this, then another would. It was simply the rules of politics. The only question was how far he wanted to push this.\n\nShiina finally spoke. \"You are thinking of displacing Fukuda,\" he said after a few moments. The man was attuned to his way of thinking, and Kishi was not surprised he'd reached that conclusion. It was, after all, an end goal. \"That would be risky. The actions you are taking now are already bold. It may be prudent to wait for the right time. Pushing further risks backlash.\"\n\nKishi considered the advice. While he felt that there was enough reward to justify the risk, it was possible Shiina was right. And even if he did not act now, it would only be a delay - not a defeat. \"You are right,\" he said after a few moments. \"There is no need to risk all that we have done.

More so than Yasuda and Mitsubishi - Nagayama wasn't a financier by trade, and the rich scratching each others' backs was nothing new  - this incensed Nagayama. The defrauding of the Empire and its military - under the watch of Takagi, a military man himself!\n\nIt was mind-boggling, and he'd used those exact words at the Cabinet meeting, which elicited a sinister smile from Shiina. \"We have evidence against not one, but two of the three remaining zaibatsu? Why not drop this pretense of politeness and go after the zaibatsu directly - it'll be interesting to see how they try to wriggle out of this.\"\n\nEven as Kishi nodded approvingly of Shiina's aggression, Aoki Kazuo fired back, his expression aghast. \"Didn't we just find out what happens when we don't consult the rest of the YSK?

His ambitions and vision are not your own.\"\n\nKaya lifted an eyebrow at that. \"I do not think I need to fear him.\"\n\n\"All the same,\" Kishi said neutrally as he took another drink. \"I prefer to be prepared. Nonetheless, I trust you take these concerns to heart.\" He lifted his glass slightly. \"For now, we continue forward. For the Empire.\" Kaya lifted his own glass in return."

 japkaya_tree_two.103.desc: "11:32 AM, Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Kaya frowned as the members of the government's economic planning committee rose to their feet at his entrance, a gaggle of trim suits and balding heads surrounding the central table. The regular spacing between them only highlighted a single gap, twice as large as the others, around an empty seat.\n\nCabinet Secretary Shiina Etsusaburo leaned over as Kaya motioned for the assembly to be seated. \"Mr. Aoki has pressing business elsewhere. I suggest we start without him.\"\n\n3:03 PM, Friday.\n\n\"Where's Aoki?\" Kaya tapped his left index finger impatiently on his right sleeve, waiting for the last senior member of the working group on educational reforms to present himself. \"Early is on time; on time is late. What's gotten into him?\"\n\nShiina's eyebrows knitted in concern as he received a note from an aide. \"His earlier meeting is running over. I'll have a word with him after this, don't worry.\"\n\n12:15 PM, Wednesday.\n\nKaya said nothing about Aoki's latest disappearing act, this time at a wage policy meeting in the Diet. As the agenda concluded, Shiina pulled Kaya aside to a corner of the cavernous meeting hall.\n\n\"Prime Minister, even I'm concerned about Mr. Aoki's absences. I think it's time we dig deeper.\"\n\nAfter three missed meetings in two weeks for no clear reason beyond 'pressing issues,' Kaya was inclined to agree."

 japkaya_tree_two.104.desc: "\"Prime Minister, I'm afraid that Aoki Kazuo seems to enjoy the company of Takagi Sokichi more than your own.\" Home Minister Nagayama Tadanori placed a neatly bound file on Kaya's desk.\n\n\"And?\" Kaya snapped, eying both Nagayama and Cabinet Secretary Shiina with a resentful glare. \"Aoki's been around for a long time. So has Takagi. We all know each other. What's your point?\"\n\n\"The point, Prime Minister,\" Shiina said firmly while opening the file before Kaya, \"is that Aoki has been colluding with the reformists to undermine the government. He's been providing them our talking points and policy proposals. The reformists have always been quick with counter arguments - this is why.\"\n\nKaya, after one wary glance at Shiina, gingerly retrieved the file, leafing through its contents. He wanted to deny it, to toss the file into the trash and scream at Nagayama and Shiina to get out. For years, Kaya and Aoki had shed sweat, blood, and tears in service to the Empire, to think Aoki would betray him so easily - and so brazenly, in a manner certain to be noticed?\n\nIt stretched credulity, and yet here the evidence was - unmistakable contact between Aoki and Takagi, held in the open for all to see.\n\nEvidence that could be interpreted any number of ways, Kaya thought. For all Aoki could have given Takagi, he could have been gleaning information from Takagi in return. Takagi had been around for as long as Kaya or Aoki had been - better Takagi than Miki or another independent MP.\n\nKaya sighed. The bureaucrat in him screamed to find the right answer; the politician in him knew there wouldn't be one."

 japkaya_tree_two.105.desc: "Three facts, one reassuring, one inconvenient, and one damning.\n\nThe first fact: Kaya had been right that the hardliners had been bluffing. When Kaya had talked to Aoki in private, certain misunderstandings were clarified - namely, that while Aoki had been in touch with Takagi's faction, their shared dislike of the hardliners had been the only real topic worth discussing.\n\nNo shenanigans, no plotting, and - most importantly -  Shiina had orchestrated Aoki's absences to frame him on false allegations.\n\nThe second fact: relations between Aoki's New Bureaucrats and the Hardliners were utterly broken. With evidence of Shiina's perfidy in hand, Aoki and Fukuda were quick to demand his resignation - and those of Kishi and Nagayama, for good measure. They were not so gracious to forgive such a grievous offense, and only a cabinet reshuffle in their direction would right it.\n\nThe third fact: politics is a game of numbers, and Kaya no longer had enough. Whatever commonalities existed between Takagi's reformists and Aoki's New Bureaucrats, joining any new cabinet was more trouble than it was worth. If the technocratic faction as a whole was disintegrating, the reformists would be happy to accept the New Bureaucrats - in a cabinet of reformist design.\n\nIt made no sense to bet on a losing horse, after all."

 japkaya_tree_two.106.desc: "\"A traitor.\"\n\nKaya barely breathed those words out, drowned with disbelief and stunned surprise. Aoki Kazuo, a traitor. His old ally plotting behind his back with reformists. He scarcely believed it, but the words were there on paper, as if written in blood, detailing quiet conversations and secret handshakes, all building up to a great betrayal. There could be no questioning it, even if he wanted to.\n\n\"It is my deepest regret to have to report this to you, Prime Minister.\" Shiina spoke quietly, as if to mask something of his own. Even with his efforts, Kaya could detect a faint hint of satisfaction in the hardliner's words, as he could in the thin smile that crossed Nagayama's face. Kishi, however, remained stock-still, silent. \"Unfortunately, it is the truth. Kazuo cannot be trusted. We cannot allow him to make his plans any longer.\"\n\nKaya's eyes turned to the hardliner, eyes flickering with wary trust. \"Then this is the Justice and Home Ministry's responsibility, is it not?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Now it was Nagayama's turn to speak, and eyes drifted to him. \"But this isn't a simple task. We've whittled it down to two main routes of attack at the moment. Either we look into the Finance Ministry-\"\n\n\"A good tack, yes, but Fukuda works there. We suspect he and Aoki are collaborating.\" Shiina added.\"\n\n \"-or we look into the Foreign Ministries. Both may have something, but it's best to focus on one to begin.\"\n\nKaya dwelt on the thought for a long moment, sinking into his chair. Finally, his gaze snapped to Kishi, still stoically on his feet. \"Minister Kishi, your thoughts?\""

This was the dragon's den - Fukuda and Aoki were close allies, and news that hardliners were sifting through the Ministry would cause unwanted problems. This whole operation was too delicate, too brittle for that. It pained him, really, to go through all the precautions and steps of a covert operation. In his opinion, it gave the whole movement - an action to finally cement Japan on its rightful path - a criminal, subversive feel. Of course, who could dither about feelings when results were on the line?\n\nStill, the plan moved forwards. Papers were dumped on his desk to be sifted through, put together like a mosaic, creating an ugly picture that only a schemer could love. Slowly, surely, a trail formed, each with the poison pill Yasuda written onto them, dancing around but circling closer and closer towards Aoki and Fukuda's signatures.\n\nHe had them where he wanted them. The dossier grew and grew with each day, to be delivered with a polite bow and a similarly polite threat - go quietly, or go down hard. He knew what the bureaucrats would pick."

The office, lavish yet cozy, was silent as they sized each other up, waiting for someone to make the first move. Still, despite Fukuda's glare, Nagayama felt no fear - it was him who was in control.\n\nSwiftly, he pulled a folder out of his suit, placing it on the desk. The title read 'YASUDA COLLAPSE - INVOLVEMENT OF MINISTERS FUKUDA AND AOKI'. \"You're finished, Fukuda.\" Nagayama sneered, confidently grinning across the desk. \"We have everything. Your plotting, your deals, and. . .\"He pointed again to the folder. \"Your involvement with Yasuda. I've been gracious enough to allow you the dignity of going peacefully.\"\n\nHe'd expected a reaction, certainly. One of rage, perhaps, or resignation, or contempt. What he didn't expect, however, was for Fukuda to level a grin as predatory as his own back at him, followed by the rattle of a drawer opening. Slowly, Fukuda drew a folder of his own out of his desk, putting it down on top of the first. Nagayama's heart fell through the floor when he saw the title - \"DEALINGS OF MINISTER KISHI IN THE YASUDA CRISIS - 1948-1963\".\n\n\"Minister Nagayama, surely you didn't think I was so foolish as to leave my papers lying around, did you?\" Fukuda said, practically cackling through his words. Nagayama's wide-eyed stare told him all he needed to know. \"Now, I wish to extend you and your ilk an offer of our own. You all resign, effective immediately. In exchange, we don't throw you in jail for the rest of your lives. Does that sound. . .reasonable?\" He relished that last word in the same spirit Nagayama had planned to relish his own.

It was I who struck first, and I who rejected the rightful focus of politics. If I were in your position at the time of the purge, I would have done the very same thing, perhaps even less honorable and civil.

He certainly wasn't surprised that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was implicated in multiple corrupt and backroom details; everyone had some idea of what they were involved in - but hard evidence? That had been hard to come by - Until now.\n\nAnd it was most interesting indeed.\n\nNot only had there been multiple dealings with Indonesian officials during the War, but there had been backroom deals with Australia of all nations as well - something which was even more damning to the ministry. Most of the deals with both nations had to do with the copra and rubber markets, which had been extremely lucrative for certain members of the ministry. Yes, this was certainly enough to force a reshuffle in the ministry.\n\nBut would it be enough to topple the rest of the ministry?\n\nThat was the question he was pondering now. There was enough here to start the ball rolling, even if it wasn't enough to outright force Fukuda's resignation. It was embarrassing and damning for many - but perhaps now enough. However, a way to be sure that it would be enough was fabricating additional evidence to remove even more bureaucrats from the ministry.\n\nIt was admittedly a risky option. If he overstepped or overplayed his hand, then any hope they had would be dashed, and would almost certainly lead to Kaya's government collapsing. However, if he did this, it would make it far easier to remove Fukuda. It was a large risk - but he had to weigh the outcomes, and make a decision."

He found himself furious, baffled, and overall just finished with these games against him. However, he was not a political novice, and knew very well that he had plenty of enemies - particularly Kishi and Shiina's Reform Bureaucrats.\n\nApparently they had found evidence that implicated a large number of individuals in the Foreign Ministry with some connections to him - but had decided to also attempt to forge evidence that made the ties to him and his allies in the bureaucracy more explicit. However, they had overplayed their hand, and the moment someone had learned of it, he had known soon after.\n\nHe was not going to remain silent.\n\nHe knew who was ultimately behind this. Shiina, Kishi, neither man would have done this unless Kaya was looking for a way to get rid of him - along with anyone else who stood in the way of the hardliners. This was a purge, though a very, very sloppy one - and one he was also not going to stand for.\n\nFine.\n\nIf Kaya wanted to get rid of him, he would try, and would learn that betrayal had its price. Fukuda knew many people, and he had power in the Ministry of Finance - power that he was going to employ right now, particularly his connections within the Todai clique of the ministry. His reach did not stop there - as there were even those in the House of Peers he could call upon.\n\nThere would be retribution for this.

Regret that he had listened to Kishi and Shiina. Regret that he had attempted this scheme. Regret at acting against a friend in such a way. Regret that he had failed. Regret that it was deserved.\n\nSome had pressed him to try and salvage this. Kishi had tried to propose some replacements for Fukuda, but even Kishi saw the writing on the wall. After Fukuda, and every other Todai technocrat had resigned in a very public fashion from his cabinet, it set in motion the beginning of the end.\n\nThe collapse of his government was not a matter of if, but when.\n\nTrying to stay would only make it worse. There was only one path for him - resignation. Leaving the responsibility to another unlucky man who would have to stabilize the nation in a way he had failed to.\n\nIf he was lucky, he would be forgotten. His legacy would be a man who had tried to fix the nation, and had failed. If he was unlucky, his failure would be his legacy, as he joined an unenviable list of those who were looked to as warnings. There were those he could blame, but in the end, Kaya knew that he could not absolve himself of responsibility.\n\nHe had made his own decisions. He had made his choices.

No, some of this was fake, it had to be - but the Lord Keeper was clearly convinced by it.\n\nKido beheld the man who had gone silent and nodded once. \"Perhaps silence serves you better.

Splashed across the front page of Nippon Times was a glum-looking Fukuda Takeo, looking outside his Osaka country house. Caught by some overeager reporter, Fukuda found himself captured just peeking out of his bedroom window - eyebags betrayed his pathetic attempts to appear dignified.\n\n\"FUKUDA DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF 'PAPUAN MASS GRAVES, DESPITE EVIDENCE\". Kaya rarely smiled, but how could he not? How could he not revel in the downfall of his enemy in his feeble attempts to bring down Japan? It was despicable how some people would bring Japan down around their ears for the illusion of power. It's what it was, after all. It was all an illusion, a warm haze over the public's eyes. It made them think that their \"Great Helmsman\" was an all-powerful, omniscient being - and why should anyone tell them otherwise? Being Prime Minister was a game of treading water, just hoping they would have enough energy to escape the rising tides.\n\nWhich only made this an even sweeter victory. A knock came on the door. Kishi did not even wait for Kaya's approval to walk into the room. He too held a bundle of newspapers carrying them under his arm like a paperboy that Kaya had seen around his neighborhood as a child. Kishi dropped the newspapers onto Kaya's desk. He smiled, almost grinning. \"USHIBA IMPLICATED IN FUKUDA SCANDAL! LORD KEEPER DENOUNCES THE SCANDAL\". Kaya could scarcely believe it. It would have taken enormous amounts of political capital to scrub down the Foreign Ministry and bring down Ushiba. Here his head was, just lying on his desk.\n\n\"I have contacts in the Nippon Times. They're going to print this in the evening edition. Look,\" Kishi said, pointing at a small sub-article on the front page. \"Even Kido has deserted him. Every and any support that Ushiba had will curl up into a ball and wish it was never born.\"\n\nKaya stared at Kishi, virtually dumbfounded. With Fukuda and Ushiba gone, nothing lay ahead of him now.

Shuddering at this, he quickly rose from his slouched posture, straightening his back and quickly folding his hands on top of one another as his gaze shot forward towards the entrance where just the man he had expected was pushing his way through.\n\nUshiba's face did not wear a pleasant expression, and as the clatter of his boots filled the previously pin-drop silent office space it was made clear that he had not come here to peaceably discuss the terms of Suzuki's meddling. But moments before he could open his mouth in a flurry of protest, a folder was dropped flat against the space between them, and from within spilled paper upon paper of incriminating evidence.\n\n\"You seem nervous, my friend, is there something wrong?\" Suzuki teased, a grin raising his worn complexion as he began to release the faintest of suppressed snickering. \"I wonder if you looked that nervous when you did all this mess, a question only you can answer, right?

A twang of frustration struck the Prime Minister, expression curling into a distasteful sneer as he realized it would have to be him that begrudgingly took the right steps to depose the finance minister and his associates.\n\nCarefully, Kaya mentally perused his available options, discarding one after another as potential fixes seemed to run through his mind in an unintelligible blur. Two among the stream of further dubious and rather complex solutions stood out distinct outliers, Yasuda, or the recently greenlit developments in Southeast Asia. \n\nMassaging his brow, head aching, Kaya pondered using Shiina and his Ministry of Commerce, their influence handling resources allocated by the Finance Ministry being the obvious jumping off point for any meddling in Fukuda's affairs.

He could see it now, the shock on his old friend's face as the press and their locust-like swarms of story-hungry reporters latched onto the reports of his supposed mishandling of government funding.\n\nThe thought was reassuring to Kaya, his legacy secured for another day as Fukuda's threat to him dissolved in the titanic wake of the perfect scandal. As far as Japan was concerned, the current state of the Finance Ministry was simply unacceptable, and it's head was an incapable jester, just like Kaya wanted it. Shifting the blame had been easy, development projects had always been rather messy and this had been no different.\n\nAnother reshuffling was expected within the week, public pressure putting a hefty weight upon Fukuda and his clique to release their hold upon the Ministry of Finance.

They could not find anything on Aoki that could both bring him down and keep them alive.

How will you use it, specifically?\"\n\nKaya stared at Aoki, silent. The Prime Minister of Japan did not speak because he could not speak. In front of the fireplace, the Secretary-General's shadow reached out towards Kaya, covering him. When that silent eternity passed, Kazuo Aoki, former Secretary-General of the Japanese Cabinet, stepped out of the room and out of politics forever. "

 japkaya_tree_two.120.desc: "Shiina cradled a large bottle filled with a thick, black liquid. Its outline topped the drink; being the brightest scarlet that Kaya had ever seen, like the hue of a technicolor strawberry. Beside him sat the 'Monster of Showa' Nobusuke Kishi, holding a glass of Shiina's wine. Outside the window, the cold, clear Friday sky cast its harsh sunlight into the office, while the gnarled cherry blossom tree outside waved its bare branches to the gusts. Kaya laid back, slumping into his office chair, while the two spoke to each other.\n\n\"It's Korean,\" Shiina said, barely concealing his pride in his choice. \"I got it from Jinsen, a local market. Not the shabby inner-city markets. Those are for the Koreans. I am talking about artisanal places. This wine was supposed to be for the Japanese Official, in charge of the province, to stop grain requisitions.\" Shiina stopped smiling and put on a mock expression of sadness. \"I convinced the farmer personally to hand me the drink, and I would promise him that no crop of his would be taken, for one year. Shame corruption seems so endemic to the Empire. \"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Kishi said, taking a sip of the wine. He turned to Kaya. \"Did you deal with him? Will he be a nuisance to our plans?\" Kishi stared straight through Kaya, almost as if he was talking to some disembodied spirit.\n\n\"No. He handed in the note of resignation yesterday.\" Kaya said, nearly whispering. This was a victory, by all means. Aoki, the last obstacle in his path, was gone. All of his enemies, in their vain attempts to stand up to them, had been dashed against the rocks of the inevitable. Was it inevitable? All this? Japan now marched to a drumbeat, not dissimilar to the one it marched to in the 1930s. The storm clouds of war loomed overhead, once again. The Sphere frayed at the edges - a seething, writhing mass of lukewarm flesh and boiling idealism clashing for whatever resources they could find. But now, it was Kaya who found himself the Great Helmsman of Japan.\n\n\"Good,\" Kishi beamed. \"Then there's nothing left. Nothing left between us...and a better, stronger Japan. Long live Japan!\" Kishi held up a glass of wine. As did Shiina.\n\nAs Kaya raised his glass, the Japan of the 1950s died in its sleep. The past became a slave to the future. And the master would never let its serf out of its grip."

 japkaya_tree_two.121.desc: "Kaya stared into the fireplace in his office. The dying, orange embers flickered and leapt over each other as if it was a life-or-death competition. The warmth of the fireplace was an alien creature to Kaya, like the embrace of a passionate lover. The soft crackle of the fire, burning through the kindle, reminded him of his youth. His father would take him to the Imperial Gardens, during the autumn season, when the imported trees' leaves fell to the ground. Every step he would take, the leaves would make a satisfying crunch. Moreover, his father would gather a pile of leaves for him to jump into, to hear that noise closer up. His father had taught him a lesson, using that pile of leaves.\n\nGathering a pile was hard, fiddling work. It took finding lots of non-damp leaves and having the collection not be scattered by the wind. Yet, when completed, it was all worth it. Just to jump in and roll around in the leaves, without a single damn to the outside world. This was what the ideal society was. Men use all their talents and skills to build the perfect Japan - no matter the sacrifice. Nothing was out of the realm for building a utopia. Once it was all done, it was the job of the builders, to watch their children reap the rewards of their labor. \n\nAoki had handed him the letter just a few hours ago. He would stay as Secretary-General, beside the Prime Minister. In other times, this would have been good news - joyous news perhaps. A government, at the brink, is saved by the honor of its constituents. The hardliners would flay him for this move - if they didn't already know about it. With them turned against him, his delicate house of cards that he had built in Tokyo wouldn't be long for this world. It was always like this, this job. One wrong move and the entire thing would collapse. Just like it was doing now.\n\nThe only thing to do now was to resign; the final coup-de-grace that the hardliners salivated for. His legacy would remain, in fragments, but only if he left. Damn it; he was the Prime Minister! The most powerful man in the Eastern Hemisphere, why was he so powerless? So helpless and easy to bend? He couldn't resign. He wouldn't. Why should he? But, it was there - cloaked in darkness - he thought back to his father. What would he have done in his shoes?"

Japan's domestic stability and unity is pivotal to the growth of the Sphere, and without the said stability, many important reforms would never have the opportunity to be implemented.\n\nInvoking my experience as an army officer and the Chief Executive of Guangdong, it became clear to me that self-sufficiency of the Sphere, independent from international trade with hostile states, is of the utmost urgency in today's global arena. Independence of foreign commerce not only set up an effective defense against degenerate ideologies that pose a threat to the East Asian way of life, in the never-so-distant event of a world war, self-sufficiency of war materials will also prove crucial for our national defense.\n\nOur reliance on American and Dutch oil imports substantially hampered our military effort in the Pacific War. The shortage of oil forced our commanders to make risky decisions in an effort to end the war as expeditiously as possible. Luck will not always be on our side, however, and the self-sufficiency of fuel should be of the highest priority.\n\nThough the Empire has liberated the Duch East Indies and now has access to oil fields in the said region, the inferior efficiency of our refineries requires our immediate attention. It is my humble recommendation that you empower the Ministry of Great East Asia to oversee this issue, so that the workload of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can be reduced, as they are already tasked with the crucial duty of managing our relationship with the OFN and the Reich."

He knew it all already - Suzuki and Kishi had been briefing him after every round of talks with Kaibara - and he was more than convinced of the proposal's merits.\n\nEven after the completion of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, energy scarcity had always remained an issue, especially with the growth of the automotive and plastic industries. Oil, as ever, remained the blood of a nation, and any sources of oil outside North America or the Middle East producers -and in Asia, no less -  were utterly invaluable.\n\n\"President Kaibara, your proposal aligns entirely with government policy,\" Kaya remakred, setting the map aside. \"A self-sufficient, Pan-Asian economic ecosystem has been a cherished dream for the Empire for decades.\"\n\n\"That is wonderful to hear. But -\" Kaibara said, his expression grave. \"Oil exploration is ruinously expensive, as is security. Without government assistance in both, this project is doomed to failure.

A humanitarian problem that the Empire is simply not capable of dealing with!\"\n\n\"How will expanding Nippon Oil deal with that, precisely? Will they extract peace and co-prosperity from the ground?\" one Diet member sneered. With cold daggers, Suzuki leered at the dissenting politician. To say that this bill was crucial was an understatement. If passed, it would mean that Japanese Autarky would no longer be a pipe dream. No longer would they have to kowtow to America - a nation that they had crushed on the battlefield - just because they happened to be blessed with their black gold. Japan would be able to stand on its own two feet as the undisputed hegemon of Earth's four corners.\n\n\"No. It will not 'extract peace from the ground'. I will tell you what it does. It will create jobs. Jobs across the Asia-Pacific region to help our brothers in need. Too long, we have proclaimed ourselves as a Pan-Asianist brother among their siblings. Yet how can we supervise our brothers if we cannot keep them in our house? Jobs create wealth, which means more spending. More spending means a higher standard of living. A higher standard of living. Who will they thank for this great opportunity? Us.\"\n\nSuzuki let that last phrase hang in the air. Across the seats, countless Diet members were nodding their heads, lost in thought. Yes, in Parliament he may have just won the battle. However, the Navy was bound to lose its temper over the bill. The South Pacific was their domain, to do as they please.

He wasn't much of a political know-it-all, but even he could see that the new bill was just something that the corporate bigwigs would use to line up their pockets even more. It was just how things work around here, it seemed.\n\nSome of his colleagues he talked to during lunch break had said there was still hope. Maybe it was Isamu, actually.

How can we claim to be truly equal when we do not even have a proper system of power set up? That is why I am suggesting the State Reorganisation Act. Not only would this increase the amount of power that already exists in rural electricity grids, but will create new grids for the rural areas to use.

Few were surprised to see that the revised bill would give the lion's share of the military funding to the navy - but that was far from the only adjustment.\n\nWhere investment in Guangdong and Manchuria had been a centerpiece, the focus under Takagi's amendment shifted to increasing investment throughout all of Southeast Asia, not just the economic hubs of the Empire. Kaya followed all of these developments closely, knowing he had a choice before him.\n\nTakagi's proposed amendment was rather radical. These were major changes to the bill. He knew that if he supported the amendment, Takagi would back him, and passing this was important. However, aligning with the reformists no matter the reason would hurt support among the conservatives and create an equally unenviable situation.\n\nNonetheless, he needed to decide, and after some deliberation, he chose a course of action."

 japkaya_tree_two.136.t: "Fortifying the Empire"
 japkaya_tree_two.136.desc: "News of the passage of the Mobilization Act quickly spread throughout Japan and the wider Co-Prosperity Sphere - as well as quietly observed by other nations throughout the world.\n\nAnd with its passage, Japan wasted little time in beginning to implement it.\n\nNaval bases across Asia were provided with far greater increases in funding, as expansions to existing dockyards were planned, repairs to long-ignored issues were addressed, and still more bases were built to better position the Japanese navy to respond to any threats to their sphere of influence.\n\nFunds also went out to many of the nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the Japanese economic hubs of Guangdong and Manchuria receiving a notable boost. Many other Southeast Asian nations - Thailand in particular - also found themselves bolstered with a generous Japanese investment.\n\nMoney flowed like water throughout the Empire and Co-Prosperity Sphere. While the critique for this influx of spending was muted within Japan, it was less because of a universal consensus, especially among the more liberal economists, and more due to said economists biting their tongues. When giving public statements they offered their support for the effort and mission of national defense - but those who read between the lines could see the implication. Implications, and subtle warnings, that this unrestrained spending was simply unsustainable.\n\nImplications that Kaya dismissed. His objective had been completed, and the legislation had passed. The Empire, and her interests, would be secured from the vultures that eyed them from across the sea, and for that, he was more than content."
 japkaya_tree_two.136.a: "The Empire secured - At least for now."
 japkaya_tree_two.137.t: "A Shortsighted Outcome"
 japkaya_tree_two.137.desc: "Kaya did not outwardly react as he read the headline of the morning paper. Perhaps it had been because he'd known it was coming that he found his reaction closer to resignation than anger at those who foolishly denied that these measures were necessary. Yet what was done was done.\n\nThe Mobilization Bill had failed to pass. He sipped his tea.\n\nThe press, the ministries, and the government circles he had insight into were seeing this as a blow to his agenda and government, and were already making implications on his future after this defeat. While few were saying it openly, behind closed doors he knew that many of the corporations and the liberal economists were celebrating the bill's failure.\n\nNot to mention the superpowers who wished nothing more for a weak Japan.\n\nSeveral rumors had already made it to him that the reformists were beginning to build their own national defense bill - one that was far more limited and gradualist in scope than his. Fools who were more concerned about abstract economic theories, and future returns acquired in decades rather than the needs of the Empire today.\n\nOf course, they didn't see that the failure to pass this bill already was hurting them. Since it had failed, Guangdong and Manchuria had been deprived of much-needed injections of credit and resources. It remained to be seen what the extent of the damage would be, but Kaya knew it would be enough to be felt at home - but especially there.\n\nThis was a defeat, but he would have to keep going. He would recover from this, he was sure of it. His agenda might have been stalled, but he would succeed in time. He would find an alternative, another way."
 japkaya_tree_two.137.a: "He had to."

By the 1960s however, they had broadly solidified themselves into two cliques: Kaya Okinori's moderates, and Kishi Nobusuke's hardliners.\n\nWith Kaya's ascension to power, the moderates have ingrained themselves into the post-war political mainstream. Given their lack of public charisma and appeal however, they have made themselves vulnerable to attacks from the hardliners, and only time can tell if the moderates are truly eclipsed by the radical ideologues.\n\n§rHardliner§!
