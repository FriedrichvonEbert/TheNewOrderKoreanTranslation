#  JAP_prime_minister_kaya:0 "Prime Minister Kaya"
#  JAP_prime_minister_kaya_desc:0 "With Kaya at the helm of Japan itself, one can expect much change under his administration. A former Reform Bureaucrat turned Prime Minister, Kaya harbors ambitions to deal with the various factors preventing Japan from reaching its maximum potential.\n\nFrom the conflict between the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus and the interservice rivalry between the Army and Navy, Kaya plans to end the discord, one way or another. His final plan is synthesizing the government, military, and industry into one cohesive unit after settling their individual disputes, all to redirect their efforts to serve Japan, first and foremost.\n\nWhether it requires stripping power from the various companies, mending the divide in both departments of the armed forces, or cleansing his cabinet of uncooperative members, Kaya will ensure that he and his Reform Bureaucrats get what they desire, no matter the cost."
#  JAP_the_new_cabinet:0 "The New Cabinet"
#  JAP_the_new_cabinet_desc:0 "The first task of any new Prime Minister is to form a new cabinet. Close associates and talented individuals alike will be selected and week-long discussions shall be held to understand the position we've been placed in.\n\nWe must act quickly to garner support and root ourselves in Japanese politics, as the other factions of the Yokusankai look down on our fledgling government with disdain in their eyes. Should we show any vulnerability, they will decimate us without hesistation.\n\nOur Emperor has given us a chance, but they will not. We shall prove the vultures wrong."
#  JAP_appeal_to_the_hardliners:0 "Appeal To The Hardliners"
#  JAP_appeal_to_the_hardliners_desc:0 "As Kaya was elected as the new Prime Minister, his foundations and support started off as frail. So until he can push for major reforms to satisfy his campaign's promises, he is forced to seek out aid quickly to ensure temporary stability in his position.\n\nOne potential group of backers are the hardline members of the cabinet, who are well acquainted with Kaya on ideological and personal levels. With their deep pockets and web of connections, they could surely assist Kaya and allow him to continue operating as Prime Minister, for a price that is.\n\nTheir only condition is to place Teiichi Suzuki, a renowned economist, a seat at the Diet with the role as the Minister of Economy. His methods are unorthodox indeed, but they have been used to good use in Guangdong and shall be put into greater usage under Kaya's guidance.\n\nThough such a request is monumental, this slight boost is what's needed to keep Kaya from sinking under the pressure of the Yokusankai. After the deal is brokered and having support under his belt, Kaya can finally soon reform Japan at his behest."
#  JAP_rub_our_back:0 "Rub our Back..."
#  JAP_rub_our_back_desc:0 "To win over the hardliners' trust, we must extoll to them their benefits if they do decide to cooperate with us. Political favors, landed appointments, extra seats, the list goes on. We shall arrange deals at first in secret with several prominent figures, then slowly, little by little, we will eventually receive a cascade of deals, to which then we will garner enough support to wade through the murky depths of the Yokusankai.\n\n§RThe problem is, are we sure we can follow through? What if it's too much? What if we come up short? What will their reactions be?§!\n\n§YRegardless, we must keep our chins held high and be open to further talks.§!"

#  JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours_desc:0 "Now that we have received an ample amount of offers, we shall begin to fulfill them. Shifting through their signed letters, most of the requests are small and easily grantable. As previously mentioned, we have outlined what we can do for them, and many have taken that to heart.\n\nHowever, a looming problem remains in several individuals, who, while influential, have asked for demands as large as their power in the political sphere. Accepting these demands ensures we get substantial backing amongst the Diet, but at the expense of the support from the public.\n\n§RIt hurts us to do it, but our position as the leading group is more important than the desires of the people.§!"

#  JAP_a_new_face_desc:0 "After Teiichi Suzuki is inaugurated as the new Minister of Economy, he has to settle in and learn the ropes of the Diet in order to become an effective servant to the cabinet.\n\nWith a few weeks of service, he'll surely adapt to his new position and feel comfortable handling the day-to-day operations. That said, we shall also ensure his old position back in Guangdong is replaced by a suitable candidate, so his years of administration and organization aren't wasted.\n\nWe are glad to have Suzuki aboard and wish him for his future successes well."

We are the ones in control. We shall not give in to those who oppose us. We were elected for a reason. It is our right to lead this nation and guide it to victory.\n\nWe shall spearhead the rejuvenation of Japan and its people, all on our own."

#  JAP_forge_our_own_path_desc:0 "To listen to the devil's temptations? Foolish. To seek aid from our rivals? Never. The path to victory must be one paved by the work of one's own hands.\n\nAfter discerning all possible options, it seems the only way is to go forward, alone. While this may take significant amounts of effort, Prime Minister Kaya Okinori is prepared to handle the strenuous and arduous tasks laying ahead. Such tasks include extensive reforms promised during the campaigns, and exemplary acts of leadership in the party.\n\nOnce this is complete however, the Reform Bureaucrats shall stand empowered and unyielding, now free to develop Japan for the betterment of the people."

We shall react to the concerns immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.\n\nThe faster we're able to solve them, the more the populace notices our hardworking nature and may show support for us, allowing our popularity to rise. With the people's backing, we are able to pass our intended reforms without bars or restrictions."

We shall prove that our gracious Prime Minister Kaya, is not above working, spending his precious effort and time toiling tirelessly alongside his accolades to solve the rampant problems ravaging Japan.\n\nBy showing his virtuous ethics, many will become convinced and vouch and support a government with such a responsible leader, increasing our popularity."

#  JAP_realpolitik:0 "Realpolitik"
#  JAP_realpolitik_desc:0 "Due to our current standings, the best course of action in order to stabilize our position has been determined: negotiate some compromises and give concessions to influential former candidates like Ikeda and Kido in exchange for support, in order for our reforms to pass smoothly without resistance.\n\nHowever, by giving in to our rivals, it may stunt our growth in the short run, yet, it is necessary for us to continue for the long term. Our time in the Diet has not been long, but if we want to continue staying in the ring, we must work and ally with the ones who can knock us out of it."
#  JAP_talk_with_ikeda:0 "Talk with Ikeda"
#  JAP_talk_with_ikeda_desc:0 "Ikeda is a simple man, a man who desires nothing more than to uphold the status quo and the continued stability of Japan. As such, we can use this to our benefit by appealing to his more tender sides to convince him to aid our cause.\n\nWe shall first arrange a meeting with him to discuss agreeable terms, granted we gain his support. We must be ready, as Ikeda wants to curb the military's prominence in government affairs and may try something to ensure that our armed force's influence is reduced.\n\nWhile it will be impossible to accept his full demands due to conflicting interests, we can compromise and hopefully reach an agreement which allows both parties to gain something out of the exchange. If our desired outcome is achieved, plans to advance to our next phase may begin."
#  JAP_listen_with_kido:0 "Listen with Kido"
#  JAP_listen_with_kido_desc:0 "Kido is a powerful ally to have, as shown by his status as MP. While wielding vast influence among the House of Peers, he looks down on the House of Representatives, eyeing us with disdain. Regardless, his assistance is required.\n\nWe shall schedule a meeting with him to discuss the measures needed to gain his backing. With this however, we must be keen and keep our wits about us, as Kido is cunning and will conjure an elaborate scheme to tip the deal in his favor. Knowing this, all possibilities must be considered and preparations are necessary. However, if we do manage to secure a favorable deal, it will boost our progress significantly, allowing for us to shift to the next stage in our plans."
#  JAP_bend_to_pressure:0 "Bend to Pressure"
#  JAP_bend_to_pressure_desc:0 "Right now, we hold no position to enforce total control over the government so in order to stabilize it, we must turn to the system we try to avoid - the Kokutai. We must adhere to its rules strictly to appease the upper house, in doing so may make them content with our rule. Alongside that, caving in to public demands and passing reforms drafted by important officials will allow us to earn some support.\n\nSuch methods definitely get the job done and provide us a temporary boost we'll need to start off with, but many suggest this strategy may stunt our future growth. Unfortunately we have no choice, as it's the most logical path we can pursue."
#  JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme:0 "Pragmatism Reigns Supreme"
#  JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme_desc:0 "Ever since our negotiations, our government's stability has been restored and our coalition is now able to traverse the raging waters of the Yokusankai.\n\nThe time has come to start enacting plans of our own volition, and achieve the goals so long promised before taking power. With the backing and support of some influential politicians, we now have the necessary credibility to pull off our plans without much interference.\n\nWe shall slowly work our way upwards, reform after reform, until our efforts pay off and our objectives are achieved. Under our rule, Japan's rise will be dizzying."

#  JAP_begin_the_reforms_desc:0 "Now that we have survived the preliminaries, the time has come to move onto the main event - the implementation of our reforms and policies.\n\nWe can tackle the many problems that surround our society, hindering us from moving forward; from the twisting corridors of the Diet, to the organized barracks of the military, to the sprawling suburbs and secluded villages of Japan and the Sphere; all shall be reformed and developed under our administration.\n\nWe will clear away the vines binding Japan to complacency and stagnation. We will burn them away from the roots until Japan is unshackled, its glory dwarfing that of the Goliaths of the West."
#  JAP_intergrate_the_military:0 "Integrate the Military"
#  JAP_intergrate_the_military_desc:0 "Since the Meiji Restoration, the military has been closely intertwined with the state, waging conflicts for the interests of the directive above, yet our loyal officers never felt formally welcomed in Diet halls for years, up until this point.\n\nToday marks that day, where we begin our grand project of increasing military partnership with the government to an all-time high. Talks between the General Staff will begin to occur, with discussions for possible benefits in exchange for collaboration."
#  JAP_court_the_generals:0 "Court the Generals"
#  JAP_court_the_generals_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has had an intimate relationship in Japanese politics for years, with many dignified officers holding positions and influence in the government; As such, having their backing would be a massive boon. That being said, even if they support our ideals whole-heartedly, they are skeptical of our intentions and so further diplomatic actions must be taken to earn their trust. We shall set an appointment with them to convince them that our motivations are pure which will allow us to earn their trust."

#  JAP_dine_with_admirals_desc:0 "While the Imperial Navy spends most of its time engaging in overseas affairs rather than participating in home politics, its staff still command some degree of prestige and influence, so garnering their support would serve our best interests. However, the navy is a gentry bunch, so to lull them over, would require exquisite dinners with influential officers and some charismatic persuasion to convince them to aid us. Once we've secured their support, it'll be smooth sailing from there."

Doing so, will boost the amount of soldiers we can field. However, many of our advisors warn that diverting manpower to the military means all other sectors will be affected as well and in general, many will see this move as controversial and protest its approval.\n\nClearly, they are all too spineless. Do they not see the threat of the Americans landing on our soil uncontested, due to the shortage of men? They are all mistaken. The law shall pass."

#  JAP_the_might_of_our_military_desc:0 "The military's role in Japan has been severely downplayed these past years, from the foray into the plains of China, to the high sea engagements and intense island hopping skirmishes against America, our loyal soldiers have always been there, risking their lives for the sovereignty of the Japanese people and the salvation of the nation.\n\nWith the withstanding peace we've experienced, the army's been on standby, save for small divisions and fleets to safeguard our interests abroad. Many people, especially the younger generation, question their usefulness and push for the reduction of their spending and mitigation of their grasp on power.\n\nHowever, the youths weren't there. They weren't born when Japan was threatened with extinction. They didn't serve or see the effort and dedication that our brave men put in, putting themselves on the line and even sacrificing themselves, all so that our glorious Sun may not be extinguished.\n\nWe shall show the new generations that the service of these brave warriors is necessary, more than ever in the tumultuous world. We shall prove that our armed forces are the bastion against the West, and that our glorious defenders are here to stay, forever and ever."

We shall start the cleansing by sacking notorious or underperforming cabinet members to terrorize the rest to reveal themselves, lest they want to suffer even worse consequences.\n\nSoon, the rodents hiding in the cracks will be delivered into the cat's paws, ready to be devoured."

What better way to do so than invoke one of Japan's most sacred principles, the Kokutai?\n\nFor years, the decadent Prime Ministers have allowed Japan to deteriorate and weaken. This has culminated in the utter failure of Hiroya Ino, whose administration was bout with corruption and his resignation left Japan dealing with utter economic destruction and in deep bureaucratic chaos.\n\nWith such a catastrophic failure, it will be easy to exploit this and state that we, the Reform Bureaucrats, intend to uphold and protect the values of the Kokutai previous leaders have not. Where our predecessors have failed, we shall succeed."

We must devote more resources into our police department, be it new textbooks or better equipment, to ensure our officers can perform at the highest efficiency.\n\n§YWhile the funding of this renewal might be costly, our contacts in the hardline Reform Bureaucrats are more than willing to cover the cost.§!"

However, some of these men are intertwined with Prime Minister Kaya himself. Back during the days of Prime Minister Konoe, several of these individuals worked alongside Kaya in the Shōwa Kenyōkai, the predecessor of today's think tank. However, those reformists opposed Kaya's ideals and plans, actively criticizing them in favor of their own.\n\nOld scars don't heal, and while Kaya doesn't hold personal grudges, he holds distaste for those who disagree with his agenda."

However, with the development of the stock market crash and their subsequent full-scale conflict that followed, the situation presents a unique opportunity.\n\nWe shall make our opening moves by increasing their tax burdens, probing their strength while slowly funneling our rightful funds back into the state treasury. Once the ploy is realized, the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus will try calling us out, yet no real action is taken because of the economic strains they suffer currently.\n\nThis first step will bring us closer to the reduction and minimization of their influence and power, ending their misguided rule on our economy."

Confrontation and conflict between the two would only lead to Japan and her economy and people being plunged into further ruin - no, there is a far smarter way of dealing with these companies, one which will both preserve economic health and cripple their power.\n\nFinance Minister Fukuda has proposed a bill for "corporate stabilization" - in actuality, a treaty between the state and the zaibatsu. Should the bill be passed, the government will offer a conditional bailout package to the zaibatsu: in exchange for subsidies, tax relief, and loans, government observers will be appointed to their boards of directors nominally to measure firm performance and work with the zaibatsu to ensure growth and stability; in truth, this mechanism will also be used to exert control over the companies and threaten them into submission if necessary."

A little humiliation from time to time was worth it if it meant progress for his beloved nation.\n\nSeated across from the table was Shiina Etsusaburo and Kishi Nobusuke. The former shook his hand, and the latter smilied, gesturing towards a seat. A seat a little too low for Kaya's preference. \n\n"I need your help, gentlemen," Kaya said. "You two have proven yourselves efficient bureaucrats time and time again, which we have dire need of. I would appreciate it if both of you were to publicly, and privately, support my new cabinet. Your reputation would give my cabinet a certain legitimacy that it currently does not have." Kaya straightened his back, even as both men smiled and nodded. Here come the demands, he thought.\n\nShiina started. "We would be glad to give our support, Prime Minister, but..." \n\nKishi now took over. "But we would both prefer that you could... well, throw us a bone, so to speak." The man chuckled at his own joke, waiting for a response.\n\n"Very well. I had it in mind to revive a few retired agencies and ministries," Kaya replied. "They were powerful institutions that boosted our nation to the spot of a global superpower. I thought both of you could lend a hand in reconstructing these agencies and ministries, controlling them after the fact."\n\n"That would suit us wonderfully." Shiina said, a broad smile across his face. Kishi, on the other hand, did not look as pleased as his counterpart. Another round of bribes would be coming, Kaya thought. Hopefully, he did not ask for too much more."

Utter fools."\n\n"We won't. Neither of us can miss this chance. In our career, there are rarely second chances; we'll grasp this one with both hands, and I, for one, will not let go until my death," Kishi replied. "The work we will be able to accomplish... well, it's indescribable." \n\n"It's good that we could finally come to terms with the New Bureaucrats too." Shiina thought out loud. "We wouldn't have been able to maintain a rivalry within our faction, so I'm glad that's been sorted away. Giving them those lesser cabinet posts has worked rather nicely."\n\n"I would not have thought anybody in the Yokusankai would have supported us after that whole affair with Tojo, twenty years ago," Kaya sighed, poking at his own food.  Fear had taken his appetite away, whereas it seemed to only have enhanced Shiina's. It was only lunch, yet the man had almost consumed a whole duck, half a loaf of bread and various spreads besides. \n\n"Shit scrubs off." Shiina said, chuckling."

Kane chuckled.\n\n"I suppose it isn't, but I'm just not sure of what any of this means. What it will lead to." Aoto shrugged, rubbing his eyes.

A matter as mundane as the reformation of the Cabinet Planning Board should've gone over smoothly enough with the Diet, but here Kaya was, listening to the petty complaints of yet another status-quo Yokusankai politician, some nobody from some nowhere district. The Prime Minister sipped at his water, wondering which schmoe would stand up next to frustrate his plans.\n\nShiina Etsusaburo, it would seem. "The Cabinet Planning Board aches for reform," he began. "Our practices of the past are just that: of the past. Old ways are nothing more than obstacles for progress, and the people that defend them only a little less so. I say yes to these reforms, and so, I am sure, do many of my colleagues." \n\nShiina smilied, and looked to the Prime Minister. "My only question is when Minister Kaya might get out of our way, and finally allow the rest of us a little work for a change." The comment elicited the laughs of his aligned Reform Bureaucrats.\n\nIt seemed Shiina's show of support was as much of a shock to the rest of the Yokusankai as it was to Kaya. Murmurs and whispers flowed all throughout the assembled politicians, which exploded into loud displeasure as Kishi Nobusuke stood, agreeing with Shiina's points and voicing his approval for the reform. If those dimwits in the Yokusankai didn't clue into Kaya's deal, they certainly would've now.\n\n"56 to 44!" The vote counter called out in a bellowing voice. "The Cabinet Planning Board has passed!" The man's voice was answered by applause from Kaya's side and utter bewilderment by the opposition. It was all Kaya could do to not laugh as he signed his name at the bottom of the document."

The Prime Minister of Japan was almost willing to call the two men friends, but even that might have a price tag. Close acquaintances then, Kaya thought, entering the office.\n\n"The foreign minister," Kaya said. "My cabinet is not complete until we have one, so I have a mind to run my choice by you two: Arita Hachiro."\n\nThe Prime Minister looked from Shiina to Kishi. "It's a good choice." Shiina said. \n\n"But we have a better one." Kishi added. "Suzuki Teiichi."\n\n"Suzuki Teiichi?" Kaya said with a frown. The man was a political outcast ever since his failure in Guangdong. He did not hold an enviable position, managing that chaotic little nation. Perhaps there was something to the man after all.\n\n"Suzuki Teiichi." Kishi smilied. "Less likely people have held the Foreign Ministry before, you know."\n\n"Who has?"\n\nKishi smiled again, then frowned. "Well, I can't remember their names off the top of my head... But I'm sure there were one or two."\n\n"Suzuki could fit the role." Kaya thought. His failure in Guangdong was a domestic issue, not an international one, yet assigning him a minister could attract a fair bit of negative attention anyhow. Arita Hachiro would not have that effect, but his appointment could risk the relationship Kaya had only just formed with the two men in front of him. He had to be decisive, though.

He could see an issue with Kishi Nobusuke coming down the line, but as long as he kept the man happy, there shouldn't be a problem.\n\n"We have already made incredible progress, especially with help from our friend Mr Kishi Nobusuke. Now is the time to capitalize on our work, take the initiative, so to speak. We shall press forwards with a new direction, and I myself already have a thought in mind. To advance our nation, the military must be enshrined and made great."\n\nHis cabinet sat silent, nodding along, smilies on each and every one of their faces. They, at least, understood. The innovationists and bureaucrats seemed less keen, but that could be worked over with time. "I must say, Mr Prime Minister, that I could not put it any better than yourself. The military defends our nation and our allies. To forget them, well, that would be an outrage." Kishi said, a great beaming smile across his face.

"It's said Kaya doesn't age, but age does Kaya." \n\nIf only they were right. The Prime Minister's old bones were aching, his hands nearly shaking. Administration was proving difficult.\n\nIt was six by the time the meeting concluded with a final thought from Kaya. The cabinet was at least a little more active by then, with the benefits of coffee boosting their energy. "Policy cannot be allowed to be dictated by the party. Any party, be it the Yokusankai or the opposition. The elites of this nation too; none can be allowed to flaunt and avoid our laws. This is just the beginning of our work."\n\n"It shames me to have to chip at my colleagues' success, but to encourage unity within the party, some of our newly made friends will have to suffer lesser cabinet positions. The Reform Bureaucrats will be rewarded in due time, but unfortunately, that time is just not now."\n\nThe cabinet was dead silent, listening on in fearful anticipation. "Those are my final thoughts, gentlemen. Take on board all I have said today, and we can begin to start building this nation back to greatness."

He trusted few factions to act not in their own self interest, and fewer still he could trust to act for the benefit of Japan. It was clear the politicians were waiting for him however, so Kaya began his speech.\n\n"I want to keep this brief, but I have a few words I am sure some members among us would benefit from hearing. This party cannot remain divided. The disasters of the past have proven this fact to us, and each level of our government is somewhat responsible for this division.'\n\n'What is best for Japan, what is best for its survival, is the preservation of the Kokutai. Such division only weakens these structures, and I for one will not stand by and watch this happen. I will yield the floor back, but allow me these final words: only united can this government stand strong."\n\nFaint applause came about as Kaya stood down, but not from the leaders of said factions - Ikeda and Takagi in particular. Each gave the Prime Minister an icy stare, and scoffed with disdain as Kaya met their eyes. It did not matter. If they stood in the way of progress, Kaya would crush them."

Tallies were recorded by the bookies at the front of the chamber, votes counted almost every ten minutes. The chamber was alive with activity, yet the most important motion was yet to be passed: Kaya's motion.\n\n"All in favour of the Prime Minister's motion, please raise your hand!" The speaker called out. Neither Takagi's clique nor the status-quo politicians within the Yokusankai decided to raise, although Kaya hadn't expected them to. It was his own clique and the Reform Bureaucrats he needed. With grunts of disdain, they, to a man, raised their hands. It would be good enough.\n\nShouts of disapproval came from across the aisle as the speaker's voice rang out across the room: "The proposal of Mr Okinori passes!" It seemed the opposition hated his government almost as much as they hated each other. \n\nNothing new, Kaya thought. This was what politics was about; playing the enemies off of each other. Power would not come from begging for scraps, it would come from making enemies. That was a fact Kaya was all too glad to accept."

These were the men he needed to govern Japan. But even they sometimes had fears.\n\n"Kishi Nobusuke is a problem," one minister declared loudly. "That rat has always been known for influencing events from afar, and retaliating with brutal force if necessary. In my opinion,Prime Minister, you give him far too much power as it is."\n\n"Both the liberals and conservatives are growing within the Yokusankai," another said. "And if they think our government weak, they would most certainly band together to oppose us, and bury us."\n\n"Every government in this country has faced the same problems, gentlemen!" Kaya bellowed, silencing the cabinet. When they quietened, he allowed his voice to level. "From yesterday to the Taisho era, this has been an issue. The factionalism, the backstabbing, the asslicking. Yet, we can manage this. We must cede ground, yet fight for vital issues. If we combine this pragmatism with our efficiency for administration, the Diet will bend to us. Never forget that. Never.""

The security minister, I believe." The secretary bowed, and left Kaya to the paper.\n\nRight, Kaya thought. He had told the minister to keep an eye out for the press' reception of the government's new agenda. The front page headline 'Kaya Okinori: A Guiding Light to the Future' informed the Prime Minister that this reception had been a positive one. Littered throughout the paper were more encouraging headlines and articles, all showing a genuine interest and cautious hope for Kaya's newly made government. A good sight. \n\nWith the public behind him, he would become unstoppable. And it was always nice to know his cabinet was supporting his leadership."

The belief that you should accelerate your own ambition by any means necessary? Kaya thought not. Kaya held a true belief; that his government had a plan that would bring Japan into another age of prosperity, a plan the Yokusankai would have no choice but to toe. That was true self belief: the belief in your own competency.\n\nKaya was the Prime Minister of Japan. All doubts must be expelled. He was entrusted by the Emperor himself to lead his nation. He would not fail now.\n\nThe Diet had assembled slowly today, and even now, the chambers echoed with idle chatter. Kaya's voice quietened their murmurs, the chamber speaker officially calling the session. All eyes turned to Kaya, burning into him. This is leadership, he told himself. This was the burden of ruling, and he would not succumb to it.\n\n"My colleagues. My cabinet and I have crafted a plan for prosperity. Some of you amongst us have aided us in doing so, whereas some of you have only hindered us. That does not matter now. As servants of Japan, I expect every one of you to toe the party line, to help my cabinet in whatever way you can to ensure this plan can be fully implemented across the nation. The time for petty grievances is over." \n\nEven Kaya impressed himself by that line, spoken with a leader's voice - finally, he thought. "Whatever you may think of my government, the time for argument and debate is over. I will not suffer anymore hindrances. I will not suffer factionalism. I will not suffer cliques. From hereon, I expect the Yokusankai's full cooperation to see my plan brought into fruition." Kaya squinted. Perhaps he had been too rough. He smiled, coming up with a last line to soften the blow he had just given."

Notes in the margin, all ignored.\n\nKaya Okinori had mapped out endless combinations of cabinet ministers over the hours, filling each sheet with frustrated scrawls until the paper would tear at the touch of his pen. Then he would start again, and repeat the exercise, each time coming to the same conclusion: the technocrats alone could not carry the government.\n\nKaya ran a hand through his hair and sighed. How much easier things would be, if he could throw caution to the wind! He'd been chosen as Prime Minister; did he not have the right to determine policy as he wished? And Kishi's hardliners were more than dependable in a legislative scrap, even if they asked a high price for their services.\n\nBut politics was the art of the possible, and right now, it was impossible to see a way out without the YSK's other factions. The technocrats would not survive long without either the public cover provided by the conservatives, or the aristocratic networks of the Kidoites.\n\nThe last thing Japan needed, Kaya mused, was for the YSK to be consumed by infighting, when it needed stable leadership most of all. Even if it meant forcing the hardliners - most notably Kishi Nobusuke and his protege, Shiina Etsusaburo - to accept minor cabinet positions as a peace offering.\n\nSo be it. If diluting the technocratic faction's brand was the cost of a legacy beyond martyrdom, Kaya was more than happy to pay it."

Kaya would have been amused - how many faces could Ikeda wear in the span of a minute? - were it not for the fact that Kaya had entrusted his entire political future to the man.\n\nFinally, Ikeda placed the paper on the table beside his armchair with a sigh, wiping his glasses on the hem of his waistcoat. "Fukuda for finance minister, Ushiba for foreign affairs, and Kawashima for the home ministry? I'm impressed you could find this many insiders so quickly."\n\n"Fortunately, the YSK has many qualified experts within its ranks," Kaya said, smiling politely. "Factions don't count for much when you look strictly for expertise."\n\n"Mm." Ikeda nodded appreciatively as he weighed Kaya's verbal supplication, but Kaya said nothing. Ikeda wasn't going to agree to cooperate for free, the other shoe had to drop -\n\n"Of course, I have a few suggestions for the less prominent posts." Ikeda crossed his legs languidly, smiling like a cat. "The Ministry of Commerce, perhaps?\n\nKaya pursed his lips, immediately discerning the intent of Ikeda's 'suggestion.' He'd already given the Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs prime place in his cabinet, sidelining his own hardliners' supporters in the Ministry of Greater East Asia. Now Ikeda wanted to claim the Ministry of Commerce - Kishi Nobusuke's alma mater - for himself.\n\nIt didn't take a genius to understand the anger that would provoke - which was exactly the point."

Not the sort of place one would expect to find the Prime Minister meeting with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. But also not where people would ask questions.\n\n"Frankly, Mr. Kaya," said Kido, smiling slightly, "your appointment is one that unnerves me. I don't mean to fully compare you to Tojo, but we cannot deny that there are certain similarities between the policies you advocate and those during the war."\n\n"I assure you, Mr. Kido," said Kaya, "I am no Tojo."\n\n"I will take your word for it. Regardless, I am also concerned by your factions perhaps... obsessive focus on technicians, of bean-counters, of machines. In the case of your younger accomplices, on monied interests. You are in danger, I fear, of trampling over the dignity of our institutions in search of raw efficiency. It is not enough for a nation-state, especially one with an unbroken imperial legacy as long as ours, to be a well-oiled machine. The offices and symbols of the Emperor and his subjects require a high degree of reverence to operate in a proper and moral fashion. And I am not yet confident your government can achieve that."\n\n"Your concerns are well-founded," said Kaya, "and this is indeed a weakness of our current administration. However, I am not too proud to refuse help where it is needed. With your experience and expertise, I am certain we can bring the Japan of the future to a place of both efficiency and dignity."\n\nKido's smile grew a fraction wider."

Unless, of course, the Prime Minister wishes to preside over the Sumimoto Crisis? Or perhaps the Mitsubishi Crisis? We don't want to be obstructionists, but unless real, meaningful change is brought about, we will."\n\n"We understand the need for government unity, yes, nobody understands more than us. And we admire the policy agenda the Prime Minister has set out. But how can I hope to support this cabinet when its programs don't extend to my constituents in Niigata? Our prefecture has been neglected by Tokyo for far too long, I'm afraid, for us to offer our support for free. Our roads have been allowed to fall into disrepair, agricultural stipends have fallen below the national average, our businesses are in dire need of investment, the list goes on..."\n\n"Mr. Kido is well aware of his arrangement with the current administration, and you can rest assured that he stands to maintain it. However, we are not as beholden to the Lord Keeper as many like to think, and we are more than capable of making independent judgements of the present situation, to spot details which are below the Lord Keeper's notice. Take the growing impudence in the countryside, for example. Previous administrations have, in their fleeting desire for popular acclaim, allowed tenants to take more and more while producing little in return.

Despite all the motions of celebration, however, few could bring themselves to smile, and those who did were perhaps grimacing. Takagi and his liberals could not even bring themselves to clap, instead staring in stony silence.\n\nAoki did manage a grin, however. "Well, Prime Minister," he said. "I think we managed it.

"Well, it's a platform waterlogged with compromise, half-measures, placation and insufficiencies, but at least we're no worse off than Ikeda or Kido. I guess it'll have to do."\n\n"Well, that's the spirit of compromise, which is what the YSK was formed to do, after all. If they could see reason here, there's no reason to suppose they can't be budged in the future. Perhaps that old wartime spirit is returning to our humble organisation, after all."\n\n"I hope you're right, but all I see is naked self-interest," grumbled Kaya. "The wartime spirit's never coming back. Maybe that's for the best, seeing how it brought us here.

It is not inaccurate to say that our international representation has been tarnished, and our enemies smell blood in the water. For example," Kaya said, holding up a newspaper, "I have it on good authority from our translators that this copy of the Wall Street Journal predicts the total collapse of our system within a decade. Deeply concerning news, if it were true. But, by now, I think we are deeply familiar with American overconfidence." A handful of chuckles rang out around the Diet.\n\n"They have, yet again, failed to observe the small details which stand in the way of their feverish hopes. They failed to notice the speed with which we excised the rot of Yasuda. They failed to appreciate our new direction and the unparalleled technical ability of our civil service, of our administrators, of our capacity for innovation. And above all, they failed to understand our unity and the strength of our resolve. The YSK is now, and has always been, a united front in service of His Majesty and the nation that our enemies could never possibly hope to understand. I ask you now to join me, trust in me, as I join and trust in you, to set Japan right, for the good of all!"\n\nCheering and clapping resounded around the room, but as a reasonable, temperate level.

Indeed, there were technical mistakes in that we failed to handle the financial situation, yet that does not account for the full picture. Why was there resistance everywhere when we tried to call upon the people to buy bonds and make savings? Why were our posters and fliers in the streets torn down and spit at by the people, and no matter how many arrests we made, the unrest kept burning red and hot? Why did the people lose faith in us?\n\nInvoking my experience as a civil servant and a politician, it became clear that we have forgotten the very purpose of politics. Our constituents cast their votes on us. We feed on the taxation paid by our fellow subjects of His Majesty. His Majesty entrusted this glorious Empire and its people to us. And as such, we bear the responsibility and the honor to lead the people, to care for the people, and to solidify the loyalty to His Majesty in the hearts of the people. Blind suppression of the people was in deviation from His Majesty and the people's expectation; how good is a father if he knows nothing but beating his child? How can we solidify people's love of His Majesty, and the trust in the government, if we turn a deaf ear to their voices, and decline to teach them the righteous way?\n\nToday, here in the holy halls of the Imperial Diet, I solemnly vow that the past ways of absolute control over the masses will come to an end.

You may find these procedures unnecessarily repressive for a peacetime society and a peacetime economy. You may consider these the lingering obsessions of an aging wartime cabinet member forcing the solutions of the past on the problems of today. I expect to hear these complaints frequently in future Diet sessions, in fact.'\n\n'But know this. We are no longer living in an age where such appeals to emotion or to ideals will suffice to deal with the problems Japan faces. Our issues will not be solved by instituting arbitrary levels of economic freedom or social permissiveness. They will not be solved by politicians invoking the Emperor's name in the cause of pedantry or their own special interests. They will not be solved through political theatre.'\n\n'Our issues will be solved through utilising our constitutionally-granted power to guide Japan in the right direction. They will be solved by forcing our institutions, by hook or by crook, to work in the national interest. They will be solved because they will be regarded as problems to be solved, rather than issues of contention between the ambitious and greedy. Though this may not sound pleasant to many sitting here, it is necessary. And if you value Japan in your hearts as much as your oaths would imply, you will do what is necessary to see Japan through."\n\nKaya looked around the room. The liberals were silent, as could be predicted, while the technocrats were almost howling with applause, Kishi almost bouncing in his seat. The conservatives clapped, as politely and uselessly as always. Entirely expected outcomes. Despite what the movies said, grand speeches were never enough to truly sway opinion."

Something which needs to be brought to heel, for its own sake and for that of the nation, but one which would almost rather destroy itself than submit to oversight.\n\nKaya supposed part of it owed to the traditional views of military officials towards civilian administration. Never mind that Kaya himself had managed to bankroll their great crusade across the Pacific in the thirties and forties, nor the need to budget and finance armies in general. To generals and admirals the world over, men like Kaya were little more than pencil-necked bureaucrats standing in the way of their great ambitions, or skewed visions of necessity. But the truth of it all - one that the smarter military men recognised - was that they needed each other. Kaya was far from too proud to admit it. The armed forces were the only institutions capable of mustering the strength to deter the threats from outside, and disciplining the threats from within. But for them to understand this, a bone would have to be thrown.\n\nFortunately, the generals liked to consider themselves men of force and action, exactly what they would soon be required to deliver. They would need funding for this. Thus, to give them what they wanted was a matter of simply directing them to where they were needed. A few tense evenings and a few misunderstandings cleared, and this could be set in motion. Perhaps even Takagi could be brought on board."

"The Kwantung Army has been steadily ignored for decades now, while Tokyo gawks southward. Don't let the fatcats in Hsinking fool you: the partisans are very much still active, and Russia's growing less chaotic by the day. When they come for Urajio, how long will it take your men to march from Shonan-to?"\n\n"It was my understanding that the Kwangtung Army was supposed to hand over responsibilities to this highly competent and motivated Manchurian Imperial Army I keep hearing about for years now," countered another, with puffy red cheeks and a tortured, mangled pile of seafood below him. "We don't have the time or money for your speculations or paranoia. You won in the north. Savour your victory. Down south, meanwhile, we still have real wars to fight, and a real job to do."\n\n"Why you-"\n\n"Gentlemen, please!" Glaring heads whipped round towards Kaya, smiling serenely. "The failures and indiscretions of previous administrations may have caused you to forget that we have the economy of a superpower behind us, one which promises to only grow further still as we put it towards a healthier direction.

The IJN, it seemed, were content to leave such brutish behavior to the open seas, if it existed at all.\n\nTheir requests were simple, and could easily be granted. More funding, of course, that much was obvious. Key bases would be strongly reinforced and key shipping routes protected more vigorously. Resources would be allocated to help build the maritime forces of Japan's loyal allies in Southeast Asia. The future would be accounted for in equal measure with the present: new naval technologies, grants for the study of tactics, increased observation on the changing nature of ocean warfare around the world, all would be keenly considered. Nothing would be forgotten, no stone left unturned. A comprehensive, full package, for Japan's brave defenders on the waters.\n\nJust then, Takagi slowly rose to stand, making Kaya's heart skip a beat. Pleasant or no, the admirals were deeply connected to the YSK liberals, and so a man like Takagi's opinion counted as double here. Would this be enough, to cooperate on at least this one issue?\n\n"As we all well know," Takagi began, "me and the Prime Minister disagree on a wide variety of issues, and I expect we will continue to do so in the future. However, I must admit I find myself impressed with his proposed plan for the navy. Whatever misgivings we may have then, I would like to express my admiration for what we see before us now.""

What they were being replaced with instead was garrisons, attaches, joint training camps, naval bases, things of that sort. From Kwantung to Kuala Lumpur, civilian authorities were fading into the background, and as various jurisdictional scuffles were sorted, the army and the navy were moving in. Shunichi looked around his cozy little office, and wondered if it would be so cosy this time next year.\n\nFar away, in a much grander, less cozy office, [GetJapHoG] turned to Kaya.

Efficiency was improving across the board, the military presence was finally driving some much needed discipline into civilian administration, and the armed forces themselves were finally beginning to be equipped and act as soldiers of Japan, rather than a mass of brutes with firearms. Japan's institutions, at last, were learning to put aside their feeble, pointless squabbles, and move ahead in a unified direction. Things could soon be set right, and the future could mean something once more.\n\nThe economy could grow again, unlocking all kinds of new possibilities. Asia would be secure once more.

His doctor would surely say that now was no hour for a man of his age to work, Prime Minister or no. But Kaya knew that this was foolish, when one considered all the work yet to do.

Everyone seemed content with it as well - that was, until Shiina spoke up.\n\n"So long as this is only the start," Shiina said. "We have only scratched the tip of the iceberg. This corruption has spread far outside the Diet, and we will need to purge it from all parts of the nation if we are to restore her national character. We cannot only cut half the rot while leaving the rest to fester."\n\nThe room went quiet at that declaration. Aoki nodded in silent agreement, while Fukuda frowned. "And what does that entail? The military? The schools? Where would such actions stop - and would it be warranted?"\n\nNone of them seemed eager to speak after Shiina and Fukuda, and Kaya became aware of the gulf that existed on where they each wanted to take this.

But if you any ounce of sense or care for Japan and its institutions, then I don't need to tell you what to do." The liberal representative sat down.\n\nOther speeches of this ilk followed, and when the time to vote came, the results were not pretty. Kaya did not know it was possible for him to feel twenty years older, but the sensation streaking through him must have been the equivalent. Despite the use of the fullest extent of the Prime Minister's cleaning tools, the filth had not been cleared from the heart of Japanese politics. Not one inch. As it piled up more and more, it would threaten to turn to blight, creating a rot so deep only complete destruction and rebuilding would suffice to make Japan whole again.\n\nBut they had not made it to that stage yet, and Kaya would not let it happen. He still lived, he still breathed, the fire remained within, and most importantly, he was still Prime Minister. The worms had not escaped his attention, and they would not escape his wrath. He began to make his way back to the Prime Minister's Residence. There were files to look through, reports to write, contingencies to be made, and as always, much work to be done."

Those four were the leading representatives of the New Bureaucrats and the Hardliners, and they spoke in guarded, cautious tones - to avoid giving the other side an unearned advantage.\n\nToday, Shiina had presented his proposals - no doubt backed by Kishi - to 'purify' the national spirit, and Aoki and Fukuda had dispensed with their tact and caution in return.\n\n"Don't you see?" Shiina exclaimed, tapping the draft legislation with his free hand. "Yasuda's corruption was only possible because everyone strayed from the essential character of this nation. Honor, duty, filial loyalty - replaced by the division of liberalism and the false utopia of socialism!"\n\n"And your solution is to browbeat citizens and businesses into compliance with penalties?" Aoki shot back, disdain dripping from his words. "The economy plunges to new depths every day, and you want to spend time on indoctrination rather than work! It's unenforceable - and it's a mistake."\n\n"If you're that set on political education," Fukuda pointed out, barely hiding a sneer, "we already have the national broadcaster. Why not -"\n\n"I don't see why this is so controversial," Kishi said, cutting Fukuda off briskly. "We all memorized the Imperial Rescript on Education as schoolchildren. It's our first duty as Imperial subjects. But where we can excuse children forgetting, adults need to face consequences."\n\n"We won't let dissidents go unpunished; that's what the Tokko are for."

It was evening, and Kaya stood with [GetJapSecMin] along with a few other officials as they finalized the last elements of the anti-corruption operation. "These are the administrators to focus on," Kaya finished, indicating on the list of names. "Each one appointed by Ino. His influence will be broken tomorrow."\n\nAll of them nodded. Ino was by far the most corrupt official of their generation, and if they wanted to show they were serious about removing the corruption in the government, they had to start with his cronies. "Easy to justify to the public," one of the officials said.\n\nHe was correct. This was not an operation that Kaya was expecting public pushback on - at least at first. Kaya then lowered his voice, almost to a conspiratorial level. "A final note - do not overlook those who may also be opposed to our government. I expect that those opposed to our agenda may find themselves in this net we are casting."\n\nA few smirks around the room at the clear implication. [GetJapSecMin] smiled at Kaya. "I will be sure to take that into account, Prime Minister." After that, they all departed for the night. Kaya went to sleep, and while he slept, [GetJapSecMin] and the security forces acted.\n\nThe next morning, the papers were awash with bolded headlines and frantic commentary. The scope of the bureaucratic purge was extensive, and many were excited at the developments, seeing the deep corruption finally starting to be dealt with. Others were apprehensive, fearing it was a pretext to something worse.\n\nYet all were watching Kaya's next moves closely. Because they all knew one thing for certain."

Politicians would blather about the state instead of the emperor, but he'd still be there."\n\n"Well, that's exactly it, isn't it?" countered Miyuki. "It's not enough to simply cite Lenin or Luxembourg's comments on bourgeois democracy, especially given their distance to Japan, we must examine the Japanese tradition more thoroughly. Consider, we constantly hear invocations of the Emperor, but when has the Emperor acted in any real kind of independent fashion. When Minobe proposes to subordinate the emperor's position to that of a symbol of the state, does this not reflect the unsaid reality of the present?"\n\nBefore Ryunousuke could respond, a knock came at the door, followed by Akira walking in slowly. "Fuck's sake, man, it's been twenty minutes! Were you followed-" began Miyuki, who was interrupted by Akira levelling a Tokko badge at the reading group.\n\n"I'll give you one chance to surrender," said Akira, if that was indeed his real name. "You have three seconds." Before two had passed, however, Ryunouske rushed towards Akira, fists balled. An instant later, he was huddled over the floor, a bullet lodged into his gut. A whole column of Tokko entered the small room shortly after, slamming the disparate students to the floor with little effort. Akira stood to the side, observing Ryunousuke's twitching below him."

That preening, careful illusion was smashed, an ornate mirror meeting a sledgehammer.\n\nPoliticians making their way back to their homes are apprehended by Tokko agents, pushed into the same cars as their civilian counterparts. Probes launched by the Home Ministry and Tokko revealed a great deal about the members of the YSK, rooting out Kidoites, reformists, and conservatives. As the inferno of the Anti-Corruption Act sweeps across Japan, the press, though quick to praise the purification of society, have begun to succumb to creeping doubt. No one is safe from Kaya and his ideological club. Brute force and political warfare now serves to keep both the people and the government accountable and properly intimidated.\n\nThe purges have not been taken lying down, however, and this form of political violence has raised concerns within Kaya's own party.

With Kaya's premiership hinged on him, there was even a moment where Shiina envisioned himself as the one making the calls, and to him, Kaya has become more of a puppet than the man he owes allegiance to...\n\n"No." Kaya slammed his palm on the desk, emphasizing the finality of his decision.

It seemed it depended upon the whims of the police.\n\nJai-Li had bruises on her arms and legs when the police had used batons. Tear gas deployment was regular. A few were beaten worse. A few times she'd see men in different uniforms working or advising the police officers, some said they were Kenpeitai or the Tokkō, but she didn't know for sure. Despite it, they kept coming back, day after day. They didn't have another choice.\n\nThe Yasuda Crisis had destroyed and ruined many of them, and they weren't even asking for anything unreasonable. They just wanted help. Relief. They were part of the Empire, were they not? Why should they not get some help? Some of those with them were protesting Japanese rule of Taiwan itself - but she, and many others, were here just trying to get some help.\n\nRumors traveled among them, and there were some saying that Korea was also experiencing a protest wave, though was being met with a similar response. She supposed it could be worse - they could have sent in the military to break it up. The police weren't pleasant, and they weren't shy about throwing fists and slurs at anyone who came too close - but they didn't feel their lives were in danger.\n\nBut as the days went on, more of them lost hope that anything would change.

The Higher Education Regulation Act was alive, breathing, with all its bells and whistles glimmering with sparkling approval\n\nFinally, he closed the door behind him, the thunder winding down into a distant whine as he stepped forward, his polished boots clattering across the floors which bore the same illustrious shine. In this shine Kaya saw his future, the future which he had fought tooth and nail to secure, his ascent guaranteed within the walls of the diet and the greater of Japanese society as a whole.\n\nThis was the greatest test which his government had to weather, and he had passed. Beyond this triumph all he could envision was the spotlight shining down upon him and the associates which had remained so faithful in their tireless task to cement his will upon Japan.\n\nTurning, he now reached out to grasp the handle of the door before him, exhaling deeply as he felt the stress which had consumed him flutter from between his lips."

Sneering, the only expression that had crossed his face in the entirety of the session in which his bill had single handedly been the focus of, Kaya felt the assured future in which he had thrown his dice upon fade into but a distant glimmer in the reflection of Ikeda's pearly teeth.\n\nSlighted, he rose, gesturing to the men who had entered alongside him to remain in their seats, hand trembling with a subdued passion before resting back into his usual graceful posture. Stepping forward, the triumph in his stride noticeable absent, the gentleman squeezed from his section of the room, moving with abstract purpose toward the doors which swung outward into the halls of the grandiose Diet building that he believed would house his greatest success to date. Instead, all he found, between the judgemental stares of his opposition and the obnoxious shuffling of the press closing in behind him as he fled, was a deep residual disappointment building like a heavy weight in his stomach.\n\nAnd yet as he moved from the halls of his defeat onward towards the exit of the chamber in which his confidence was shattered, the polished floors showed back his own grimace toward him.

The only thing that kept his attention was the rhythmic drumming of Fukuda's fingers, the incessant tapping worming its way into his busy mind as he struggled further to assess the situation his gamble had so unceremoniously cast him into.\n\nAcross him sat two men, men who had warned him that his compromises with the Hardliners would be nothing but a frivolous expenditure of much needed political capital, their eyes flicking upward to face the Prime Minister's distraught expression.\n\nWords did not float between the Prime Minister and his associates, not words in the verbal sense anyway. Within Kaya's eyes was something that had not been present before: regret. He could only blame himself, not those who surrounded him, for the death of the Higher Education Regulation Act.

The Hardliners had reached too far, and for this Kaya had elected that they would be taking the fall for what could have been a failure entirely his own.\n\nThe Higher Education Act had failed, but the rejection of his bill would not be attached to Kaya's reputation, but that of the faction that had sought to worm its way into a comfortable position beside him. Like a parasite they had tried to cling to his cabinet, and like a parasite Kaya and his government had seen fit to see them dealt with. Their influence would wane, and his would only take a slight dent at the end of it all.\n\nKaya wondered if he would soon see steam pouring from Shiina's ears, musing silently to himself as he basked in the success of his plan. However, his thoughts would soon turn to the next issue at hand, the press and their damned ungrateful prodding. He had bent to the demands for a free vote, he had submitted to their morality, and even yet they questioned the sincerity of his actions.

Kaya knew what Eizo had come here to ask, and he knew what his answer would be: no deliberation was needed to assess that the army and the navy's ambitions needed to be placated with another carrot, on a fresh stick.\n\n"Grant them an expansion of the mining efforts in Korea. Give them enough, but not all of it. We still need something to bait them if they elect to reach deeper into my pockets," Kaya curtly responded, a venomous distaste in his tone as he snatched the battered receiver from its place upon his desk, crudely interrupting Eizo with his order.

Please, before you weep my departure from the tangible world, heed my words and take a moment to think about it as I have always asked you to. Since the passing of the act, 23 professors at our university have been removed from their position. Needless to say, their views were incompatible with the path of our administration. They did nothing but follow the pursuit of academic freedom. Yet, their acts out of intellectual curiosity and justice for the masses earned them cold, unforgiving fists from the Home Ministry.\n\nA friend of mine and maybe yours, Professor Kouyama Iwao, was one of those who lost their tenure. He was the sole breadwinner of his family and a firm believer of Asian Co-Prosperity through equality and fraternity between nations. Yet, not only did he lose his job, he also received a hefty fine from Tokko for "unpatriotic acts". In what world would a just, kind man like him suffer like this? In what world could a man be punished just for siding with good? In what world would calling for fraternity between peoples of Asia be a crime? While there is little I can do in the tangible world, I hereby leave my worldly inheritance to his family, and I sincerely plead to you all to assist innocent scholars like him if it isn't a burden.\n\nAs a humble student of Zen Buddhism, I know well enough that ending my life prematurely is in no agreement with Buddha's teaching, and I strongly advise you against pursuing my path. I believe, however, that my death can be of benefit to you as a message and a plea to our government. If my failure to achieve nirvana can bring forth an era of academic freedom and equality among people of the Sphere, then so be it. "

 japkaya_tree_one.49.desc: "The protest against the Higher Education Act remains heated as of today. This week had been bloody; people around the Empire are losing their loved ones to the hands of the Police, Tokko, and Kenpeitai.\n\nPassed last week, this highly controversial law led to mass terminations and funding shortfalls across the Imperial University System, particularly in the social sciences. With the suicide of Professor Nishitani Keiji of Kyoto Imperial University in protest, nationwide student riots were ignited to the extent of no control. At this fateful moment, PM Kaya ordered an all-out suppression by force followed by mass prosecution, killing 105, injuring 4810, and convicting 5114. One attorney who defended a group of students reported, "I was not permitted to present my defense; it took the judge 5 minutes to sentence 20 students to 8 months in prison."\n\nNever has this nation seen brutal suppression against its populace like this, and needless to say, Kaya's action was met with attacks from all sides, including diet members who initially supported the bill. Even conservatives led by Rep. Ikeda Masanosuke and reformists led by Rep. Takagi Soukichi put aside their differences, making a joint announcement that any bill submitted by Kaya would not and never would gain their support. Following this was another statement, co-signed by 25 prefectural governors, declaring that local law enforcement would not comply with any arrest order associated with the Act.\n\nFacing this unprecedented opposition against the government, PM Kaya and his cabinet insisted that the act is a success. The government further ordered to replace all prefectural governors and police commissioners who refused to cooperate, also unseen in the history of the Empire. Despite the government's bold move, however, it would take a miracle for the Technocrats to regain their footing in the Diet, with the future of Kaya's premiership largely uncertain."

Japan's economy was in ruins, and while Kaya would be the one to rebuild it, he could feel the daggers pointed at his back. Nearly everyone in the Diet was aiming for Kyaya's throne, and having side-lined Kishi and Shiina, not even Kaya's own faction could be expected to remain loyal forever.\n\nKaya needed results, and he needed them fast, which is why he had turned to the two men standing before him. Fukuda Takeo and Aoki Kazuo, both men who planned to unite the Diet with proposals emphasizing the role of the private economy in the wake of the Zaibatsus' past domination. Kaya had to admit, their backgrounds as Ministry of Finance bureaucrats muzzled during the war showed in their proposals. They echoed the ideas of the 1920s and early 30s. However, these were Kaya's best minds on the subject, and their proposals were well-developed. Kaya looked up at the two men and asked, "These proposals are strong, do you have any other resources that we can turn to?"\n\nAoki was the first to respond, "The Cabinet Planning Board and Home Ministry still have many of their predecessors' documents for us to refer to," he paused briefly, "However, many of the actual specifics still need to be worked out," he added with an acidic tone. Fukuda nodded in agreement.\n\nKaya sighed as he looked back to the proposals. Even though their details were somewhat vague, they were all they had. In the wake of the tremendous failures of Yasuda and the 40s establishment, these proposals might just be the solution to Japan's problems. They certainly couldn't hurt Kaya's position in any significant manner not already in effect."

The proposals produced by the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet Planning Board were far more detailed, and it was a miracle such detail had been produced in such little time, but there was an issue. There were two incompatible proposals sitting in front of Kaya. Kaya addressed the two men standing in front of him, "So as I understand it, you need me to resolve your dispute in strategy," the two men nodded. Kaya looked at Aoki and said, "The first, Aoki. Explain your proposal."\n\n"Thank you, Prime Minister. My proposal is simple: A state-led program for economic recovery and social organization. It's built upon the well-founded principles of bureaucratic planning and stability that lead our nation to prosperity in the past. My proposal will also help us gain the support of the more conservative members of the Diet."\n\nFukuda quickly cut in, "Those principles have clearly failed us once, let's not give them a second chance," he turned to Kaya, who motioned for him to continue, "Yasuda has granted us an opportunity to rebuild Japan's economy from the ground up, we should seize that opportunity. An expansive investment budget and Keynesian spending will revitalize Japan's economy and help fortify it against any future crisis such as this one. Clearly-"\n\nAoki interrupted him, "Like anyone would support such a proposal! We have to be realistic here-" the two quickly devolved into arguing, a situation Kaya had become all too familiar with over the past few days. Kaya turned back to the proposals.

The state-led economic recovery plan and social organization. I've accepted it, and need you to bring the Home Ministry on board."\n\n"Thank you, Prime Minister. I've already contacted a few of my old associates to get things started. There's no need to worry," replied Aoki.\n\nAoki continued, "I can get the program most of the support it needs, all that's left would be for you to tell the conservatives of the plan. They'll give our position more stability moving forward," Kaya nodded along with Aoki's suggestion. The man was experienced, and Kaya had made him Cabinet Secretary-General for a reason. After a few minor details were discussed, Aoki left the room to ensure the program was carried out as quickly as possible. Kaya looked over the proposal once more.

The receptionist quickly guided him to a quiet table of the restaurant, with an excellent view of Tokyo's skyline. The table possessed only two chairs, one of which was occupied by Kaya himself. If Kaya had invited Fukuda here alone, then Fukuda was clearly trusted by the Prime Minister, a good sign for the events to come.\n\nAfter an exchange of greetings, Kaya cut straight to the point, "I have decided to back your proposal to revitalize Japan's economy. Tomorrow we will put together your proposed investment budget."\n\n"Thank you for this opportunity, Prime Minister. I assure you that you've made the right choice," replied Fukuda. He was glad to hear Kaya agreed that the Japanese economy needed to be revitalized under its own power.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Kaya spoke again, "You should keep in mind that you'll need to keep the other factions of the Yokusankai in line."\n\nFukuda was quick to reply, "Of course, Prime Minister. I'll begin contacting faction leaders as soon as possible."\n\n"You'll also need to keep Aoki informed. His proposal may have been rejected, but he's still Cabinet Secretary-General, and his input should not be ignored," added Kaya. Fukuda nodded in response. Kaya was putting a lot of trust in Fukuda, he needed to play this smart or he could end up sinking both of their careers. Finally, Fukuda spoke."

"With the utmost respect, Kaya-" \n\nThe senior politician was interrupted by Satō Eisaku, the other representative of the conservative faction. "Elaborate, please."\n\n"I can promise you two - and your colleagues - that my ministers and I do not intend to upheave Japan's institutions and political system.

You can trust me to stay the course - but to put a far more able pair of hands on the ship of state. But I need your faction's backing for that to go smoothly."\n\nThe Prime Minister looked sharply at Hatoyama, the elder statesman. A product of the same young Japan, struggling to define itself, as himself, though a parliamentarian through and through where Kaya had always been a child of the bureaucracy. Perhaps it was that old feud of parties and civil service before the war which wrought his skepticism.\n\nIt was Satō - the odd one out - who spoke. "I think we can work with you." Perhaps his time in the Ministry of Railways had shaped him well, or it was simply his and Hatoyama's different characters. It mattered not. \n\n"That is, provided we accept the policies you intend to introduce," Hatoyama interjected quickly.\n\nKaya smiled. "Mr. Aoki will give you the full details, I'm sure.""

A true magnum opus for an economist and technocrat, contained within its nine hundred pages was the government's vast recovery program - public works, rural welfare, expanded social programs, state subsidies, the whole lot. It was the tried and true Keynesian solution to the woes of the Economic Wars: deficit spending to inject demand.\n\nThe only issue with deficit spending, of course, is that it creates deficits. The proposal was thorough with how much funding each program was expected to require, and the tallied numbers weren't pretty: many billions of yen of expenditure which would send the budget balance into perhaps not a nosedive, but certainly a sharp descent.\n\n"The Finance Ministry is upset," Aoki remarked. "The old bureaucrats among them say the recovery plan and its spending would cause issues with debt and worsen our reputation."\n\n"Our reputation's as bad as it can get already, and it'll stay that way until we can deliver results and recover from Yasuda's downfall," Fukuda responded. "I'm not a fan of the deficits either, but they're necessary to move on - a growing pain, if you will."\n\nThe two looked to Kaya, who sighed. "All eyes are on us - simultaneously scrutinizing and sizing us up and looking for leadership and guidance. That's our current system. We must spend, if only to show our confidence in the economy, lest everyone else loses confidence and stops spending - a far worse outcome.""

There were two Japans, one in the streets and one in the fields, the latter trailing behind the former in almost every respect imaginable.\n\n"It's simple," said Fukuda. "We have allowed ourselves to become agriculturally dependent on Southeast Asia for far too long, an unstable place at the best of times. On top of that, we can't continue sending our excess rural population to Manchuria. The land's not as empty as it used to be, and their government's not what it used to be. We are forced then, to invest, to modernise, to make Japanese soil produce what is expected of a global power, and give our farmers what they are due. And the only way to do that, is by stepping on the toes of the landlords who got us into this mess."\n\nKaya sighed. "I don't disagree with you in principle, but we have to pass a bill here, through both houses. I don't need to tell you how much land the average peer holds, and they're not going to vote for something they see as a challenge to themselves. If we can't present this as a boon to landlord and tenant alike, we will achieve nothing. And we simply can't let that happen."\n\n"But this will just be another stopgap, we can't just keep kicking the can-" Fukuda stopped himself. "No, you're right. But all the same, we can't just give landowners money and equipment and pray it'll be put to productive use. Any bill we draft here is going to have to be very precise, and very carefully worded.

He was going to be rich, then he could expand his holdings, so much more to do, so much more.\n\nStill, he thought, shaking himself out of his giddy frenzy, government allowances didn't grow on trees. The new resources he had been provided with would have to be allocated very carefully indeed. The tenants he could trust, naturally, would be getting first pick of Ozawa's fancy new toys.

No matter how hard he and his wife worked in the fields, no matter how much they harvested, his landlord always took every coin from his pocket. And whenever Oda trekked up to the landlord's big house to complain about his broken tools and the lack of seeds, the man had the gall to complain about the government. It wasn't him stealing Oda's money and doing little in return, the landlord whined in his fine clothing, but the government. Then he cried about some bill and the Diet and reminded Oda he was behind on his rent.\n\nThere were days when Oda and his wife Hina wondered if life could have been better. Maybe, they muttered while eating rice, they could have moved to Manchuria while they still had the chance. Maybe they could have ignored the stories about bandits and poor soil and made a life for themselves as the first settlers of a new territory. Whatever the hardships, at least it would be without bastard landlords.\n\nBut those were just dreams. He did not live in a world where he could stop being a tenant farmer. He lived in one of constant toil, interrupted only by regular visits from the local policeman. The visits seemed to be more frequent month after month. Perhaps, it was a sign of worry, an expression of fear by a government that could not help its people, that could not make basic changes to help people like him.\n\nWhatever the reason, Oda said nothing as the officers rooted through his small house without asking.

Fukuda, something to answer?"\n\n"As a matter of fact, I do," calmly retorted the Minister of Finance. "While I do understand the concerns of the opposition, I have to say that I find them to be mostly unfounded. Indeed, the Yokusankai still holds sway over the rural areas, and we only need to be wary of problems in urban centers, such as strikes or protests. However, this shouldn't be too much of a problem, as we have put in place many preventive measures to avoid this, such as, of course, the Light Industrial Development Act."\n\nAs Fukuda continued talking, Kaya observed with satisfaction the situation from the Technocrats' bench. The young New Bureaucrat sure had some political acumen, he thought: staying ahead of the public, and assuaging their fears before they really materialized, was a crucial skill to have in such a cutthroat world as politics. Now, he only needed to make good on his promises, and pass the bill into law: this hopefully wouldn't prove too much to handle for the astute parliamentarian, however.\n\n"Thank you, Fukuda." resumed Aoki, who seemed to have gotten slightly distracted as Fukuda's speech continued on. Who could blame him, honestly? The Diet sometimes was a tiring place. "Now, does anyone have other questions?""

The pile of papers on his desk was just the applicants from a section of his city of Nagoya; there must have been hundreds of pencil-pushers like him across the country whose sole task was to process these applications.\n\nDespite the aching in his hand, he felt rather upbeat about the volume of applications: undoubtedly the tax relief would save many local businesses from collapsing or being cannibalized by larger corporations. He had heard of and seen for himself the phenomenon of towns, cities, and entire prefectures being left behind to languish in economic stagnation as industries failed and fled the region, leaving the area to be a shadow of its former self. Hinata was glad such a fate might not yet reach Nagoya.\n\nLooking outside the window, Hinata could see a city, once moribund, slowly roaring back to life. The streets were no longer filled with beggars but bustling with commuters and families; the factories' smokestacks bellowed dark smoke once more - the fruits of the fire of industry. The skies were painted gray with storm clouds and smog; yet, it was a city more vibrant and colorful than he had seen in several years. Nagoya - and the rest of Japan - was climbing out of the pit of recession, at long last, into a shaky normalcy."

 japkaya_tree_two.19.desc:0 "History repeats itself, and leaves those who fail to learn in its dust. Nearly forty years ago, the Great Depression ravaged Japan's economy, leaving mass poverty and unemployment in its wake; the lethargic and ham-fisted response of partisan kleptocrats, in conjunction with petty political gridlock impeding the government when they did attempt to respond, taught a valuable lesson to all, but especially to the technocrats and bureaucrats. A lesson of why party politics inexorably leads to incompetence and failure, of why Japan needs the guiding hand of the state - of the bureaucracy - to function perfectly.\n\nYet, in a painfully ironic twist, the House of Representatives has blocked Kaya's and the New Bureaucrats' Light Industrial Development Bill. The squabbling factions of the Yokusankai - little better than the Minseitō and Seiyūkai of the interwar period - have cited reasons ranging from fiscal concerns to lack of support for larger corporations for voting against the bill. They are myopic fools, seeing not the bigger picture of the urgent need for our recovery program at any cost, blinded by ignorance at best and corruption at worst.\n\nRegardless of our grievances with the Diet, the bill's failure is more or less final. We must move on, and only glance back in shame as we see a Japan in decay, her cities stagnant with hundreds of thousands of jobseekers all while the businesses who have weathered the storm rush to cannibalize the unfortunate in a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions. Will the economy move on and right itself, eventually? Yes, but only at the avoidable cost of tens of thousands of livelihoods and the financial and social pain of a rectification by blood and corporate warfare."

Then, as if by clockwork, Japan whirred to life.\n\nFrom the Imperial Universities emerged dozens of young graduates dressed in fine suits. They organized themselves into neat, little lines and marched mechanically toward the Diet, toward the Prime Minister's office.\n\nOne by one, they accepted new offices, new posts. With their ascension, old networks fell away. The disorganized policymaking of the old order became replaced with new, bloodless systems that valued evidence more than emotion, metrics over abstractions. All those unnecessary components in the machine-those hardliners, junior lawmakers, and Manchukuo-raised national defense state advocates-found themselves pushed away, isolated from the core. Their outrage went unheard beneath the shifting of cogs and gears.\n\nThe machine's chugging continued. Lights turned on. Roadways filled. Workers returned to their factories and CEOs returned to their high towers. The Japanese economy was back-still run by a few men and companies-but there was a certain comfort in that stability. People could learn the patterns and signals and come to master them. Perhaps it did not matter that nothing had changed, that reformers still muttered about half-measures and half-freedoms, so long as the people had food, homes, and a steady income.\n\nSo long as the machine continued to whir, all would be well. Kaya and his allies would continue pulling the levers of power to ensure all moved along quickly and efficiently. They would make Japan a leader among nations, its bureaucrats forcing it boldly into the future.\n\nNo one would stop it. No one could even try."

We simply can't afford to bail out the zaibatsus unconditionally. They have a place in Japanese society, a very specific place, and we cannot allow them to overstep it."\n\n"On the contrary, it is precisely because Yasuda knew their place that they went down the path to destruction," said Fukuda. "Everything went through them and they died for it, but every aspect of the government, the armed forces, and yes, private enterprise, was involved. In all of their dirty dealings, Yasuda did exactly what previous governments told them to. Unless we give them a degree of independence, we're allowing them to be the funnel for state corruption, and all that was will be again, but with the new bankers instead of Yasuda. Not to mention what people like Kishi could use them for."\n\n"That may be the case," said Kaya, "but we can't change the future. We can only change the present. And right now we need to make some very important changes, ones we won't have a shot at unless we can maintain some level of leverage over the zaibatsus. It's us, the hardliners, or chaos they might not survive, and out of those three, we are clearly their best option. For now, we can afford to squeeze them, and we have no other choice.

What requires such privacy?"\n\nFukuda looked up from his combing through the documents, and replied, "You were right. After the Tax Bureau was informed to accelerate their audits of the surviving Zaibatsus, we discovered all of them had offshore dealings. Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, all of them are using subsidiaries of Yasuda to offshore their revenues and dodge Japanese taxes," Kaya and Aoki glanced at each other. If what Fukuda said was true, this was a major revelation, and a dangerous one.\n\nAoki was quick to ask, "So where was all that potential tax revenue sent?"\n\nFukuda quickly responded, "It all went straight into the executives' pockets... and the Navy."\n\nKaya rubbed his forehead, muttering, "This is perfect for Kishi." \n\nThe others reluctantly nodded. The hardliners had repeatedly claimed that the Zaibatsus were more trouble than they were worth, and these audits would only embolden them.

Kaya listened to Kishi speak on the other end before continuing. "Yes, we've agreed to pressure the Zaibatsus into compliance using the Ministry of Commerce and public opinion. Simply put, I need your connections in case the Zaibatsus attempt anything." \n\nThe Zaibatsus could make life very difficult for him, and Kishi had the connections to avoid such a mess.\n\nKaya could hear the smile on Kishi's face as he spoke. "Very well. What's your price?" \n\nKaya swallowed as he heard Kishi's demands, but ultimately replied affirmatively. "Fine. One of your men will lead the initiative," Kaya paused to hear Kishi's response, "Yes. The rest of your demands as well. Is that all?" Kaya felt a small pit in his stomach begin to form.

They had enough of the Diet convinced, and the ramifications of failing to pass this key legislation were major. \n\n Kaya's supporters whispered in the halls, discussing which parts of the bill might've been too much or which Zaibatsus contributed the most to the fearmongering. Most, however, assigned blame to Kaya for failing to force the bill forward. Only a few of Kaya's allies were brave enough to call for his resignation due to his supposed incompetence. Kishi was more moderate in his criticism, offering only a few words of disappointment.

Kaya didn't care much about Kishi's words because he had something far worse to contend with. \n\n The public had reacted to the bill's failure with shock and outrage.

Except for those fucking... pieces of underwear. I swear, my genitals have actually shrunk during my time here." He groaned, and grinned at Ogawa. "But I have finally been liberated. My genitals can roam free once again."\n\nOgawa had to admit: the new boots felt good. He could feel all five toes, and he could wriggle them one by one. The socks were not the scratchy pieces of fabric he had become so accustomed to, but soft pieces of wool that actually comforted his feet from the boots, rather than adding to the misery of Ogawa's old shitty boots.\n\n"Marching practice." Kane groaned. Ogawa could hear the siren too. But perhaps with the new boots it would not be so bad. "Come on, let's go. We don't want to keep Officer Hayao waiting."\n\nThe march went well. Very well. Ogawa led the group of jogging men down the course, smiling all the way. Each step felt like justice. Justice for his poor, purple, abused toes. When the men sat down for a break, the food was not pig slop, but carefully prepared pork and rice, topped with soy sauce, and all of it came in large proportions. And for once, it was warm.\n\nBreak ended with Ogawa leading the marching group again. He joined in with a smile as the men sung their way down the marching course.

It would not do to let them have the leg up on us."\n\n"I have little more to say than I already have, Prime Minister. You know my concerns about our allies' commitments to us. Modern weapons in the army will help us keep them in line. No modern weapons in the Army will do the opposite, and right now we have no modern weapons in the army."\n\n"You two raise concerns I have myself," Kaya remarked.\n\n"Not concerns.

It is the consensus of the Imperial Navy that such measures are nothing but bureaucratic red tapes that do no good, and true interservice coordination can only be improved by communication between the services free from extra interference by the civilian government. Earlier today, Minister Fuchida has expressed the Navy's willingness to work with the Army Chief of Staff, and he expects that this effort, on the Navy's own initiative and independent from the government's bill, will work out well.\n\nUnless the government consults the Imperial Navy in revising this bill, I shall respectfully decline to support the bill proposed by the government.""

Yesterday he was informed by the supply officer that the meat supply was running low; those idiots from the Guangdong supply station clearly miscalculated the ration for each solder. And now he is invited by those traitorous navy guys to dine on the ship? Kayaba thought to himself-- is this some kind of mockery? As he set his foot on the deck, he saw that on the mast, and for the first time during Yakumo's service, an army colonel's flag was hoisted. Seeing the flag in surprise and feeling a sense of weird warmness, Kayaba stepped into the bridge and made his way to the officer's dining room\n\nThe moment Kayaba stepped into the room, he was welcomed by a firm handshake by Captain Sakyo, commander of the Yakumo.\n\n"I'm so glad you came," said Sakyo, "here, try this curry. Our ship just won the fleet's curry-making contest; even Admiral Takagi loved our curry!"\n\nOverwhelmed by the friendliness of the captain, Kayaba nodded and had a spoonful of Yakumo's pride. Damn, it was the best curry he ever had, Kayaba thought, but he decided to keep his reserved posture in front of the captain. Those guys are from the rival service, after all.\n\n"Thank you for this delicacy, Captain Sakyo," Kayaba responded, "and what would be the reason that you invited me here today?"\n\nSakyo responded with a smile. "Colonel, I have noticed that the protein supply of your men is running low, so I'd like to ask if you'd permit us to share some of the beef and fish on our ship.

The hardliners of Kishi and Shiina remained a threat to them, and if Kaya was to secure his legacy...they needed to be dealt with.\n\nKaya finally spoke. "What is your suggestion?"\n\nFukuda took a few moments before he answered. One might wonder if the question was serious, but Kaya had decided he was to be his successor - and because of that, Fukuda knew that whatever he said would be given serious consideration. Thus, he did not rush his response. "I believe that Kishi and Shiina are too entrenched to remove directly. Not yet. Doing so would tip our hand too early. Their support base should be weakened first."\n\n"Which lies in the Ministry of Commerce," Kaya grunted. He'd identified that as an option as well. Still, if both Kishi and Shiina were able to be dealt with early, it might throw the hardliners into disarray. It was an option on the table - along with another, which was to simply do nothing at all.\n\nThe latter option was perhaps the most risky, as it would rely on the support of the hardliners, who were far from reliable.

Outside of that, their reasons are stability and unity," Kaya responded, though inherently understanding the limits of that reasoning.

Many were "promoted" to useless positions overseeing what was little more than busywork. Others were more direct reassignments, as after all, no one was foolish enough to challenge a direct demand from the Prime Minister.\n\nA select few were pressured to "retire" earlier than they had planned. Kaya made sure their replacements were quickly selected and staffed, before Kishi was be able to respond. By now Kishi and Shiina no doubt knew what was going on - but already too many had been removed for them to do anything about it.\n\nKaya took great satisfaction in imagining the look on their faces, as they realized he had outplayed them.

If he continued with his plans, he risked losing the government. If he didn't, then he effectively strengthened the hardliner position. He was in a bad situation that only had one true option - he would have to gamble. He had no choice.\n\n"Review the names," Kaya finally demanded, and Fukuda immediately whipped out a notepad and began writing. "Find the worst performers. The neoptists. The incompetent.

Never too quiet, never too loud. And when the YSK decided that Tōjō's hour had passed, Kon quietly but noticeably accepted a necessary change in direction, and all those which had followed. His constituencies got the money and projects they needed, and Kon continued to quietly do his job, cordial to all, but enemy nor ally to none. He was careful to never seek higher office. The benefits of a cabinet position were like those of amphetamines, a short, sharp rise, followed by a sudden, irreversible drop. Better a stable and placid position. If all Japanese politicians felt the same, the country would be a better, more honest place.\n\nOf course, it took far more effort to be prudent than most people realised. Kon made a point of avoiding factions wherever possible, but on some days, the floor of the Diet became that of a casino, one where only betting customers could remain. Today was one of those.

"It is the express opinion of this group of peers that the proposed ministerial restructuring by the Prime Minister is not in the interests of Japan nor His Majesty. It is highly unlikely that such legislation would achieve its supposed aims of improving efficiency and tackling corruption, and is instead a transparent attack against the Prime Minister's political opponents. In accordance with the preservation of parliamentary values, we cannot accept the proposed bill at this time."\n\nKishi put down the letter. "Given such a hostile reception by the Diet's other half, I do not believe it is in the interests of the House of Representatives to continue discussing this matter." He and his colleagues stood, and promptly left the chamber. Most of the remaining members followed afterwards, leaving a stunned Kaya and his allies."

 japkaya_tree_two.57.desc:0 ""Another cup?" asked Fukuda, tilting the bottle of sake towards Kaya, who politely declined. More than one at this hour and this age and he'd be off to bed. Besides, now was not the time for any serious celebration. A battle had been won, but the war was far from decided. It was all well and good to reorganise the ministries, but as long as Kishi and Shiina remained in positions of prominence, no permanent gains could be made.\n\n"We need to press our advantage," said Fukuda. "The pieces are in place now, so we need to move against Kishi without delay. As long as that relic of the thirties stands in our way, we will still be resisted at every turn, bureaucratic restructuring or no."\n\n"Don't you think that's a bit too hasty?" asked Kaya. "We've been lucky even making it this far. If we go full steam ahead against Kishi, we run a serious risk of overplaying our hand. Shiina's a much easier target. Less politically experienced, less connected without Kishi, and if we remove him from the picture, who will Kishi have to succeed him?"\n\n"Respectfully, I disagree." said Fukuda. "Both men are united against us, so for our purposes, Shiina's connections are Kishi's connections. Going after Shiina will just give the hardliners time and cause to regain their strength, and take us down. The only surefire way to save our movement is to cut off the head of the snake while we have the upper hand. We were always taking a risk when we set along this path, and at this crucial moment, we cannot allow for an overabundance of caution."\n\nKaya paused to think about this for a moment, and then spoke."

 japkaya_tree_two.58.desc:0 ""Between Kishi and Shiina, Shiina was the weaker link, and by dealing with him first, Kaya believed that the largest obstacle towards securing Fukuda's succession would be removed. Shiina had been willing to meet, and while their initial conversations were pleasant, Kaya got to the point.\n\n"I have decided to select Fukuda as the one to take my place," he said. "I understand your own ambition, but I believe he is best-suited to handle the needs of the country."\n\nMuch of this was an act; the culmination of weeks of political maneuvering. Kaya carefully watched Shiina's reaction. Had things been different, it was possible it would have been him, and not Fukuda, who would have risen to take his place. Shiina knew that, which was why Kaya was expecting a reaction.\n\nTo his surprise, there wasn't one.\n\n"I suppose this was inevitable," Shiina finally mused. "Fukuda was always the favorite. The writing was on the wall, perhaps I simply chose not to read it. Your point is made, Prime Minister."\n\n"It is much appreciated," Kaya said warily. "I'm glad you agree."\n\n"Indeed," Shiina said in a strange voice. "It is good to have clarity on these matters."\n\nThe conversation continued a little longer, and turned to different matters. Kaya was surprised by how little resistance Shiina put up. Suspiciously little resistance. As much as he would like to believe that it was as simple as that, he was skeptical. However, there was nothing more he could do right now. If Shiina was genuine or not, it would be proven - sooner or later. One thing, however, was very clear to him.""

 japkaya_tree_two.59.desc:0 "Kishi Nobusuke was a dangerous, influential, and powerful man - but also one who would take a meeting. Shiina was important, but it was ultimately Kishi who was the power behind the hardliners, and if any change was to happen, it would be by dealing with the head of the snake directly.\n\nTheir conversation started politely enough, but Kaya did not like to waste time, and neither did Kishi. Both of them knew what they were here for. "I intend for Fukuda to take my place and lead the technocrats," Kaya finally said. "It is not final, as I wished your consultation, as a valued member of our coalition."\n\nIt was a lie, intended to appeal to ego, though one that Kishi did not seem especially flattered by. He chuckled dryly. "Now you ask for my consultation? Rather strange, as you did not ask my 'consultation' before you purged the ministries."\n\n"An unrelated matter," Kaya retorted. "That was within my purview as the Prime Minister of Japan. I do not need to consult you on matters that do not relate to the technocrats." A deflection, and one Kishi would see through, but keeping up the narrative remained important.\n\n"I am not naive, Okinori," Kishi dismissed in an almost bored voice, his eyes turning almost disappointed. "But if you wish to give excuses, then so be it. What will be your next excuse, Prime Minister? By what argument will I be persuaded to support your candidate?"\n\nNow would be the most crucial moment, one which would need to be chosen carefully, based on the strength of the hardliners, his relationship with them, and his knowledge of the man himself. There would only be one chance to convince Kishi - he had to make sure he chose the correct argument."
 japkaya_tree_two.59.a:0 "Logic - Convince Kishi of the superiority of the New Bureaucratic Platform."

 japkaya_tree_two.60.desc:0 ""Your efforts have failed. Do not continue this."\n\nThe words from Kishi were delivered in a cold monotone over the phone line. Kishi had deliberately ignored him for days after trying to reach him - and was now calling on his terms, on his own time, to send a clear message.\n\nThe rumors had been circulating and amplifying for days now. Kaya could sense the mood change when he walked in the Diet and capital. He knew what the rumors were saying. Rumors that he had lost his mind, that he was incompetent, that he and Fukuda were worse dictators than Tōjō. It mattered not that it was false.\n\nWhat mattered was what it was working against him. The support for the hardliners was growing every day, and he'd seen his support in the technocrats slip rapidly. It hadn't taken long to figure out that Kishi was behind this, using his money and influence to badly wound him, even if it risked the stability of the government. He'd tried to reach Kishi to talk this out, but there'd only been silence. Until now. And now, Kishi was conveying one stark message: Knock it off.\n\n"If you wish to support Fukuda," Kishi continued. "That is your prerogative. You will not make final decisions on your own. You will not sideline us simply because we disagree on the best candidate. We must be a unified party, one respectful of our ideologically differences. Am I making myself clear, Prime Minister?"\n\nHe was making it all too clear. For anything to happen, Kaya would need to work with the hardliners, not against them. It was over. He had lost. Kaya did not want to admit defeat, but knew that Kishi would accept nothing less than him saying it. He slumped in his chair, and was glad Kishi could not see his posture of defeat as he answered."

He knew the ins and outs of every policy debate that had taken place, and had very deliberately chosen his side. His motivations might not be purely ideological, but even if it was influence and power, Kaya knew he wasn't offering Kishi anything near what Kishi enjoyed leading the hardliners.\n\nKishi seemed chronically disinterested and bored, merely content to listen in silence as Kaya tried making many of the arguments showing the superiority of the New Bureaucratic platform - all arguments Kishi had likely heard before. Even Kaya's own voice was devoid of passion the longer he talked, once he saw that Kishi was just waiting for it to finish.\n\nAt a break in the conversation, Kishi leaned back, his face unimpressed and eyes filled with a dismissive contempt. "You are saying little I have not already heard before. I have considered everything you have just said, and found it lacking. Such debates take place daily, and I have chosen my side. Until now, you have remained ambivalent, but I see where you fall now."\n\nHe glanced at a nearby clock and stood. "This was an enlightening discussion, Prime Minister, but we both have other important business to attend to. I will consider what you have to say." Without another word, he left, leaving the Prime Minister alone. Kaya was not hopeful of what would come next. Kishi might say he would consider what he'd said, but Kaya knew the truth."

One did not become good at politics without some skill in deception. It helped that he was also unafraid to use his own persona and position to intimidate, influence, and insinuate as needed, especially if he was playing a weaker hand.\n\nUnfortunately, Kishi was just as good as he was. He was just as experienced, just as knowledgeable, and more importantly, was not intimidated by the fact that Kaya was Prime Minister. Kishi knew his position was precarious, and that the leverage Kaya held was not absolute. Kishi would not be intimidated by anything less than absolute proof his position was untenable.\n\nProof that Kaya simply didn't have.\n\n"Do not speak to me as if I am a child," Kishi interrupted in a tired voice, stopping Kaya from continuing his push that the hardliners were the weaker party. "If what you say is true, we would not be speaking right now. You need my support if you wish to succeed. Do not insult me by pretending I do not speak for many of your peers. It is beneath you."\n\nKaya wasn't certain how to respond, because he knew that Kishi was right - and Kishi knew it. Kishi didn't have the influence to control the technocrats - but he could absolutely make trouble if he wished, and Kaya simply could not ignore that. Every insinuation and veiled threat fell flat, as Kishi saw through his bluff - and outright called it.\n\nKishi apparently decided that the conversation was over, and abruptly stood. "I trust my point is made, Prime Minister," he said coldly. "It is a shame it had to end this way." With nothing more to say, he turned and left, leaving a defeated Kaya alone, uncertain what would come next."

In a sense, they were relics, each who were invested in who would come after them. It was perhaps something both men could relate to.\n\nUnfortunately, Kishi seemed unconvinced.\n\nKaya spoke at length, of the past, of legacies, all with an underlying point that he knew Kishi was smart enough to grasp. Yet he had been around Kishi long enough to tell when the man was listening - or humoring the speaker. Kaya's voice slowed, and he finally ceased speaking.\n\nKishi appraised him. "Poetic words, Okinori. Unfortunate that you believe nothing of what you say."\n\nKaya blinked. "Do you believe I am lying, Nobusuke?"\n\n"I do not know, but your actions show me the truth," Kishi's tone was mellow and eyes unblinking. "You say it is time for men like us to move on, but if you believed that, you would not have taken the Prime Ministership. You would not be engaged in these games of power and influence. You would not be working to secure your own influence after you leave the scene."\n\nHe lifted a hand, to cut off a retort. "Perhaps you have changed, now that you sense victory. I understand. Politics can change the most immutable of people, such is its nature. But I have no reason to indulge you now. It is a valiant attempt, but I am afraid you will not sway me."\n\nKishi stood, deciding that the conversation was over. "Farewell, Prime Minister. May the best man succeed."

For Kaya, this was his endgame, where they would see who had the stronger hand. He was confident that his hand was the winning one - and was ready to bet on it.\n\nKishi to his credit, barely reacted to the threat that the Reform Bureaucrats were far weaker than Kaya's clique. "Bluffing does not suit you, Kaya," he said in a monotone. "You cannot afford to lose me. Both of us know that if I leave, then you will fail."\n\nNow or never. Kaya met his eyes, and his own voice was just as even. "Then do it. Threats only matter when one has the will to carry them out. One of us is bluffing, Kishi - but it is not me."\n\nThere was a long, pregnant silence in the room.\n\nHe could see Kishi thinking hard, even behind his inscrutable face. He was thinking of every possible way he could turn this to his advantage. Each scenario running through his mind. And Kaya knew he was coming to the same, inescapable conclusion: He couldn't win.\n\nKishi could follow through on his threat - and it would be a setback, but Kaya also knew that Kishi simply didn't have the numbers anymore to make his departure matter. If Kishi left, all the influence he had now would be gone. They would both lose if he walked out - but Kishi stood to lose far more.\n\nWhen Kishi spoke again, his voice was slow, reluctant - but accepting. "This infighting is not useful, for us or the technocrats." he pursed his lips. "Your point is made. I will remain neutral in the matter of your...succession." That was all Kaya needed to hear, and it meant that all support for Shiina would be withdrawn. He'd done it."

One that was summed up in his closing sentence: "It's time for us to step back."\n\nOver the past half hour, he'd changed the conversation to one that was reflective; introspective. Both of them were of a similar age; each of them had grown up in the same period. They'd experienced Japan when she was at its height, they had watched the Empire become a world power. They held the power of nations. Theirs was a perspective that few others could dream of.\n\nAnd both of them were old. Japan was entering into a new era now, and in a sense, they were relics. The world around them was changing in ways none of them could have imagined when they were boys, or even men.\n\nKishi had surprised him partway through, speaking a little on his own. His eyes had been unfocused while he'd spoken, as if speaking to himself. On some level, what he was saying resonated with Kishi. They were both old men, and their time was coming to an end.\n\n"Perhaps you are right," Kishi mused, almost to himself. "I do not think I will...fully let go, as you seem to wish. This is where I belong, but perhaps it is time for the younger men to enter and prove themselves." A thin, humorless smile crossed his face. "It is perhaps best if they learn not to rely on us."\n\n"We have shaped the world, both of us," Kaya said. "Few can say that. We have earned the right to rest, and the men behind us earn the right to make mistakes - and learn from them."\n\n"I suppose so," Kishi admitted. "I have my doubts about the man you wish to replace you, but perhaps he deserves a chance." Kaya nodded, and with those words, knew then that he had won."

"No others could have dealt with Kishi in such a way."\n\nNo, Kaya thought to himself, there likely would not have been any others. He would have preferred a more extensive celebration for today, one larger than just sharing a drink with his heir apparent. But that would come at a more formal time; a time when Fukuda ascended to properly take his place. It was certain now, and so for now, he was content.\n\nWith Kishi dealt with, Shiina had crumbled nearly the moment he had been confronted. With no one left to back him, he had privately conceded to his allies that he was abandoning his push to lead the technocrats. Kaya didn't know what excuse had been given, and it wasn't important. What was important was that he had won.\n\nKishi, Shiina, they had been neutralized. There was no one to stand in the way of Fukuda taking his place, and continuing the work that had been started. "I expect that Kishi's coming absence from politics will be taken poorly by some of the Peers," Kaya mused as he sipped his wine. "But they are few, and unimportant."\n\n"And there is little we can do outside the technocrats," Fukuda agreed. "This was last gasp of an old era. One which has finally been struck its death blow."\n\n"That it has," Kaya nodded. "The future is bright, my friend, and I will retire well, knowing my work will be continued.

"Both of you have been quite busy aside from your official duties, I hear. There's enough backbiting and gossip that I've even heard of it."\n\nFukuda and Shiina didn't respond, knowing well enough that making weak excuses would only worsen their position. Kaya regarded them both cooly, before nodding once and crushing his cigarette into a half-filled ashtray.\n\n"I've never hidden my intent to hand things over to a successor. But - " Kaya lowered his voice, steepling his hands. " - I intend to announce my successor at a time of my choosing. No matter who succeeds me, we must remain united.

"Long live Japan, Prime Minister Kaya."\n\nKaya winced; ever so slightly. Prime Minister of Japan. To the outside world, he was one of the most influential people on the planet. Inside...inside was an all too different matter. Japanese politics was like climbing a mountain. One false move and he was dead. It was at least a wise move to have someone to help you up.\n\n"Long live Japan, Nobusuke Kishi," Kaya clinked their glasses together. "Have you seen what Fukuda has been doing? The House of Peers has been more tortuous than usual - the bastards can smell blood in the water. Even when it's his."\n\n"Yes, it certainly is. Fukuda seems to want to die, kicking and screaming. Not literally of course. I'm not such a monster that I would murder anyone around me, eh?" Kishi chuckled to himself. "But still. He wants the entire YSK to know what we've done. So be it, I say. What can he do?"\n\nWhat could Fukuda do? Kaya wondered to himself. The Technocrats was a wounded animal. Not dead, yes. But wounded. The Technocrats would need help from the outside. From who, that remained to be seen. But one thing was for sure. They wouldn't offer their services for free.\n\n"I shouldn't be concerned, but w-"\n\n"Then don't be," Kishi interrupted. "Remember that we're still the ones in power here. I cannot promise that the next few months will be clear waters, but we have still won, Kaya. This is just maintenance."\n\nWith that, Kishi took a sip, closing his eyes to savour the flavor. Kaya followed. Japanese politicking was a lot like mountaineering﻿ indeed.

Rumors were just as much to mislead as much as they were to inform. The savvy could learn from rumors and deduce truth from misinformation, and the gullible were useful for the former.\n\nHowever, of late the rumors had all consolidated around a specific narrative. In the technocratic faction, there were those who had noticed that Shiina and Kishi's reform bureaucracy had gradually had their presence reduced. It was a subtle thing, and only the attentive noticed the gradual shunning of both men. No longer were many present in meetings, and Shiina - and subsequently Kishi - appeared to have lost sway with much of the faction.\n\nAnd if Shiina had fallen out of favor, to many that could mean only one thing: Fukuda Takeo had been the man Kaya had selected to be his successor.\n\nWhen that narrative had taken hold, more rumors swirled around. People who spoke about how Fukuda and Aoki had been seen often visiting the office of the Prime Minister, and taking more and more responsibility within the faction.\n\nLearning of this had triggered a number of reactions, overt and subtle throughout the YSK. Many of the technocrats, themselves cut out of the high-level politicking taking place, were simply watching and waiting. All of the other factions were not so restrained, scrambling and plotting in preparation for the inevitable announcement.\n\nIt remained to be seen if Fukuda would have the support to succeed Kaya - but the stage was set, and soon the future of Japan would be decided."

Due attention will be paid, of course, to preferred and trusted suppliers - for quality is the objective, not cost."\n\nShiina's address to the military's leadership, a sea of medals and uniforms in a pastel conference room, was met with polite applause - and Kaya cast a wary eye to see if there was any apprehension amongst them. But the generals and admirals knew well enough to keep their own feelings private - even if they appreciated the favor of the Prime Minister, and his successor.\n\nAt the same time, politics in Japan was a subtle and delicate art, no matter how brazen and grandstanding it appeared.\n\n"Of course, we respect the prerogatives of the peers of the Empire." Shiina was on his best behavior, being as congenial as possible before the members of the House of Peers. "We will continue to keep you informed of the government's deliberations, and we would appreciate your continued support.\n\nIt was the fourth 'luncheon' that week, and both Kaya and Shiina were too busy to eat any of the food the Peers were so deliciously devouring.

Ikeda and Takagi were studiously, scrupulously polite - smiling, but without a hint of warmth or sincerity. Their factions joined them in measured applause - many of them frowning, even scowling. Shiina's program was anathema to both groups - the reformists for obvious reasons, the conservatives for having been left out to dry.\n\nThe Kidoites? They were more animated, chatting amongst themselves as they acclaimed Shiina's proposal - no doubt strategizing about how to present the Five-Year Plan to the House of Peers. He would have to have a word with them, Kaya mused.\n\nThe loudest applause and widest smiles came from the technocrats, to nobody's surprise - and the hardliners were visibly cheered by Shiina's unspoken ascension to the height of political power. The New Bureaucrats amongst them had sour looks on their faces, perhaps imagining what might have been had it been Fukuda at the podium.\n\nBut their loyalty could be counted on, for they were nothing without Kaya - and soon, Shiina.\n\nHe couldn't say the rest about the rest of the YSK.

I can assure you, these plans do not interfere with the interests of yourself, this body, or the military."\n\nThe Prince inclined his head.

However, I understand that words are not enough - and  I will ensure that the budget also reflects the interests of this esteemed body."\n\nHe could see the Prince and the other aristocrats considering what he said, but many of them remained impassive.

"We have our limits, and we must acknowledge them unless we wish to one day collapse under our own weight. We can only manage and command so much before corruption, graft, and stagnation creeps in. Our overbearingness has strangled our economy, and if we wish to thrive - this must change."\n\nThere were some nods from the gathered crowd, and Fukuda pressed on. "Times have changed, and the United States has shown that we must adapt, or fall behind. We must focus our efforts on national defense and critical industries to achieve ascendance - and it should be done working with the economy, not controlling it."\n\nThis did seem to have made the impact he wanted.

Kaya's desk - usually heaped high with papers and reports - was empty, except for a single sheet with a single message: 'I hereby tender my resignation as Prime Minister.'\n\nThroughout the day, the paper had sat unattended, studiously ignored in favor of anything else. Tying up loose ends, micromanaging his policy staff, a few phone calls where a note would have sufficed: Kaya marveled at his own productivity, even if nothing of substance had been done.\n\nBut now, as Tokyo slumbered, Kaya was faced with this final act of state - and he still resisted, even as he held his hand-carved ivory seal in hand.\n\nPart of him wanted to get it over with - a growing part of him, in fact. His supporters and allies had been shocked when he'd succeeded Ino, warning him about the stress of the job - something he understood all too well now. But to step away was, inevitably, to surrender control, even if he had moved heaven and earth to secure his succession.\n\nKaya stared pensively at the ivory seal, remembering each time it had been used: to get the economy back onto its feet, to win over the stubborn generals and admirals, to prosecute the corrupt. To set the foundations of the Empire's intellectual future, and then its economic future, all per the state's design.\n\nAs per his design. As per - he hoped - his successor's design.\n\nWith a single, deliberate motion, Kaya pressed his seal to the document, the vermillion ink glowing warmly in the cold moonlight."

Kaya had a few of them delivered this morning, and as he skimmed the headlines, all of them were saying variations of the same thing: Fukuda Takeo had been selected by the Jushin to be the next Prime Minister of Japan, and had the support of the majority of the YSK.\n\nAgainst the odds and expectations of some of his critics, there would be a smooth transition of power now that Kaya could retire safely. The effects of the Yasuda Crisis would continue for years onward, but because of his own work, the worst was passed, and Japan was stable. His retirement would be in triumph, knowing that Japan was in good hands.\n\nA knock on his door interrupted his reading. Fukuda, most likely. "Congratulations, my friend," Kaya said as his successor entered. "You did it."\n\n"With your support," Fukuda answered with a smile. "There remains much work to be done, but I will work to ensure that the Empire is prepared.Our best days are to come." That they were, Kaya was certain. Domestically, internationally, he was certain that Fukuda would succeed.\n\n"I have something I've been saving," Kaya said, as he walked to his desk and pulled out a bottle of champagne. "Something saved for a celebration," he continued, pouring two small glasses. "I am glad to pass this burden to you."\n\n"One I humbly accept," Fukuda said, slightly inclining his head as he took the glass. "I will never forget what you did for me and the nation, and the people will not either." He lifted the glass slightly into the air. "To the Empire."\n\nKaya smiled, and lifted his own glass. A new sun was rising over Japan, and this time, he believed it would reign forever."

Already it seemed confirmed that the nomination had majority support in the YSK.\n\nAgainst expectations and fears, it seemed like there would be a smooth transition of power; the first since the Yasuda Crisis. Kaya had succeeded. He had successfully done what had been needed to stabilize Japan, and would be able to retire in well-earned triumph.\n\n"Congratulations," Kaya said, shaking Shiina's hand as he welcomed the future Prime Minister and Kishi inside, along with Kishi. "I know that both of you will do well."\n\n"We will strive to do our best," Shiina agreed. "It will not be an easy road - the path to get here was difficult, but it will pale in comparison to what comes next."\n\n"For certain," Kaya agreed. "But I trust you to build upon the foundation I laid."\n\n"Which shall be done," Kishi affirmed. "As Shiina says - correcting the road that our nation has been set upon will be difficult. There will be many who oppose our vision and decisions that will be made, even more than now."\n\n"But rest assured, Kaya," Shiina promised. "We will succeed. Japan will not fall to ruin on our watch."\n\nKaya believed them. They had demonstrated enough skill to at least maintain what he had built, and he felt confident leaving Japan in their hands. His leadership would be remembered as one of the turning points in the history of the Empire. Perhaps even one day, as the one who had saved it."

They had not decided on a candidate, and until they did, the Prime Minister would continue to serve at the Emperor's pleasure.\n\nThe news was a hammerblow to Kaya's ambitions, grinding any hope he might have held into dust. With every passing day, Kaya felt his body drain of life, processing the actions demanded of him while devoid of spirit. An empty nod here, a mechanical signature there, repeated from dawn to dusk until he was dismissed in favor of his enemies.\n\nSome of the backbenchers in the technocratic faction still believed, a faint hope or a wild wish that the Jushin truly were just taking their time, proceeding with due caution. Kaya knew otherwise, even if the rejection had been a wordless one. No words were necessary, when Kaya's last wish had been spurned so blatantly.\n\nEven as Kaya's body filled empty political space, his power ebbing away with every hour, the YSK's other factions rushed in to seize the moment. Takagi's reformists and Ikeda's conservatives had resumed their attacks on Kaya's technocrats in earnest, presenting themselves as alternatives to a faction fallen out of favor.\n\nJapan would go into the future without Kaya, on a different path than he had hoped - all while Kaya could do nothing but stamp papers, passing the time in sullen disappointment."

He'd not expected to find himself needing to have another one, nor had wanted to.\n\nBut he needed it now. A flame was lit, and the end of the cigarette burned.\n\nHe didn't know if it had been worth it, even now. The Higher Education Bill had passed, but the cost of it...it had been far and it had been deep. It had been important, no - necessary, for it to consolidate the bureaucracy under the government. It had been a fear that had driven it, perhaps against his better judgement. He'd sworn he'd not make the same mistakes Hirota did.\n\nHe'd succeeded, but it was a pyrrhic victory. One which had cost him the support of the public, many colleagues in the Diet, and even some in his own faction. It had been a hellstorm that he wasn't sure how to recover from. He picked up the phone, feeling the need to talk to a friend. "Prime Minister," Aoki said after picking up. "What can I do?"\n\nKaya was silent for a few moments. After all, what could be done now? "That is something I wish I knew."\n\nBrief silence at the other end of the line. "The Act passed. There are worse outcomes to gain."\n\nThat there were, but Kaya was less and less sure of his decision. He could not outright say it, but at the same time he could not hide his doubts. Not anymore."

 japkaya_tree_two.79.desc:0 "Kaya was not completely able, or admittedly, very willing to hide his feelings on how things were developing. Aoki seemed similarly dejected, even as both men avoided the reason they were meeting. They danced around it with meaningless small talk and inconsequential matters, neither willing to give voice to what they knew as true. It seemed, in some small way, that if they pretended otherwise, it would not come to pass.\n\nThey both knew better.\n\nBut in the end, Kaya had no fancy words or speeches to give, and his well of meaningless topics ran dry. Aoki spoke first. "Is there nothing that can be done?"\n\nA rhetorical question, one that both of them knew the answer to. Too much political capital had been burned by the Higher Education Act, and the blame for it was laid at his feet. He had few allies now - and his tenuous hold on power was now largely supported by Kishi, Shiina, and the innovationists - and his rivals were now forcing them to lie in the bed that had been made.\n\nKaya shook his head. "No."\n\nAoki nodded slowly. The little hope that there was another answer, a hidden plan Kaya had, dissipated from his eyes. There was no master plan, there was no contingency. Still, Kaya did not intend to simply give up.\n\n"Our position may be dire," Kaya finally said. "But we are not defeated yet. No matter what has happened, we may yet salvage our legacies. I have devoted too much of my life to this - and not even this will stop me from persevering. We should not give up yet." Aoki did gain a little more life at his comment, but did not add onto it.

There was nothing standard about the silence, with the ministers exchanging pointed glances as they maintained a prickly distance from each other.\n\nThe cause was obvious: the Higher Education Act had been a near-run thing from start to finish. Everyone remembered the howls in the Diet as the final votes had been counted, alternately denouncing the legislation and calling for the Cabinet's resignation en masse.\n\nWhile Kaya's ministers - Kishi, Fukuda, Aoki, and Shiina foremost amongst them - had presented a united front at the time, whipping the YSK into doing their bidding, the entire affair had left a sour taste in all of their mouths.\n\n"It makes my blood boil," Shiina spat with his characteristic swagger, "thinking that Takagi and his 'friends' in the YSK are so proud of being a thorn in our side."\n\nAt that, the entire assembly nodded somberly. Kaya's government - their government - was barely a few months old, and they were already scrambling to put out fires. No matter how much of a loose cannon Shiina was, on this point everyone agreed: whatever disagreements existed between themselves paled in comparison to the threat of the reformists.\n\n"I suppose we can thank Takagi and his ilk for coming out of the woodwork this early," Home Minister Nagayama remarked blithely. "We have some leads concerning Takagi's lieutenants' connections with Mitsubishi. When the time is right, we can expose Takagi's hypocrisy and Mitsubishi's rot in a single strike.""

Even if it gave him a savage satisfaction to know that Takagi's peons were no less predisposed to corruption than other legislators, a gift meant little; what mattered was what was given in return.\n\nThat said, even Nagayama couldn't stop his eyebrows from rising at the thickness of the dossiers placed on his desk. The Tokkō were frighteningly effective, and if they had this much on Takagi's people, they likely knew just as much about himself, even if they weren't planning on doing anything with it.\n\n"Give me the short version," Nagayama coughed, while reaching for Nakasone Yasuhiro's file. "Takagi's protege. Is there anything - "\n\n"Flip to page 38. We have records of Nakasone acting as Takagi's intermediary with Yasuda and Mitsubishi, funneling auctioned Yasuda assets to a front for Mitsubishi. Abuse of power, insider collusion, defrauding the public - we can go after him on any of the three, if you so order." The Tokkō chief's tone was measured, his words precise and definitive.\n\nNagayama wondered briefly that it'd taken him less than a week to come up with the information - which raised questions of its own, since the Tokkō weren't above smear campaigns if ordered to do so - but it didn't matter. If they were pointed in the right direction - his enemies - then that was more than good enough."

A presentation that revolved around the corruption of Takagi's lieutenants, and Mitsubishi, who were involved in an elaborate plot to seize Yasuda, which Takagi was at least partially aware of. Much of the evidence seemed legitimate and damning, yet Kaya found himself almost...disappointed.\n\nHe didn't bother to hide his apathy. "Is this supposed to be shocking, Nagayama? Insider trading, corruption, deals in the backrooms, why are you attempting to portray this as an anomaly. We are not children here." Kaya's eyes flicked to Kishi, who had largely been silent. "It is rich that you are attempting to tie Takagi to this, when we know your own vast connections to Korea and Manchuko, Kishi. I trust that we are not going to pretend you have clean hands when it comes to the corporations?"\n\n"All the same, we are talking about Takagi now," Nagayama insisted. "This cannot go unanswered."\n\n"No." Kaya shook his head. "If you wish to pursue this another way, then so be it. But I will not drag them before a committee."\n\nKishi appraised him carefully, then nodded to Nagayama. "Show him."\n\nWordlessly, Nagayama handed Kaya another folder of documents. "Perhaps this will make you reconsider."\n\nWith some trepidation, Kaya opened the folder, and inside it were detailed reports, meeting minutes, and irrefutable evidence that showed an old Zaibatsu-backed plan to remove him from power. The implication could not be clearer - he would either follow Kishi and Nagayama's plan - or he would be deposed."

Corruption in Japan was well-known, but corporate coups against the government were a red line - and at least publicly, were unprecedented. Aoki was the first to speak. "With all due respect, Prime Minister - what proof do you have of such a conspiracy? That is a serious charge."\n\n"I know," Kaya said. "And I did not come without proof."\n\nFor the next half hour, Kaya went through each piece of evidence with Aoki and the Board. Some pieces were stronger than others, but when it was all put together, even the most skeptical would be hard-pressed to deny that there was a vast conspiracy afoot. The evidence did generate some debate - but the argument against it did not last long. "This is unacceptable," one of the Board finally stateded. "This must be dealt with."\n\n"It must," Aoki agreed. "The only path forward is the Diet."\n\nThere was some debate over that, but most - Kaya included - ultimately agreed with the proposal. Only legislation, enforceable by law, would be enough to restrain the corporations. Their power had been unchecked for too long, and now it would be dealt with. For the next four hours, the Board, Kaya, and Aoki worked to craft the legislation that, if successful, would restrict the power of the corporations far beyond anything that had come before."

He had learned the uniforms very well when he had been on the Board of Yasuda.\n\nThe Tokkō. The Special Higher Police.\n\nThe Tokkō were never sent to merely talk. They were here for him. They were here to arrest him.\n\nAnother knock. Harder this time. "Konda Tsutomu! Open the door!"\n\nHe knew the game was up. There was only one thing they could potentially after him for. Maybe if he cooperated, he would perhaps escape with this with his life. With a trembling hand he opened the door, and faced the officers outside. "Yes, officers, how may I help you?"\n\n"You are under arrest for conspiracy, and illegal insider trading," the officer said as two more grabbed his arms and cuffed him behind his back. "Search the building," the officer ordered as Konda was led out. "And take him to interrogation!"\n\nKonda was only one of many ex-Yasuda board members caught in the conspiracy to be arrested that day. It did not take the Tokkō long to confirm their involvement - and that of the wider web of Takagi and Mitsubishi players. As Kaya read the compiled report when all was said and done, he was struck by one simple fact about the conspiracy. One that had been proven, without a shadow of a doubt."

All of them were departments in the financial and shipping branches, and he had no shortage of reliable people he would nominate - all with the guidance of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, of course.\n\nAnd all such postings were, obviously, temporary.\n\nFor every crisis, an opportunity. Better yet, crises engineered for opportunities. Kaya would be displeased, or irritated by his actions, but Kishi had no sympathy for those who were too slow to act. If he had not taken advantage of this, then another would. It was simply the rules of politics. The only question was how far he wanted to push this.\n\nShiina finally spoke. "You are thinking of displacing Fukuda," he said after a few moments. The man was attuned to his way of thinking, and Kishi was not surprised he'd reached that conclusion. It was, after all, an end goal. "That would be risky. The actions you are taking now are already bold. It may be prudent to wait for the right time. Pushing further risks backlash."\n\nKishi considered the advice. While he felt that there was enough reward to justify the risk, it was possible Shiina was right. And even if he did not act now, it would only be a delay - not a defeat. "You are right," he said after a few moments. "There is no need to risk all that we have done.

The dossiers seemed to balloon with new findings concerning the reformists and the corporations - a sick replay of the cloying, suffocating influence of the zaibatsu during the 1920s.\n\nNow Mitsui had emerged as a new link, this time being implicated in shipping and construction kickbacks being written into military budget appropriations. More so than Yasuda and Mitsubishi - Nagayama wasn't a financier by trade, and the rich scratching each others' backs was nothing new  - this incensed Nagayama. The defrauding of the Empire and its military - under the watch of Takagi, a military man himself!\n\nIt was mind-boggling, and he'd used those exact words at the Cabinet meeting, which elicited a sinister smile from Shiina. "We have evidence against not one, but two of the three remaining zaibatsu? Why not drop this pretense of politeness and go after the zaibatsu directly - it'll be interesting to see how they try to wriggle out of this."\n\nEven as Kishi nodded approvingly of Shiina's aggression, Aoki Kazuo fired back, his expression aghast.

Respectfully, Lord Keeper, there is no evidence for that," Kaya retorted, keeping his voice calm, but firm. "If I am wrong, I will bear the consequences of my actions, as will the nation. But, Lord Keeper, I know this is what is best for the nation - and I will remain firm on this."\n\nKido was silent for a long moment, the anger in his eyes and posture unabaiting.

Each claim of deceit was answered by a counterclaim of bad faith, the representatives from Mitsui and Sumitomo drowning each other in vitriol.\n\nKishi's plan to have the zaibatsu representatives argue amongst themselves was working - but that was it. There seemed to be no plan, no end goal, no objective beyond watching the two industrial giants spill each other's dirty laundry with the blessing of the government.\n\nKishi had taken his leave as the two parties threatened to summon legal counsel, stating that he would 'make sure nobody did anything rash' - his sole concession to the spiralling situation in the room. Fukuda had been left to hold the fort.\n\n"Gentlemen," Fukuda interjected, following a particularly animated accusation of malfeasance by Sumitomo. "Let's return to specifics. Your organizations have unique strengths that can be complemented. For instance - "\n\n...\n\n"I'm glad you see it that way. This arrangement is best for all of us." Kishi scratched a red line under a sentence in his notebook as he hung up - deal secured with Mitsui and Sumitomo.\n\nWhen it had become clear that reason alone wouldn't push Mitsui and Sumitomo to an agreement - despite the implicit benefits from the exclusion of their mutual rival, Mitsubishi - Kishi had decided it was time for alternate measures. The state would take ownership of assets where neither company trusted the other - and Mitsui and Sumitomo would be given a lump sum for their trouble.\n\nIf they refused -"

Where in days past the corporate delegates had been positively eager to tear into each others' arguments, or engage in passionate performances of indignation, today they were entirely sedate and placid.\n\nFinally, after Fukuda had reviewed the minutes of their previous meeting - nothing beyond arguing and useless, circular discussion - the Mitsui representative asked to be recognized.\n\n"We appreciate the great effort it has taken on your part to bring us together day after day, Minister Fukuda." The Mitsui executive's voice was calm - perhaps mockingly so, leaving Fukuda with a gnawing unease. "But it is time we address the elephant in the room: where is Mitsubishi?"\n\nFukuda fought down the urge to roll his eyes; Kishi had left notes for this question. "As we've said before, Mitsuibishi's participation would be inappropriate, given they are the subject of a separate investigation - "\n\n"An investigation, or a settlement?" The Sumitomo representative said, venom dripping from his words. "We will no longer accept a situation where the Ministry of Finance makes side deals with our mutual competition"\n\nEverything after was a blur, as the corporate suits walked out despite Fukuda's protests.

The Yasuda crisis has shown we have forgotten the lessons of the Showa Depression - that we cannot trust capital to prioritize the interests of the nation above their own, to be selfless rather than profit-chasing -"\n\nAt the mention of selflessness, the entire Diet erupted into a cacophonous mess. The reformists and the Kidoites slung accusations of hypocrisy, citing Kishi's own business interests; the conservatives and the technocrats fired right back with cries of self-destructive factionalism.\n\n"That was too much, Kishi." Kaya pulled Kishi aside after the session, the two huddling in the Cabinet's sitting room overlooking the Diet gardens. "Moralizing is bad optics. The rest of the Diet only sees us twisting government policy for personal benefit."\n\n"Bringing the economy back under state control isn't easy, Kaya." Kishi said, his expression inscrutable.

Takagi gave lip service to Prime Minister Kaya's efforts, before bluntly offering his rebuttal.\n\n'We disagree wholeheartedly about whether this represents the best course of action for the Empire. To demand submission without transparency is an excuse for more corruption, not less.'\n\n'It is neither unrealistic, nor treasonous, to ask for transparency between business and politics; it is common sense. Politics is best conducted openly, in full view of the Diet and the Empire's subjects."\n\nSoon afterwards, the reformists launched a bid to amend the Corporate Political Restrictions Act, watering it down to its bare essentials. While business would be kept at arms' length from politics, politicians would also be barred from undue influence in business. Their revisions established mutual oversight between the economy and the state, rather than a fusion of the two - gutting the technocratic faction's entire program.\n\nTakagi had thrown his gauntlet, daring Kaya to figuratively drown his own child in the hopes of garnering more support.

The reformists, the Kidoites, the conservatives, his own technocrats - the YSK had been a wobbly coalition from the start, and it infuriated him to see the papers writing breathlessly like it was all new to them.\n\nWhat hadn't been written - but had been fully implied - was that Kaya was incapable of keeping the factions in line. If change was slow in coming in Japan, that was usually because the government was busy corralling the factions to vote with the party line - the illusion of party unity, even if everybody acknowledged that reality was different.\n\nKaya slumped back in his seat, sighing in frustration. A government that couldn't achieve its aims was no government at all - an assessment that rang even more true when the obstacle came from within. A choice line from one of the editorials flashed through his brain, so unpleasant it twisted Kaya's features in a sour grimace. 'Another Hirota,' it had read - linking him to Hirota Koki, who had been disgraced over internal disagreements with the Army.\n\nAll told, the tone of the morning's news could be summarized with three words.

The papers treated the episode so triumphantly it seemed like an outcome preordained - when the reality was nothing of the sort. The past few weeks had been a mad dash to secure conservative and some sympathetic independent votes in the aftermath of Kishi's speech - that speech that had cleaved the YSK in two.\n\nThe reformists, as ever, had bemoaned the vote, claiming that it was a power grab threatening to return Japan to its darkest hour. A few foolhardy 'intellectuals' had gone on record supporting them,calling the legislation unnatural and despotic.\n\nTheir objections were utterly drowned out by the exuberant response of the people and the press at large.

It wasn't that he fully disagreed with some of the provisions, but what it's purpose really was.\n\nAnd it was not merely to bring the corporations in line.\n\nUnfortunately, there was nothing he could do. Fukuda stood before the Diet, and cleared his throat. "Over the course of years, it has become clear that many of the corporate actors within Japan have been more focused on their own influence and growth at the expense of the nation and national interest."\n\nHis eyes tracked around the Diet. "This skirting of state authority has persisted for too long, and controls are necessary for the good of the nation. Through this Act, the Ministries of Finance and Commerce will be empowered to act as arbiters between the corporate actors, and to regulate, manage, and guide them towards how they can best serve the state."\n\nDebate began shortly after he finished. Despite himself, he was curious to see what the reaction would be. As expected, there were immediate protests against the bill, with them claiming that this was nothing more than a power grab by Kishi - something that Fukuda privately agreed with.\n\nHowever, there was also a swell of support for it, with proponents agreeing with the underlying framework of bringing the corporations under control. Some perceived it as the ideal technocratic solution - one that would be impartial and act solely in the interests of the state. How true that might end up being was open for debate, but one thing was clear to Fukuda."

"If we as a nation are to reach our greatest heights, we cannot become further divided. We all seek to better the Empire, and when our disagreements grow large enough that they harm the national unity, then it is time for all parties to step back."\n\nHe paused for a long period.

It is for this reason that I will support this act - with an additional urge to this body."\n\nTakagi met Kaya's eyes for a brief moment. "I have introduced an amendment to this Act to ensure that its mission is met. It will further ensure the impartiality of, and cement the role of the Finance Ministry in this arbitration process. We must all carefully consider the consequences of, and ask who will benefit, if this measure is not passed."\n\nKaya had reviewed the amendment that Takagi had introduced, and he knew what it's purpose was - a last attempt to place a check on Kishi. Ifit failed, Kishi would wield significant power over the business community. Kaya knew he had Takagi's support now, and could ensure this amendment was killed here and now.\n\nOn the other hand, the amendment was more befitting of the mission of the Act.

However, in the cold light of day, those who we condemned as 'pessimists' proved to be correct. The liberals and the Kido-ites managed to put aside their differences - focusing their rage against us and the bill.\n\nThe question of the Finance Ministry's power over corporate arbitration was too much for much of the Assembly to handle. Correctly perhaps, Takagi and Kido pointed out that this act would only increase Kishi's power and his vice-like grip over the commerce industry. Whatever the case, Kishi and his supporters have been left reeling after the news of their defeat, and Kaya remains silent after the vote.\n\nElsewhere, business leaders celebrate failure as a success for the economy. The bill, derided by the corporations as 'totalitarian' and the last stepping stone to 'governmental domination of the economy' will not be missed. However, the IJA do not share the same views. Army chiefs and corporals mourn the death of the bill as a 'terrible loss to Japan' and a 'capitulation to the Zaibatsu' and call for the placing of Japanese values above personal greed and gain.\n\nWhatever the case, Kaya must find a different route to his goals.

"And now look at how the roles have reversed. The traditionalists in the Finance Ministry outmaneuvered by the ones they once scoffed at.

Continue this focus; continue to show the nation that you do not dance to the whims and strings of the corporations, that you put the interests of the public before all else.

He wanted to deny it, to toss the file into the trash and scream at Nagayama and Shiina to get out. For years, Kaya and Aoki had shed sweat, blood, and tears in service to the Empire, to think Aoki would betray him so easily - and so brazenly, in a manner certain to be noticed?\n\nIt stretched credulity, and yet here the evidence was - unmistakable contact between Aoki and Takagi, held in the open for all to see.\n\nEvidence that could be interpreted any number of ways, Kaya thought. For all Aoki could have given Takagi, he could have been gleaning information from Takagi in return.

With evidence of Shiina's perfidy in hand, Aoki and Fukuda were quick to demand his resignation - and those of Kishi and Nagayama, for good measure. They were not so gracious to forgive such a grievous offense, and only a cabinet reshuffle in their direction would right it.\n\nThe third fact: politics is a game of numbers, and Kaya no longer had enough. Whatever commonalities existed between Takagi's reformists and Aoki's New Bureaucrats, joining any new cabinet was more trouble than it was worth. If the technocratic faction as a whole was disintegrating, the reformists would be happy to accept the New Bureaucrats - in a cabinet of reformist design.\n\nIt made no sense to bet on a losing horse, after all."

Papers were dumped on his desk to be sifted through, put together like a mosaic, creating an ugly picture that only a schemer could love.

 japkaya_tree_two.111.desc: "Fukuda found that people had a tendency to underestimate him.\n\nThat was the only assumption he had come to after whispers had reached him about the latest moves against him. He found himself furious, baffled, and overall just finished with these games against him. However, he was not a political novice, and knew very well that he had plenty of enemies - particularly Kishi and Shiina's Reform Bureaucrats.\n\nApparently they had found evidence that implicated a large number of individuals in the Foreign Ministry with some connections to him - but had decided to also attempt to forge evidence that made the ties to him and his allies in the bureaucracy more explicit. However, they had overplayed their hand, and the moment someone had learned of it, he had known soon after.\n\nHe was not going to remain silent.\n\nHe knew who was ultimately behind this. Shiina, Kishi, neither man would have done this unless Kaya was looking for a way to get rid of him - along with anyone else who stood in the way of the hardliners. This was a purge, though a very, very sloppy one - and one he was also not going to stand for.\n\nFine.\n\nIf Kaya wanted to get rid of him, he would try, and would learn that betrayal had its price. Fukuda knew many people, and he had power in the Ministry of Finance - power that he was going to employ right now, particularly his connections within the Todai clique of the ministry. His reach did not stop there - as there were even those in the House of Peers he could call upon.\n\nThere would be retribution for this. If he went down because of a power grab orchestrated by Shiina and Kishi?"

There remained only one place that was blank. His signature.\n\nHe'd been staring at it for the past half hour, the pen nearby. He felt numb. No, not numb, he felt regret. Regret that he had listened to Kishi and Shiina. Regret that he had attempted this scheme. Regret at acting against a friend in such a way. Regret that he had failed. Regret that it was deserved.\n\nSome had pressed him to try and salvage this. Kishi had tried to propose some replacements for Fukuda, but even Kishi saw the writing on the wall. After Fukuda, and every other Todai technocrat had resigned in a very public fashion from his cabinet, it set in motion the beginning of the end.\n\nThe collapse of his government was not a matter of if, but when.\n\nTrying to stay would only make it worse. There was only one path for him - resignation. Leaving the responsibility to another unlucky man who would have to stabilize the nation in a way he had failed to.\n\nIf he was lucky, he would be forgotten. His legacy would be a man who had tried to fix the nation, and had failed. If he was unlucky, his failure would be his legacy, as he joined an unenviable list of those who were looked to as warnings. There were those he could blame, but in the end, Kaya knew that he could not absolve himself of responsibility.\n\nHe had made his own decisions. He had made his choices. And he had failed.\n\nHe picked up the pen, signed his name, and the Prime Ministership of Kaya Okinori was finished."

There were many reasons one could be called within the Lord Keeper, and very rarely were they good, especially if they were spontaneous. As Kido approached, Fukuda could immediately tell this was going to be unpleasant.\n\n"I have seen many disgraceful things in my time," Kido's voice was cold as he approached. "But what you have done; what you have allowed to happen, may be among the worst offenses. Do you have any explanation for yourself?"\n\nFukuda was caught off-guard by the sheer contempt in his voice. "L-Lord Keeper, I do not understand what you are talking about. I have done no such thing!"\n\nKido's lip curled up, and he handed a small folder to him. "There are two possibilities. You are lying to me right now about what the Foreign Ministry has been involved in, or you do not know, and your ignorance and incompetence cannot be tolerated."\n\nFukuda opened the folder, flipping through it, and the blood drained from his face as he beheld the contents.\n\nNo. No...\n\nPapers, memos, and spreadsheets which implicated ministry officials in deals with Indonesian and Australian officials for various goods which had taken palace during the Indonesian War. No, some of this was fake, it had to be - but the Lord Keeper was clearly convinced by it.\n\nKido beheld the man who had gone silent and nodded once. "Perhaps silence serves you better. There will be consequences, Fukuda, and not even your connections will be able to save you from them." Kido drew himself up, and fixed Fukuda with a final, contemptible stare."

 japkaya_tree_two.114.desc: "Kaya fiddled with the band which tied the newspaper up. Turning the paper over, he saw the face of a man who had haunted him for so long. A man; so determined to bring down Kaya, it meant ripping every single brick out, piece by piece. Splashed across the front page of Nippon Times was a glum-looking Fukuda Takeo, looking outside his Osaka country house. Caught by some overeager reporter, Fukuda found himself captured just peeking out of his bedroom window - eyebags betrayed his pathetic attempts to appear dignified.\n\n"FUKUDA DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF 'PAPUAN MASS GRAVES, DESPITE EVIDENCE". Kaya rarely smiled, but how could he not? How could he not revel in the downfall of his enemy in his feeble attempts to bring down Japan? It was despicable how some people would bring Japan down around their ears for the illusion of power. It's what it was, after all. It was all an illusion, a warm haze over the public's eyes. It made them think that their "Great Helmsman" was an all-powerful, omniscient being - and why should anyone tell them otherwise? Being Prime Minister was a game of treading water, just hoping they would have enough energy to escape the rising tides.\n\nWhich only made this an even sweeter victory. A knock came on the door. Kishi did not even wait for Kaya's approval to walk into the room. He too held a bundle of newspapers carrying them under his arm like a paperboy that Kaya had seen around his neighborhood as a child. Kishi dropped the newspapers onto Kaya's desk. He smiled, almost grinning. "USHIBA IMPLICATED IN FUKUDA SCANDAL! LORD KEEPER DENOUNCES THE SCANDAL". Kaya could scarcely believe it. It would have taken enormous amounts of political capital to scrub down the Foreign Ministry and bring down Ushiba. Here his head was, just lying on his desk.\n\n"I have contacts in the Nippon Times. They're going to print this in the evening edition. Look," Kishi said, pointing at a small sub-article on the front page. "Even Kido has deserted him. Every and any support that Ushiba had will curl up into a ball and wish it was never born."\n\nKaya stared at Kishi, virtually dumbfounded. With Fukuda and Ushiba gone, nothing lay ahead of him now. A "slight" reshuffling of the cabinet was inevitable. With that gone, there was only one person left, between him."

 japkaya_tree_two.115.desc: "Suzuki Teiichi ran his palm across the freshly polished desk he had commissioned for his office, just another perk of being Kaya's new Foreign Minister. Rather abruptly his admiration for the craftsmanship, and his newly achieved status, was shattered by the thud of footsteps leering ever closer from outside the door of his new workplace. Shuddering at this, he quickly rose from his slouched posture, straightening his back and quickly folding his hands on top of one another as his gaze shot forward towards the entrance where just the man he had expected was pushing his way through.\n\nUshiba's face did not wear a pleasant expression, and as the clatter of his boots filled the previously pin-drop silent office space it was made clear that he had not come here to peaceably discuss the terms of Suzuki's meddling. But moments before he could open his mouth in a flurry of protest, a folder was dropped flat against the space between them, and from within spilled paper upon paper of incriminating evidence.\n\n"You seem nervous, my friend, is there something wrong?" Suzuki teased, a grin raising his worn complexion as he began to release the faintest of suppressed snickering. "I wonder if you looked that nervous when you did all this mess, a question only you can answer, right? Deals with the Australians, deals with the Indonesians, how could you ever hope to hide all this?" He continued to poke and prod, weaving his words ever so carefully as to keep the frazzled gentleman provoked but utterly helpless.\n\n"A disaster, no, a threat to East Asian unity and solidarity! That's what I would call it, Mister Ushiba, that is what I would call it." Suzuki commented further, now sporting a cheshire smile. The Foreign Ministry was his, and now he could simply move onto the next issue at bay."

 japkaya_tree_two.116.desc: "The cabinet had been debating their next move since the rather public reshuffling of the Foreign Ministry, a particular bump in their path to dispatching Kaya's old allies rearing its ugly head as the time for action seemed to draw ever closer. Many ideas had been thrown around about how to deal with Fukuda and his Ministry of Finance, some raising Kaya's brow as he patiently sits and listens to the differing pitches presented to rid them of his old New Bureaucrat comrade.\n\nFukuda Takeo was a well connected and well informed man, always wary and analytical of his situation in almost any circumstance, and Kaya was more aware of this than any of the men that had proposed removing him in the first place. A twang of frustration struck the Prime Minister, expression curling into a distasteful sneer as he realized it would have to be him that begrudgingly took the right steps to depose the finance minister and his associates.\n\nCarefully, Kaya mentally perused his available options, discarding one after another as potential fixes seemed to run through his mind in an unintelligible blur. Two among the stream of further dubious and rather complex solutions stood out distinct outliers, Yasuda, or the recently greenlit developments in Southeast Asia. \n\nMassaging his brow, head aching, Kaya pondered using Shiina and his Ministry of Commerce, their influence handling resources allocated by the Finance Ministry being the obvious jumping off point for any meddling in Fukuda's affairs. Beyond this, he considered the Yasuda connection, and the fruits it could bear if pushed in the direction of their enemies.\n\nThe old man let his shoulders relax, expression following suit as he finally rose from his chair to give a verdict on the matter."

It hadn't been simple, but his plan to target the Ministry of Finance's investments in Southeast Asia had become an undeniable success in his quest to remove those that threatened his balance. He could see it now, the shock on his old friend's face as the press and their locust-like swarms of story-hungry reporters latched onto the reports of his supposed mishandling of government funding.\n\nThe thought was reassuring to Kaya, his legacy secured for another day as Fukuda's threat to him dissolved in the titanic wake of the perfect scandal. As far as Japan was concerned, the current state of the Finance Ministry was simply unacceptable, and it's head was an incapable jester, just like Kaya wanted it. Shifting the blame had been easy, development projects had always been rather messy and this had been no different.\n\nAnother reshuffling was expected within the week, public pressure putting a hefty weight upon Fukuda and his clique to release their hold upon the Ministry of Finance. Kaya was satiated with this outcome, treating himself to a drink to commemorate the toppling of a great opposition. However, as he tilted the glass to his lips, sculling down the bitter alcohol with a sputtering cough, another feeling began to occupy space beside his relief. A ravenous uncertainty forming within him, nervous doubt slowly overcoming his triumph.\n\nWith mounting dread, Kaya muttered to himself, placing the glass back against the desk."

 japkaya_tree_two.118.desc: ""It's a complete mess, Aoki. I allow them to succeed, and they end up just dragging me deeper and deeper into this." Kaya vented to his confidant. Kaya and Aoki walked through the halls of the empty Diet. It was dark - despite it only being 5 PM - and not a single soul inhabited the halls of Parliament. Even the janitors had retired for the night. The only people who were here were the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General.\n\n"You can't blame them, Kaya. They have supported you, even through our darkest hours. Yes, they may have a fair few scandals, but don't you dare to paint them all with the same brush!" Aoki said, stopping in his tracks. Kaya could tell that Aoki was uncomfortable with this. The conversation, for the last hour, had been about the New Bureaucrats and showed no signs of stopping. Kishi and Shiina had goaded him into doing this, dealing with the Secretary-General, personally. It was the only option, they said. They could not find anything on Aoki that could both bring him down and keep them alive. This had to be a suicide - in their morbid words. \n\n"Why can't I blame them?" Kaya also stopped, raising his voice. "I take them under my wing, under my oversight. Without me, this 'new generation' of New Bureaucrats would be small fishes in a pond the size of the Pacific! Then they attempt to ruin my lives, with their murder, greed and whoring. It's despicable, and you should know that".\n\n"What do you mean murder, greed and whoring? You work with fucking Kishi Nobusuke!" Aoki began to shout. "My mistake, you work for Kishi Nobusuke, Kaya. That Tengu is a Socialist dressed up as a Japanese politician. The man would dissolve every company in the Empire if he thought he could get away with it."\n\nThe room fell into silence. The pair found themselves in the empty House of Peers, surrounded by row upon row of seats. It was time. Growing up, Kaya had been taught by his parents about the fickleness of destiny. They drilled into him that momentous events often hinged on the smallest of acts. The fate of Asia depended on what he said next. Breaking the silence, Kaya Okinori spoke."

 japkaya_tree_two.119.desc: ""Remember, Oki. You left me with no other choice." Aoki handed Kaya a slip of paper. Kaya looked at the note that Aoki gave him. What was it? Ink splashed onto a piece of mashed up wood pulp. Aoki sat in front of him in the middle chair. The Prime Minister's office was dark, almost pitch black, save for the flickering embers that played inside the fireplace. The warm orange glow embraced the two men like a close lover - a feeling that was not reciprocated. No. Kaya wouldn't get anywhere, wallowing in self-denial. It wasn't just ink on paper. It represented the final, wobbling tether between the old and the new. The resignation letter was a blade, brought to that last, squirming string - working so hard to keep everything in harmony. It sliced straight through it.\n\n"You always had a choice." Kaya pleaded. "I would have kept you on board! The others respect you, even if they can't show it. I respect you!" The Prime Minister's eyes didn't bother to conceal anything. They had been through so much together; China, Pearl Harbour, the Peace, Yasuda. Here it all came crashing down. The moonlight cast long, winding shadows over the room, masking most of Aoki's face.\n\n"When we started this," Aoki gestured to the room. "This project. What did you say you wanted to me? You wanted a Legacy. A legacy with a capital L. Something you could look back on in your twilight years and point to. A fierce, independent Japan, led by a fierce, independent leader." Aoki sighed. Rarely in politics was an act based purely out of principle ever done. Which only made the times it did even more devastating. "Why did you surrender yourself to Kishi and Shiina?"\n\n"They are powerful, Kazuo. More powerful than you can imagine. Japan needs that power. I need that power for Japan! For the good of the nation!" Kaya cried out.\n\n"I will stay if you answer one question," Aoki said. "What are you going to do with that power? How will you use it, specifically?"\n\nKaya stared at Aoki, silent. The Prime Minister of Japan did not speak because he could not speak. In front of the fireplace, the Secretary-General's shadow reached out towards Kaya, covering him. When that silent eternity passed, Kazuo Aoki, former Secretary-General of the Japanese Cabinet, stepped out of the room and out of politics forever. "

 japkaya_tree_two.120.desc: "Shiina cradled a large bottle filled with a thick, black liquid. Its outline topped the drink; being the brightest scarlet that Kaya had ever seen, like the hue of a technicolor strawberry. Beside him sat the 'Monster of Showa' Nobusuke Kishi, holding a glass of Shiina's wine. Outside the window, the cold, clear Friday sky cast its harsh sunlight into the office, while the gnarled cherry blossom tree outside waved its bare branches to the gusts. Kaya laid back, slumping into his office chair, while the two spoke to each other.\n\n"It's Korean," Shiina said, barely concealing his pride in his choice. "I got it from Jinsen, a local market. Not the shabby inner-city markets. Those are for the Koreans. I am talking about artisanal places. This wine was supposed to be for the Japanese Official, in charge of the province, to stop grain requisitions." Shiina stopped smiling and put on a mock expression of sadness. "I convinced the farmer personally to hand me the drink, and I would promise him that no crop of his would be taken, for one year. Shame corruption seems so endemic to the Empire. "\n\n"Indeed," Kishi said, taking a sip of the wine. He turned to Kaya. "Did you deal with him? Will he be a nuisance to our plans?" Kishi stared straight through Kaya, almost as if he was talking to some disembodied spirit.\n\n"No. He handed in the note of resignation yesterday." Kaya said, nearly whispering. This was a victory, by all means. Aoki, the last obstacle in his path, was gone. All of his enemies, in their vain attempts to stand up to them, had been dashed against the rocks of the inevitable. Was it inevitable? All this? Japan now marched to a drumbeat, not dissimilar to the one it marched to in the 1930s. The storm clouds of war loomed overhead, once again. The Sphere frayed at the edges - a seething, writhing mass of lukewarm flesh and boiling idealism clashing for whatever resources they could find. But now, it was Kaya who found himself the Great Helmsman of Japan.\n\n"Good," Kishi beamed. "Then there's nothing left. Nothing left between us...and a better, stronger Japan. Long live Japan!" Kishi held up a glass of wine. As did Shiina.\n\nAs Kaya raised his glass, the Japan of the 1950s died in its sleep. The past became a slave to the future. And the master would never let its serf out of its grip."

 japkaya_tree_two.121.desc: "Kaya stared into the fireplace in his office. The dying, orange embers flickered and leapt over each other as if it was a life-or-death competition. The warmth of the fireplace was an alien creature to Kaya, like the embrace of a passionate lover. The soft crackle of the fire, burning through the kindle, reminded him of his youth. His father would take him to the Imperial Gardens, during the autumn season, when the imported trees' leaves fell to the ground. Every step he would take, the leaves would make a satisfying crunch. Moreover, his father would gather a pile of leaves for him to jump into, to hear that noise closer up. His father had taught him a lesson, using that pile of leaves.\n\nGathering a pile was hard, fiddling work. It took finding lots of non-damp leaves and having the collection not be scattered by the wind. Yet, when completed, it was all worth it. Just to jump in and roll around in the leaves, without a single damn to the outside world. This was what the ideal society was. Men use all their talents and skills to build the perfect Japan - no matter the sacrifice. Nothing was out of the realm for building a utopia. Once it was all done, it was the job of the builders, to watch their children reap the rewards of their labor. \n\nAoki had handed him the letter just a few hours ago. He would stay as Secretary-General, beside the Prime Minister. In other times, this would have been good news - joyous news perhaps. A government, at the brink, is saved by the honor of its constituents. The hardliners would flay him for this move - if they didn't already know about it. With them turned against him, his delicate house of cards that he had built in Tokyo wouldn't be long for this world. It was always like this, this job. One wrong move and the entire thing would collapse. Just like it was doing now.\n\nThe only thing to do now was to resign; the final coup-de-grace that the hardliners salivated for. His legacy would remain, in fragments, but only if he left. Damn it; he was the Prime Minister! The most powerful man in the Eastern Hemisphere, why was he so powerless? So helpless and easy to bend? He couldn't resign. He wouldn't. Why should he? But, it was there - cloaked in darkness - he thought back to his father. What would he have done in his shoes?"

Japan's domestic stability and unity is pivotal to the growth of the Sphere, and without the said stability, many important reforms would never have the opportunity to be implemented.\n\nInvoking my experience as an army officer and the Chief Executive of Guangdong, it became clear to me that self-sufficiency of the Sphere, independent from international trade with hostile states, is of the utmost urgency in today's global arena. Independence of foreign commerce not only set up an effective defense against degenerate ideologies that pose a threat to the East Asian way of life, in the never-so-distant event of a world war, self-sufficiency of war materials will also prove crucial for our national defense.\n\nOur reliance on American and Dutch oil imports substantially hampered our military effort in the Pacific War. The shortage of oil forced our commanders to make risky decisions in an effort to end the war as expeditiously as possible. Luck will not always be on our side, however, and the self-sufficiency of fuel should be of the highest priority.\n\nThough the Empire has liberated the Duch East Indies and now has access to oil fields in the said region, the inferior efficiency of our refineries requires our immediate attention. It is my humble recommendation that you empower the Ministry of Great East Asia to oversee this issue, so that the workload of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can be reduced, as they are already tasked with the crucial duty of managing our relationship with the OFN and the Reich."

"The development of these oil resources is an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the Empire's perennial resource shortages."\n\nKaya looked over the map, making a show of noting the locations and expected output of each oil field. He knew it all already - Suzuki and Kishi had been briefing him after every round of talks with Kaibara - and he was more than convinced of the proposal's merits.\n\nEven after the completion of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, energy scarcity had always remained an issue, especially with the growth of the automotive and plastic industries. Oil, as ever, remained the blood of a nation, and any sources of oil outside North America or the Middle East producers -and in Asia, no less -  were utterly invaluable.\n\n"President Kaibara, your proposal aligns entirely with government policy," Kaya remakred, setting the map aside. "A self-sufficient, Pan-Asian economic ecosystem has been a cherished dream for the Empire for decades."\n\n"That is wonderful to hear. But -" Kaibara said, his expression grave.

A humanitarian problem that the Empire is simply not capable of dealing with!"\n\n"How will expanding Nippon Oil deal with that, precisely? Will they extract peace and co-prosperity from the ground?" one Diet member sneered. With cold daggers, Suzuki leered at the dissenting politician. To say that this bill was crucial was an understatement. If passed, it would mean that Japanese Autarky would no longer be a pipe dream. No longer would they have to kowtow to America - a nation that they had crushed on the battlefield - just because they happened to be blessed with their black gold. Japan would be able to stand on its own two feet as the undisputed hegemon of Earth's four corners.\n\n"No. It will not 'extract peace from the ground'. I will tell you what it does. It will create jobs. Jobs across the Asia-Pacific region to help our brothers in need. Too long, we have proclaimed ourselves as a Pan-Asianist brother among their siblings. Yet how can we supervise our brothers if we cannot keep them in our house? Jobs create wealth, which means more spending. More spending means a higher standard of living. A higher standard of living. Who will they thank for this great opportunity? Us."\n\nSuzuki let that last phrase hang in the air. Across the seats, countless Diet members were nodding their heads, lost in thought. Yes, in Parliament he may have just won the battle. However, the Navy was bound to lose its temper over the bill. The South Pacific was their domain, to do as they please.

Integration of the Asia-Pacific region into the GEACAPS would benefit us all, especially the locals." Suzuki rebutted, clinging on to any control he had.\n\n"Opportunity? The navy has locals doing work - hard work, in the area. They plan, build and work because they know best. Why should we lord over them, like some kind of dictatorship?" Nakasone spat.

All this was just plain old backroom politics, after all; this didn't change too much from usual. Just calls to make, and files to study. His life. And yet, he was a bit tired of having to deal with what seemed to be just about everyone's complaints. Maybe he could actually go for a walk, for once?"
 japkaya_tree_two.126.a: "The bureaucracy's reach grows ever wider."

 japkaya_tree_two.127.t: "What Saves Us From Bureaucracy..."
 japkaya_tree_two.127.desc: "Hachiro took a long, cold look at the walls of the oil rig, and a drag of his cigarette, as the crushing noises of the machinery could be heard behind him.\n\nHe had heard the news through one of his colleagues, actually. The bill had failed. The all-enduring march of the bureaucracy had been stopped, at least for now. It felt a bit strange, actually.\n\nTo be fair, what replaced it wasn't really all that great either. As he glanced at the faded logo painted on one of the machines, Hachiro thought about what the corporations had gained from it. Probably way too much, anyway. He wasn't much of a political know-it-all, but even he could see that the new bill was just something that the corporate bigwigs would use to line up their pockets even more. It was just how things work around here, it seemed.\n\nSome of his colleagues he talked to during lunch break had said there was still hope. Maybe it was Isamu, actually. He said that since those were regional contracts, maybe the locals could have some more power and influence down the line. But when exactly was down the line?\n\nIsamu and the others were a nice bunch, but they were a bit naive, Hachiro thought as he threw his discarded cigarette to the floor. To think that either the state or the corporations had anyone's best interests at heart was foolish; they were only in it for themselves, fighting against each other endlessly, and people like Hachiro who were paying for it."

 japkaya_tree_two.128.desc: ""...listen, Okinori," repeated an exasperated Takagi while drumming his fingers on his interlocutor's desk, "I really don't think that caving in to Kishi's demands is a good idea. If you start to give him what he wants, who knows what he'll ask for next?"\n\n"And I am telling you, admiral, that I am not "caving in" to anybody's reclamations." answered the Prime Minister, in a rather uninterested tone. "Kishi's demands happened to be aligned with our plans, which does not mean that we are going to give him free reign on just about everything any time soon. Is that clear?"\n\n"What is perfectly clear is that you and your friends are in cahoots with him, and that you can't even own up to it. Very brave, I have to say." Takagi curtly replied. "I hope you realize one thing, though."\n\n"Oh, and what is that?"\n\n"Keeping the traditional pillars of our society, and of the Empire, from accessing a resource as crucial as oil is a surefire way to weaken Japan's strategic position." The admiral stood up, ready to leave. "But honestly, do as you see fit. Goodbye."\n\n "There's one thing you need to realize too, Takagi."\n\n"Please, friend of Nobusuke, tell me." he mockingly answered.\n\n"For someone so opposed to military influence in politics, maybe you should think about corporate influence. And when you do, please come back. I'll accept your excuses.""
 japkaya_tree_two.128.a: "...is better than no deal at all."

 japkaya_tree_two.129.desc: "As Nagayama sat in front of the Prime Minister; the air felt heavy. Maybe it was the strangely minimalistic and austere room that gave off this feeling, actually.\n\n"So, Okinori, what did you want from me?" he asked, rather impatiently.\n\n"It's quite simple. I want you to find something to counteract Takagi's threats." Kaya took a sip of water. "While I would like to just ignore him, it is not something we can afford, as him and his clique still hold some sway over the Diet."\n\n"More precisely?"\n\n"Propaganda. We need to make him lose his support, and quick. We need to hit him where it hurts. Any ideas?"\n\n"Well, let's see." Nagayama stroked his chin and put his elbows on the desk. We could do it in two different ways. The first is relatively straightforward: we attack Takagi on corporate intervention. After all, it basically made Yasuda even more of a trash fire than it was at the beginning, and we could very well use that fact to our advantage. The public would probably love that too, actually."\n\n"I see. And the second way?"\n\n"The second way," continued Nagayama, "is a bit through the back door, so to say. Basically, we would be doing an appeal to national security. After all, in these trying times, we can't allow people like Takagic and his clique to squabble while the future of the Empire is at stake. As such, they have to cooperate with that, since if they don't they will be seen as crypto-dissidents. Which one do you prefer?""
 japkaya_tree_two.129.a: ""The first one seems more efficient.""
 japkaya_tree_two.129.b: ""Let's go with the second one.""

 japkaya_tree_two.130.t: "The State Reorganisation Act"
 japkaya_tree_two.130.desc: "Etsusoburo Shiina walked up to the speaker's podium. He checked himself one last time. In his front pocket, there were his notes still on the proposal. Good. He would need all the help he could muster to pass this one through. Shiina coughed slightly and then spoke into the microphone.\n\n"I have come before the Diet today," Shiina started. Formal but professional. That was a good tone, to begin with. "To discuss a matter of national importance, if not international importance for Japan. Fifty years ago, all of Asia was using candles and lamps to light themselves. They used coal and gas to heat themselves and cook their food and knew no other alternative. What about now? We are just over halfway past the century."\n\nThe Diet was quiet, attentive almost. He hadn't blundered yet; Shiina could only hope that this streak continued. "In Tokyo, one can scarcely go fifteen meters without seeing a neon sign, the size of a large school bus! Every home has multiple ways of heating itself, and there's almost certainly a lightbulb in every room. Yet, not everyone in the Empire lives in Tokyo. Or Beijing. Or Gyeongseong. There are those out there who cannot afford such liberties as us. Our citizens, in the farmlands, who toil so hard to make the food that feeds us do not even have central heating!"\n\n"These areas, they don't live as we did in the late Meiji period," Shiina continued. "They live like peasant slaves during Nobunaga's reign. How can we claim to be truly equal when we do not even have a proper system of power set up? That is why I am suggesting the State Reorganisation Act. Not only would this increase the amount of power that already exists in rural electricity grids, but will create new grids for the rural areas to use. Furthermore, I intend for the entire Empire to follow in our roots! In five years, all of Asia will be energy sufficient to power the continent to superpower status. For how can we be the head of Asia if we do not help our Asian brothers?""
 japkaya_tree_two.130.a: "Let's hope that this bill makes it past the Diet, then. "

 japkaya_tree_two.131.t: "Small Adjustments"
 japkaya_tree_two.131.desc: ""Shiina-san." Takagi got up, and gave a polite bow. "I think I speak for quite a few people here, when we say that this bill is a good idea. The countryside is far too littered with villages that haven't even used a radio, let alone a television. Connecting a power grid to these areas would only do us well. As for the Empire, the addition of electrification would benefit everyone there, regardless of race, colour or color."\n\nWell this was certainly interesting. Shiina was used to heated arguments, and demands being flung across the room, but rarely a cross-aisle commendation. It was refreshing, like all of Japan had finally awoken from it's daze and understood basic common sense. The Empire was needed - necessary even - to Japan's success and maximising every single advantage that they could get. Well, it was an obvious choice. In hindsight, Shiina chided himself slightly. Of course the Diet would agree to this. This was really not that controv-\n\n"I have some issues with the bill, itself." Takagi continued. Of course he did. "I hear people telling me how worried they are about the State Reorganisation Act. They say that the act would kill rural living, and the countryside as a whole. They are worried about governmental intervention in their lives."\n\n"And what would you do about that?" Shiina questioned, increasingly irritated. "We cannot simply move them someplace else? Where can we put these power grids - in the water?"\n\n"I will only vote for the bill, if the rotten bureaucracy that seems to cover Japan, is taken out of the bill. We must strive for a simpler, more effective government!" Takagi's speech was followed by muttering from the back of the room. "Furthermore, it appears that this plan is heavily reliant on massive, Zaibatsu-esque companies. I do not know the extent of their influence, but a government's policy must be intact, surely?"\n\n"Are there any other questions, Takagi-san?" Shiina said, exasperated. This was not good. He was losing favor with the Diet, and he was doing it quickly. Should he appease the liberals, and gather some support from their large base? Or should he stick to his guns, and make a stand?"
 japkaya_tree_two.131.a: "Perhaps Takagi has a point. Increase the restrictions."
 japkaya_tree_two.131.b: ""Over- bureaucratisation"? This bill is the only way that Japan's Empire will survive!"

 japkaya_tree_two.132.t: "The Failure of the State Reorganisation Act"
 japkaya_tree_two.132.desc: "It was like any other day for Asahi. At the crack of dawn, he would wake himself up and check on his field. Then, he would tend to the village business. From there, he would improvise but it was mostly the same thing. Today was different. As Asahi faded into bleary consciousness, he noticed he had left the radio on. God, how could he be so careless? Must have left it on during the night. Yet, as he reached to turn it off, something caught his ear.\n\n"The Diet has shot down the State Reorganisation Act, much to the chagrin of its mastermind, Shiina Etsusaburo," the radio blared. "It appears that the close associate of the Prime Minister could not overcome the overwhelming disdain that the bill incurred. Rural gr-"\n\nFailed? The Act failed to make it pass? Asahi let a grin escape his weathered, ancient face. This was excellent news! He had overseen his village of Naose for nearly fifty years now. People came, and people left but there was a beating heart to the village that it seemed he could only see. Asahi stumbled out of the door from his wooden house. The sun shone brilliantly against the mountains. The rosy pinks of dawn collided with the bluish haze of yesterday night, and the soaring peaks lined the horizon like the maw of a dragon. For most of his life, the government didn't interfere with his business - or the villages. That summed up the existence of the entire town. Shoguns fell, and Emperors rose, but you would always have to feed your chickens in the morning.\n\nNow, things are different. The war had fattened Tokyo up, and the peace had made them arrogant. Demanding. Suzuki was only the symptom of an issue that crawled under the belly of Japan for so long. In their quest for superiority and a crown to place upon their heads, they betrayed their people. The very same who had served this country so well. A tinge of guilt poisoned Asahi. Was it right to celebrate the failure of their government?\n\nAsahi walked among his crops and felt the stalks pass through his hand. No. What he felt - the touch of nature herself. It was worth a dead bill or two."
 japkaya_tree_two.132.a: "The future does not come to those who resent it."

 japkaya_tree_two.133.t: "The Passing of the State Reorganisation Act"
 japkaya_tree_two.133.desc: ""The motion for the State Reorganisation Act has...passed." the news reporter said. "The Diet has officially signed the State Reorganisation Act into existence. Promising an extensive rework to not only the Japanese power grids but to the entire Emp-"\n\nShiina laid back in his bed, his thoughts draining out the television. The house was silent - his wife had gone out for the day, and the children were at work. Staring at the ceiling; his heart pounded against his chest. Why was that? He was there when the Diet had passed his Act. He saw his allies hold steadfast as the enemy routed against him. He had triumphed, damned be the consequences. Perhaps, it was the publicity of things. In the Diet, matters were more...insulated. They were personal things, with deeply human factors weighing on every decision. Perhaps, it was a flawed system. Having such slight and differing circumstances forge the future of mankind. Yet, it was their system. Shiina would stand by it, to the bitter end. Yet now, the entire world knew about what he had done.\n\nLooking at the ceiling, he let his mind race. The drab creams and eggshells capitulated to the neon scarlet fantasies of the future. It would be righteous, but this was only one minuscule step to utopia. Once the entire Empire was electrified; then it would be the tie that bound Asia together as one close unit. A reality where the four corners of Asia could communicate and act, just as if they were standing next to each other was possible. It was real, and the Japanese people would bring it to reality.\n\n"Local leaders complain of quote-on-quote 'heavy-handedness' and 'insolent government intervention in the lives of their people'. Already, protests have broken out from the signing of the bill into law-hood and many officials say that they will not enforce the bill at all." the news reporter said.\n\nShiinai winced at the news. How petty and small-minded did you have to be? The fate of Asia rests on their shoulders, and they complain of heavy-handedness? If they had to be heavy-handed to secure Japan's interests and that of Asia, then he was proud. Some would have to suffer, some would have to face eviction and some would have to make way for them. That much was true. Yet, for a glimpse of Heaven, wasn't suffering in Hell worth it?"
 japkaya_tree_two.133.a: "That remains to be seen."

 japkaya_tree_two.134.t: "Asia Surrounded"
 japkaya_tree_two.134.desc: ""The Greater East Asia Economic Mobilization Act," Foreign Minister Suzuki thundered from the Diet podium, "is the obvious, yet heretofore unimplemented step towards the final completion of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is not enough to eliminate the political and military chains of domination by Western powers in Asia itself, when American carriers patrol from Australia and German submarines operate in the Indian Ocean.'\n\n'The project of creating an Asia, for Asians, will only be complete once we are assured of Asia's ability to function as a single political and economic collective, with Japan leading the way for all its brethren nations. Gentlemen, we cannot do this if the other superpowers - the OFN especially - are interfering with Asian affairs from the Philippines to Malaya.'\n\n'This government has always argued that political security and economic security are deeply intertwined. The prosperity of Japan, and of Asia, requires that we do more to secure the trade lanes and hinterlands of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, to make Asia safe for development and industry.'\n\n'The proposed increase in the military budget - for both the Army and the Navy - is a necessary expense. To those who argue that we spend more on guns than butter at the expense of the common livelihood, in Japan and in Asia, think of how much more can be gained if Asia were allowed to develop in peace.'\n\n'Make no mistake - in the Cold War, Asia remains surrounded by enemies. If we are to have prosperity, we must first have peace.""
 japkaya_tree_two.134.a: "Peace through strength?"

 japkaya_tree_two.135.t: "Takagi's Compromise"
 japkaya_tree_two.135.desc: "The Diet, along with many observers, were waiting to see what Takagi would say on the subject of the bill - few were expecting an outright endorsement, but many expected that he would be open to being persuaded - or introduce a method to gaining his support, and that of the other reformists. It was an assumption which turned out to be accurate.\n\n"National defense is an understandable and justifiable priority," Takagi stated in his address. "It is necessary in the world where the Reich and Americans eye us, yet we should not be blind to the clear consequences of this bill. To put it simply - the economic goals outlined here are unattainable, not without significant and long-term losses."\n\nFor some, that had been believed to be the end of it - until Takagi went on to propose an amendment to the bill that would orient it towards a more palatable direction. Few were surprised to see that the revised bill would give the lion's share of the military funding to the navy - but that was far from the only adjustment.\n\nWhere investment in Guangdong and Manchuria had been a centerpiece, the focus under Takagi's amendment shifted to increasing investment throughout all of Southeast Asia, not just the economic hubs of the Empire. Kaya followed all of these developments closely, knowing he had a choice before him.\n\nTakagi's proposed amendment was rather radical. These were major changes to the bill. He knew that if he supported the amendment, Takagi would back him, and passing this was important. However, aligning with the reformists no matter the reason would hurt support among the conservatives and create an equally unenviable situation.\n\nNonetheless, he needed to decide, and after some deliberation, he chose a course of action."
 japkaya_tree_two.135.a: "The amendment will be supported."
 japkaya_tree_two.135.b: "The amendment will be rejected."

 japkaya_tree_two.136.t: "Fortifying the Empire"
 japkaya_tree_two.136.desc: "News of the passage of the Mobilization Act quickly spread throughout Japan and the wider Co-Prosperity Sphere - as well as quietly observed by other nations throughout the world.\n\nAnd with its passage, Japan wasted little time in beginning to implement it.\n\nNaval bases across Asia were provided with far greater increases in funding, as expansions to existing dockyards were planned, repairs to long-ignored issues were addressed, and still more bases were built to better position the Japanese navy to respond to any threats to their sphere of influence.\n\nFunds also went out to many of the nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the Japanese economic hubs of Guangdong and Manchuria receiving a notable boost. Many other Southeast Asian nations - Thailand in particular - also found themselves bolstered with a generous Japanese investment.\n\nMoney flowed like water throughout the Empire and Co-Prosperity Sphere. While the critique for this influx of spending was muted within Japan, it was less because of a universal consensus, especially among the more liberal economists, and more due to said economists biting their tongues. When giving public statements they offered their support for the effort and mission of national defense - but those who read between the lines could see the implication. Implications, and subtle warnings, that this unrestrained spending was simply unsustainable.\n\nImplications that Kaya dismissed. His objective had been completed, and the legislation had passed. The Empire, and her interests, would be secured from the vultures that eyed them from across the sea, and for that, he was more than content."
 japkaya_tree_two.136.a: "The Empire secured - At least for now."

 japkaya_tree_two.137.t: "A Shortsighted Outcome"
 japkaya_tree_two.137.desc: "Kaya did not outwardly react as he read the headline of the morning paper. Perhaps it had been because he'd known it was coming that he found his reaction closer to resignation than anger at those who foolishly denied that these measures were necessary. Yet what was done was done.\n\nThe Mobilization Bill had failed to pass. He sipped his tea.\n\nThe press, the ministries, and the government circles he had insight into were seeing this as a blow to his agenda and government, and were already making implications on his future after this defeat. While few were saying it openly, behind closed doors he knew that many of the corporations and the liberal economists were celebrating the bill's failure.\n\nNot to mention the superpowers who wished nothing more for a weak Japan.\n\nSeveral rumors had already made it to him that the reformists were beginning to build their own national defense bill - one that was far more limited and gradualist in scope than his. Fools who were more concerned about abstract economic theories, and future returns acquired in decades rather than the needs of the Empire today.\n\nOf course, they didn't see that the failure to pass this bill already was hurting them. Since it had failed, Guangdong and Manchuria had been deprived of much-needed injections of credit and resources. It remained to be seen what the extent of the damage would be, but Kaya knew it would be enough to be felt at home - but especially there.\n\nThis was a defeat, but he would have to keep going. He would recover from this, he was sure of it. His agenda might have been stalled, but he would succeed in time. He would find an alternative, another way."
 japkaya_tree_two.137.a: "He had to."
