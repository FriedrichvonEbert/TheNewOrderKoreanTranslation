POLITICS_FU_ZUOYI_DESC:0 "Was Fu Zuoyi a traitor?\n\nExamine the past of this once-war hero and life-long National Revolutionary Army fighter, and you shall find your answer. Hail, how he had hurled himself to the revolutionary flames of 1911 as a mere sixteen-year-old adolescent; hail, how he had, under Shanxi governor Yan Xishan's command in the early 30s, dedicated his mind and vigor to the betterment of the patch of soil called Suiyuan under his watch; and hail, too, how he had fought tooth and nail to defend it against the Japanese jackboot, securing victory after decisive victory against the treacherous Demchugdongrub and his dogmasters.\n\nBut good fortunes are not to last. Eventually Suiyuan fell, then Shanxi too, under the blood-soaked bayonets brought forth by Operation Go-Go; with this, Fu vanished along with his erstwhile superior. It's all too easy, then, to point fingers at the duo's all-too-convenient reemergence just in time for negotiations, and their all-too-eager self-presentation as the definite solution to the border partisan problem, winning back Yan his precious home province, and winning Fu the wretched bandit lair that was Shaanxi. To the casual observer it might be inexpiable betrayal against China itself; to Fu, his one last bid at sheltering noble, like-minded patriots from total annihilation, even if it takes selling his very soul to the invader. So granted them a safe escape he did - no matter Yan's grumbles - swearing on his life that one day, maybe one day, he would reunite with them in their crusade for liberation once more.\n\nOnto that promise he held, as he tended to his new homeland and its people as he had done Suiyuan. Onto that promise he held, even as his old comrade Yan departed from life and as Shanxi submitted itself under his jurisdiction. Even today, as he stands as undisputed commander of two provinces, he holds onto that promise. Yet the spark of hope dims and dims before his eyes with every passing year - and as the butcher Tsuji makes his bloody waltz along Shaanxi's western borders, Fu can only watch as the spark wavers and flickers, as if to be snuffed out the very next second.\n\nWas Fu Zuoyi a traitor? Let history decide, for he has already done all that he can."
