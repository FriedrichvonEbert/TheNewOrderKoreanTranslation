 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_PUYI_DESC:0 "Once the son of heaven, Puyi's life has been a long descent into hell. Chosen by the Empress Dowager Cixi herself a day before her death, he would serve as little more than a ineffective child emperor in the dying days of the Qing dynasty. Forced to abdicate by the Empress Dowager Longyu under pressure from the leaders of the Xinhai Revolution, Puyi grew up in the Forbidden City, temporarily left to him by the newly established Republic of China. There, he married Wanrong of the Gobulo clan, and became close friends with her younger brother, Runqi. In 1924, the court was expelled from the Forbidden City, and forced to eventually take refuge at the Japanese Concession of Tianjin, taking his life in a decidedly pro-Japanese direction.\n\nAfter six years in Tianjin, in 1931, Puyi was visited by Kenji Doihara, head of the espionage office of the Kwantung Army, who offered to make him the head of a new Manchurian state. After some initial hesitation, Puyi accepted, traveling with his court to Changchun. He was made 'Chief Executive' of Manchukuo in 1932, and finally became an Emperor once more in 1934. Despite this, Puyi soon found that he was nothing more than a glorified prisoner of the Japanese, kept in a gilded cage.\n\nThis was keenly felt by those around him as well: Wanrong, who had never liked Japan, grew ever more distant and deeply addicted to opium, his brothers were no longer as close to him as they once were, and even Runqi became concerned by the control of the Japanese over Puyi. However, Puyi gave up on any hope of challenging the Kwantung Army, especially after the victory of Japan in the war. Now, nearly 30 years after his coronation, he has accomplished little and is despised by many, even those he cares about. This knowledge increasingly eats away at Puyi as his own health begins to deteriorate. His only legacy is a lonely life and an empire in chains."

 POLITICS_PUJIE_DESC:0 "On paper, Manchukuo is an Empire - and every empire must have an Emperor. Though Aisin Gioro Pujie was once born in the shadow of his elder brother - first the Xuantong and then the Kangde Emperor - circumstances have made him much more than just another Manchu noble. Noted as being much more charismatic and thoughtful than his brother, Puyi's inability to produce an heir has left Pujie the new heir presumptive - and witnessing firsthand the Court's prostate servility to the Japanese at the cost of the people has made him determined to restore the Imperial Court to its true place: at the very apex of Manchukuo's government. Furthermore, his marriage to Hiro Saga, a Japanese noblewoman - surprisingly happy for one arranged - links him with the highest ranks of Tokyo's aristocracy and grants considerable amounts of legitimacy to his reform-minded end goals.\n\nWhether he will be able to effectively tie together this spider's web of influence and alliances to secure Manchukuo a constitution and an empowered throne and court against the endless pressure from outside forces - most dangerously, the Kwantung Army - remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - Pujie is at least determined not to end up like his brother has."

 POLITICS_GU_CIHENG_DESC:0 "Though many were surprised by Gu Ciheng's seemingly sudden rise to the office of President, those paying attention would have already realized it was a foregone conclusion. Having previously been the Deputy Director of the General Affairs Agency, he developed a strong and positive relationship with the Manchurian bureaucracy, retaining clear links with them even after being promoted to the cabinet. During his time in the Ruan cabinet, disagreements developed between Gu and reformist elements of Concordia seeking to curtail the influence of the bureaucrats on the state, and these tensions eventually erupted upon Puyi's death, leading to Gu cooperating with a coup launched by the bureaucracy that successfully took full control of the state and disbanded the Concordia Association. His own ambition fulfilled, and content with being the figurehead of the newly empowered bureaucrats, Gu Ciheng watches without interest from above as the government he supposedly leads undertakes perhaps the most drastic reforms Manchukuo has seen since it was established."

 ### Ideas ###
 MAN_Chained_To_Rising_Sun:0 "Chained to the Rising Sun"
 MAN_Chained_To_Rising_Sun_desc:0 "Since the establishment of its status as a state, the Manchurian government has always relied on Japanese means to accomplish its ends. The Kwantung Army safeguards its borders to the north against the Russians, and to the East against the NAJUA. The Japanese bureaucracy, a vital organ to the state as the heart to the human body, oversees the economy. Corporations across the sea establish themselves in Asia's third-largest industrial nation.\n\nYet, this cooperation is rarely done in good faith. The Kwantung Army and the Manshu Somucho hold a predominant role in Manchuria's political society, and the State Council is nigh powerless without Somucho's "benevolence.". The corporations, dominated by Mangyo, are rarely benign: twisting Manchuria's laws against itself, all in the name of profit. Currently, the state is in an equilibrium. In order for anything to change, something must give."
 MAN_Vices_Of_Modernity:0 "Vices of Modernity"
 MAN_Vices_Of_Modernity_desc:0 "Manchukuo's triumph over the wars of the 20th century has introduced the rural communities of the Northeast to the excesses of modern age. Opium, once a forbidden substance looked down upon by the rest of the civilized world, plague its urban centers. Prostitution, especially by disadvantaged minorities, is rampant. The Japanese bureaucracy, a crucial component of the state, has harmed the people of Manchuria by peddling these excesses.\n\nThus is the fact of life an average man in Manchuria: what low wages they can squeeze from the corporations they must then spend on these vices of modernity, perpetuating the vicious cycle. To address these problems, however, would require the Japanese bureaucracy to abdicate its role: something impossible unless Manchuria asserts sovereignty, somehow."
 MAN_Kwantung_Army:0 "관동군"
 MAN_Kwantung_Army_tt:0 "§RImperial Army units have been subordinated to the Kwantung Army's chain of command - for the time being.§!"
 MAN_Kwantung_Army_desc:0 "The sole military authority in the Northeast following the passage of the Safety Edicts, the Kwantung Army is, ostensibly, "just another IJA army group." In reality, such assessments are rooted in a surface-level view of the situation. The fact is that there exists a high level of integration between the Japanese administrators and the Manchurian government. For example, Japanese bureaucrats are made the vice-ministers of all Manchurian ministries, blocking the passage of any initiative that may impinge on their ability to extort concessions from the state.\n\nIn addition to this, there are internal divisions within the Kwantung Army, that of the Manchurian faction and the Orthodox faction. The former include members of the Manchurian Imperial Army, as well as personnel from more moderate branches of the IJA. The latter, however, are comprised of personnel who harken back to the days of national corporatism and mobilisation, bolstered by the 1955 Military Cooperation Law which saw the Imperial Army be "aided" under its command."

A native of Manchuria starting with the study of medicine in 1913 and finishing with a doctorate at Kyoto Imperial University - no mean feat for a Chinese man in Japan. First dabbling with official work as a chief army medical officer for the Fengtian Clique, he steadily moved upwards through the ranks of local government positions until the formation of Manchukuo.\n\nOne of the founding members of the Concordia Association, his posts have now ranged from Minister for Education, to Finance, to Construction, with brief stints even in the Foreign Office. As one of its single most key officials, Ruan has made himself indispensable for the functioning of the Empire's government - though he has mostly focused on keeping it going despite immense contradictory pressures from outside, as opposed to beginning the process of change that it is increasingly becoming clear the state needs.\n\nWith Puyi's undecided succession turning from a smoldering, long-term problem to an immediate concern, Ruan as the 'caretaker' of the government now finds himself at the centre of its apparatus, surrounded by people who only barely tolerate him and few real friends or allies. It is now evident that in order to survive the coming years, Concordia will have to rise out of its stupor and attempt to fulfill its long overdue promise - but how it will go about this rests on Ruan's decisions.§!"

His eager opportunism paid off, being made a member of the cabinet of Manchukuo and serving in various posts until 1937, when he was made deputy director of Somucho, the general affairs agency. Though he only remained until 1941, it was in this role that he attracted significant attention and established key contacts both within and without the government of Manchukuo that he maintains to this day. However, in the uneasy years of the 50s, Gu Ciheng steadily lost his personal influence and was left in the shadow of his old compatriot Ruan Zhenduo.

With the establishment of Manchukuo in 1932, he served as dean of the Police College. Continuing to hold posts related to policing for the rest of the 1930s, Yu was made director of the city police of Harbin and, afterwards, Hsinking. In 1940 he became Governor of Binjiang Province, and in 1943 became Governor of Fengtian Province. By 1947, however, increasing disorder caused his recall to the post of police director of Hsinking, a role in which he had previously served with great distinction. He was tasked not only with protecting Puyi and his court, but also with keeping an eye on them on behalf of the Kwantung Army. This resulted in Yu developing a good working relationship with the Kwantung general staff, which he maintains to this day. After the ascension of Ruan Zhenduo to the post of Prime Minister, Yu Jingtao was a natural choice for the post of Minister of Justice in the new cabinet, taking his experience in policing with him to the national stage.§!"

After the death of Puyi and the ascendancy of Pujie, Yuyan was the natural choice for the next Prime Minister.\n\nThough he has quickly shown himself to be capable, there are rumors that his ambition reaches even higher than the post he currently occupies.

Despite this obstacle, Han Yunjie went on to be appointed mayor of Hsinking Special City in 1935, before being appointed as Minister of Finance in 1937, a position shortly after renamed to Minister of Economy. He spent the next three years doing everything in his power to establish economic ties with countries in Europe friendly to Japanese interests. In 1940, however, he was dismissed from his post for criticizing forced acquisition of agricultural land and control of industry by the Japanese government and Kwantung Army. Having made powerful enemies, Han retreated into the business world and became quite wealthy. With the country seeing a resurgence in instability in the wake of the fall of Zhang Jinghui's cabinet, the Kwantung Army reluctantly agreed to allow Han to take up a post in the government once more, on the condition that he not be made a minister.

Runqi continued to follow Puyi after his expulsion from the Forbidden City, even into Manchukuo itself despite his increasing reservations, in part due to Puyi encouraging Wanrong's addiction to opium. Marrying Puyi's younger sister and studying at a Japanese university, Runqi was given a high rank in the Manchurian Imperial Army upon his return and assigned to oversee the training of new recruits, a role he continued to fill throughout the war.\n\nThe increasingly tight grip of the Kwantung Army through the 1930s and 40s convinced Runqi that reform was necessary, but despite his best efforts Puyi remained disinterested and disillusioned, widening the chasm between the two of them. Runqi is a known reformist within Manchurian politics, respected by much of the Imperial Court, but carefully watched by the Kwantung Army and even the mainstream elements of the Concordia Association.

A competent bureaucrat in his own right, Sakomizu never really got the chance to break through into the big leagues in the Home Islands and join a Prime Minister's administration like Kishi, Yoshino or Shiina. Instead, he was reassigned to lead Somucho alongside his politically volatile former colleague Wada in the early 1950s. For all intents and purposes, Sakomizu's career has hit a dead end, with no room for advancement at home.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a dead-end path has turned into a bountiful opportunity following Yuyan and Runqi taking a step too far - and the subsequent purge and removal of the Aisin-Gioro. Now, Sakomizu and his colleagues have one last chance to solidify Japan's grip over Manchukuo as a republican state is established - a chance to end the task burdened unto them thirty years ago.\n\nOf course, unity is merely an illusion in the wilds of Manchukuo - and beneath Sakomizu's precarious pyramid lies a swarm of opportunists and rivals circling, waiting for the time to strike.§!"

A member of the Manchurian bureaucrats' more overtly Marxist clique compared to the Kishi-Minobe-Yoshino-Shiina group of German law students, Wada believed in the usage of central planning to enact far-reaching agrarian reforms - an opportunity he hoped he would maximise in the wilds of Manchukuo.

 MAN_Katakura_Tadashi_hog_desc:0 "Head of Government\nNational Socialism\n------------\n§LKatakura Tadashi is a shining example of the ideal Japanese military officer. Shortly after joining the Kwantung Army, he stood by the Emperor Shōwa when curbing the Kodo-ha faction. \n\nExamples of cunning would only add on over time, until Tadashi eventually became the head of the Kwantung Army after Tojo's death.\n\nKatakura has a unique take on administration, as he shows more sympathy towards allowing Manchurian civilians to rule themselves with the army acting to only ensure order and justice. However, he has made it known that he would not hesitate to curb undesirable factions from arising within the state, as he has done before.\n\nHis devotion to the Kwantung Army above all else has given spoils; his only job now is to keep Manchuria from bursting at the seams by any means necessary.§!"

 MAN_Kamata_Senichi_eco_desc:0 "Economy Minister\nNational Socialism\n------------\n§LOne of the most knowledgeable engineers in all of Manchuria, Kamata is said to have been tutored by none other than the American general Douglas MacArthur. Kamata worked on railways during the Greater East Asian War and continued that occupation in Manchukuo, growing a personal bond with the Mangyō corporation over his many years of service.\n\nThat's why the coup has been a disaster for Kamata, as economic fallout threatens to decimate the economy and Mangyō with it. It's of the utmost importance that the railways keep going so that the state itself does not crumble, and Kanata realizes this more than his colleagues.\n\nIn victory and in strife, Kamata has been loyal to the Kwantung Army. His skills prove to be among one of the many, many tools the Army has used to maintain order.§!"

The Mukden Incident brought him to the Asian mainland, notably running garrisons in Harbin and later Pyongyang during the Great East Asian War.\n\nAfter promoting all the way up to being a senior general over the span of thirty years, Takeshita retired to the reserve Kwantung Army; yet in many ways, through his wise talks with Kwantung leaders and willingness to return to work if need be, it's almost as if he is still in command.§!"
