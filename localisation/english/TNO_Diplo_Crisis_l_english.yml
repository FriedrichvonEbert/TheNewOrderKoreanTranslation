 diplocrisis.125.desc:0 "독일 놈들의 음흉함은 끝이 없는 것 같습니다. 사우디아라비아 주재 대사인 윌리엄 A. 에디가 암살 당했습니다. 우리의 정보국은 에디를 '골치아픈 문젯거리'라고 묘사한 베를린에서 송신한 전보, 암살 계획 수립을 위해 정보 수집 활동을 한 독일 정보원들의 활동 내역, 범행 시각으로추정되는 때에 현장에서 들린 독일어를 들은 목격자들의 증언을 수집했습니다. 또한 결정적으로 현장에 피가 묻은 '피와 명예' 가 새겨진 칼이 현장에 있는 것을 확보했습니다. . \n\n 우리 정부 내의 몇몇은 독일이 그런 중요 인물의 암살을 왜이리 어설프게 처리했냐며 의문을 제기하지만 대다수는 나치의 암살자가 무능했다고 간주하고 즉각적인 보복을 주장하고 있습니다. 중간에 보고서의 일부가 언론에 유출되는 바람에 국민들 또한 분노하고 있습니다. 이미 우리는 독일에게 해명을 요구했고, 그들의 반응을 기다리는 중입니다."

 diplocrisis.126.t:0 "미국의 지목"
 diplocrisis.126.desc:0 "양키놈들의 히스테리가 끝이 없는 것 같습니다. 사우디 주재 대사인 윌리엄 A. 에디는 부주의한 사고로 사망했거나 유대인, 볼셰비키 혹은 그 둘다인 유대-빨갱이에게 살해 당했을 가능성이 큽니다. 그럼에도 미국 정부는 우리의 명예로운 제국 정부를 암살의 배후로 지목했고 이와 관련해 수많은 거짓 증거를 수집했습니다.\n\n 이 것이 전세계에 우리의 명성을 더럽힐려는 한심한 공작임에 틀림없지만, 우리 정부 내에서는 어떻게 대응해야할지에 대해 의견이 갈리고 있습니다. 어떤 사람들은 강력히 부정하고 넘기자고 주장하며, 다른 사람들은 이 사건을 확대시키자고 주장합니다. 현재로서는 미국이 어떤 행동을 할지 지켜보는게 최선입니다."
 diplocrisis.126.a:0 "그거 우리 아니야!"

 diplocrisis.127.t:0 "독일의 부정"
 diplocrisis.127.desc:0 "마침내 우리는 독일로부터 그들이 에디 대사의 암살에 연관되어 있다는 비난에 대한 응답을 들을 수 있었습니다.: "대독일국은 이번 사건에 독일이 관여했다는 미국의 판단을 전적으로 부정하며 독일은 이번 사건에 관여하지 않았음을 알린다.\n\n 강경파들은 중동의 위치한 우리 대사관들을 요새화하고 이들을 보호하기 위해 추가 병력을 보낼 것을 주장합니다. 그러나 몇몇은 이번 사건이 독일의 중동 전략과는 크게 어긋난다는 점을 주목했고, 현 단계에서 이런 행동은 좋지못하며 재앙적인 결과를 초래할 수 있다고 경고합니다."
 diplocrisis.127.a:0 "우리의 외교관들을 보호해야 한다! 요새화하라!"
 diplocrisis.127.b:0 "증거가 너무 허술하다, 독일에게 사과하자."

 diplocrisis.128.t:0 "미국의 지목 철회"
 diplocrisis.128.desc:0 "양키놈들은 거친 외교를 할 배짱이 없는 것 같습니다. 오랜 시간 끝에 미국 정부는 오늘 우리 정부에 공문을 보내 대사 암살에 관한 증거가 허술했다며 성급한 지목에 사과를 해왔습니다.\n\n 이 위기가 해결된 것은 다행이지만, 누가 제국의 이름을 더럽힐려고 했는지, 그들의 목표는 무엇인지에 대한 의문이 생깁니다. 많은 사람들이 생각한 것처럼 빨갱이 유대인의 소행일까요? 아니면 일본놈들이었을까요? 아니면 미국이 스스로 조작한 것일 수도 있습니다. 확실하지는 않지만, 현재의 상황이 좋지 못하다는 것만은 확실합니다."
 diplocrisis.128.a:0 "경계를 늦추지 말자."

 diplocrisis.129.t:0 "미국의 움직임"
 diplocrisis.129.desc:0 "나쁜 소식입니다, 교활한 미국인들이 에디 대사의 암살에 관여하지 않았다는 우리의 해명을 인정하지 않고, 중동 전역에 그들의 대사관을 요새화 할려는 움직임을 보이고있습니다. 이러한 행동들을 미국은 예방책이라고 주장하고 있습니다만, 우리는 그들이 배치하는 병력이 대사관을 보호하는 경비 목적으로 온 것이 아니라 중동에서의 우리의 이익을 훼손하고 그들의 영향력을 늘리기 위한 수단이라고 생각합니다.\n\n이제 우리는 선택해야 합니다, 미국과의 군비 경쟁을 벌여야 할지, 긴장을 완화시키기 위하여 노력해야 할지를 말입니다. 대부분의 사람들이 이러한 행동들이 미국과의 외교 위기를 일으킬만한 가치가 없다고 주장하는 반면, 정부 내의 강경파들은 독일의 명예가 훼손되었으며 미국인들과 군비 경쟁에 들어가야 한다고 주장합니다. 우리는 결정을 위해 미국인들에게 스스로 해명할 것을 요구할 것입니다."
 diplocrisis.129.a:0 "정예 병력을 보내고 미국에게 해명을 하도록 요구하라."
 diplocrisis.129.b:0 "사과를 하고 배상금을 보내라."

 diplocrisis.130.t:0 "독일이 백기를 들다
 diplocrisis.130.desc:0 "중동에서 좋은 소식이 들어왔습니다. 어리석은 나치는 미국과의 경쟁에 나설 수 없다고 판단하고 에디 대사의 죽음에 관하여 사과와 배상금을 보내왔습니다. 독일과의 분쟁은 끝났으나 그 과정에서 배치한 병력들 덕분에 중동 내의 우리의 영향력은 커졌습니다.\n\n곧 독일은 중동에서 쫒겨나 협약의 석유 공급에만 의존해야 하는 처지가 될 것입니다."
 diplocrisis.130.a:0 "또 다른 승리로군."

 diplocrisis.131.t:0 "독일의 대답"
 diplocrisis.131.desc:0 "중동에서 나쁜 소식이 들어왔습니다. 독일군은 우리의 증원에 겁먹지 않았고 우리의 결정이 독일에 대한 도발이 아니라는 것을 증명하라고 요구해왔습니다. 지금 상황에서 독일과의 군비 경쟁에 들어가는 것은 도발 행위나 다름없으나 이 상황에서 물러난다면 굴욕일 것입니다."
 diplocrisis.131.a:0 "대사관 경비 인력을 더 늘려라!
 diplocrisis.131.b:0 "여기서 멈추자고, 병력들을 철수시켜라.

 diplocrisis.132.t:0 "미국이 항복하다"
 diplocrisis.132.desc:0 "마침내 양키놈들이 사리분별을 할 줄 알게 되었나 봅니다. 우리의 요구에 답하여 미국인들은 새롭게 지은 철조망을 두른 콘크리트 요새를 허물고 지역 내의 병력 일부를 철수시켰습니다. 우리는 미국의 위신에 큰 타격을 입혔으며 전 세계에 민주주의 체제가 대독일국의 상대가 되지 않는다는 것을 똑똑히 보여주었습니다."
 diplocrisis.132.a:0 "또 다른 승리로군."

 diplocrisis.133.t:0 "미국이 요새화를 계속하다"
 diplocrisis.133.desc:0 "양키놈들의 광기와 도발은 끝이 없어 보입니다. 그들은 대사관을 요새화하는 것에 그치지 않고 대사관 주위의 거리를 확보해 방어선을 구축했습니다. 외교를 통한 해결은 점점 불가능해지는 것 같고 우리는 미국의 도발로부터 독일을 지키기 위한 결정을 해야 할지도 모릅니다."
 diplocrisis.133.a:0 "아리아 민족의 힘을 보여주겠다."
 diplocrisis.133.b:0 "물러서자, 싸울 가치가 없다."

 diplocrisis.134.t:0 "독일이 항복하다"
 diplocrisis.134.desc:0 "독일 놈들은 자신들이 힘과 우월성을 찍은 훌륭한 사진을 갖고 있더라도 내면은 겁쟁이라는 것을 계속해서 보여주고 있습니다. 파시스트들이 그렇듯이 이들의 끝없는 힘자랑 뒤에는 나약함과 발악이 숨어있을지도 모릅니다. 만약 그게 사실이라면, 이들이 대사관 군비 경쟁에서 조용히 발을 뺀 것으로 증명되는 거겠죠. 이는 미국 민주주의와 자유시장의 우월성을 다시 한번 증명하는 것입니다.\n\n이제 우리 중동 대사관은 적이 뚫을 수 없는 요새가 되었습니다. 우리는 이 지역에서 벌이는 행동의 범위를 자유롭게 넓힐 수 있습니다. 이는 우리 동맹이 나치즘과 일본 군국주의를 초토화할 수 있는 능력을 비약적으로 상승시킬 것입니다. 이 중요한 지역에서 얻은 우위와 자원은 국가 간의 벌어지는 조용한 전쟁에서 중요한 우위를 줄 것입니다. 우리 적국의 붕괴라는 결과가 빠르게 찾아올 거라는 것은 의심할 여지도 없죠."
 diplocrisis.134.a:0 "신이시여, 미국을 축복하소서!"

 diplocrisis.135.t:0 "German Buildup"
 diplocrisis.135.desc:0 "It seems that the Germans have not yet awoken from their racial delusions. Putting their faith in their deluded notion of "Aryanism" rather than in cold facts as we do, they appear to be attempting to fortify their military bases within the Middle East in order to counter our own build up.\n\nWhile their efforts are no doubt, in the long term, futile, for the moment they pose something of a dilemma: we could reinforce our soldiers still further and put them on high alert, but challenging the German constructions even as we maintain our own will open us up to charges of escalation and hypocrisy, while backing down will threaten our growing influence in the region. We must tread carefully, we walk along a narrow path with an abyss on either side -- do we dare to allow the world to fall to Fascism, or risk destroying it in a nuclear firestorm?"
 diplocrisis.135.a:0 "Send more men and make sure they're ready for anything."
 diplocrisis.135.b:0 "Back down. We can't risk war."

 diplocrisis.136.t:0 "American Withdrawal"
 diplocrisis.136.desc:0 "Is there a better example of Jewish hypocrisy and the weakness of bourgeois "democratic" values than the United States? Their nation struts and proclaims its greatness and prosperity, yet in every instance of real challenge, they tuck their tail between their legs and run home to hide behind their oceans. This has been demonstrated once more in our ongoing dispute related to the accidental death of Ambassador Eddy. Although the Americans were happy to stock their bases in the region full of weapons, the moment we did the same they profusely apologized and immediately scaled back their expanded defence area.\n\nOnce More we have shown the world the shallowness of American pride, and its fragility when compared to the ever-enduring iron will of the German Reich."
 diplocrisis.136.a:0 "Satisfying indeed."

 diplocrisis.137.t:0 "Escalation"
 diplocrisis.137.desc:0 "It was a day like any other at the American Egyptian embassy. The soldiers made their usual rounds, albeit more of them and better armed. They had been warned that German-aligned Ba'athists were potentially preparing an attack on the diplomatic center, and so were on high alert. They stared over the passing cityfolk, wary of every black-garbed women and milk cart, ready for bombs and hidden weapons.\n\nAll of a sudden a sudden movement caught their eye, a man in khakis with an unidentifiable object sprinting towards the embassy. Quick to react, the American soldiers opened fire, killing the attacker quickly.\n\nUnfortunately it turned out that the man was only a courier, hired by the embassy to quickly and securely carry messages to their contacts throughout the city. In typical American fashion, they have refused to recognize their mistake and are now claiming that the situation was orchestrated by the local German garrison. Their soldiers have fanned out looking for the "perpetrators" and the situation is rapidly threatening to spiral out of control."
 diplocrisis.137.a:0 "We can't back down now. Deploy our men to protect our assets."
 diplocrisis.137.b:0 "This is dangerous, withdrawn all units to our embassy and open communication."

 diplocrisis.138.t:0 "승리"
 diplocrisis.138.desc:0 "Good news! The situation in the Middle East had seemed for a moment to be at the brink of war after American soldiers were tricked into killing a embassy courier, but the Germans have backed down and offered reparations. Our men had spread out around the city, attempting to bring the vile Huns to justice, and after the news reached us of the German withdrawal, they have surrounded the enemy embassy. Although the environment remains tense, we dominate the balance of power and will most likely leave this incident with significant geopolitical gains.\n\nWith the German power in the Middle East weakened, we have struck a terrific blow against Fascism world wide."
 diplocrisis.138.a:0 "Another win in the fight against Nazism."

 diplocrisis.139.t:0 "The Breaking Point"
 diplocrisis.139.desc:0 "Tragic news from the Middle East. American soldiers deployed throughout Cairo in order to hunt the German soldiers responsible for triggering the recent incident in which an American embassy courier was killed accidentally by our own men, have found German affiliated points in the city heavily fortified and ready to engage. Although we have arrested a number of German operatives and their Ba'athist allies, many others have eluded our grasp, driven away our raiding parties. Many soldiers have been killed, and though local authorities are desperately urging both sides to remain calm, a number of firefights between American and German units and proxy forces have continued into the night.\n\nMany within our government are furious that the decrepit Nazi empire would dare to challenge the most powerful nation within the world, and urge immediate retaliation. Others believe that the situation has escalated far out of hand, and escalating now could lead to retaliation -- perhaps even open war devastating to all mankind.\n\nThe choice is yours, Mr. President. Do we yield at this pivotal moment and demonstrate to the world that America is unwilling and unable to protect them from the fascist scourge? Or do we respond with unsparing fire and fury, risk unleashing nuclear retaliation, and be remembered as the nation that unleashed the fire of the sky upon man, brought hell upon the earth and ended the age of civilization?"
 diplocrisis.139.a:0 "We cannot back down now. May god have mercy on our souls."
 diplocrisis.139.b:0 "There's no other choice. We have to yield."

 diplocrisis.140.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 diplocrisis.140.desc:0 "As the world teetered on the brink of chaos, militarists in America and Germany alike advocated fire and fury, the few pacifists in each government found themselves overwhelmed by the drive to war. In the darkest hour of chaos and tension, some despised, believing that they had failed and the nuclear apocalypse was now unavoidable.\n\nBut in the midst of such insanity, those in the highest halls of power saw reason, and chose to sacrifice their pride rather than the lives of all humanity.\n\nThe Americans have backed down. After firefights between our security forces throughout the Middle East, their soldiers have returned to their bases, and a cable from the State Department has formally apologized for the incident, and offered reparations. The enormous defensive zones they had previously constructed have been turned over too local authorities, and troop reductions are scheduled. What exactly caused the Yankees to back down at the final moment we shall never know. Perhaps they were intimidated by the superior elan and racial purity of the Reich. Perhaps they simply decided that the death of one ambassador was not worth the potential destruction of all humanity.\n\nFor now, this is a victory. Our international reputation has been greatly enhanced by this diplomatic coup, and it is now the Americans who are widely seen as warmongers jingoistic savages. We can only hope that the mistakes that brought this incident so close to sparking global war will not be replicated."
 diplocrisis.140.a:0 "Thank God that's over."

 diplocrisis.141.t:0 "Begining of the End"
 diplocrisis.141.desc:0 "Never the most stable of locals, the Middle East is seething with violence and sabotage as a result of the confrontation between America and Germany. To say that war appears imminent is no understatement -- American soldiers have been reinforced with tanks, artillery, and helicopters and are now hunting for our operatives and soldiers. Our embassies are virtually under siege, and many personnel both civilian and military have been killed. One would think that the Yankkes, with their bold statements about "world peace" and "diplomatic norms" would take it on themselves to back down and so prevent a war, but it seems that the degenerate cowards have found some ounce of courage (or madness) within their placid minds.\n\nThe American escalation very clearly gives us no choice. The lives of Aryans and the honor of the Reich is at stake, and so we have immediately dispatched reinforcements to pay the Americans back in interest for their treachery.\n\nOnly a few within our government and the Reichstag have dared to criticize the mood, and have already been arrested. One way or another, the hour is nigh. The old West is going to war with the New World, and whatever happens this earth will never be the same."
 diplocrisis.141.a:0 "The Clock Strikes 12"

 diplocrisis.142.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 diplocrisis.142.desc:0 "It has often seemed that the German victory in the Second World War was not of this world, but a bad dream that had somehow taken physical form. Ever since the never ending march of humanity towards progress has been twisted and malformed. The world's powers are suspicious and cruel, fighting petty struggles rather than working together for the common good.\n\nPerhaps there truly is no explanation for the phenomenon rather than the political leanings and institutional structures of these nations. Or perhaps the madmen and street philosophers are onto something, and the Nazi victory against thre free world truly was an aberration, one that set humanity on a unavoidable path towards destruction.\n\nEither way, the piper has come, waiting to be paid. When we ordered our boys into the Middle East, it was with the assumption that the Germans, cowards at heart, would back down. It seems that they had made a similar prediction. Now our forces are in open battle, and any hope of peace, honorable or otherwise, has been lost. There is no time left for last minute diplomatic engagement or public appeals. The red phone's line has gone dead, the missiles will soon be on their way, and pure anarchy unleashed upon the world.\n\nWould that we could un-make our mistakes, or will the soldiers of the earth regain their sanity, but it is too late for such meanderings. The World is at War once more, and this time it is doubtful if modern civilization will survive it."

First Lieutenant Konda had reported an aircraft inside secure airspace. As this was not an infrequent occurrence, Major Matsuzaki nodded and headed into the command center for his radar battalion.\n\nIt was already awash with activity; men watched the screens and scrambled around in a daze of surprise. Visual contact had been made with the aircraft by a fighter squadron that had been scrambled. It seems to be an unmarked Douglas DC-8 that is remaining on it's course into secure airspace.

An even more painful silence had filled the deck, suffocating the crewmen with anxious fear until a great thud could be heard on the sonar systems; the Americans had sunk the rogue submarine that the crew of the I-3 were ordered to stop.\n\nThe crewmen let out a deep sigh, and some began to chuckle in relief knowing the Americans had cooperated in the sinking of the treasonous vessel. Washington could champion that they sank a Japanese submarine, many thought, but Naval Command was grateful they did not discover the technologies and intelligence hidden within it. As his men were celebrating, Captain Nagai leaned back in his chair and hunched over. He could not tell if it was humiliation or not, but at least his men were jolly and distracted from any appearance of weakness he may have exposed to them as he turned to the Americans for aid."

Since Washington had become bungled up in the renegade Japanese submarine, American ships were sent across the Eastern Pacific to keep track of the defector's movements, lest they head to a major base or city. But this far out? Paulie shook his head. The feds had cut his leave short, and he was still pissed as ever.\n\nHe sat on the flight deck and watched as the reconnaissance plane returned, greeted cheerfully as usual by the other sailors. The pilot, however, looked paler than the few clouds that graced the open sky when he stepped out of the cockpit.\n\n"What's gotten to you, man?" asked a few of the flight crew, concerned for their friend's health.\n\nAll he could do was stammer, until Paulie and some others came to ask him straightly what the hell happened on his flight.\n\n"It was something massive on the radar, I've got to tell the admiral now! Outta my way! It's a whole Jap armada!"\n\nAnd so the reports crawled through the ranks of command, until it was clear that the forces the Japanese had sent to recover their submarine looked more like a full task force, one that had never come so close to American shores since the Second World War."

They were safe.\n\nMost of the crew still feared being taken prisoner by the Americans, never able to even tell their families of the harrowing journey. Akiyama just wondered how his brother and sister would react. Mai would scold him, telling him, as she always did, that the military would turn him into a drunken and morose man, or leave him dead in the ocean. Would Kazuo even send a letter? He spent his days rushing about the advertising agencies of Tokyo, he could not even spend a full day when mother died.\n\nThe submarine began to surface, and an officer told Kazuhisa to raise the periscope. Beyond the endless void of the Pacific, there was a speck of land ahead. Nothing more than a brownish dot, but unmistakably land. Whatever happened to the crew now, he prayed, let there be no more trouble."

It quickly approached the docile rogue vessel, stuffed full of traitors guilty of treason towards His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor. Nagai's adrenaline buzzed in his stomach, creeping across his body as he was overwhelmed by a patriotic zeal to destroy the self-exiles with all kinds of hideous explosives his submarine was armed with. Nodding to his armaments crew, he ordered for the priming of the weapons systems with a hungry grin, but as he turned back to face the deck his smile dropped. Many of the faces hard at work coordinating systems of the I-3 had stopped in their tracks to gaze in fear of their captain who had been seized by an irrational passion they had not seen before.\n\nFeeling the jolt of vertigo, the awe of his crew struck the captain; he gulped and exhaled slowly, attempting to drive away the nagging burden of responsibility that came with human empathy. They were genuine, real people, and all deserving of good futures; he could not bring himself to risk their lives in a confrontation so objectifying of human experiences. A battle between morality and duty warred within his skull, and with each crashing second his submarine zipped across the ocean, the closer he potentially brought his men to their doom.\n\nA sailor working on reconnaissance interrupted Captain Nagai's stream of thoughts, bellowing that the rogue vessel was within range of the I-3, and that the armaments crew would be able to fire upon Nagai's orders. The captain felt another plunge in his stomach. A single word, and certain death would chase after the defecting submarine, but Nagai feared that certain death would chase him back."

In what was suspected to be a mutiny and an attempt at defection, the Imperial Japanese Navy had negotiated its way across the icy waters to disrupt the vessel's traitorous course. As Japanese ships bobbed about the deep waters surrounding the surfaced submarine, Marines escorted and evacuated the sweaty and exhausted crewmen on to smaller rafts to board them upon larger ships so that they may set sail for trial in Tokyo.\n\nTheir faces were wretched and bitter, defeated by their failed attempt to cross the Pacific and find refuge in what the Naval Command presumed to be Anchorage, Alaska. They had been held on the destroyer-class Minamikaze, standing on the deck in dripping sweat with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. Military photographers shot pictures of their scowls, and officers smirked at what they considered a pathetic attempt at treason; the crewmen were powerless to resist their own subjugation.\n\nCaptain Nagai towered above the battered crewmen, who reeked of perspiration and motor-oil, and felt sickened by their malevolence. They looked back up at him, slowly, and returned a scowl at his scorning presence. He let out a deep breath, looking up and out towards the chopping seas in the open air, before returning his disgusted gaze to the crewmen; he signaled with his hand and one of the marines slapped them across the face. Nagai knelt down to stare at one of the crewmen, grabbing him by the chin as he sat cross-legged with his hands behind his back, and threw him backwards in a moment of intense revulsion."

To face depth charges, even a whole fleet, was suicide. The captain sat to himself, wondering what to do. The world may not be able to save them, but they could at least deliver a single blow to the corrupt and brutal empire that enslaved billions.\n\nAn officer ran up to him, informing him the torpedoes were armed and ready to fire on his word.

Any veteran of the Pacific who didn't at least get a little shudder once the coast vanished from his eyes was a lunatic or didn't get into a real scrap.\n\nSo as the news showed the military photographs of Japanese submarines, then warships, inching ever closer to the Pacific shore, he worried that a new generation would meet the same fate. They almost faced nuclear war at Honolulu, would this be the one?\n\nAnd so the sailor prayed in his home, silently wishing that no more young men like him would have to see a torpedo send hundreds to a forgotten, watery tomb. Nixon may have been able to talk the Japanese Prime Minister out of war, but he was out, and nobody had his spine.\n\nGlued to the TV screen, late into the night he watched as the White House came forward: The Japanese would turn back from entering American waters. He could hear a few people cheering across the road, but all Mr. Miller could do was to breathe in silence. For the second time in his life, the United States was spared from certain death."

A silence fell over them, hollowing out Nagai's heart and filling it with the groaning anxiety roaring across the vessel's surface metal. Silent gasps escaped the lungs of Captain Nagai's officers, and dry gulps lined the room with a tense and shuddering fear for each passing second.\n\nIn the brittle silence, an electronic siren signaled; Captain Nagai darted his head towards the wailing horn and to the shuddering crewman manning a radar. Depth charges were suddenly picked up on the radar system travelling at a high velocity in the water. They cut through the freezing oceans and rushed at full speed towards Nagai's submarine, carrying with them a terrorizing intent to pierce the hull of the vessel. The sirens screamed louder and louder as the crewmen were frozen in their place; their eyes were wide open and petrified, reflecting the beaming red alarm lights, and horror-struck by the certain death charging at them.\n\nSuddenly and instantaneously, Captain Nagai dashed for the relay to communicate with Naval Command. He dialed the numbers as he slouched behind a desk, and a hysterical panic broke out throughout the deck. Howls of unadulterated terror echoed throughout the hallways of the vessel, damped only by the shrieks of alarm sirens, until a crashing thud violently shook the hull and a roar of explosive fire flooded Nagai's vision."

The room had been plunged into a sweltering darkness, lit only by the groaning red sirens that colored his face with intense stress. Nagai gulped and darted his vision about the many petrified faces that filled the room. What he had to do was necessary, he thought, no matter how costly it may seem.\n\nHe cleared his throat and ordered his armaments crew to sink the rogue submarine, breaking the deafening silence with the grim utterance. The sailor blinked, astonished, then darted over to launch the depth charges. The vessel shuddered for a moment; the metal ached as the explosives shot from the submarine, until the deck was once again plunged into silence. The crew waited with a prickling unease, and Nagai was filled with a concern of regret. A crackle soon shot through the waters and on the sonar systems, and Nagai let out a deep breath as he knew the rogue vessel had now been sunk.\n\nHe grinned with a moral apprehension and rested his shoulders as his task had been completed, but his crewmen still looked to him. They were uneasy, perhaps more disturbed to know he found solace in the brutal killing of the alleged defectors. He gazed back at them, now sheepish and overwhelmed with the burdensome realization. His crew returned to their positions, and Captain Nagai returned to his thoughts, rationalizing his actions as necessary despite the burning regret gnawing within his skull."

 WORLD.3500.desc:0 "News reports have officially made confirmation of a deadly conflict occurring within the waters of the Greater Sunda Islands. Yesterday, the Tosa, a Japanese Akizuki-class Destroyer, in a patrol mission near off the coast of South Sumatra, was caught in a violent explosion which rendered its facilities destroyed, with water coming aboard the vessel and, ultimately, leading to its sinking to the bottom of the seas. With radio systems appearing to malfunction on the ship during its destruction, 253 members of the Imperial Japanese Navy were brought to the depths of Indonesian seas in the destruction of the vessel.\n\nAnd yet, the most horrifying detail remains to be seen; as, according to certain reports and Japanese naval intelligence, submarines of the United States were spotted in the area frequently before the tragedy and afterwards. With 253 men killed in the destruction of the ship, it remains unclear what the future of this massacre will bring."

Of course, one could always find an unnerving shadow passing by when you work throughout uncharted seas, as the great man-eating sharks of legend passed by, or even just simple schools of fish. However, these shapes donned not the activity of any beast; rather, in a mere few moments, Seaman Second Class Hayashi realized that this was no creation of the wilds. And yet, how could that be: Imperial Japanese vessels consistently gave reports upon passing, even the clandestine submarine? However, as he began to run towards a commanding officer, the fires of war once more rang out in the Asian seas.\n\nSeaman Second Class Hayashi awoke from the explosion in a terrible fright. Flames danced with water all around him, while the red alert of danger alarmed throughout the entirety of the ship, and his own crewmates continued to run past him despite his cries. Not to mention, the great piece of metal crushing, nearly severing his leg continued to act as his own prison. While the pain and terror generated the warm tears which streamed down his face, Seaman Second Class Hayashi's face was washed away as Sumatran waters poured across his face, and into his lungs."

Ladies and gentlemen, I can promise you one thing in the wake of this grave, grave incident: the Naval forces of the United States of America, under the command of the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of Defense, and, finally, myself, had nothing to do with the orchestration of the destruction of the Tosa and the deaths of her crew, and, quite frankly, find it demeaning to imagine this to be the schemings of a plot against the Empire of Japan. We hold no such plans, and are completely willing to present the evidence of Naval records to ensure our innocence."\n\nAnd, at that moment, all became still in the office of the Prime Minister of Japan. Everyone remained glued to the television sets throughout the office, stopping in their tracks of carrying paperwork and the tasks of the day to focus on the words of the President of the United States.

Late last night, the group of Americans were just about to begin another attack against our western mine when several officers caught them in the act, knocked them unconscious, and sent them to the investigators for their identities to be determined.\n\n'This was a severe diplomatic mistake made by the American government, and we will make sure they pay for their international crime,' one domestic official claimed when he first heard the news.\n\nTwenty of our workers were killed in the attacks on our mines, and another hundred were severely injured.

However, one specific incident that took place in Hokkaido truly grabbed the eyes of our officials.\n\nAn unprotected cargo ship was suddenly and utterly destroyed, its crew of twenty-two sailors and passengers burning alive as the dead ship plunged to the bottom of the ocean. Neither the abundant uranium resources nor any member of the ship's crew were ever recovered.

These husks of men and boys appeared as though they left their own souls back at the mine. Business as usual. "Sklaven," the headmaster yelled, "move out!"\n\nAnd so another day began for the slaves. Boys as young as seven and men as old as sixty performed equally deadly tasks, though the most conditioned men were the ones to handle the raw uranium. It was difficult work, but at least every man had some sort of reason to keep living.\n\nSuddenly, the crashing sound of Herr Rüdiger's voice rang in everyone's ears. A poor boy of twelve stood before the master and admitted what each worker had already discovered. "Th-there's no more uranium here! Not for any of us!"\n\nThe old master huffed and curled his fists, ready to tear the young boy into a mess of blood and flesh, when a telephone rang. Rüdiger picked up the telephone and listened intently, and his eyes widened. "One of our mines in Russia came up empty all of a sudden! We've been checking all of our mines for more damage. How's yours looking, Herr Rüdiger?"\n\nThe old man dropped the phone and stared in disbelief. He looked at the mine himself and saw nothing. He panicked; he had a quota to deliver!

Our entire nuclear arsenal is at stake here. We refuse to let the Japanese and Americans overtake us in this field. A few German investigators are considering the possibility of a Japanese spy or an American infiltrator as the cause behind the uranium raid, but there has been no confirmation. The criminals could very well be a handful of slaves who gained "independent thought" the night before and decided to test their luck on a successful raid. Simply put, we can't gather enough evidence to make a definite conclusion.\n\nThe good news is, we can rebuild our uranium supply. Our nuclear arsenal will grow back in due time.

He had relocated to coastal Virginia, not far away from D.C. just in case he was suddenly summoned for duty. The President spent a significant amount of time on the Virginia beach, watching the Atlantic Ocean sway back and forth, the sun's reflection bouncing around the waves. He was looking for an appropriate way out, a way that would greatly benefit both his hated rival and his country. Just what could he say to make the Japanese forgive him completely and restore the fallen prestige of the United States? It seemed like he had all the time in the world to ponder this very topic...\n\nIt was then that Glenn's secretary ran onto the beach and informed the President that "the Japanese have some business they need to discuss." President Glenn, annoyed at the break in his peace, decided to answer the telephone call from Tokyo.\n\nThe Japanese Foreign Minister was the man on the other line. He began to request heavy American compensation for the attack on Chinese uranium mines; the President would have until tomorrow to respond with an answer.

Many of the maps, battlefield reports and other forms of data concerning the formations of the Wehrmacht's divisions and assessment of their strength date all the way back to 1945, making them utterly outdated and useless to be offering any tactical benefit for the Imperial Army. With the grim bonus of the Germans excelling in covering up their more dangerous toys in their arsenal, any current response to their aggravating actions could only result in bloodshed on a crippling scale for Japan; a massacre to which the Prime Minister would prefer to slate as a last resort.\n\nThe Prime Minister acknowledges these issues, and he is quick to reiterate to his subordinates that something must be done to counteract the technological advantage of their Aryan foes.

After all, they too suffered the blindness of the imperialist parasites that sought to promulgate the corruption of their Judeo-Bolshevik puppet masters upon the innocent people they relished in their oppression. But now, the times have changed; whatever wisdom or intellect Hitler had seen in the Rising Sun perished in his departure to Valhalla, and with it, the new Führer's respect for the mongrels of the East.\n\nIn a public declaration before the Volkshalle, the Führer declared that the Japanese are now revoked of their status as Honorary Aryans, their failure to comprehending reason and the pleas for diplomatic resolution a telltale sign to the Reich that the Japanese have grown barbaric, their minds now cursed with the infection of the Untermensch's way of thought. With fire in his vocals and thunder in his clenched fists, the Führer laments this horrific betrayal by those they once called their brethren, their friendship spat on and their alliance of steel withered and rusted by the decadence that infests the Emperor's domain.\n\nAt the announcement's closing before the roaring crowd energized by anger and zeal, the Führer promises to his people that Germany shall respond to this insolence with fire and fury, that the only consequence deserving of a traitor to the Reich's generosity is by being swept aside as burning embers to their folly.

The Prime Minister could not help but to entertain the possibility of a traditional war himself, as would a few others among his cabinet, but atomic fire or not, there still would be hundreds of thousands of souls that would be sacrifice to the meat grinder that was to come - the only difference was whether their deaths would be abruptly swift or gruesomely slow.\n\nEven as it appeared that the Rising Sun was to set upon its glorious empire, its people would not abandon their trademark resolve to see their fate through till the end.

It was like a black hole of sound had opened up, keeping things in an unearthly silence, until a voice stopped Richard in his tracks. \n\n"It isn't! It's bullshit!" The doors swung open, and Daryl marched outside, avoiding eye contact with much of anything, his white collared shirt soaking through with sweat, and his thick-rimmed eyeglasses seeming as though they would fly off through his spite alone. Pushing the door open, the scene struck Richard into a state of disbelief. Half of everyone in the office was sitting there in absolute silence, few eyes flicking over to him as he stood in the doorway, the light of the hallway illuminating the dust floating through the air, and the cigarette smoke that flooded into Richard's sinuses. \n\nEmily, Danny, and John all sat together in a triangle of chairs, smoking cigarettes, bags under their eyes. Even in the near pitch black, Richard could tell from the luminescence of the light alone that they were deathly tired. Michael and Tam were whispering to each other, barely audible at all, probably talking about the good times they had with each other. Everyone knew about the two, but nobody could show any legitimate care for the pair, not right now. The scene was illuminated by a deep orange light, bolted onto the wall, and the sign read simply:"

tension_diplo_crisis.22.desc:0 "The United States had never lost their vitriolic hatred for Japan since the end of the Second World War. While its wings had been broken by the might of the Samurai, the Eagle had been defeated but not fully brought to heel. Through indirect means of sabotaging Tokyo's hegemony, whether by their secret services or by their economic manipulations, the United States have yet to surrender their foolish belief that they will retake what has been lost in the war, that their might shall return and that the Japanese will pay for their "tyranny" with blood.\n\nEvidently, it is all but mere sabre-rattling by the Yankees, who simply cannot understand the notion of honorably accepting their defeat and accepting their weakness. However, they have recently begun to grow increasingly erratic in their interference of our activities, to such an extent that their military assets have begun to ramp up their momentum to dangerously active performance levels. Whether the Americans are trying to intimidate through a show of force or going forward with a build-up of forces, it remains to be seen.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Japan will be ready. Like the great warriors of old, clad in their armor and wielding their katanas with merciless efficiency, it shall await the dangers to come."

Alan had already made his call to command; they were well aware of the situation, though sitting in the stuffy command center of a submarine a dozen leagues beneath the ocean surface did little to ease his nerves. If anything, they worsened because of it. He could tell the mood was no different for those around him, too. The air had stiffened, even for a submarine. Looking around at those around him, Alan could tell from the pale visages and shuddering hands that everyone had the same thoughts running through their heads, like a broken record on a loop that couldn't be stopped. Their headsets chattered with the voices of radar specialists and the high command in the OFN. Alan's radar was already being transmitted to high command, and it was a weird feeling knowing that the big shots in Washington were watching over his charts, same as he was supposed to. Not that he could focus on them in the least with what he'd need to be focused on. \n\nIt was like a digital fourth of July. As the radar's pulse washed over the screen time and time again, and the pings illuminated the screen to the point that it looked like Alan was looking at a dozen fireflies dancing above the Louisianan swamp he knew so well, the horrific implications of the Japanese on the move were enough to make him snap out of his daze. \n\nHe could overhear the conversations of others beginning to disturb his thoughts. The tone of voice used by those around him was hushed and stern, like they were talking to a misbehaving child in the company of others. Tuning into the conversations over his headset, Alan couldn't help but feel his stomach drop, not due to any bad News circulating, but for lack of good News. All there was in the steel, sealed can beneath the ocean was a mundane collection of mutters speaking of Japanese warships. Alan laid back in his chair."

tension_diplo_crisis.24.desc:0 "It is said that when a truth so horrific displays itself before the human mind, even the most courageous, most fearsome of spirits can crack and shatter from daring to accept what lies before them is real. Such a saying can never be more exemplified than among the members of the Empire's high command, officers and leaders of glorious pride and grim determination that, for all the years in service of their nation, of their Emperor, this would be the first time that astonishment - and confusion - would grace their steely spirits, as the nerve center of Japan's military thrummed in an utter chaotic frenzy. \n\nThe truth that struck these men was one they thought impossible, after everything they had done to ensure the Eagle remained grounded and stripped of its talons : the Americans, after all their talk of "settling the score", have begun to act. Even now, as operators attempt to relay and confirm hectic reports from the Empire's surveillance bases, there are multiple confirmed sightings of USAF aircraft en-route for China, South East Asia and, most horrible of all, Japan itself. \n\nSome men knew this was a far graver issue than the Hawaii Crisis, years ago; others have already shown weakness through cowardly begging that what they hear, what they see is all but a mistake, a grave issue caused by their technology. A few Generals have also succumbed to this gnawing parasite of fear plaguing what resolve they held to maintain their tactical sharpness, while the rest showed little to no sign whether this matter concerned them or worse. However they were affected, they were to face an unchanging reality, one in which its resolution was to be made with immediate haste.\n\nThey needed to act now, for the fate of the Empire now hangs by a slim thread."

tension_diplo_crisis.25.desc:0 "Frank Jones, a young Pentagon intern, was ferrying coffee as normal, seemingly without a care that he was doing so within the National Military Command Center. Frank was more concerned with not bumping into generals and getting to meet the President. Frank certainly hadn't voted for 'em, but hey, rubbing elbows with the powerful is always a great opportunity. Normally, the NMCC was a strictly "eyes only" sort of operation, but the brass didn't seem too worried about procedure today. Frank didn't mind. He loved getting the chance to see the sausage get made. \n\nFrank Jones, in his enviable and optimistic ignorance, was getting on the President's nerves. Who was this kid running back and forth with a smile on his face? Didn't he know what DEFCON 2 means? Does he even care? The Secretary of State spending gut-wrenching hours attempting to force open the Japanese diplomatic channels with no success; wannabe generalissimos with itchy trigger fingers on both sides. This could be the big one, and all this Frank Jones kid is doing about it is putting creamer in coffee? Not even a call to his sweetheart? Would he even notice the bombs going off? \n\nFrank saw the President staring straight at him, and gave a big smile and thumbs up in return. Always good to have friends at the top, but he didn't expect the President to get so chummy so fast! A great day to be Frank Jones, as always. Frank dutifully carried files to and fro, enjoying his time as the intern-in-chief, and as the day grew into night, he delivered to the President orange chicken from Frank's personal favorite Chinese place. He expected a warm thank you, or at least to get his money back. Instead, the President seemed distracted by something, so Frank took the chicken for himself. \n\nThe President was indeed distracted, to say the least. The Secretary of State finally opened channels with the Japanese, but they were only saying one thing. A blanket refusal to any and all negotiations. No peace talks, no backchannel discussions, no hotline. The IJN was steaming towards the USA, and the Americans had better get ready for the third World War. The President would have to go before the nation, not as an elected leader, but as a herald of death. They just hoped they could make America's Frank Joneses listen."

tension_diplo_crisis.26.desc:0 "When the striking news of American bombers and fighters beginning their predatory approach upon the Empire's holdings reached the upper leadership, an emergency conference was quickly held to discuss the appropriate measures to confront this dilemma in the true brave fashion of the Samurai. Quite unexpectedly but nonetheless welcome by the Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Army and the Navy have come to cast aside their petty rivalry for the purpose of defending their homeland against these barbarians who have yet to learn their place, each side providing a contingency that will make the United States pay dearly for this act of aggression.\n\nHowever, as the discussions for a response have yet to spawn favorable results, an aide comes rushing into the chambers to the Prime Minister's side, informing him that the American President has issued an ultimatum: a cease to all hostilities - a cease to Japan's mandate as the dominant force in the Pacific.\n\nAll eyes were now on the Prime Minister, each waiting with varying levels of intensity as they awaited the final answer to this blasphemous demand by the Americans. To refuse this demand was to banish the Empire to extinction by nuclear fire, in exchange of safeguarding their honor; to accept it was not even worth consideration to some, for it meant that Japan would show weakness before the enemy, weakness to the people it leads beneath its crimson glare. The only audible sound within that chamber was the ticking of the clocks, each second shaping what would be the Prime Minister's final decision."

All over town, people had retreated to their living rooms and dens. They sat with their children or their partners, alone or in the company of friends, sitting in frozen horror or wide-eyed glee. All stared at the glowing image of President [GetPresidentLastName], propped up behind the Resolute desk.\n\n"This is not a decision I take lightly," said the president, glancing for a moment away from the camera to a photo on [GetPresidentPronounLowercase] desk as if it could provide any escape. "I, like all of you, remember the costs of the Second World War, of the horrors inflicted by the Japanese on our soldiers and the people of Hawaii. We cannot hesitate in opposing offensive threats on the part of any nation, whether they be small or large."\n\nOn the opposite side of the world in the small city of Nikkō, a similar scene played out. Families gathered in front of their televisions, transfixed. Some cradled their children and whispered sweet reassurances. Others cheered as Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] spoke. Most, though, were silent.\n\n"We cannot allow the forces of imperialism to prevail in shattering our community," said the prime minister, neither his voice nor his expression providing any hint to his mood. "Many of us remember the hardship of the 40s but, rest assured, our victory over the Americans will be swift. We will show them that people fighting for freedom and independence will defend their gains."\n\nThe two towns watched their leaders. They continued to watch as the broadcast ended and the signal lapsed into patriotic songs. They could not know that, already, their leaders were receiving word of troop movements in far-flung reaches of their empires. They could not know that skirmishes had already broken out in cities all around the world. Still, they all knew what the speeches meant.\n\nWorld War III had begun."
