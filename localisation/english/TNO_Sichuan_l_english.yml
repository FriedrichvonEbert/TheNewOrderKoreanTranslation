 SIC_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In the war against Japan few bleed and died as Sichuan did. Countless young men were drafted in China's defense, and the province rallied to Chiang-Kai-Shek and the republican banner. It was all for naught. By 1947 the Imperial Japanese Army had crushed their province, devastating both the land and the people. Finally, in 1949 it ceased to be under military administration and was handed over to Tian Songyao. Over the past decade the ruined province has slowly been rebuilt, and its devastated population has gradually recovered. Now Tian Songyao can finally begin the development and improvement of his native land and paint over the scars of war. But this time, it will be a Sichuan for the Sichuanese. He will not easily see his people slaughtered by Nanjing's command again."
