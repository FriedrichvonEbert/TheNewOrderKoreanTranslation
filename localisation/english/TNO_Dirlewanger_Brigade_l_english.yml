 POLITICS_OSKAR_DIRLEWANGER_DESC: "Oskar Dirlewanger, the bandit king, is perhaps the single most hated - and feared - man in Southern Russia. Standing at the head of his men, a collection of rapists, murderers, and savages without equal, he terrorizes all unfortunate enough to call the Southern Urals their home.\n\nA lifetime criminal opportunitst, Dirlewanger was imprisoned in 1934 for the rape of an underaged girl, and escaped only this and other later convictions through political connections and, in 1939, by his volunteering for service in the Waffen-SS. There, his depravity was found to be accompanied by a talent for effective, if brutal, leadership, resulting in his promotion to command what would become the first iteration of the so-called 'Dirlewanger Brigade.'\n\nDuring the war this unit, shielded by association with the SS, committed uncounted atrocities in the Eastern campaigns, burning and pillaging its way across Poland and Russia. These actions were repeated in the West Russian War, and what evidence of those actions survives make it clear that Dirlewanger's brutality and criminality only increased with time.\n\nHis life changed dramatically, however, in the aftermath of Himmler and the SS's failed coup. Opening fire on the Wehrmacht units that had arrived to disarm and imprison them, Dirlewanger and his men escaped into the Russian winter, eventually carving out a fiefdom in the Southern Urals from which they could pursue their greatest passions - plunder and blood.\n\nAt this, he and his Brigade are all too effective. But Dirlewanger has grown somewhat tired with ravaging nameless villages, and has his eyes set on the two prizes of the region: the city of Orenburg and the facilities on the Black Mountain. He thinks he would very much enjoy burning them to the ground.\n\nAfter taking everything of value, of course."
 POLITICS_FRITZ_SCHMEDES_DESC: "Oskar Dirlewanger is dead. But the Brigade, such as it is, limps on under the command of Fritz Schmedes, the only man capable of attempting to keep it together.\n\nExiled to the Brigade long ago following a dispute with Heinrich Himmler, and although he initially had worked hard to try and escape it, when it turned from a military unit into a bandit force he followed, and adapted. Perhaps tapping to a darkness that was always there, he quickly became almost as monstrous as his commander, working to plan and execute many of the Brigade's most daring raids.\n\nNow, with Dirlewanger dead and the Brigade in near-anarchy, Schmedes leads the crippled remnants that are still loyal, desperately trying to maintain some form of unity. However, with desertions increasing, splinter groups forming, and punitive expeditions increasingly launched against him, it would seem as though his efforts are doomed to failure."
 POLITICS_STEVE_DESC: "No last name, just Steve\n\nA Community College Student from Minnesota\n\nHe's very lost\n\nNot all who wander are lost- but Steve is.\n\nSteve is very lost\n\n\n\nStve has hypothermia."
 LEADER_FRITZ_SCHMEDES_DESC: "Fritz Schmedes was a good German, a loyal National Socialist, and a true believer in the superiority of the Aryan race. And it all mattered naught, for a dispute with Heinrich Himmler ended with him exiled to the Dirlewanger Brigade as punishment. When the Brigade abandoned the German cause and marched into the Russian wilderness, Schmedes followed. As the once-loyal German soldiers pillaged and raided like the bandits they were once conscripted to fight, Schmedes fought beside them. His seething anger and resentment for being sent here manifests itself in the cruelties he inflicts alongside the Brigade's other officers and men. Even if not by choice, Schmedes is a loyal son of Germany no longer. He is a monster like the rest."

The Ural League, a pathetic collection of communities led by a criminal priest, have hunted us time and again, and though we've evaded or destroyed their parties, more always come.\n\nOtherwise pinned between the madmen to the east, the steppes to the south, and the communes to the west, the League thinks they can destroy us once and for all. But what they don't know is that we have them right where we want them. We'll hold our own, bleed them dry and then, in time, strike back and take Orenburg.\n\nAnd when we do, they will truly learn why the Brigade is so feared."

It's time to prove that once again.\n\nIn order to provide motivation, some of the previous spoils will be spread around. Loot, liquor, and the provision of women still capable of providing entertainment will remind them of what's to come.\n\nOur next 'expedition' is fast approaching, and they must be enthusiastic for it!"

 DRL_keep_them_fresh: "Keep Them Fresh"
 DRL_keep_them_fresh_desc: "The men of the Brigade are hard. But gorging on plunder, that ever present goal, has a disturbing tendency to turn them soft. A lazy bandit is a dead bandit, and we have no intention of dying.\n\nWe'll keep their beds hard, their barracks barely warm enough, and their liquor share sufficient, but only just. We'll keep them alert.\n\nAlert enough so that, when the command is given, they will eagerly jump for the chance to participate in another 'expedition.'"
 DRL_keep_them_happy: "Keep Them Happy"
 DRL_keep_them_happy_desc: "The Brigade exists because of enjoyment. Enjoyment of using that which was taken by force of arms from the cold, dead, hands of weaker men.\n\nWhat 'that' is - wine, women, drugs, games, books, or anything else at all - doesn't matter. The boss knows this very well, and so loot will be distributed and revelry encouraged.\n\nA happy bandit is always motivated to remain so, and will cheerfully obey any orders given in that pursuit."

 DRL_prepare_for_the_clash_desc: "It's coming, and soon.\n\nA big showdown with the Ural League is approaching, and we are going to destroy them. We are going to kill their men, rape Orenburg into the ground, in every way possible, and prove to everyone that nobody can stop the Brigade!\n\nAnd after that? Without the League around to organize defenses and provide 'advisors' to villages? Well, we'll loot the whole region. Who could stop us?"
 DRL_prepare_new_raids: "Prepare New Raids"
 DRL_prepare_new_raids_desc: "A lot of people think that the men of the Brigade are simple bandits, capable of nothing more than simple brutality in the pursuit of plunder. Most of those people are dead.\n\nWe may be brutal, and we may want to plunder, but we are no simpletons. Raids must be planned. Loot must be transported. Casualties must be managed. Terror must be applied in just the right fashion.\n\nDirlewanger, and the Brigade at large, have been doing this for years. And we will continue to do so, as we prepare for the biggest raids yet!"
 DRL_gather_our_loot: "Gather Our Loot"
 DRL_gather_our_loot_desc: "When the Brigade rides, it always returns with mountains of loot. But it also returns with the problem of keeping track of that loot.\n\nShares must be properly distributed, and even with the penalty known, some men always try to take more. This cannot be allowed to continue - every man gets a share, and the size of that share depends on many things. An inventory of all spoils must be meticulously generated, kept, and regularly updated.\n\nAfter all, how else will we know when it's time to go and take more?"
 DRL_prepare_for_the_spoils: "Prepare for the Spoils"
 DRL_prepare_for_the_spoils_desc: "Though it could not truly be considered a 'problem,' we frequently find that we have trouble storing all of the spoils of our many successful raids.\n\nThis causes trouble - without proper places to store everything we've taken, not only do we need to rapidly distribute or consume it, which causes discipline problems, but we find that thievery increases besides.\n\nTherefore, More depots will be constructed before our next raid. Hopefully, they'll fill up just as quickly!"
 DRL_the_black_bandit_on_the_black_mountain: "The Black Bandit on the Black Mountain"
 DRL_the_black_bandit_on_the_black_mountain_desc: "Even for the men of the Brigade, rumours about the insane experiments conducted by the mad scientist in Magnitogorsk are enough to give pause. But the boss sees only opportunity.\n\nWhatever else he might be, Lysenko is certainly no friend of the Ural League, and he has large deposits of weapons of all kinds. Weapons we want. We'll try and work out a deal for some of them.\n\nAnd, in time, we can look into what else he might have..."
 DRL_lysenkos_instruction: "Lysenko's Instruction"
 DRL_lysenkos_instruction_desc: "The deal with Lysenko has worked out even better than we could have hoped. Not only did he have weapons, but among the NKVD soldiers who defected to him there were several actual combat instructors.\n\nThe men of the Brigade may be expert raiders with an eye for the value of anything encountered, but many of them, especially our newer recruits, are woefully undertrained. We've therefore worked out an arrangement to send some of our people to go and learn some basic military particulars from those instructors.\n\nLet's see how much the League likes it when we next run into them!"
 DRL_organize_the_russians: "Organize the Russians"
 DRL_organize_the_russians_desc: "Dirlewanger might be an old hand at raiding, but he is also just that: old. Old and weak.\n\nOld bandits don't last long, and when they go down, so too does everybody who stays loyal to them. We will make this fact understood to the Russian members - the majority - of the Brigade, and work to bring them to our side. Increased shares, stolen spoils, and anything else necessary will be promised.\n\nWhen the time comes, Dirlewanger, and the few remaining non-Russians who remain loyal to him, will find themselves alone. And easy prey besides."
 DRL_expert_instruction: "Expert Instruction"
 DRL_expert_instruction_desc: "The Soviets might have lost their grand war against the Reich, but those of us still around from those times well remember how hard they fought, and how many Germans they killed, before capitulating.\n\nThey accomplished this through tough, uncompromising, and sometimes brutal training. Training that we now have access to, courtesy of Lysenko's instructors. And we intend to exploit it. As many of our men as possible will be sent to, hopefully, learn better and more efficient tactics.\n\nIf those tactics lead to more successful raids, so much the better."
 DRL_soviet_stratagem: "Soviet Stratagems"
 DRL_soviet_stratagem_desc: "The Soviets lost, but as the Russian members of the Brigade make sure to constantly emphasize, they were, and are, masters of deception. Of the maskirovka.\n\nThey used that mastery, many years ago, to sow confusion among both the Wehrmacht and their other enemies. Our enemies are smaller than the Soviets' were, but they are enemies all the same. If we can learn some of these strategies of deception, modify them to suit our purposes, and deploy them on our next raid, we could increase effectiveness significantly.\n\nOr, at the very least, give them less time to hide their valuables."
 DRL_soviet_arms: "Soviet Arms"
 DRL_soviet_arms_desc: "Many of the weapons secured for the Brigade from Lysenko's Magnitogorsk stockpiles are ancient beyond all measure. Some even bear the double-headed Russian Imperial Eagle!\n\nBut guns are guns, and as long as they can reliably shoot, they can be of value. We will distribute them to the men of the Brigade, starting with the newest recruits, freeing up better weapons for the veterans. If they prove themselves, and turn over the loot they find for distribution as is required, they can earn themselves a better weapon.\n\nAnd if they don't, there's always another recruit waiting."
 DRL_soviet_mastery: "Soviet Mastery"
 DRL_soviet_mastery_desc: "The Brigade has survived - and thrived - by understanding its environment. When we broke away from Germany, we had to adapt our doctrine, altering it to suit the Urals and our needs for raiding.\n\nWith our new deal in place, Lysenko's instructors are imparting to us Soviet tactics. Some of the smarter men have realized that combining the two - Soviet strength and discipline with the unorthodoxy and unpredictability of raiding maneuvers - could give us a real advantage over those who would see us destroyed.\n\nSo we will."
 DRL_lysenkos_promises: "Lysenko's Promises"
 DRL_lysenkos_promises_desc: "In exchange for his help, Lysenko demands much from the Brigade. Prisoners who could be put to work - in the base or on their back - or otherwise pressed into service have to be handed over unharmed.\n\nHe's paid us well for them so far, yes, but what else does that madman have, hidden away in his labs? In the depths of the Black Mountain?\n\nIt's time to find out, and see what other items he's willing to offer!"
 DRL_spoil_trucks: "Spoil Trucks"
 DRL_spoil_trucks_desc: "Our requests for 'alternative' forms of payment from Lysenko have borne fruit.\n\nThe first such form? Trucks, no doubt taken from the motor pool of the formations that defected alongside him. While the origin matters little to us, the effect matters much, much more. More trucks means that more gold, more grain, more women, more everything can be loaded up and brought back to our camps.\n\nTime to find some sleepy village where they can be put to use!"
 DRL_the_riches_of_the_mountain: "The Riches of the Mountain"
 DRL_the_riches_of_the_mountain_desc: "The Brigade continues to hand over valuable prisoners to Lysenko, and it's long past time that we remind him how valuable our continued assistance truly is.\n\nThere's more inside the Black mountain than he's shared with us so far, much more, and we want it! A little pressure, applied in just the right way, should encourage some additional cooperation and payment.\n\nIf Lysenko knows what's good for him, anyway."
 DRL_the_think_tank: "The Think Tank"
 DRL_the_think_tank_desc: "Lysenko's given us trucks, guns, and money. So why doesn't he give us back some of what we've been giving him - people?\n\nHe's got all kinds of scientists hidden away in his labs, and some of them must be less important than the others. Why doesn't he send them to us instead? He'll get more prisoners, and we'll get some eggheads that can move to both perform some 'field research' on prisoners and contribute to our own efforts besides.\n\nIt's too good a deal to pass up. We'll make sure Lysenko sees that."
 DRL_loot_the_universe: "Loot the Universe"
 DRL_loot_the_universe_desc: "Lysenko's made the right choices so far, giving us alternative and useful items for our prisoners, and now he's stepping up his normal payments as well!\n\nHe seems to be learning - the Brigade is happy to sell, but payment - considerable payment - is both required and expected. The latest such payment has arrived - more rifles and equipment, including heavier ordnance.\n\nIt's good stuff. Time to go use it!"
 DRL_lysenkos_strategy: "Lysenko's Strategy"
 DRL_lysenkos_strategy_desc: "People. It's all Lysenko cares about.\n\nMoney? He could care less. Territory? He has no use for it. Women? Not in the way we want them, that's for sure. No, all he wants are lots of people, marched to the Black Mountain in chains for use in whatever twisted experiments he has planned. Well, if that's what he wants, that's what he gets - as long as he can pay.\n\nIf he can, he can have the people he wants - and we can have the loot, both from them and him, that we want!"
 DRL_testing_our_enemies: "Testing Our Enemies"
 DRL_testing_our_enemies_desc: "The Brigade is surrounded by enemies. But that also means that we are surrounded by opportunities.\n\nThe Ural League, Orenburg, and countless small villages and settlements occupy the lands around us, all rich with loot just waiting for us to take it. We must be careful, however, as they are all waiting for us to make a mistake. Therefore, we will first test their strength, and see which of our foes offers the best opportunity.\n\nThen, and only then, will we ride to plunder!"
 DRL_strike_at_the_urals: "Strike at the Urals"
 DRL_strike_at_the_urals_desc: "The Ural League, our most vigorous enemy.\n\nAs much as we hate their pathetic mongrel 'state,' we cannot deny that their militias are effective and their communities well protected. On several occasions in the past they have even defeated us, and this is causing us trouble. We must prove that they are not capable of defending their territory, that they, like everyone else, fall before us.\n\nWe must put them in their place. And we will."
 DRL_strike_at_orenburg: "Strike Orenburg"
 DRL_strike_at_orenburg_desc: "The communes of Orenburg are disorganized and only loosely held together by shared anarchist ideals. In other words, they are perfect targets.\n\nUp until now, however, they have been the targets of our raids far less than the villages and settlements of the Ural League. This means that, unlike the places we have sacked before, they must be swollen with loot.\n\nTime to show them what the Brigade can do!"
 DRL_strike_at_the_peasantry: "Strike at the Peasantry"
 DRL_strike_at_the_peasantry_desc: "Though striking at settlements affiliated with either the League or Orenburg could yield good loot, there is one major problem: they can fight back.\n\nThough that usually isn't a problem, right now we'd rather not risk a defeat. The independent villages that dot the Southern Urals might not be wealthy, but they also have no real defenses. There won't be much loot, but there will be some, as well as women besides.\n\nThat will be enough for now."
 DRL_grab_the_healthy_fit_and_strong: "Grab the Healthy, Fit and Strong"
 DRL_grab_the_healthy_fit_and_strong_desc: "We raid for wealth, entertainment, and many other reasons, but one of the most valuable things we find is flesh.\n\nEvery single person we take captive during a raid can be utilized. Women can be used until they can be used no more, and men can either be put to work or, if they are strong enough, pressed into service. All can serve.\n\nAnd they will serve. Or they will die."
 DRL_draw_out_the_guard: "Draw out the Guard"
 DRL_draw_out_the_guard_desc: "At every turn, the Ural Guard frustrates our efforts, organizing defenses, training villagers into militia, and even striking at our camps in the night.\n\nIf we're going to, one day, utterly destroy them, and leave their lands open for plunder, we need to sap their strength first, and the maskirovka tactics we have recently learned can help here. A series of small raids should force them to commit their main force to action.\n\nAnd when they do, we will be waiting."
 DRL_the_battle_of_novotroitsk: "The Battle of Novotroitsk"
 DRL_the_battle_of_novotroitsk_desc: "Our gambit worked!\n\nThe raids we conducted on the League's outlying villages have drawn them out, moving to erect defenses around the town on Novotroitsk in anticipation of an engagement. But they still think they will only be fighting another raiding force, and have deployed themselves accordingly.\n\nThey have no idea what's coming."
 DRL_the_second_phase: "The Second Phase"
 DRL_the_second_phase_desc: "The Ural League's forces were smashed at Novotroitsk, drawn in by our deception, and this gives us an opportunity.\n\nTheir militias are depleted, their defensive lines breached, and their fortresses exposed. We will likely not see such momentary weakness again, and we must move to take advantage. Additional raids will be launched on these fortresses to ensure their destruction.\n\nAnother great raid approaches, and when it does, the League will not be able to interfere!"
 DRL_lessons_of_the_guard: "Lessons of the Guard"
 DRL_lessons_of_the_guard_desc: "We secured much loot from the League's fortresses, but we also took prisoners.\n\nThough we would usually hand them over to Lysenko, or just dispose of them altogether, we should not forget how useful the training our men previously received was. We'll give them a very simple choice: teach us how the League trains and fights, or die. Surely, some of them will be willing to give us lessons.\n\nAnd then we can, and will, use those lessons against their former friends."
 DRL_ural_expertise: "Ural Expertise"
 DRL_ural_expertise_desc: "The Ural League captives, those smart enough to take us up on our offer at least, have been very helpful.\n\nThe lands of the League are rugged and mountainous, and they've given us some useful instruction on how to best handle them. So useful, in fact, that some of the Brigade think they should be given an offer to stay, and join us more permanently.\n\nThey can always refuse, of course. It just means we need to dig a slightly bigger hole."
 DRL_homemade_body_armor: "Homemade Body Armor"
 DRL_homemade_body_armor_desc: "There is one thing that the men have been asking for, time and time again: body armor.\n\nThough we don't have the connections or resources to acquire proper, high-quality armor, we don't need to. Most of the weapons our enemies use are old or improvised, and so we can improvise a solution as well. We have lots of scrap metal lying around, from old or plundered equipment, and we can use it to fashion sets of crude armor.\n\nIt will be good enough. If a bit strange looking."
 DRL_rapid_assault: "Rapid Assault"
 DRL_rapid_assault_desc: "There's much to admire about wolves.\n\nThey hunt in packs. They identify the best targets of opportunity, targets that foolishly remove themselves from the larger herd. They move swiftly, achieve their goal, and then withdraw, ready to repeat the procedure all over again. We should act in the same fashion, using our trucks to move rapidly, bring down our prey, and take what we want.\n\nSoon, all will know the Brigade as the Wolves of the Urals."
 DRL_transfer_the_flesh: "Transfer the Flesh"
 DRL_transfer_the_flesh_desc: "Our raids in the Southern Urals, having expanded both in frequency and scale, have left us with many more captives than usual.\n\nWe don't have the space, or the desire, to hold onto them, and we certainly don't want to feed them. But, as always, Lysenko always wants more, and so we'll move to hand them off to him. For proper compensation, of course.\n\nLet's see what we can pressure him for this time."
 DRL_hand_them_over: "Hand Them Over"
 DRL_hand_them_over_desc: "As before, Lysenko has offered to provide us with a reasonable amount of equipment from the Black Mountain's stockpiles in exchange for the captives we can offer.\n\nWhile some within the Brigade claim we should push him for more, citing our strengthening position, others claim that Lysenko's realm isn't comparable to that of our usual targets, and that there is little purpose in killing a golden goose besides.\n\nTheir argument has merit. We'll stick to the deal. For now."
 DRL_good_friends_means_good_money: "Good Friends Means Good Money"
 DRL_good_friends_means_good_money_desc: "True to his word, and in response to our own actions, Lysenko has stuck to the deal as well.\n\nAlready, shipments of equipment, as agreed upon, approach our depots outside Orsk. Though it's not as much as some claim we should have gotten, it is a lot more than nothing, and can immediately be put to use in our future raids. That will have to be good enough for the moment.\n\nBut next time? Who knows?"
 DRL_the_deal_changed: "The Deal Changed"
 DRL_the_deal_changed_desc: "The last time we arranged a major deal with Lysenko, we weren't powerful enough to strong arm him. That is no longer the case.\n\nWe have more men than him. We have more experience than him. And, after all our previous deals, it's very possible that we now have more equipment than him as well. It's time to make this difference in position clear. He can give more. We'll tell him as much.\n\nAnd he had better do so."
 DRL_pray_we_dont_alter_it_further: "Pray We Don't Alter It Further"
 DRL_pray_we_dont_alter_it_further_desc: "Excellent news - Lysenko has realized he was in no position to bargain with the Brigade, and he backed down like the coward we know he is.\n\nAlready shipments of equipment, much more than we might have received otherwise, approach our depots outside Orsk. Our men are excited in the extreme to get their hands on them, to replace both old and worn out weapons and to equip our newest recruits as well. We've already begun planning more raids to make use of them.\n\nWhoever said intimidation couldn't work wonders?"
 DRL_a_second_great_raid: "A Second Great Raid"
 DRL_a_second_great_raid_desc: "With the Ural League humbled after their debacle at Novotroitsk, it's time to plan for another great raid. One that they won't be able to stop.\n\nThere are many questions to answer first, however. Where to target? What type of loot to concentrate on? When to attack? What to do with the captives - at least once the men are done with them?\n\nWe will, however, find answers. An abundance of choice is something we could get used to!"

 DRL_rally_the_lads_desc: "If we're going to raid, we need to get the men pumped up!\n\nWe'll tell the officers to promise them whatever they want - money, women, liquor, blood, anything! Whether they get it or not is up to them, up to how aggressive, violent, and perceptive they are. And, of course, once they do find any such items, they'll have to put them in inventory, to be properly distributed.\n\nBut they'll get their share. The share they deserve."

 DRL_spread_the_spoils_desc: "Our raid was a great success, and we've come away with even more plunder than we thought!\n\nIt's time to spread the wealth around, and maybe this time we increase their share a bit. Give them a little more liquor, a few more pieces of gold, one or two more women to use up, and free rein over some of the other prisoners and items.\n\nSome of our officers might be a little unhappy, but even they have to know that keeping the men happy is an important consideration!"
 DRL_lick_our_wounds: "Lick Our Wounds"
 DRL_lick_our_wounds_desc: "Our raids were successful, but that doesn't mean they were without cost.\n\nMen were lost, as they always are. Equipment was worn out, camps abandoned, and the like. We're going to be going out again soon, of course, but only a fool acts without preparation. So we'll take a break. We'll rest, repair, and identify new targets.\n\nAnd then we'll head right back out again."

 DRL_deep_in_the_west_desc: "To the west lies Orenburg. A perfect target.\n\nTheir defenses are chaotic and uncoordinated, their militias are not nearly as effective as those of the Ural League, and their settlements are laden with loot ripe for harvest.

 DRL_penetrate_the_mountains: "Penetrate the Mountains"
 DRL_penetrate_the_mountains_desc: "Once again, we look at the lands of the Ural League for our next raid.\n\nThey still haven't recovered fully from their defeat at Novotroitsk, and they still oppose us at every turn. They remain our most formidable enemies, but the air of strength that they once possessed has dissipated considerably. We'll hit them again, while they're still down, and carry away whatever they have left.\n\nAnd we'll prove to the people of the Southern Urals that the League can't protect them from us!"
 DRL_the_pincer: "The Pincer"
 DRL_the_pincer_desc: "There exists a third option: strike Orenburg and the Ural League together, at the same time!\n\nSuch a move will be difficult, and a great risk besides, but if we win, if we defeat and scatter their forces both, we will have more plunder, of all kinds, than we will know what to do with. Not only that, we will strike fear into all of the Southern Urals.\n\nThe Brigade cannot be stopped, and we will prove it!"

More guns. More training. More everything. But we won't. We have enough enemies right now without adding the Black Mountain to them, and we will make it known that we will honor deals when it suits us.\n\nSo that's what we'll do. One more deal. As fair as any one that can be had in the Southern Urals."

 DRL_prepare_for_the_final_battle_desc: "The time has come.\n\nWe've hit the Ural League over and over, and still they stand. Still they fight us at every opportunity. Still they, maddeningly, give the people hope that they can stand against us. Against the Brigade! No longer.

Discipline must be enforced, and every man of the Brigade must be roused, pulled from between the legs of their latest conquest, or returned from whatever personal grudge they've left to settle.\n\nThe showdown is approaching."
 DRL_gather_our_guns: "Gather Our Guns"
 DRL_gather_our_guns_desc: "Any major fight with the League is going to require every weapon we have.\n\nTo say that the men of the Brigade are hard on their equipment would be a colossal understatement, and so we must make sure that every weapon we do have is working, assigned to a fighter, and in peak condition as well.\n\nWe can leave nothing to chance when we go after the League - we'll only have one chance."
 DRL_sound_the_horn: "Sound the Horn"
 DRL_sound_the_horn_desc: "We've spent years in these lands around Orsk, suffering attacks from all sides.\n\nFrom our former so-called comrades in the Fatherland.

And we will not be content with the plunder of filthy villages, no, we will not stop until all of their fortresses are aflame, all of their fighters are dead or scattered, and all of their wealth and women are collected.

 DRL_a_hollow_victory: "A Hollow Victory"
 DRL_a_hollow_victory_desc: "The Ural League is defeated, and the mountains are set aflame, but there is no celebration.\n\nLysenko, that traitorous madman, has claimed the mountains for his own, and ignored our demands for the loot rightfully earned in fire and blood. Though some in the Brigade want to avenge this insult immediately, we are in no position to fight him right now. We will take what we can, and leave, for now.\n\nBut we will not forget.

 DRL_chase_the_scraps_desc: "Lysenko, that bastard, stole the Urals from us.\n\nBoth he, and every one of the mad 'scientists' who follow him will pay for it. Dearly. Until then, however, we will concentrate on what we can still salvage from this betrayal.

 DRL_pillage_orenburg: "Pillage Orenburg"
 DRL_pillage_orenburg_desc: "Orenburg stands as the sole remaining obstacle between the Brigade and great Russian hunting grounds to the west.\n\nIt is time to destroy it.

 DRL_let_all_know_fear_desc: "Fear is just as powerful a weapon as any rifle.\n\nAfter all our conquests, all our raids, all our victories, and all our secured plunder, fear both precedes and follows us, as well it should.

The steppe lies open to us, and now we ride, and conquer, like the Greeks of old, with our very own Alexander leading us forever forward to wine, women, and riches uncountable!\n\nThe reputation we have built here will only grow, because not a man, woman, or child will be safe. We will torch Germania, plunder New York, sack Tokyo, and take everything we want, everything we see.\n\nThe King, and his bandits, ride!"

He must be stopped.\n\nAnd we will work to do so."
 DRL_organize_the_kazakhs: "Organize the Kazakhs"
 DRL_organize_the_kazakhs_desc: "There are more than just Germans or Russians in the Brigade.\n\nDirlewanger has committed atrocities uncounted against many ethnicities, including both the Poles and Kazakhs. They must surely thirst for vengeance just as we do. If we approach them in the proper fashion, and explain our plan carefully, they will join us.\n\nAnd Dirlewanger will have that many fewer men with him when the time comes."
 DRL_pay_the_mercenaries: "Pay the Mercenaries"
 DRL_pay_the_mercenaries_desc: "Dirlewanger has bought mercenaries. Good for him.\n\nBut he has overlooked one very important consideration: if a man can be made to murder and pillage with money, he can also be made to backstab those same men who paid him to do so. We will offer the mercenaries more - either directly or in terms of the loot they can take - and secure their loyalty.\n\nEnsuring that Dirlewanger is even more isolated than he already is."
 DRL_poison_the_germans: "Poison the Germans"
 DRL_poison_the_germans_desc: "Those most loyal to Dirlewanger are the Germans who have followed him all the way from the Reich.\n\nThey are also those who are responsible for the vilest of crimes against our people, and so they must be dealt with. We will do so, carefully, by waiting for the completion of the next raid and poisoning any liquor that they have looted.\n\nAs they die in agony, not only will they feel the smallest portion of what they have inflicted upon Russia, but we will also remove the last, crucial roadblock in our path to Dirlewanger himself."
 DRL_kill_the_scum: "Kill the Scum"
 DRL_kill_the_scum_desc: "It is time for Dirlewanger to die.\n\nThe Russians, the Kazakhs, and the mercenaries have all deserted him. His most loyal Germans have died.

 DRL_galvanize_soldiers: "Galvanize Soliders"
 DRL_galvanize_soldiers_desc: "\"Negotiations\"? Hah! That limp-dicked communist Lysenko would rather keel over and die to the mob of smelly peasants below his little mountain shack before he'll give us our fair share on anything! And what use does the Reich have for bastards like him anyway? We've done our own things just fine before, especially without barbarian Slavs holding us back.\n\nThen again, an extra gun pointed at our boys is a pound less of loot to take from the Urals, and they'll be facing much more of them than if we had a horde of reds to keep the peasants looking behind as we blitz their front. Might as well have them run more drills than the usual so they know what to expect, right?"
 DRL_refocus_strategy: "Refocus Strategy"
 DRL_refocus_strategy_desc: "We, of all people, would be the last to talk of \"order\" and \"protocol\" and any of that priestly bullshit. The Brigade cares for none of that; hell, plenty of our men joined up to escape them! And why should we? Dirlewanger's bastards thrive in the bloody, ecstatic chaos that's run amok in the southern Urals -- putting a tamper on it should be the same as cutting your leg off so you can eat some meat in the winter.\n\nNote: Should. Because get this, making like complete animals isn't all too fun either. For the horde of famished canines that is the Brigade, having some way to keep from collapsing into a bickering mess after a raid is important. Some standards can make the most effect here, if nowhere else; because everyone knows they'll have a share, shanking your \"allies\" only means you won't get your cut. This is a lesson the men will be eager to learn... or else."
 DRL_reaffirm_duty: "Reaffirm Duty"
 DRL_reaffirm_duty_desc: "It has come to our attention that some of our men... no, the word is far too kind for them. Some of these pieces of filth, not even fit to be afterbirth from their whore mothers, have been deserting their posts. We found one such individual who, in the moments just before we had his brains shot out but just after we cut off his fingers, told us that there was a general feeling of discontentment brewing amongst some of the rank and file. Ungrateful shitstains that they are, they are not happy with the leadership of Dirlewanger and his trusted subordinates. They'll die slow and public deaths, but the larger problem remains. We can't kill all of the men who doubt us, though we'd surely enjoy that more. No, we have to resort to the much less interesting tactic: buying their loyalty. Increasing the frequency of our raids will increase the amount of loot we have to spread around, and if some of these doubting Thomas' end up dying that way then all the better."
 DRL_truck_upgrade: "Truck Upgrade"
 DRL_truck_upgrade_desc: "As just about everyone knows, any self-respecting bandit group absolutely must have its fair share of steeds to mount up on. Unfortunately for us, horses simply aren't practical in the harsh environment of these damned icy mountains. We know because we've tried before, but no luck. Still, if regular horses won't work we can always turn to the wonders of technology to see us through! That's right, our steeds will be metal and in place of hay they'll eat fuel as they take us from town to town on our merry little 'adventures'. One slight problem remains, and that is that all of our trucks are getting up there in years, and we can't even breed them either... Nothing a little elbow grease can't fix though! Yes, elbow grease -which in this case happens to be a gun pointed at the head of whichever unlucky bastard's been assigned maintenance duty this month- and we'll be cruising around the southern Urals at record speed in no time."

If Hans hadn't arrived with reinforcements you sons-of-bitches would all be dead, and you would have deserved it for that pathetic display. You think that performance entitles you to any of the spoils? Wrong. You absolute jokes deserve a bullet in your thick as shit skulls if you don't shape up quick. We waste food and ammo on you maggots and this is how you repay your commanding officers? Next raid, I had better see some goddamn results, I mean it. I want to see cabins painted in blood and flames and orphans screaming in fear. You think we'll survive a month if the League thinks we've gone soft? You think that that prick in the mountains will continue supplying us with the good shit if he thinks we'll waste it? I guess you do believe that and a thousand other fairy tales given how stupid you seem to be. Get out my sight and get some fucking results next time!"
 DRL_support_units: "Support Units"
 DRL_support_units_desc: "So far, our ability to beat the shit out of our usual targets hasn't been hindered by our general lack of tactical support. So far. We, however, are not really interested in such small prizes any longer. Taking on big bigger towns and even cities with real defenses won't be possible with the rag-tag structure our Brigade is organized into at the moment. We need to scrounge around and find binoculars, medical equipment, and engineering tools. Our enemies will naturally underestimate us, thinking we don't have the capacity to take them on equal terms. We will give them a nasty surprise."
 DRL_better_guns: "Better Guns"
 DRL_better_guns_desc: "Around here, a man's gun is his closest companion, more than any woman could ever hope to be. We have carried our guns loyally since the West Russian when we were abandoned by those fuckers in Germania. Well, a decade of using the same guns, most of which were outdated even by the time of our stranding, makes a man mighty eager for something new and fresh. It does hurt to acknowledge it but our current weapons just won't do any longer. Still, they deserve better than to be scrapped. As a compromise solution, Dirlewanger himself suggested we could keep our old tools of fun and excitement for sentimental value while we buy new equipment from our contacts. The only thing better than a gun is a new gun."
 DRL_use_the_prisoners: "Use the Prisoners"
 DRL_use_the_prisoners_desc: "Our enemies always slander us as vicious killers and psychotic butchers, but this is simply false. In fact, we have an entire maze of cages full of people who are quite alive to prove it. Of course standard practice has been to execute them for fun when we have nothing better to do but the point remains: we do take prisoners. Actually, the number of prisoners has risen significantly ever since the call was made to avoid wasting ammo when possible on minor raids and that has presented the problem of figuring out just what the fuck we're supposed to do with these people. After a night of hard drinking and vigorous academic discussion, we think we may have a solution. Put them to work! If they can free up some of our boys from manual tasks and provide cover on the battlefield then the more the merrier we say. If any of them survive for a few weeks they may even be worth actually recruiting officially. Everyone wins!"
 DRL_on_all_sides: "On All Sides"
 DRL_on_all_sides_desc: "It's been about a decade since we were ratfucked by the high command. If we ever returned what we'd do to those bastards... But we have bigger problems to worry about right now than dreams of sweet revenge. Many problems in fact, keeping us in the cage called Russia. Whether it be the slavic dogs to our north or the steppe dogs at our south, we have mongrels attempting to strike us from all directions. Well, they know full well the pain we can inflict upon them, so they've mostly kept to counter raids, although they have never had the success we've had. Our ambitions have been no grander than that in the past as well, but lately Dirlewanger has been indicating a desire to make some bigger moves, but that's still just talk after all. For now."
 DRL_reaffirm_dirly_power: "Reaffirm Dirlewanger's Power"
 DRL_reaffirm_dirly_power_desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger is the closest thing to a god for the members of this Brigade, no qualifiers, no quantifiers. It doesn't matter if some say he's too old, or he's a drunkard, or even crazy. DO NOT question his authority if survival is a priority. Some among our number seem to be forgetting this very simple law. They think they know better; they fancy that they ought to be in charge and that Dirlewanger is past his prime. They're about to learn the truth. Dirlewanger hasn't survived as the head of a glorified penal battalion turned bandit army without knowing when to crack the whip, and the whip is about to be cracked hard. We are going to choose the most insubordinate officers, the men being propped up as pretenders to command as it were, and we are going to drag them screaming out of bed and blow their brains out so that everyone knows the consequences of even considering mutiny."
 DRL_maintain_order: "Maintain Order"
 DRL_maintain_order_desc: "The Brigade is a motley crew of ex-convicts turned German soldiers turned bandits and the scum of the southern Urals who also have nowhere to turn to in 'civilized' society. In short, they're fucking animals, and just like animals require constant watch lest they go out of control. Dirlewanger's preferred method is keeping everyone on their toes, if you're more likely to die for stepping out of line than you are in a battle, you won't step out of line. So Dirlewanger claims anyways, when he's sober enough to speak coherently at all. Still, someone once said you catch more flies with honey, and they might be right. Maybe the boys would benefit from an uplifting pep-talk or two. Tell them about the loot, drugs, and women they'll have if they just stick with us and maybe we can keep this whole thing moving forward as long as possible."

 DRL.50.t: "The Pillaging of Orenburg"
 DRL.50.desc: "Orenburg, at long last, has fallen.\n\nOur men rampage through the streets, looting whatever they find, taking any woman they see, and killing anyone who resists even the slightest amount. The massacre is near-total, with tens of thousands dead at our hands, thousands more sure to die from exposure or starvation, and more still scattered to the villages and settlements yet untouched - which will not remain so for long.\n\nAs fleeing defenders are ridden down by the Brigade's Kazakh horsemen, and rivers of blood flow outwards from the sacked city, all will know the inevitable fate of those who would deny us our spoils! And all will also know that we will not stop here. All of Russia will bleed before we are through!\n\nFor plunder! For the Brigade! For Dirlewanger!"
 DRL.50.a: "The world is ours to take!"
 DRL.162.t: "Black Mountain Treachery"
 DRL.162.desc: "Initially, the meeting with those mountain-top creeps held a tone of optimism. Dirlewanger received an invitation written by Lysenko personally, scribbled in hasty German on brown-stained parchment. Of course Dirlewanger saw through this farce and opted to humor the mad scientist with his presence. At first the meeting seemed cordial by Uralic standards, a lone table amidst the tundra and mysterious meat smoking over a humble fire. Even Lysenko's men were pleasant with their offers of conversation and faux smiles. That all changed in a moment, however, when the Lysenko's rabid dogs released their anger upon the brigade. Amidst gunfire and chaos, Dirlewanger managed to dive into the cab of a Brigade truck and, under suppressing fire from fellow Brigademen, managed to escape unscathed. It was a relief to all the Brigade when he returned as the sole survivor of this horrible act of deceit. One thing is for sure, relations between those mad mountaineers and our Brigade have taken a turn for the far worse."
 DRL.162.a: "Outsmarted again!"
 DRL.200.t: "Missed a Few"
 DRL.200.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger, leader of the infamous Dirlewanger Brigade, was killed by a partisan group yesterday. As he was on his way to a meeting with Lysenko, a small band of ex-NKVD partisans ambushed him and his men, killing Dirlewanger himself as well as several members of the Brigade.\n\nWhile the Brigade has exacted revenge on the village where this took place, without Dirlewanger at the helm, the Brigade has all but splintered. Various factions have already begun breaking off to terrorize the Urals, though it is likely they will find no quarter anywhere in Russia."
 DRL.200.a: "A fitting end to that madman."
 DRL.201.t: "Testing Our Enemies"
 DRL.201.d: "The efforts of Dirlewanger and the Brigade's senior officers to prepare for the next major raid have been successful.\n\nEquipment has been prepared, plans have been drawn, and the men have been made ready, with the deliberate encouragement of internal disagreements in order to provoke ferocity and a desire for blood. The only question is where to strike, and three options have been presented for consideration.\n\nThe first, and most ambitious, would be to strike the lands around Orenburg, trusting in surprise and skill to overcome their defenses and shatter their illusion of strength. The second, and more obvious target, would be Ural League-affiliated settlements. We fight the League on a near-constant basis, and targeting their morale and resources would be of great help in the future.\n\nFinally, and as a third option, Lysenko has informed us that his forces would not interfere were we to launch a raid against peasant communities within his territory, likely believing it an opportunity to acquire desired prisoners without inciting unrest against himself. They would be unlikely to offer any real resistance, but it is unclear if there would be all that much to gain from them.\n\nRegardless, however, a decision must be made."
 DRL.201.a: "Whoever we choose will fall!"
 DRL.202.t: "Strike at Orenburg"
 DRL.202.d: "Dirlewanger has decided: the Brigade rides on Orenburg.\n\nNot the city itself - we are not quite yet prepared for that - but on a town just across the border. The raid is intended not only to capture whatever wealth and prisoners the town can provide, of course, but also to test the overall defensive capabilities of the state as a whole.\n\nIt is expected that while any individual commune, such as the town, might provide strong resistance, the inherently chaotic nature of anarchism will prevent reinforcement within reasonable timelines. We shall see.\n\nIn any case, the promise of blood and plunder has excited the men as a whole, who eagerly await the battle to come, and the division of loot that is sure to follow."
 DRL.202.a: "Ready the men!"
 DRL.203.t: "Strike at Orenburg - The Raid Succeeds!"
 DRL.203.d: "Our raid on Orenburg was, as hoped, a complete success.\n\nUnder cover of night, our men approached the town from multiple sides, establishing overlapping fields of fire while also acting to block any routes of escape. A small force acted to distract the defending militia and lure them out of established positions, and once that goal had been achieved, our main force, commanded by Dirlewanger himself, fell upon them from ambush.\n\nThe battle was quick, with the militia swiftly overwhelmed and slaughtered, with the Brigade's Cossack and Kazakh riders slaughtering those few who attempted to flee. And then their, as well as the rest of the force's attention, was turned onto the town itself.\n\nEverything of value was seized, large numbers of prisoners were taken for trade or personal entertainment, and intelligence on the dispositions of other communes was acquired. Once completed, those inhabitants deemed too old, young, sick, or otherwise not worth the effort to transport were corralled in the town hall before it was set ablaze along with the rest of the settlement.\n\nAll of the Brigade's objectives have been accomplished - loot, slaughter, prisoners, and terror - and as word of this raid spreads, our dread reputation can only grow."
 DRL.203.a: "Fire or Lysenko - which is a worse fate?"
 DRL.204.t: "Strike at Orenburg - The Raid Fails!"
 DRL.204.d: "The attack on Orenburg was known to be risky, and this time that risk proved too much. The Brigade's attack failed. Utterly.\n\nA failure somewhere allowed for the commune to somehow learn about our impending raid, and they were able to, before our arrival, secure considerable reinforcement. Our attempts at distraction and ambush were wholly unsuccessful, and when our main force advanced out of cover they were immediately engaged by pre-sighted machine guns and overlapping fields of fire.\n\nThe field commander, apparently consumed with rage, ordered continued advance, and though our men eventually overran the commune's outer defenses, they took horrific casualties, and were soon routed by additional militia forces fortified within the town itself. Perhaps knowing what we had in store for them if victorious, very few of our men were permitted to escape, most being shot down as they fled.\n\nDirlewanger himself is furious, and has ordered the commander who gave the order to advance shot, along with any of his senior subordinates who survived.\n\nThough the Brigade can recover its manpower and equipment in time, it is not yet known if we can recover the damage to our dread reputation that this failure has inflicted."
 DRL.204.a: "A defeat, to be sure."
 DRL.205.t: "Strike at the Ural League"
 DRL.205.d: "Dirlewanger has decided: The Brigade rides on the Ural League.\n\nThe League has long been our most committed enemy, and many of our men have lost comrades to them at one time or another, leading to great enthusiasm for any action taken to bring them harm. Harm that is soon to come, as our scouts have identified an excellent target: an occupied prison that the Ural Guard uses for training new militia recruits in methods of village defense.\n\nThough the Guard always fights with determination, and the instructors and senior cadres present at the prison will no doubt do so in even greater fashion, the opportunity cannot be ignored. By killing their recruits we will not only strike at the morale of their rank and file, but may dissuade others from joining them. In addition, our own men will both acquire excellent combat experience as well as improve their techniques for attacking League fortifications and installations.\n\nThe raid will commence soon. To victory!"
 DRL.205.a: "We're breaking INTO a prison?"
 DRL.206.t: "Strike at the Ural League - The Raid Succeeds!"
 DRL.206.d: "Many of the Brigade found the thought of attacking a prison ironic, yet still they approached it with the skill and determination that has made us feared all across the Southern Urals.\n\nIn the dead of night, infiltration specialists, former members of the Waffen-SS, gained entry through the prison's sewer system, and coordinated their assault with that from our main force outside. Attacked from both within and without, the Ural Guard were quickly overwhelmed, many being unable to even reach their weapons.\n\nThough we were victorious, it would appear that the Guard had planned for even such a contingency, as our men, advancing into the fortress, found defensive positions abandoned and evidence of the existence of a number of escape routes. Escape routes that were used when it was clear we were winning.\n\nThough we subsequently inflicted far fewer casualties upon the Guard than expected, we have secured both the base and the armories contained within. We have also proven that even the Guard's most powerful fortresses are not safe from us.\n\nEmphasizing this fact, Dirlewanger ordered the few prisoners taken flayed and hanged from the walls, before we set the buildings alight and retreated with our captured spoils. We have proven our point.\n\nFor now."
 DRL.206.a: "The Guard are not invincible."
 DRL.207.t: "Strike at the Ural League - The Raid Fails!"
 DRL.207.d: "Although we do not yet have all the information, the situation is clear: our strike at the Ural League failed in its objectives. Completely.\n\nBy all accounts, the attack enjoyed initial success, with former Waffen-SS infiltration specialists entering the prison and coordinating their strike on the garrison with our main attack. However, they were unable to secure critical points, including the radio room and armory, in time to prevent the defenders from solidifying their position.\n\nAs a result, the attack turned into a bloodbath, with each position only taken by our forces after a brutal close-quarters fight. Though we did technically 'win,' securing the fortress after many hours and horrendous casualties, the victory can hardly be called such.\n\nMany of our best men are dead, everything of value was either expended or destroyed in the fighting, and the story of the Guard's 'bravery' in opposing our attack is already spreading, no doubt sure to inspire stiff resistance elsewhere. There will, must, be a reckoning for this failure.\n\nDirlewanger will make sure of it."
 DRL.207.a: "For certain, there are more deaths to come."
 DRL.208.t: "Strike at the Peasants"
 DRL.208.d: "Dirlewanger has decided: The Brigade will ride on the peasant settlements around Magnitogorsk.\n\nThough not a particularly dangerous - or lucrative - enemy, and thus unable of inspiring in our men the usual aggression and enthusiasm usually desired for a raid, none can, or would dare, argue that it is not a safe choice.\n\nThough the villages will not have much within them to carry away, absent the people themselves, they should at least provide good sport, and allow us to avoid much planning besides. Lysenko has already informed us that his forces will not intervene, and so we will only need to concern ourselves with whatever pathetic militia the villages attempt to assemble.\n\nIt is time to get to the bloody, and sometimes monotonous, work of killing those who cannot fight back."
 DRL.208.a: "A safe choice."
 DRL.209.t: "Strike at the Peasants - The Raid Succeeds!"
 DRL.209.d: "As expected - the alternative was laughable even to consider - our raid on the Magnitogorsk peasants was a total success.\n\nThe few villages targeted, abandoned by their own supposed protector in Lysenko, stood no chance, with the few men brave enough to pick up weapons killed almost where they stood. The Brigade descended upon them like locusts, often in little more than a mob and absent any real tactics, for such were not needed.\n\nEverything of value, little as it was, was captured, and the people of the villages were processed. Healthy men and women, or at least those women still healthy after our men were through, were loaded up for transport to the Black Mountain, and those deemed unfit were butchered. The children we will keep for ourselves, as new recruits, those made impressionable by youth, are always needed.\n\nWhile we cannot call this raid a great victory, and it will likely be forgotten about in due time, we can at least say that we have profited, and for the Brigade, that is always the goal."
 DRL.209.a: "Exactly as expected."
 DRL.210.t: "Strike at the Peasants - The Raid Fails!"
 DRL.210.d: "We have no idea how this went wrong. We sent in some of the most brutal bastards the world has ever seen against simple peasants in one of the most unremarkable villages in Russia and yet somehow we were beaten back. Our commanders for once are not even bickering about whose fault this was, all in a shock of bafflement about how this happened at all. The only thing we are certain of is that for simple peasants the village was oddly well armed, and certain villagers oddly well trained in uncommon weaponry. This has caused speculation that Lysenko might have violated our agreement and in fact sent aid to the village in some sort of power play against us. With our defeat however we have no evidence of this, and Dirlewanger is unwilling to press his suspicions whilst the Ural League and Orenburg still exist. For now, we must just lick our wounds, and prepare for next time."
 DRL.211.t: "The Battle of Novotroitsk"
 DRL.211.d: "Despite all our victories against the Ural League, its Guard, and other organizations, we have yet to secure a decisive victory. Something that can give us the advantage on a large scale. That changes now.\n\nThe Brigade's scouts have reported that the Ural Guard have established a large concentration of forces around the industrial town of Novotroitsk, no doubt in order to protect the extraction of the rare and extremely valuable composite ores that are located there. Ores that are no doubt critical to the League, both for their own military production and for trade to acquire that which they cannot make themselves.\n\nWe must have this prize, and similarly deny it to them. It will be a bloody, and difficult, battle, against some of the Ural League's best fighters, but the reward is worth it. Dirlewanger himself believes it, and that is, in the end, what matters.\n\nWe will prepare our plan, we will engage the Guard, and once they fall, we will unleash ourselves on Novotroitsk, and take everything it has!"
 DRL.211.a: "Ready the men!"
 DRL.212.t: "The Battle of Novotroitsk - The Outskirts"
 DRL.212.d: "The Battle of Novotroitsk began as our formations approached it, covered by early-morning fog, and began an artillery bombardment of the Ural Guard's outer positions.\n\nGiven the importance of the battle, Dirlewanger had authorized the use of heavy equipment and ammunition reserves not typically accessed, and thus the bombardment, conducted in waves, was one that we knew our enemies did not expect. By the time it ended, three hours later, it was clear that the defenders had been significantly weakened. And then our men were sent in.\n\nThe outer defensive works were quickly taken, but our push into Novotroitsk's suburbs was more strongly resisted, with machine gun fire, from prepared positions, slowing the advance. In the field himself, Dirlewanger ordered smokescreens deployed while flamethrower teams moved to successfully burn out the gun nests.\n\nAlthough it took several more hours to properly secure the rest of the outskirts, the outcome was inevitable, and the Brigade's command post has been moved forward in anticipation of the nest push, into the industrial districts ahead."
 DRL.212.a: "This is shaping up to be a good day."
 DRL.213.t: "The Battle of Novotroitsk - The Industrial District"
 DRL.213.d: "The push into Novitroitsk's industrial areas was critical, since, as the Brigade has often learned to its fury, the Ural Guard would sooner destroy what it possesses than allow us to claim them as our spoils.\n\nAnd, so, our advance into the district was started as soon as our hold on the outskirts was cemented, capitalizing on the momentum possessed. Unfortunately, however, a quick victory was denied us, and brutal fighting, often at close quarters and sometimes in melee, carried on through the afternoon and into the night. Alongside explosions that we knew belonged to the Guard's sabotage teams.\n\nAs the sun rose on the next morning Dirlewanger, enraged at the loss of valuable plunder, ordered an all-out assault, leading to yet another long day of close quarters fighting. A day that in the end, however, brought victory.\n\nThe Brigade has secured the district, but at great cost and with much of it left in ruins. A victory is a victory however, and must be capitalized on. The last area of Novotroitsk that must be taken is the town center, and we move to do so.\n\nImmediately."
 DRL.213.a: "The boys had a blast."
 DRL.214.t: "The Battle of Novotroitsk - The Town Center"
 DRL.214.d: "Operating from our positions in both the suburbs and the industrial zones, the Brigade began its final push on Novotroitsk's town center, intended to finally break the Ural Guard's resistance, alongside the sunrise.\n\nUsing sniper and artillery fire, our forces frustrated attempts by the Guard to affect civilian evacuation, ensuring future captives while also causing obstructions for the Guard themselves. This distraction also allowed elements to advance closer than before under less fire, and thus when the final assault began, it did so from a superior tactical position.\n\nDespite this, however, the Guard resisted fiercely, and close quarters, room-to-room combat became the norm as we moved closer to the town hall itself. As ammunition was expended, rifles and submachine guns became clubs, and debris was turned into improvised weapons. Indeed, and in spite of the hopelessness of the Guard's position, so determined was their defense that it took two further days to break.\n\nBut break it did. With a final push, a shock element of our own stormed the Guard's command post in the town hall and killed the officers within. Organized defense collapsed shortly thereafter, and as the Brigade's flag was unfurled above it, a great cheer rose.\n\nWe have certainly earned this victory - now it is time to enjoy it!"
 DRL.214.a: "Victory is ours!"
 DRL.215.t: "The Battle of Novotroitsk - Victory"
 DRL.215.d: "The Battle of Novotroitsk is over, and the Brigade has, once again, emerged victorious.\n\nAs the last of the Ural Guard's positions were overrun, and those few foolish enough to attempt surrender shot where they stood, the aftermath began. Novotroitsk may be a larger settlement than the Brigade is used to sacking, containing far more people, but the procedure remains the same, and our men are very, very experienced at following it.\n\nAny civilians who had aided the Guard were immediately shot, along with their families. The strongest of those who remained were concentrated together, ready for transport to forced labor camps either in the town itself or in our other territories. Buildings were first ransacked for anything of value, and then burned down in order to send a message. Women were abducted wholesale.\n\nIn the town centre, Dirlewanger himself gave a jubilant speech on a balcony overlooking a bonfire - into which the corpses of the Ural Guard were thrown. The valuables and resources of the town will be a great boon to the Brigade, but the boost in morale is potentially an even greater reward."
 DRL.215.a: "The Guard should have stayed in their fortresses."
 DRL.216.t: "The Battle of Novotroitsk - Defeat"
 DRL.216.d: "Despite our best efforts in the planning, preparation, and execution of our attack on Novotroitsk, the Brigade has been defeated by the Ural Guard.\n\nOur men fought like those possessed, taking much of the town, but resistance proved too strong and with their energy spent they were vulnerable to counterattack. A counterattack which the Guard executed the moment they were able.\n\nTo their credit, the men held out, inflicting grievous casualties in brutal close combat, but in the end they were forced to withdraw lest they face utter annihilation. Our defeat, however, is not total, for the town and the extraction works around it are all but destroyed, impeding their war efforts for a significant period.\n\nStill, this is not the victory we wanted. The victory we deserved. And we must now return to Orsk in that most terrible of conditions - empty-handed."
 DRL.216.a: "Bloody, and ultimately pointless."
 DRL.217.t: "The Second Phase"
 DRL.217.d: "We have been waiting for this day for a very long time, indeed.\n\nThe Ural Guard's defeat at Novotroitsk has left them, at least for the moment, scattered and disorganized, unable to mount effective defense or counterattack. As such, the lands they claim to protect, especially along their borders, are wide open for the Brigade to pillage, and pillage we shall!\n\nIn addition to wealth, women, prisoners, and other items of value, Dirlewanger and his officers have issued specific orders to secure any and all military equipment found. We will, eventually, have to face that madman Lysenko, and the fortifications of the Guard contain much, including heavy weapons and artillery pieces, that could help us when that day comes.\n\nIn addition, the other supplies to be captured, especially foodstuffs from the many farms left equally unprotected, will allow us both to replenish our depleted stocks and establish a strategic reserve.\n\nA reserve that will keep us going for some time. Things are looking up, indeed."
 DRL.217.a: "Take it all!"
 DRL.218.t: "A Second Great Raid"
 DRL.218.d: "Victory breeds complacency, and this is no different for the Brigade. Our men, hardened and skilled, are getting bored with the small-scale raids we have made in recent days. Bored raiders are dangerous raiders, to both friend and foe, and the officers understand this well.\n\nThe decision has therefore been made to carry out a second great raid, and secure much new plunder!. And, just as before, there are three primary options for our officers to choose between.\n\nOrenburg, as always, is the great prize of the Urals, bloated with prisoners, wealth, and 'entertainment' of all kinds. Our men speak of it always, often in hushed tones, and would jump at the chance to ride towards it once again.\n\nThe second group of targets lie in the lands of the Ural League. Though not as wealthy, no group in the region provokes more hatred from our men as the League and its Guard, and that thirst for revenge will no doubt motivate the Brigade to new heights of aggression and slaughter.\n\nFinally, and by far the most ambitious, is the third option. It has been proposed to strike Orenburg and the Ural League both. It would be difficult, to put it mildly, and a great risk, but the reward, both in loot and in dread reputation and fame, would be enormous, and would weaken both our enemies besides."
 DRL.218.a: "Excitement builds."
 DRL.219.t: "Draw Out the Guard"
 DRL.219.d: "The Ural Guard, celebrated by peasants as heroes across the Southern Urals, even far beyond the League's borders, are getting too full of themselves. Every time our men enter their territory, they arrive to stand against us, fighting with utter tenacity. But it is time to show the people that the Guard are not invincible, and that nobody can protect them from us.\n\nWe will launch a series of raids into their lands in order to, if they want to keep their reputation of protection, draw their cowardly garrisons out of their fortresses and into the open. Where they will be vulnerable to attack.\n\nWe will pick a time and place, and then when they are right where we want them, we will strike from all sides and slaughter them to the last man. Surrender will not be offered or accepted, and when the people see the bodies left behind they will know they are truly alone."
 DRL.219.a: "Heroism has no place in these lands."
 DRL.220.t: "Demand Double - Lysenko Sends Half"
 DRL.220.d: "Lysenko, that freak, received our demand for double payment for the last group of captives. And refused.\n\nThe message sent in response, delivered by a very unhappy looking NKVD officer, detailed this refusal, and further warned us that any additional attempts to 'impress' upon him our position of strength could mean a decisive end to the arrangement we have established.\n\nHe is, at least, smart enough to understand that to leave us empty-handed would be a grave mistake, and has sent half of the originally agreed upon payment. Lysenko still has his usefulness to us, but he should make no mistake that we are not happy.\n\nAnd that we will not forget this insult."
 DRL.220.a: "We gambled, and we lost."
 DRL.250.t: "Transfer the Flesh"
 DRL.250.d: "The deal between the Brigade and Lysenko is, at its core, simple.\n\nWe hand over as many prisoners as possible, captured in our many raids as either a primary objective or as a side spoil, for whatever insane experimentations he has planned for them. In return, he transfers a share of the advanced military equipment and other technological wonders of the Black Mountain to our forces.\n\nThough one could not claim that our men are honest, they are, mostly, content with this arrangement. Some, however, complain. And not without cause. They claim that we are doing all of the work, and taking all of the losses, wily Lysenko sits up on his mountain in safety and with his secrets. They say that we deserve a bigger piece of the pie, and that it would be easy to impress this desire upon him, despite the risk to the deal as a whole that it could bring.\n\nSome of our officers are starting to listen. Should we encourage this?"
 DRL.250.a: "Decisions, decisions."
 DRL.251.t: "Hand Them Over"
 DRL.251.d: "Nobody could, or would, deny that Lysenko is a strange one. That does not mean he is stupid, and he ensures his own security by only ever personally appearing to deal with Dirlewanger himself.\n\nPersonnel transactions are always overseen by one of his functionaries, and today was no different. Our men, arriving with the latest group of captives taken were met by one such functionary, and given the decision not to press for more from the Black Mountain, business proceeded as usual. The chattel were then led away, towards whatever end Lysenko and his mad cabal had in mind for them, and truckloads of equipment were brought forward in payment.\n\nWe were, unfortunately, given no choice in exactly what was exchanged, as Lysenko had apparently already compiled and pre-approved a list. Not all of it is perfectly suited for our needs, but enough of it is, and everything is of sufficient quality besides.\n\nIt will do. For now."
 DRL.251.a: "There must be honor amongst thieves."
 DRL.252.t: "The Deal Changed - Lysenko Agrees"
 DRL.252.d: "Our man at Black Mountain has sent back word that Lysenko has surrendered to our demands for an increased payment for the captives we are delivering. We get the impression he is by no means pleased by our sudden change of heart, but we don't really care if he likes it or not. All that matters is that the madman caved like the cowardly creature he is, and extra supplies will reach our boys from now on."
 DRL.252.a: "Slavery is a lucrative business."
 DRL.253.t: "The Deal Changed"
 DRL.253.d: "Lysenko is, undeniably, a pretty weird guy. He rarely seems to leave his laboratories, more of a cowering creature than a man. He never deals with anyone from our side other than Dirlewanger himself, alway sending one of his equally weird 'assistants' to oversee the transactions between us. Today, as our slavemaster arrived at Black Mountain with our latest haul of captives, it was business as usual.\n\nThat was the case at least until one of the scientists remarked how impressed they were with the number of 'specimens' we were providing, to which our man replied it was easy when we have as many men as we do, ready to fight anywhere, and anyone, at a moments notice.\n\nWorried by the possible implication, Lysenko's lackeys tried to wrap the deal up quickly. But with Dirlewanger's authorization, our man informed them the deal had changed. We have been taking the risks, so we want more than the previously negotiated amount. The 'or else' was not said, but clearly implied.\n\nLyseko's assistant has retreated, claiming the demand can only be accepted or denied by the mad scientist himself."
 DRL.253.a: "Brains versus brawn, it seems."
 DRL.254.t: "The Deal Changed - Lysenko Stands Firm."
 DRL.254.d: "Having sent our slavemaster to Black Mountain, we expected that he would come back victorious with extra spoils now we have decided to confront Lysenko on the matter of the value of our prisoners. What we did not expect, however, was that Lysenko would actually have a spine when threatened.\n\nToday we received the charred bodies of our slavemasters bodyguards, the slavemaster himself having vanished from the face of the earth as far as we can tell. Accompanying the bodies was a written note from Lysenko claiming that the group had attempted to change the regular deal when they arrived, which Lysenko was 'certain was against their orders, going by our previous agreements' and was a simple 'matter of thuggish extortion'.\n\nAs punishment Lysenko 'exterminated' them, and has informed us due to our 'inability to install discipline in our dignitaries' that we will be receiving no payment for this batch of captives at all, which we will not be getting back either."
 DRL.254.a: "You win this round, freak."
 DRL.255.t: "Demand Double - Lysenko Sends Double."
 DRL.255.d: "Our favorite freak Lysenko has caved to our demands for double the payment for the latest batch of captives, the supplies finally reaching us today. Apparently whilst displeased at our extortion attempt, he is of the opinion that the better supplied we are the more of our joint enemies we will be able to kill. He has no idea we will indeed use this equipment to kill our enemies, Lysenko himself among them."
 DRL.255.a: "We'll put these to good use alright."
 DRL.256.t: "Harry the Stragglers"
 DRL.256.d: "The fire of our hearts is consuming the lands of the Ural League, burning hotter and brighter with each passing day. Now their people are refugees, fleeing as fast as their little feet can carry them from our advance. During the days our scouts stalk their columns of broken vermin, trudging forth with sorrow in their eyes and defeat in their hearts. At night, when they seek some small respite in sleep, our men descend to awaken them to a nightmare. We kill their men with savagery, relieve our frustrations with their women, and take their children to serve us. Any supplies they have are taken before we finally just burn it all to the ground. At night our men no longer navigate by the stars, but by the fires across the land."
 DRL.256.a: "Beloretsk will be our north star."
 DRL.257.t: "The World Turned Upside Down!"
 DRL.257.d: "It was a fools notion, that all those pathetic communes would ever be able to mount any kind of defense against us. They were living in a fantasy, but we have forced them to realize the truth of their utopia. They thought the Ural Guard would protect them, it was as a lie. They thought their leaders would protect them, it was a lie. They thought, at the very least, they could protect each other...but it was a lie. The landscape is filled with the ashen husks of these communes, littered with the dead and pillaged of all valuables. So often we find that their people have chosen to die by their own hand rather than ours when we arrive, and we relish in it for they have finally seen our truth. The fantasy is over, their utopia has fallen."
 DRL.257.a: "They belonged in a children's book, not life."
 DRL.258.t: "Salt the Earth!"
 DRL.258.d: "Ever since there were armies, their commanders have usually realised that an army only marches on its stomach. They may want for much more, but they need their food. We have come across crop fields aplenty in Orenburg's lands, enough to feed our army well. They certainly need it with all the effort they've been putting in to kill these miserable people. But just as our army marches on its stomach, so does theirs. And so we shall leave nothing for them!\n\nOur boys have set to work throwing salt into the earth after we have taken the crops, as well as filling them with landmines. Wells have been poisoned, often by dropping dead cattle inside. Irrigation and waterways have been destroyed. Pipes have been ripped up from the ground, wires ripped from the walls. We have taken the spoils of this land, and now no-one will ever be able to use it again."
 DRL.258.a: "We are the end times."
 DRL.259.t: "Let All Know Fear..."
 DRL.259.d: "We have come to a most delicious realization; we have inflicted such horror and terror on these people that we have begun to cross the line into myth. It all started with a scouts report that a grandmother had told her grandson that if he did not eat, Dirlewanger would come and snatch him away. We kept our ears open, and heard so much more.\n\nApparently our horses charge in with hooves of blazing fire. Dirlewanger has burning coals for eyes, rotten skin and the legs of a goat. Our men have superhuman strength and the genitalia of horses. Our weapons were blessed by the devil himself to inflict as much pain as possible. We take our prisoners and sacrifice them to Hitler, who has ascended to godhood following his death. We are so powerful because we have the ability to raise the dead after each battle to swell our corrupted ranks.\n\nThese are all highly entertaining, but more importantly, are proof that we will live on in history as utter villains, right where we wanted to be. Our names will last a thousand years!"
 DRL.259.a: "We could never be a page in someone else's history book!"
 DRL.260.t: "The Plot Begins..."
 DRL.260.d: "As terrifying as the SS truly are, they have one fatal weakness. Just like the rest of us, they are only human. With each year passed, with each battle fought, more and more of the original members of Dirlewanger's brigade have died, forcing them to accept more and more local recruits. Recruits who know all too well the brutality and horrors inflicted upon their country and themselves at the hands of the Germans. The time has come to extract our revenge, bring down Dirlewanger and kick these German scum out of our lands!"
 DRL.260.a: "Now is the time, and we will risk everything."
 DRL.261.t: "An Offer is Made..."
 DRL.261.d: "A man can be pushed, and pushed, but he can only be pushed so far. Many of the Russians in the brigade came willingly to Dirlewanger's banner, seeking an escape from their poverty stricken lives badly enough they were willing to deal with the devil to do so. Already we have enacted terrible raids against Russian communities, done unspeakable things, to say nothing of Dirlewanger's actions during the war. But now we hear he has plans for unprecedented attacks against the Ural League and Orenburg, and the Russians have finally reached their breaking point.\n\nWe don't know how they learned, but they have come to us and informed us they wish to join our plot to murder Dirlewanger. The only condition of their loyalty is that we also kill every single German son of a bitch around..."
 DRL.261.a: "...and of course we accept!"
 DRL.262.t: "Approaching the Taken..."
 DRL.262.d: "Before the Brigade reached Orsk, we went through territory now calling itself 'Nowa Polska', a most curious place filled with ethnic Kazakhs and Poles aplenty. The result was a number of raids that pressed many refugees into our service almost always against their will. These people know just as well as the Russians the atrocities Dirlewanger and his Germans have enacted against innocent people.\n\nWhilst he was on patrol, our plotters met with the leader of the Polish-Kazakh faction within the Brigade and asked them to join us. The man agreed on the spot, and we spent the rest of the patrol through the woodland discussing what part they would play in the scheme. In return, besides the sheer pleasure of having Dirlewanger dead, we have promised that they will be allowed to return to Nowa Polska freely after the deed is done."
 DRL.262.a: "The past will come for Dirlewanger, and it will strike hard."
 DRL.263.t: "To the Highest Bidder..."
 DRL.263.d: "We have secured the support of the two largest non-German factions within the Brigade, but there is another group who might interfere with our plans if we do not bring them over to our side. A number of mercenary groups of all kinds have been brought into the service of Dirlewanger, drawn in by the promises of plentiful plunder, bloodshed and women. Yet these men were bought, they care nothing for Dirlewanger himself. We know, in fact, some actively dislike him. These people sell themselves to the highest bidder, and all we need to do is put in that higher bid.\n\nWe have held secret meetings with the most powerful of these mercenary leaders. As we suspected, they can be convinced to accept a better offer from us and abandon Dirlewanger, but it will not be cheap. After many nights of negotiations, we have come to two deals they would be willing to accept. Either we grant them significant manpower from our faction, to make up for the recruits they would take in Dirlewanger's conquests, or we promise them almost the entirety of Dirlewanger's plunder stores. It's a hard choice, but what will we agree to?"
 DRL.263.a: "Give them their men."
 DRL.263.b: "They can take their riches, then be gone."
 DRL.264.t: "Their Last Meal..."
 DRL.264.d: "We have instilled chaos amongst the Germans within our ranks, exactly as we planned. With the Russians, Kazakhs, Poles and the mercenaries committed to our plot it was a simple matter. The Germans simply consider themselves above us, above the most basic and 'dirty' of tasks. As a result, it is from the ranks of our plotters that the food preparation staff are drawn. From there, it was a simple matter to poison the meals of as many Germans as possible one evening.\n\nBy the end of the night it had been announced that some kind of epidemic had been rapidly spreading through the camp with a large number of casualties, including the entirety of Dirlewanger's elite guards. There are a number of theories spreading about what had happened, with the two dominant theories being either the Ural Guard managed to tamper with our supplies or Lysenko had unleashed a new weapon upon us.\n\nBy the time the truth is fully understood, there will be almost no-one alive who cares it was us."
 DRL.264.a: "Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."
 DRL.265.t: "The Assassination of Oskar Dirlewanger."
 DRL.265.d: "It had snowed heavily during the night, leaving a crisp morning as Dirlewanger had walked from the latrine back towards his tent. The first blade came as if from nowhere, cutting deep into his side. Then another blade came for him, and another, and then another. One by one they came, and by the time it was over Dirlewanger had been stabbed over two dozen times. Collapsing to the ground, mortally wounded, he could not speak. With the last of his strength all he could do was bring his fur lined cloak to cover his face, hiding his gaze from his betrayers.\n\nBy midday most of the band had left, packing up what supplies they could and heading off in all directions to either form their own bands or go on to their next adventure. All that remained were the empty tents waving in the wind, the embers of the fires and Dirlewanger's lifeless body, left openly in the snow."
 DRL.265.a: "Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Dirlewanger."
 DRL.266.t: "Deep in the West"
 DRL.266.d: "Our commanders have been arguing for weeks on how best to strike against Orenburg this time around, but none of the presented plans have felt right to Dirlewanger. We want to show those foolish peasants what true freedom is, and so the solution was rather simple Dirlewanger has realised.\n\nWe will send a large force of our boys deep into their territory and then simply...let them loose. We will let them go forth and do whatever it is they feel like doing, consequence free, for an entire week. The only requirements are that they report back to camp once the time has expired, they don't kill any of their officers, and they cause as much trouble as possible."
 DRL.266.a: "This...this will be all kinds of fun!"
 DRL.267.t: "Deep in the West - An Overwhelming Success!"
 DRL.267.d: "A week has passed, and our boys are returning from the lands around Orenburg having been let free from their leashes for a time. Not all of our men have returned, some having been lost to clashes with the Orenburg populace, or killed by our own men over disagreements they were finally free to resolve. But among those who have returned, morale has never been higher.\n\nOur officers are reporting that we had been actually underestimating the cruelty our boys were capable of, and when given a week free of consequence let their true colors shine.\n\nVillages have been burned, cattle slaughtered, old men fed to dogs, crop fields destroyed, wells poisoned, countless lynched, riches looted, alcohol abused, and women tortured so badly no-one in the band can claim to be innocent of sodomy anymore. Those are only a small portion of what they managed to inflicted to boot.\n\nThey have brought back riches and slaves aplenty, along with shining smiles that warm Dirlewanger's old heart in these cold lands."
 DRL.267.a: "Now that's some fine shore leave."
 DRL.268.t: "Penetrate the Mountains"
 DRL.268.d: "The show these bastards are putting on is getting real old, real fast. 'The Saviors of the Urals' the people call them, the last line of defense between life and, well, us. We have launched countless raids into their territory over the years with mixed success, but this time we will beat them one step back towards their grave. Rather than another regular skirmish, we shall mobilize a full scale raid!\n\nWe shall launch simultaneous strikes against three locations within League territory:\n\nAn old Soviet airstrip turned ammunition depot, an old sports stadium which has been converted into a refugee camp and finally an Ural Guard field command post.\n\nAlongside these strikes, two dozen smaller raids will be launched along the border to keep the Guard distracted from our main targets."
 DRL.268.a: "Three is a magic number."
 DRL.269.t: "Penetrate the Mountains - The Results"
 DRL.269.d: "We came, we saw, we set their world on fire! Our great raid against the Ural League has been a success on all fronts, the Guard left reeling from our attacks.\n\nAt the airstrip, our forces assaulted the base fiercely in close combat, savagely overwhelming the ill prepared garrison with knives, glass, and knuckles just as often as bullets. As the blood saturated the soil, we filled out trucks with as much as they could carry before detonating what remained of the ammunition depot, along with the fuel stocks, and destroyed the runway. We didn't find any planes there, but better to be safe than sorry.\n\nOver at the sports stadium, our boys struck in the night. Blocking the exits, they proceeded to throw petrol bombs into the refugee camp inside. The fires spread rapidly across the tents, screams engulfing the nights silence. Anyone lucky enough to manage to climb over the walls were promptly shot as a reward.\n\nFinally, part of our Waffen-SS unit specializing in stealth assaulted an Ural Guard command post. Dozens were killed in their beds, throats slit, along with the assassination of three senior officers. All radio equipment was wrecked and any documents of interest taken, including a couple of maps which will surely prove useful in future attacks.\n\nThe three attacks combined with the smaller distraction raids across the border have caused widespread confusion and terror, along with seriously crippling the Ural Guard for a few weeks at least."
 DRL.269.a: "The scent of victory, and flesh, is in the air."
 DRL.270.t: "The Pincer."
 DRL.270.d: "Okay, let's do this. We didn't get where we are today without taking risks. We are here because we are the toughest, ballsiest sons of bitches around and it's high time we remind everyone else!\n\nDirlewanger has authorized simultaneous raids against Orenburg and the Ural League both, splitting our forces in two. It will be difficult, launching these attacks not throwing our full force into either, but the rewards we might take will be glorious.\n\nIn Orenburg we will send half of our boys deep into their territory and then simply...let them loose. We will let them go forth and do whatever it is they feel like doing, consequence free, for three days. The only requirements are that they report back to camp once the time has expired, they don't kill any of their officers, and they cause as much trouble as possible.\n\nThe other half of our forces will be sent across the border with the League and launch three simultaneous strikes against one of their ammunition depots in an old Soviet airfield, a refugee camp based out of an old sports stadium and an Ural Guard command post.\n\nNeither raid will have reinforcements, so it will be do or die. The perfect chance for our boys to prove themselves."
 DRL.270.a: "This will be our grandest offensive yet!"
 DRL.271.t: "The Pincer - Success in Orenburg!"
 DRL.271.d: "Three days have passed, and our boys are returning from the lands around Orenburg having been let free from their leashes for a time. Not all of our men have returned, some having been lost to clashes with the Orenburg populace, or killed by our own men over disagreements they were finally free to resolve. But among those who have returned, morale has never been higher.\n\nOur officers are reporting that we had been actually underestimating the cruelty our boys were capable of, and when given a week free of consequence let their true colors shine. Villages have been burned, cattle slaughtered, crop fields destroyed, wells poisoned, scores lynched, riches looted, alcohol abused, and women tortured so badly no-one in the band can claim to be innocent of sodomy anymore.\n\nHad we given them more time, and sent the full force of our men, they could have achieved much more we are certain. But they have brought back riches and slaves aplenty, along with shining smiles that warm Dirlewanger's old heart in these cold lands."
 DRL.271.a: "Now that's some fine shore leave."
 DRL.272.t: "The Pincer - Mixed Results in Orenburg"
 DRL.272.d: "Three days have passed, and our boys are beginning to return from the lands around Orenburg having been let free from their leashes for a time. It wouldn't be right to call the outcome a failure, but it hasn't been a particular success either.\n\nHaving split our forces in half, our commanders are now of the opinion we simply were not able to give our boys enough time to cause the trouble we wanted them to, nor did they have the numbers to do any of the really good stuff.\n\nCrops have been burned, riches looted, women sodomized and wells poisoned, but we have failed to make this raid truly 'great' like we wanted and it will surely be remembered alongside of all of our others."
 DRL.272.a: "Hopefully there is more success against the League."
 DRL.273.t: "The Pincer - Success Against the League!"
 DRL.273.d: "We came, we saw, we set their world on fire! Our great raid against the Ural League has been a success on all fronts, the Guard left reeling from our attacks.\n\nAt the airstrip, our forces assaulted the base fiercely in close combat, savagely overwhelming the ill prepared garrison with knives, glass, and knuckles just as often as bullets. As the blood saturated the soil, we filled out trucks with as much as they could carry before detonating what remained of the ammunition depot, along with the fuel stocks, and destroyed the runway. We didn't find any planes there, but better to be safe than sorry.\n\nOver at the sports stadium, our boys struck in the night.

Anyone lucky enough to manage to climb over the walls were promptly shot as a reward.\n\nFinally, part of our Waffen-SS unit specializing in stealth assaulted an Ural Guard command post. Dozens were killed in their beds, throats slit, along with the assassination of three senior officers. All radio equipment was wrecked and any documents of interest taken, including a couple of maps which will surely prove useful in future attacks.\n\nHad we launched a full scale raid ignoring Orenburg, we might have been able to do more, but this is a fine victory regardless."
 DRL.273.a: "The scent of victory, and flesh, is in the air."
 DRL.274.t: "The Pincer - Failure Against the League"
 DRL.274.d: "We have succeeded in our great raid against the Ural League, but is has come at a terrible cost.\n\nAt the airstrip, our forces assaulted the base fiercely in close combat, savagely overwhelming the ill prepared garrison with knives, glass, and knuckles just as often as bullets. As the blood saturated the soil, we filled out trucks with as much as they could carry before detonating what remained of the ammunition depot, along with the fuel stocks, and destroyed the runway. We didn't find any planes there, but better to be safe than sorry.\n\nOver at the sports stadium, our boys struck in the night.

Dozens were killed in their beds, throats slit, along with the assassination of three senior officers. All radio equipment was wrecked and any documents of interest taken, including a couple of maps which will surely prove useful in future attacks.\n\nHowever our commanders had argued we needed to also launch numerous smaller raids along the border to prevent the Ural Guard from organizing a response, but this became impossible with the commitment to also send men to Orenburg.\n\nAs a result, following their successes our men were confronted by the Guard before they could return to our lands and we took heavy losses before they were finally able to escape."
 DRL.274.a: "A tragic end to a wonderful achievement."
 DRL.275.t: "Honor the Deal"
 DRL.275.d: "It has been a couple of months since our last exchange with our favorite freak Lysenko. Now following our recent great raid we have fresh captives that he will no doubt be excited to get his hands on. Whilst there are still voices within the band who argue that we should be taking more and more reward with each captive handed over, Dirlewanger has chosen to ignore them. We have more immediate fights against the Ural League and Orenburg approaching, it is not worth antagonizing Black Mountain just yet. As per the deal, we have sent our captives over to the scientists and have received our equipment in return."
 DRL.275.a: "A good deal all round."
 DRL.276.t: "나치식 경례를 포기해야 하나?"
 DRL.276.d: "우리가 총통에게 충성을 바치던 시절은 옛날 이야기지만, 그 시절의 방식들은 여전히 제자리를 지키고 있습니다. 그 중 하나는 나치식 경례이며, 종종 \"지크 하일!\"이라는 문구가 곁들여졌습니다. 물론, 우리가 조국에게 배신당한 이후로, 더 이상 우리에게 나치당은 존재하지 않습니다. 그 경례는 부대 내 독일인들에게 의해 디를레방어에 대한 존경과 충성의 의미로 바뀌었습니다.\n\n여단에 비독일인 대원의 수가 증가하고 있고, 우리가 더 이상 라이히에 충성하지 않는다는 사실 때문에 많은 우리 대원들은 우리가 왜 아직도 이런 경례를 취하고 있는지 의문을 제기하고 있습니다. 우리는 나치식 경례를 내던져버려야 할까요? 아니면 이 경례의 사용을 독려해야 할까요?"
 DRL.276.a: "경례는 단순한 몸짓 이상의 의미가 있다. 계속 유지해."
 DRL.276.b: "우리는 독일 없이 우리 스스로의 운명을 개척하고 있다. 경례를 버려."
 DRL.277.t: "우리 중 가장 나이가 많은 이가 죽었다"
 DRL.277.d: "We have few ties to our homeland, back when we were a mere SS Division. Aside from some uniforms, flags and general memorabilia the largest of these connections are the original German members of the Brigade who have always held a special place for Dirlewanger. Yet our oldest member, Karl Wilhelm Müller, has died at the age of 73. Suffering from ailing health for the last few years, he suffered a stroke in camp two days ago which proved to be the last that he could take, finally passing away this morning.\n\nThe loss is being felt hard by the other members of the 'old guard' in the band, but importantly is beginning to raise questions about what exactly will happen if old age becomes brave enough to come after Dirlewanger."
 DRL.277.a: "Rest in peace, old friend."
 DRL.278.t: "Tensions within the Band"
 DRL.278.d: "Our band of merry maniacs is many things, but unified is far from one of them. Within our ranks are Germans, Austrians, Poles, Kazakhs, Russians, Ukrainians and among them criminals, political prisoners, sadists, rejects, concentration camp prisoners and lunatics. That is only a fraction of our composition these days to boot. As it turns out, all these different groups have difficulties getting along and a number of factions exist within the Brigade.\n\nWe have been aware of these tensions for some time due to the issues they have sometimes caused in the field with the following of orders, but this seems to have boiled over last night. After one too many drinks two of these factions came to blows, a massive brawl erupting in the middle of the camp as other groups got involved as well.\n\nCurious as to how it would play out, survival of the fittest and all, Dirlewanger allowed it to continue to its natural conclusion without his interference. By morning, eight were dead and twenty three more injured.\n\nThe surviving lead instigators have been executed for their roles in the brawl, and for now peace has returned. But this has once again raised the question of what exactly will happen one day when Dirlewanger dies and the unifying force of the band is gone."
 DRL.278.a: "Good to get it out of their system, now back to work."
 DRL.279.t: "Downed Luftwaffe Pilot Captured!"
 DRL.279.d: "Yesterday the band was thrown into disarray when a large snowstorm flared up seemingly out of nowhere, and moved straight through the camp. This morning we assessed the damage, with our equipment being the main thing affected along with scattered tents and minor injuries.\n\nYet with a clearer view of our surroundings, we have discovered something infinitely more interesting. Searching after some of the scattered equipment our boys discovered a downed Luftwaffe fighter along with its pilot, injured but alive. It would seem that the pilot had been on a terror bombing mission over Orsk when the snowstorm forced him to crash.\n\nInterrogating and torturing him thoroughly, we have learned a number of things about our former homeland. It seems Hitler is still Führer but Germany faces increasing unrest from within, and that there has been a great split between the Reich and the SS. Each word ripped open our old wounds, and the pilot has been hung from the nearest tree."
 DRL.279.a: "We'll make them all pay, one day..."
 DRL.280.t: "Fire in Orsk!"
 DRL.280.d: "Whilst our band moves around a lot to raid, our main base remains in the captured city of Orsk which we return to as needed. However we care far more about loot, slaves and bloodshed than we do about actually running some miserable city and so it largely lacks any form of administration.\n\nIt turns out this is not always to our benefit however, and the lack of oversight as well as the general piss-poor state of Orsk's infrastructure has resulted in a fire. We are not sure how it started, but a number of buildings and lives have been lost to the blaze.\n\nThankfully the majority of our spoils and slaves have been left intact, but the fires did ravage a section of the factory district, impacting what little industry we have."
 DRL.280.a: "We'll just have to do some more looting then!"
 DRL.281.t: "콜레라 발생!"
 DRL.281.d: "Life in the Urals is one of extremes for our merry band. We drink alcohol excessively, yet finding clean water is a rarity outside of winter. We feast on the spoils of our raids, yet face rotten and poorly cooked meals in leaner times. Often on the move, our sanitation situation is a complete monstrosity. Combined with how often we deal with the dead, the risk of disease is significant.\n\nUnfortunately one such situation has developed, with one of our few doctors reporting Cholera has broken out in camp. Over sixty men are infected, many seriously with twelve casualties so far. Among our prisoners and slaves scores are infected due to their particularly bad living conditions.\n\nWith the scarcity of medical supplies out here, the numbers are expected to rise and get worse before it gets better. There is little we can do but wait out the outbreak, bury our dead and move on."
 DRL.281.a: "우리 애들은 약탈에서 죽어야 했어, 이렇게 죽는게 아니라."
 DRL.282.t: "The Most Dangerous Game"
 DRL.282.d: "Morale has been going steady lately, but it can always been improved and so Dirlewanger has arranged for a contest to be held within the Brigade. All members are welcome to participate, but all who wish to partake are required to pay an entry fee of a certain percentage of their spoil stashes. The winner will then take all of the spoils put into the pot, along with receiving a gift from Dirlewanger himself.\n\nThe game is simple: At dawn a number of our slaves and prisoners will be set free and unknown to them given a three hour head start. Then the contestants are set loose and the aim of the game is to return after twelve hours with as many heads as possible, the man with the most heads wins.\n\nThe competition has been a great success, even if more heads did come back than we actually sent out."
 DRL.282.a: "We should do this more often!"
 DRL.283.t: "Ural League Spy Captured"
 DRL.283.d: "'String him up!'\n\n'Kill the bastard!'\n\n'Cut off his cock and shove it down his throat!'\n\nThese were the cries echoing through the camp as the beaten and bloodied form of our 'guest' was dragged through the mud to the center of camp. We discovered him scurrying through our supplies like the rat that he is, and following a thorough session of torture it was discovered that the man is in fact a spy for the Ural League.\n\nIt's almost a compliment that they find the notion of fighting us daunting enough they want to gage our strength and supplies with subterfuge. We do like it when people pay us the proper respect after all, but this is a step too far.\n\nBrought before all to see, the spy was tied to a pyre and set alight, his screams matched only by the howls of the wolves. We'll dump the body at the border and let it serve as a message.\n\nIf they want to judge our strength, they can do it whilst we're killing them."
 DRL.283.a: "I spy, with my little eye..."
 DRL.284.t: "Is There a Doctor in the House?"
 DRL.284.d: "Today has been a bountiful day indeed. Whilst scouting out the lands of Orsk for any targets we might raid between larger raids on our enemies, we have discovered an operational hospital which had managed to escape our notice.\n\nUntil today, that is.\n\nHearing the report, Dirlewanger immediately ordered the raid and our boys descended. We faced only minor resistance from a civilian force, which we overwhelmed with ease, then went after the spoils. In a part of the world where medicine is difficult to come by, the medical supplies we have captured are worth their weight in gold and then some. Combined with the beautiful nurses we found and the few doctors we have pressed into service this had been a great day for the band. Any patients we found in the hospital have been executed and the building itself set ablaze."
 DRL.284.a: "They will serve us, or they will die."
 DRL.285.t: "An Excellent Hunting Scene"
 DRL.285.d: "There is only so much that can be raided, and as our band has grown so too has our demand for the most basic of goods. The need for meat but more importantly furs to protect us against the bitter winters here led to the formation of hunters within our ranks, responsible for doing just that whilst the rest of us raid, recover and raid some more.\n\nListening to the reports, it appears that we have had a particularly good hunting season this year. A large number of wolf, bear and elk furs have been secured for our stores and will be distributed among those most deserving of Dirlewanger's favor within the band.\n\nA little competition never hurt anybody, and the rewards make themselves clear in times like these."
 DRL.285.a: "Out here, a good fur is the difference between life and death."
 DRL.286.t: "Winter Attrition"
 DRL.286.d: "Prepare as we have, the Russian winters are perhaps our match in terms of their cruelty. So often even the strongest and bravest of men can do nothing against the bitter cold and harsh landscape.\n\nWhilst we Germans are undoubtedly superior to these Russians, we are not invulnerable nor immune to these temperatures. So far the cold has claimed the lives of twenty-seven of our men, usually slipping away from us during the night.\n\nIt is sobering to face our vulnerability and insignificance against these bitter feats of nature, yet we know that once we are through it it will be proof yet again of why we are the toughest, meanest sons of bitches these lands have ever seen!"
 DRL.286.a: "The cold cannot freeze pure Aryan blood!"
 DRL.287.t: "Frozen in Time"
 DRL.287.d: "As winter continues we have come across a most fascinating sight. Buried within the snow and ice we have discovered a small detachment of T-26 tanks and the frozen skeletal remains of a number of Soviet soldiers. We suspect they must have been on their way to the front during the German invasion of the Soviet Union all those years ago, only to be claimed by the freezing temperatures before they could arrive.\n\nIt is a beautiful though haunting sight, a reminder of who we once were and how far we have come since. The equipment is beyond repair and so we must leave it, but the reminder that men are not the only enemy we face out here will stick in our minds for some time."
 DRL.287.a: "We shall not suffer the same fate."
 DRL.288.t: "Chasing Scraps"
 DRL.288.d: "The League is dead, and the path to Orenburg lays wide open! This sounds like a great thing, something to celebrate as we pillage whatever pathetic holdings the League held across the mountains, but there is no celebration in Dirlewanger's camps.\n\nAs what meager loot was found is piled at the feet of the Bandit King, he seethes. His men have already begun chasing what few survivors remain, but the road to the Ural's riches remain closed for him. His men were too slow, and Lysenko has already taken most of the mountain for himself, ignoring Dirlewanger's demands for his rightful pillage.\n\nEvery gun piled in front of him, every small piece of jewelry and scant scrap of loot only drives his anger further. How dare that bitch of a scientist shun him like this? How dare him!? HOW DARE HE!?\n\nThere will be righteous revenge in time. For now, Dirlewanger looks to Orenburg. After that, who can say?"
 DRL.288.a: "We're coming, you lab coat wearing cunt."
 DRL.300.t: "King of the Mountain"
 DRL.300.d: "This has been a long journey, longer and bloodier than any of our band ever expected all those years ago. When we were simply the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' of the SS, no-one would have guessed twenty years later we would have endured what we have endured, done what we have done. The best part? We know in our hearts that no-one, no-one, else could have done this but us. All of our efforts have led us here, to this moment, to this great conquest.\n\nThe madman Lysenko was once our ally, and a valuable one at that. But he has finally reached the end of his usefulness to us now that the Ural League is destroyed and Orenburg thoroughly pillaged. Black Mountain is home to technological and scientific marvels that baffle the mind, that belong in novels rather than reality. We have enjoyed these fruits over time, but why just have the occasional fruit when you can own the whole damn tree? Black Mountain will be the true jewel in our crown, and once it is ours we will be truly unstoppable."
 DRL.300.a: "Now is the time, and we will risk everything."
 DRL.301.t: "King of the Mountain - Black Mountain taken!"
 DRL.301.d: "It was long, and it was hard, but we have done it. The last defenders have crumbled, and Black Mountain is ours at long last. For the first time in our conquests our men were sent against a professional military force, Lysenko's 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD. Whilst not the force it once was, when combined with the fences, tall walls, minefields and gun nests defending the mountain base, it was not an easy fight. Yet as soon as we pushed into the laboratories, how quickly our boys longed to fight soldiers again.\n\nWe had no idea of the extent of Lysenko's experiments, and our people encountered trap after trap as we attempted to secure the interior. Electric traps which boiled their blood, concussive waves which blew out their eyeballs, poison gas melting their lungs, legions of crazed experiments charging with filthy knives and brute force. The survivors will never forget the horrors of those laboratories, but finally we secured Black Mountain for ourselves. We have captured numerous fascinating pieces of equipment and revolutionary research, along with many of Lysenko's scientists working on the Mountain.\n\nYet captured soldiers are telling us Lysenko became obsessed with not allowing his work to fall into 'uneducated barbaric' hands, and so detonated explosives in many of his deeper labs holding his most prized experiments. Whether he was able to flee or burned with his work is unknown, but no trace has been found alive or dead."
 DRL.301.a: "I hope we found some of those stylish white coats."
 DRL.302.t: "Victory against the Ural League!"
 DRL.302.d: "The lands under the 'protection' of the Ural League are now ours. The Ural Guard has been completely broken and their government crushed. Fires consume their gulag fortresses with their lands now wide open for plunder. And plunder we shall!\n\nWe shall cripple these people so badly they will never rise again, we shall turn this land to ash and salt. Let what happens here serve as a message for what happens when you dare to stand against the Dirlewanger Brigade!"
 DRL.302.a: "Let the League be lost to history."
 DRL.303.t: "Victory against Orenburg!"
 DRL.303.d: "Orenburg has fallen, their communes burn and their lands are ours at last! Just as with the Ural League we shall extract such vengeance and horror upon these lands it will send a chill down the spine of Russians everywhere!\n\nNever again will this 'social experiment' of theirs be allowed to exist anywhere near us, we shall leave no trace of these fools for anyone to find. We shall render this land inhospitable, the only fitting punishment."
 DRL.303.a: "Orenburg is finished, good riddance."
 DRL.304.t: "Victory Against Lysenko!"
 DRL.304.d: "After the capture of Black Mountain, it was merely a matter of time. With the last of Lysenko's forces melting away we have secured the lands of Magnitogorsk for ourselves. There is not allot within these lands, many of the people having fled Lysenko's grasp or having been consumed by it. But just because there isn't the people, doesn't mean there is not plenty of loot they left behind!\n\nThe conquests of the Ural League, Orenburg and now Magnitogorsk have taken their toll on our boys, but we shall give them free reign to loot, burn and kill all they wish within these lands.\n\nWith the Urals now ours, let the world know no-one can stand against us!"
 DRL.304.a: "Your experiments are finally over, Lysenko."
 DRL.305.t: "To Each According to His Ability"
 DRL.305.d: "One of the men who accompanied our latest raid has found himself before Dirlewanger himself today, as a disagreement between he and his commanding officer has gained notoriety within the camp. The soldier has made the audacious claim that he is not being provided with enough for all that he does for the raids, and that those who plunder the most should henceforth receive the most. He continues on to claim that the officer refuses to provide the men their fair share, and brazenly states that the officer's own contributions pale in comparison to his, something not represented in the rewards.\n\nNot willing to let his arguments be dismissed, the soldier produces a small sack of 'evidence'. The bag of evidence produced a foul smell that, upon opening, was revealed to be quite a brutal bounty. Inside laid at least a dozen pairs of strung together ears, ones that the soldier claimed to have removed from his victims during the raiding. The soldier continued to rant about how this was proof enough that he deserved far more loot than he was given, and that he demanded rewards to match his far superior contributions to the cause. All eyes were on Dirlewanger to set the precedent for the future."
 DRL.305.a: "Shoot this punk, find his officer."
 DRL.305.b: "Yes, kill him, but look into his evidence."
 DRL.306.t: "눈부신 무능력"
 DRL.306.d: "Dirlewanger took time out of his extremely busy schedule today to utterly lay into the so called idiot officer that started the argument over the proper allotment of loot for soldiers. More than a few in the camp believed this to be the final moments of the officer, as Dirlewanger went on a tirade against him. The officer was insulted in various ways, ranging from being a 'fucking moron' to being 'up for castration and demotion into a human shield'. The smack and storm flowing out of Dirlewanger's mouth was truly a sight to behold for those that were present, as the verbal annihilation of the man went on for a considerable length of time. Dirlewanger was, to say the least, displeased that the officer caused a stir that could disrupt the stability of the Brigade. It is unknown if Dirlewanger hadn't intended to kill the man at all, or if he felt a rare pang of mercy in his heart, but the officer walked away from the incident with nothing more than a fear of being castrated and a constant feeling of imminent execution by Dirlewanger's own hands. Perhaps a stern reprimand was all the man needed."
 DRL.306.a: "A stain on your record, officer."
 DRL.306.b: "To the front lines with you!"
 DRL.307.t: "A Lack of Faith"
 DRL.307.d: "The concern amongst officers from the earlier demotion has led to a group of three officers, seeking safety in numbers, to voice their concerns to Dirlewanger himself over his treatment of officers when they make so called 'slight errors'. The triad of officers believe that it was unfair to demote the last offender, instead stating that Dirlewanger should've wrapped up his punitive action with the execution of the bravado filled soldier that was the true culprit for this whole mess. Not necessarily advocating for promoting that officer back to his former position, the three officers instead ask for an assurance of job security in the face of so called minor blunders that they may find themselves wrapped up in. Once again, a request to Dirlewanger leaves him in a position to set further precedent for how the Brigade should act towards the mistakes and inadequacies from those in charge. The officers gulp and shift uneasily, silently praying to themselves that Dirlewanger doesn't sign their death warrant right then and there. Dirlewanger is left to decide."
 DRL.307.a: "One free mistake, all of you."
 DRL.307.b: "Very funny, shoot them all."
 DRL.308.t: "A Progressive Workplace Environment"
 DRL.308.d: "The efforts of the three officers seem to have paid off for the officers as a whole, as their arguments have led to Dirlewanger judging their actions with a bit less malice than ever experienced before. With a bit more freedom in their actions, and a lot less fear of being put down and shuffled out, the officers have begun to breathe easier. With this newfound lightening of the weight on their shoulders, a general increase of morale has spread from the officers themselves to the soldiers under their command, something appreciated throughout the entire camp as everyone seems to have an extra spring in their step on their way to plunder yet another fearful town of innocent Russians. Perhaps ruling entirely through fear can only take you so far, the officers are left to think, and perhaps the occasional benefit or ounce of freedom is beneficial for the overall effectiveness of your force. In any case, with morale up and attitude improved, the officers can command a bit more effectively as they carve a bloody, rich path across the Southern Urals and beyond."
 DRL.308.a: "Dirlewanger is a renowned reformist."
 DRL.309.t: "Youthful Ineptitude"
 DRL.309.d: "Perhaps only so many are fit to lead amongst the ranks of the Dirlewanger Brigade. As another three officers lie dead for dissenting from Dirlewanger's will, hasty replacements were set up to fill their now empty positions. One of these new officers, a former raider with no command experience and only a decent record of slaughter to his name, has caused yet more problems amongst the soldiers. When this new officer sought to flex his new position by taking command of the raid of a small village, he was utterly embarrassed. Reports state that this young officer's orders featured such tactically sound commands as \"Charge!\", and \"Kill everyone!\". Of course, when the villagers proved to be more than living scarecrows, his command faltered shamefully.\n\nNow, the men once again complain to Dirlewanger. The constant rotation of execution over the slightest objections, dissensions, and mistakes has caused a severe lack in command prowess among the Brigade. Now that complaints are in such numbers that they can't be solved with a few bullets, Dirlewanger seems to have backed himself into a wall and has unfortunately damaged the strength of his own army. For now, only time will tell if this will end up seriously hindering the efforts of the Brigade's raids, or even the coming war effort against the Ural League. In the meantime, it seems another officer will have to be shot."
 DRL.309.a: "Raw meat spoils fastest."
 DRL.310.t: "A Bolshevik Battalion"
 DRL.310.d: "After the execution of the bold soldier who caused a ruckus amongst the Brigade, a decision was made to posthumously look into his 'evidence' to see if his words had any merit, even after death. The subsequent investigation into these matters revealed a highly disturbing trend that did not simply die with the man, but one that has infected many of those that sat in the man's division. Within the battalion of the now dead soldier now lies a disturbing, perhaps even communist sentiment.\n\nWhile that man yet lived, his ideas of spreading the plunder more equally permeated many of the soldiers he fought alongside, and investigative action has revealed the communist, despicable, bolshevik, downright opposite to moral ideas that maybe the soldiers should receive a greater share of what they manually loot and steal for themselves.\n\nOf course, this trend is downright alarming, if not completely sinister in nature. Alas, with the circumstances, one is led to wonder why the officers of this battalion did not find it prudent to clamp down on such ideas, especially with the relative ease of which these red Russian ideas were discovered. Two courses of action seem equally appropriate in response; of course, the simple solution would be to remove this radical Marxist thought with the cracks of a rifle, but that could be viewed as a waste of manpower and ammunition. It may be equally advisable to find out why exactly the officers have not already taken care of this, and perhaps find the source of the problem."
 DRL.310.a: "Gun down these fools!"
 DRL.310.b: "Just who is in command here!?"
 DRL.311.t: "A Streak of Red"
 DRL.311.d: "The decision to interrogate the officers of the newly discovered 'Bolshevik Battalion' proved to be wise, if only because it produced a harrowing discovery. When the officers were isolated and asked about the disconcerting ideas of their men, the officers eventually let it slip that even they somewhat take the ideas of their men into account. Even worse, the officers claim that such ideas are not isolated to a single battalion of the Dirlewanger Brigade, but are in fact quite common amongst Dirlewanger's entire army! The officers go so far as to claim that it is only the top echelons, Dirlewanger and his closest generals, that believe that the officers should be taking most of the spoils for themselves.\n\nConfronted with such radical, absurd ideas, Dirlewanger is left to wonder if this is all an audacious ploy to make these dissident ideas seem far more spread than they really are, or if this is a real problem that has found itself slithering around the minds of what used to be such brutal, compliant pillagers. After all, such a bluff could be a Bolshevik plot to force Dirlewanger to accept such ideas, when they do not have precedent in reality. On the other hand, the traitor officers could unfortunately be correct, which may place the entire future of the Dirlewanger Brigade in jeopardy! If the Dirlewanger Brigade is to continue its existence, a decision will have to be made to prevent the extremist ideas of loot sharing from spreading. Dirlewanger is left to make a decision on their next move, of course, after splattering these officer's heads on the ground."
 DRL.311.a: "Hunt these bastard reds down!"
 DRL.311.b: "This is absurd, they lie!"
 DRL.312.t: "An Extinct Ideology"
 DRL.312.d: "It seems that our first hypothesis, the belief that the traitor officers have lied to make it seem like the Dirlewanger Brigade is full of Marxist scum, was correct. While fortunate, the officers did end up wasting significant time and energy searching, interrogating, and shooting our way into the minds of our own men to discover the truth behind these matters. In any case, the Brigade can be sure that the truly evil ideas of sharing amongst ourselves has been stamped out once and for all amongst the men. The fate of the extreme leftist battalion is one of mercy, as to conserve manpower, they have all been forced at gunpoint to renounce their beliefs or be turned into a sludge of grey matter. Of course, the battalion is now no threat to us, their leadership replaced with a stern loyalist and their cursed beliefs humiliated in front of all of them. The Dirlewanger Brigade is thankfully free of the influence spread by the degenerate former Soviet land, and Dirlewanger is most pleased that their efforts to slaughter and plunder all in their path can proceed fresh and unimpeded."
 DRL.312.a: "It truly was stamped out."
 DRL.313.t: "A Red and Black Brigade"
 DRL.313.d: "Once again it was wise to look deeper into the post-mortem characteristics of our men. To our detriment, it seems that the officers did not lie at all about the presence of foul Communists in our ranks, and their extent has reached a point where Dirlewanger and his loyal generals can not simply gun down every single transgressor without mercy. It is a common, dreadful sentiment amongst a majority of our men that loot should be shared to the individual achievement of the raiders, and that sentiment is a firm belief in the hearts of our men. The shock and rage present in Dirlewanger is palpable, and the only thing stopping him from going on a killing spree is the necessity of manpower for his grand plans to loot and plunder every single square inch of the Southern Urals and beyond.\n\nLamentably, this means that Dirlewanger is faced with two options to continue the further existence of his brigade. Of course, he can step away from the investigation, and pretend that he never found out about such contemptible ideas present in his men. Then, there is the second option; a step into the darkness that seems to have fallen over all of his men. Perhaps stability would be easiest found if Dirlewanger took some of their ideas in account. While utterly vile, it would be likely to produce an increase of morale in the men, something that may improve effectiveness for our great conquest. It is simply deplorable that the men have found idiotic minds of their own, but yet Dirlewanger stands, forced to take into account the wishes of his band of executioners."
 DRL.313.a: "We can listen, just for morale."
 DRL.313.b: "Put an end to this farce."
 DRL.314.t: "A Justified Fear"
 DRL.314.d: "While it seems that the troublemaking officer was not castrated or turned into a living shield, that officer's second greatest fear came true today as Dirlewanger ordered the man to be brought before him. Any pang of mercy that appeared to be present during their last confrontation was visible no longer, as Dirlewanger ordered for a few raiders to guide the officer to the middle of the Brigade's camp, ensuring the maximum visibility for whatever he had planned. As the officer was dragged along to his destination, Dirlewanger made sure to lay into the officer once again, ridiculing him all the way to his stop. The officer's life was officially turned into an example for all of those who, intentionally or not, cause issues for the stability and function of the Brigade's existence. Any questions about what would happen to the officer were answered, as the sharp crack of rifles sent bullets into his skull, ending his life for the viewing pleasure of all present."
 DRL.314.a: "For a problem, a solution."
 DRL.315.t: "A Moment to Reflect"
 DRL.315.d: "Though his life was a near constant haze of devilish excitement and all manner of debauchery, for once Dirlewanger had found a moment of relative quiet, alone in his tent. With little to do, his eyes scanned the space for something to occupy himself, when his gaze fell upon his trusty rifle.\n\nIt was an ancient thing, really. A standard issue Karabiner 98k, one he had owned since his days still on the Reich's leash. Yet despite his men continually acquiring new weapons in their bloody raids, he had kept it and maintained his rifle all these years, and continued to use it to deadly effect. Sitting down with it on the dirty fur mats he used for a bed, he began carefully polishing the grime off of its worn surface.\n\nAs he worked, his mind wandered backwards in time. He traced the rusty trigger, and remembered how his finger had click, click, clicked it in the faces of Speidel's traitorous men, blowing their empty skulls open across the Russian snow. He polished the barrel, and smirked as he thought back to when his men had first arrived in Orsk, when he thrust it down the throat of the last mayor of the city and almost choked him to death before shredding his innards with a bullet. His fingers rubbed over the scratches on the stock, and he laughed at all the Russian peasants he had simply beaten to bloody pulp with it.\n\nHe held the now relatively clean weapon in front of him. To him, beholding this rifle was like looking in a mirror. It had been with him for as long as he remembered. It was why he kept it with him all this time.\n\nIt was a part of him."
 DRL.315.a: "To think a thing so deadly can be so beautiful."
 DRL.316.t: "A Muddy Matter"
 DRL.316.d: "As the raiding party set down to rest in the burned ruins of the latest village to face their wrath, Dirlewanger hopped out of his truck and went to get something from the back. As he approached, he noticed that the mud from the recent rains now caked the side of the vehicle. He looked around the village for some useless sot to foist the responsibility of cleaning the vehicle upon, when he found a group of his men roasting the village animals over a fire.\n\nHis gaze honed in on one particular man who had most displeased him. A Khazakh raider, one who had joined the band recently but had constantly hung back in the raids, keeping himself out of danger yet still happily helping himself to the loot afterwards. Dirlewanger calmly ordered the man to approach. He smiled and offered him a cloth and a bucket, and ordered him to have his truck spotless within the hour.\n\nThe coward's face immediately went white, and Dirlewanger's smile grew all the wider. A few of the other men present began to cackle at the poor man, who immediately set to furiously scrubbing the mud off of the weather-beaten metal. Dirlewanger chuckled and wandered off into the village to find loot or some captives to entertain himself with, leaving the man to work like his life depended upon it."
 DRL.316.a: "Actually, his life DOES depend on it."
 DRL.317.t: "A Spot of Bother"
 DRL.317.d: "The man waited nervously as Dirlewanger examined every inch of the truck. The sides were now completely free of mud, the dust had been polished off the windscreen, and even the interior had been cleared of grime. Dirlewanger checked it all over, once, twice, three times. Finally he approached the man and thanked him for making his truck cleaner than it had been in a long time.\n\n\"Of course, I said I wanted it spotless...\" he said, that insidious grin returning to his face. The blood left the raider's face once more as Dirlewanger knelt down and beckoned him to come and look. There, just on the underside of the front left fender, was a tiny leftover spot of mud.\n\nA single sob was all that had time to leave the man's throat before Dirlewanger put his rifle to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. The other men watching laughed as two approached to dump the raider's body with the others. After watching the wretch's corpse go, Dirlewanger turned back to his vehicle, only to groan with frustration at the sight of all the blood now splattered over the door. He turned to the man who had spilled booze over him the other day and barked at him to get the mess cleaned up.\n\nThe same rules applied, as always."
 DRL.317.a: "That's the third time this month!"
 DRL.318.t: "A Lost Son of Germany"
 DRL.318.d: "Dirlewanger was deep in his cups when he was interrupted by some of his men barging into his tent. Before he could demand an explanation, they dragged forwards a bloodied, tired and emaciated boy no more than fifteen years old. He had been caught at the edge of the camp where the men had beat him up, until he surprised them all by crying out in fluent German.\n\nThe boy feebly pleaded with Dirlewanger, introducing himself as Otto Wagner. He claimed to be the son of a settler family in Reichskommissariat Moskowien, where he had been a petty thug. He and a group of fellow criminals had fled east after being caught filching weapons from the local garrison, but the wastes and the hostile locals of the lands beyond German control had not been kind to them. He was all that remained of that party, and he had eventually found his way to Orsk after overhearing a group of militiamen talking about a group of German bandits based there.\n\nWhether out of genuine curiosity or simply thanks to being too drunk to care, Dirlewanger decided not to spill the boy's guts to the dirt. Remarking that he must be fine Aryan stock to have made it this far on his own, Dirlewanger told the boy that he could stay within the camp. However, he grabbed the boy close and threatened him never to disrespect his new master.\n\nOtto quickly wiped his tears and quietly thanked Dirlewanger and bid a hasty exit from the tent."
 DRL.318.a: "Cause no trouble, boy."
 DRL.319.t: "The Secretary"
 DRL.319.d: "Nearly half a year after Otto Wagner arrived in the camp, he has slowly integrated into life in the Brigade. He does not complain or talk much, even as the older men roughhouse him around and give him the occasional beating. After all, he does not have anywhere else to be, so for the most part he puts up with getting the scraps from the table and generally being the runt of the Brigade.\n\nRecently, Dirlewanger has become tired of managing the day-to-day humdrum of loot distribution and ammo management. He has decided he would much like a secretary, like the big bosses back in Germany would have, to handle all the boring tedious work while they could spend their time out cracking skulls. Perhaps seeking to finally give Otto some purpose, he unceremoniously dumped a pile of ledgers and notebooks in his hands and told him to get to work.\n\nNot daring to disrespect Dirlewanger, the new secretary quickly took to his duties. Satisfied that the boy was no longer sitting around uselessly, Dirlewanger looked for some more depraved activities to involve himself in now that his responsibilities had been delegated away."
 DRL.319.a: "Don't screw this up or you know what's coming!"
 DRL.320.t: "First Blood"
 DRL.320.d: "Earlier this morning, a batch of captives destined for Lysenko's labs were brought into camp. The bandits herded them into a pen once used to hold cattle before the resident farmer was unceremoniously impaled on the gatepost. Though officially they were supposed to deliver all of those they captured unharmed to the madman on the mountain, the bandits never refrained from an opportunity to have their ways with defenseless innocents.\n\nAmidst the scenes of depravity and gratuitous violence, Dirlewanger's young secretary Otto approached the pen. He was long since desensitized to the Brigade's antics and watched the horror with a dead-eyed stare. It was then that he noticed a small glimmer from the fingers of one of the captives. Eager to prove himself to the bandits and to take some loot, Otto approached the man and ordered him to hand it over. To his surprise, the man refused. He desperately begged Otto to let him keep it, for it was his wedding ring and the only memory he had left of his wife.\n\nOtto punched him.\n\nAs the man collapsed to the floor, some of the bandits cheered him on and told the boy to hit him again. He stood there, contemplating, but the cheers were growing, so he gave the man his boot in the stomach. He bent over and gave the man another punch. Again, and again. The captive begged for mercy as Otto grew more and more furious, but still he refused to hand over his precious ring. Eventually the man lay cold and lifeless on the ground.\n\nFor a brief moment, the boy stared at the corpse in shock, then, he reached down and plucked the trinket from the dead man's finger and held it aloft for all to see. The assembled men roared with delight for their favored son and his first kill."
 DRL.320.a: "He's one of us now."
 DRL.321.t: "Broken Spirit, Broken Body"
 DRL.321.d: "Dirlewanger awoke to a loud commotion, followed by screams and gunshots. Storming out of his tent to find out who he had to shoot to get the noise to stop, he came upon a scene of blood. One man lay dead, an ornate knife embedded in his neck, while the boy Otto Wagner lay upon the ground peppered with gunshots and a mangled arm.\n\nDirlewanger furiously demanded to know what had happened, to which one of the men gathered around the scene explained that the two had gotten into a fight over loot. Both had wanted the knife for themselves, and when the elder man refused to relent the boy had viciously attacked him. A struggle ensued in which the man brutally slashed Otto's arm before the boy pulled the blade from his own flesh and dealt the killing blow. Before he lost consciousness, however, the elder had been able to pull out his luger and shoot the boy several times, he had missed the chest, but his arms and shoulders caught bullets all over. The old man was shot immediately for hurting his secretary, and shouted loudly at the men around them complete useless for letting Otto get into trouble like this\n\nAfter Dirlewanger had calmed down, he turned his attention to Otto. The boy was truly in a sorry state. The boy's arms was beyond saving, and he was quickly bleeding out. He would certainly never be useful as a secretary again, though with the limited medical supplies available it was possible he could still be saved and made useful as a cook or something similar. But in such harsh climes and amongst such harsh men, the way to deal with a man no longer needed is often a quick and merciful death. and Dirlewanger eyed up his pistol and considered perhaps just putting the boy out of his misery."
 DRL.321.a: "I'm sorry, little one..."
 DRL.321.b: "Patch him up and find a use for him."
 DRL.322.t: "The Call of the Wild"
 DRL.322.d: "The raiding squad rides across the hills in search of plunder, no doubt imagining themselves to be similar to the Mongol hordes of old. The target is a village of Russian peasants just over the next ridge; having survived through sheer luck and oversights on the Brigade's part-until now. They have little in ways of pure wealth, but they always have full cellars, plenty of vodka, and the occasional silver candlestick or gold ring to loot. All in all, the best pickings a raider could hope for without having to brave armed resistance.\n\nSuddenly, the squad comes to a halt at their leader's signal. He silently points to a shallow ravine, as the men gaze in awe. There, staring at them, is an adult brown bear in the middle of hunting for dinner. The men are frozen, desperately hoping not to break the uneasy silence between them and the beast. Finally, the commander leans over to his second-in-command and whispers \"I'll go up to it.\" His aide stares at him like he's grown a second head, then chambers a round in the worn Mosin-Nagant in his hands. Better to put the beast down before his boss get any more stupid ideas."
 DRL.322.b: "Maybe it's friendly?"
 DRL.322.a: "Better safe than sorry."
 DRL.323.t: "Bearing Arms vs. Bear Claws"
 DRL.323.d: "Without a word, the commander's aide raises his rifle and fires a round right in the bear's eyes before his superior can get any more bright ideas. The beast immediately slumps over without as much as a whimper, a slow trickle of red dribbling down its head onto the grass. After a brief debate, the guards decide to skin it and bring the pelt back to camp as their spoils-it's certainly a unique prize.\n\nOn the ride back to Orsk, the commander decides to have them stop at another ravine, hoping to give their horses a few minutes to recuperate and find some water. They do not notice a small cave around the bend, nor does the soldier guarding the horses notice three fully-grown brown bears lumbering toward them. However, he certainly notices when it bites down on his neck.\n\nWhen the squad does return to camp, it only consists of three horrified and blood-splattered soldiers riding on the backs of claw-raked horses. Neither the commander or his aide are seen, and none of them are willing to say what happened. All that one says is muttering \"We shouldn't have killed it, we shouldn't have killed it\" over and over again..."
 DRL.323.a: "Fact: Bears eat Bandits."
 DRL.324.t: "First Contact"
 DRL.324.d: "The commander reaches his hand out to his side, keeping his aide's rifle pointed to the ground without breaking eye contact with the bear. With an empty hand held forward, he slowly starts inching towards the beast, ready to break into a run at the first sign of trouble. The bear, meanwhile, stares at him with dark eyes, nothing in its movements or expression betraying what it may do next.\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity, the commander is standing several feet in front of the bear, which is standing as still as a statue. He reaches a quivering arm outward, and after a moment of hesitation, gently brushes it on the top of the bear's muzzle."
 DRL.324.a: "Is he mad?!"
 DRL.325.t: "How to Train Your Ursidae"
 DRL.325.d: "It is a tense moment, with the commander leaving his hand planted on the bear's face, and nobody dares to even breathe for fear of angering the beast. But eventually, the bear leans forward... and starts nuzzling the commander's hand.\n\nThe men stare dumbfounded, as their leader begins petting the bear's head with both hands while it scratches the side of its head against his uniform jacket. As a test, the commander takes a step back, and the bear steps forward to stay by his side. He hops on his horse, and the bear eagerly lumbers alongside him. \"I guess it is friendly after all!\"\n\nAs they arrive back at camp with their new friend, the rest of the bandits and soldiers laugh hysterically at the sight of a bear padding along like a loyal pet dog. That night, after some discussion with his men (and copious amounts of vodka), the commander decides that he should try climbing on the bear's back and riding it like a horse. It took several attempts, but the commander eventually managed to stay on the beast's back without being thrown off. He laughed at the sheer ridiculousness of it all with his men, and only provoked further roars of laughter when he promises he'll ride it on the next raid!"
 DRL.325.a: "That's a good one... he's serious, isn't he?"
 DRL.326.t: "Immediate Regret"
 DRL.326.d: "It is a tense moment, with the commander leaving his hand planted on the bear's face. Nobody dares to even breathe for fear of angering the beast. The bear even seems placid, almost accepting... until it suddenly snaps its jaws and reduces the commander's forearm to a bloody mess. He loses all reason and just stands there in shock, letting out a bloodcurdling scream as he stares at the horror unfolding before him. It is quickly cut off by a swipe from the bear's claws, which catches him in the throat. The men all scramble to their horses, screaming bloody murder and shouting prayers to whatever god may be happening to listen. Unfortunately, the horses have scattered at the sound of the carnage, carrying their rifles with them, and they see two more bears lumbering over the hill towards them.\n\nWhen the squad does return to camp, it only consists of three horrified and blood-splattered soldiers riding on the backs of claw-raked horses. Their commander and his aide are absent, and none of them are willing to say what happened to them. The only thing that they can get out of one of the soldiers is \"We should've stayed away from it, far away...\""
 DRL.326.a: "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."
 DRL.327.t: "The Charge of the Bear Brigade"
 DRL.327.d: "After some time practicing, the squad commander feels confident enough to bring the bear, whom he has dubbed 'Siegfried', with them on their next raid. It turns out that Siegfried is not the fastest of mounts, but he can get up to a decent speed for a short amount of time and doesn't even flinch at the sound of gunfire. As the men ride out toward a village, hoping to return with plunder and glory, the other squads cheer with raucous laughter as they see Siegfried lumbering by, with plenty of jokes about the commanding having found himself a Russian woman circulating.\n\nAs the squad nears the village, they hear something that is exhilarating yet unnerving: the sound of gunshots fired by some village militia. While this raid will certainly be more dangerous than the usual ransacking of poor farmers' hovels, the presence of a militia means that they have loot worth defending. The commander spurs Siegfried forward, and the horses beside him accelerate from a trot to a gallop. As the squadron begins to open fire, Siegfried suddenly jolts to a stop and slumps to the ground. The commander scrambles off the beast's back to see what could be wrong. Fortunately, Siegfried is unharmed; it seems he just stumbled on a rock. While the commander is relieved, it does raise some concerns about Siegfried's combat efficiency-bears, after all, are neither as fast nor as agile as horses. Leading Siegfried onwards may be a combat risk, but is it a worthy one?"
 DRL.327.a: "Can't stop here, boy. Ride on!"
 DRL.327.b: "It's too risky, leave him where he is!"
 DRL.328.t: "Theirs But to Do and Die"
 DRL.328.d: "Ultimately, the commander decides that Siegfried will be of more use participating in the raid than sitting around. Without a moment to spare, he climbs back on the bear's back, cracks the makeshift reins, and sends his mount onwards into the thick of the battle. The bullets whiz all around, with the militiamen having retreated behind the windows and alleyways of their village. But the men of the Dirlewanger Brigade are experienced enough to successfully fight back against their enemies, and ride through the streets shooting everything that moves. At the front of the squadron is the commander, leading a roaring Siegfried and spreading chaos in the streets.\n\nFinally, the men prepare a charge against the last stronghold of local resistance: the village's tiny, ramshackle Orthodox church. Although most locals scatter at the sight of over a dozen bandits armed to the teeth galloping towards them, several remain determined to the last and fire off a few more rounds from the rifles before being shot or cut down. Most of those bullets fly by harmlessly-except for one. Having been shot in the head, Siegfried comes to a crashing halt, and the commander is thrown to the ground. He scrambles over to his dying mount, cradles Siegfried's bloodied head, and closes his dark eyes for the last time. The commander stands up, pulls out a pistol, and walks towards the cowering villagers taking refuge in the church with determination in his eyes.\n\nThis one's for Siegfried."
 DRL.328.a: "Goodnight, sweet prince."
 DRL.329.t: "Back to Nature"
 DRL.329.d: "With a pained look in his eyes, the commander decides it is better to leave Siegfried away from the fighting and proceed on foot. Drawing his rifle, he ruffles the fur on the bear's head and starts marching to the town, well behind his mounted men.\n\nBy the time he arrives, much of the fighting has already passed. Local guards litter the streets and alleyways, their blood seeping into the dirt. Much of his subsequent duties focus on rounding up and executing military-age prisoners, looting winter food stocks, organizing the fair division of war booty among the men, and burning down the tiny Orthodox church where the town's defenders made their last stand. One of his men had lost a horse during the charge, but that was of little concern at the moment as the men were going house-to-house and grabbing whatever, or whoever, caught their eye. This town was a rather ripe reward; the commander himself had gotten a gold-plated pocket watch, a bottle of brandy, a new pistol, a silver Communion chalice from the church, and a few stacks of old Soviet rubles (having long lost their monetary value, but being wonderful firestarters).\n\nOnce the men had their fun, they began making their way back to camp. But as they near the spot where they left Siegfried, the bear was nowhere in sight. There's no blood or sign of a fight, but there are tracks leading off in the direction of the cave where they first found him. Siegfried was wild, after all, and it would be foolish to try and contain him for too long. With a heavy heart, the commander tells his men to ride onwards, knowing that it was probably the last any of them would see of Siegfried the cavalry bear."
 DRL.329.a: "If you love something, let it go."
 DRL.331.t: "A Brilliant Proposal"
 DRL.331.d1: "The great, brooding mind of Oskar Dirlewanger had borne a brilliant proposal surely beneficial to his elite retinue; removing the Sieg Heil. Dirlewanger was a man of action, ill-suited to the hamfisted social engineering of the Roman salute. This troop contingent after all was not ever going to be needed for flag waving or flattering superiors; here every man was his own master, master of creating a destiny and legacy for him and his men to follow. Fear as a form of control had always worked on those he had terrorised, so as a logical conclusion it should also work on his men if they rejected his idea.\n\nIn his delusion the crazed officer, who could have likely been a successful Landsknecht in a time both different and too similar to this one, had forgotten the reason his former masters had secured utter subservience from their underlings. The regimentation and drilling had created soldiers of iron wills, and even if they represented their ancestors who likewise pillaged Central Europe with horrifying fidelity, believing them to have the ability to murder and rape for the same reasons was utterly foolish.\n\nThe brilliant strategist had given his all-powerful decree; now he watched it fall into ruin. Every time he gathered his men around him now they stood straight to attention, arms raised at the infamous angle and roared the mantra, some even with smirks on their faces. The non-Germans began to join in, peer pressure blinding them to what they were doing and its meaning to their peoples. Even more worryingly, some of the more senior veterans of his brigade now began to almost take less notice of him, punishing violators of his supreme will with suspicious laxity. But he was still the indispensable commander that would lead his men to glory, so this was but a minor setback. Or was he? His aging mind was playing cruel tricks on him in his clear times before the mist of madness descended again."
 DRL.331.d2: "Dirlewanger was a veteran, having served in the Deutschvölkischen Schutz- and Trutzbund, then the SA and NSDAP, finally the SS. His desertion from the glorious Reich in its hour of need was not because of dismissal or hatred for the nation; his resentment of certain Wehrmacht staff would not change his love and yearning for his homeland. And so the decision to keep the tradition of the Sieg Heil, a unifier of Germans worldwide, was a simple one for him, despite having a large foreign presence in his army. When announcing the decision to his troops, he was disconcerted to find reluctance, apathy, even subtle opposition in his ranks. In an effort to uphold his iron authority over the brigade he raised his skinny arm and clicked his heels with the intensity of a much younger man.\n\n\"SIEG HEIL!\" he screamed, eyes bulging, a single vein on the edge of bursting near his grey hairline. To his dismay and seething anger a few men began to snigger, but most of those gathered around his makeshift platform continued to stare at him with something almost resembling curiosity. The tainted man, half-drowned in madness, had forgotten who he now led. The pure fanaticism had been transformed into bitter cynicism by the Russian wastes, diluting the SS brigade it had once been with men of opportunity and desperation. These were men neither of ideology nor religion; a grouping of nihilistic looters who lived from day to day had no motivation to uphold tradition that had abandoned or abused them mercilessly. Dirlewanger stepped of the podium in silence; punishment would have to follow. His quiet mutterings were lost in the din of his troops reverting back to what they had been previously doing before the former SS officer had given his address, something they were proudly good at, pillaging and raping the small, ruined Russian village."
 DRL.331.a: "Not a great surprise."
 DRL.331.b: "At least they still follow orders - for now."
 DRL.332.t: "The Cancerous Host"
 DRL.332.d1: "With every day in the chaotic Ural steppes of the former Soviet Union, what had once been an SS Brigade slipped further into simple brutality. Their morality eroded to cynical nihilism, one even Nietzsche would have raised his eyebrows at, no longer rooted to any ethical order but their own. Within this shift lay a twisted birth, the mother being the sadistic joy of hearing lost souls begging for mercy as they were raped and tortured, the father being the thrill of death knocking on one's door on a near-daily basis. The endless violence had implanted in the brigade the idea to reject Nazism, certainly a defiled, degenerate ideology, yet still with traditions that withheld certain desires and behaviors.\n\nDirlewanger, despite having deep and even affectionate ties to the twisted ideology that had brought Germany to the heights he had exploited, felt his and the roots of the former SS members of the brigade slowly being replanted into the fertile ground of the banditry of the non-German recruits. In an unsurprising move the alcoholic, sexual deviant of a commander, abolished, or rather forgot, the Sieg Heil, a greeting synonymous with conformity and strict discipline. He was not a man that required the groveling and intricate power play of the Führer, nor were these the times of a settled, organized existence; these were the times of pleasure filled pillage. These were the times of death and glory."
 DRL.332.d2: "Despite all the astounding, nihilistic carnage and pillage the rugged men of Dirlewanger's brigade had caused to the Urals, in their merciless hearts they remained loyal to the blood and soil they once fought for. A certain degree of respect, even admiration, was bred and maintained for the distant German Vaterland, thumping SS marches were drunkenly sung, and hardened veterans sometimes recounted sweet and bitter memories of their hometowns, often resulting in laughter and jeering that always just barely masks the universal longing of the exile. The Russian and other ethnic groups that had joined the wandering bandits were often savagely harassed by German SS troopers in their own ranks who had fallen into old routines, only to then be falsely accused and punished by their officers.\n\nYes, the old spectre of Nazism still clung to the hearts and minds of the former 36th Waffengrenadiere. It was difficult to peel off with the weight of traditions accrued to it like barnacles to a wreck, such as the Sieg Heil salute. Dirlewanger had briefly pondered whether it had outlived its functionality but had decided to keep it, to the silent chagrin of the non-German bandits and great elation of the 'aryans'. It would remain along with the now many other quite frankly defunct traditions as a staple of the brigades' identity."
 DRL.332.a: "Humans without traditions are but animals in the great wild."
 DRL.332.b: "You cannot deny the nature of existence."
 DRL.335.t: "A Necessary Compensation"
 DRL.335.d: "Dirlewanger woke up cold, sweaty and disoriented. It had certainly not been the worst dream but definitely the one he liked the least in a while. He had been mocked by his highest ranking officers for not having a car suited to his position as leader. He was embarrassed, and he felt powerless.\n\nIn between the regular raids and fun games, Dirlewanger had many quick passing periods to think about the solution to such a problem. It was during one of these passing periods that it came to him, he had the solution. Dirlewanger would authorize the creation of a truck grand and powerful on a level suited to him. Named after its inventor, the Oskarwagen would become a motorized arsenal of fear and firepower, with a cannon large enough to turn a farm into a forest of woodsplinters. When such divine inspiration hit Dirlewanger, he knew he had to act. Immediately, he ordered four of his burliest brutes to mount the largest gun in their stockpile atop his truck. Dirlewanger waited with eagerness to see the results of his illustrious idea; almost enough to turn his attention away from the execution of a few peasants on his latest raid."
 DRL.335.a: "The Oskarwagen will ride!"
 DRL.336.t: "It Is Ready"
 DRL.336.d: "After quite a while, certainly longer than Dirlewanger had demanded, spent forging the masterpiece, the Oskarwagen was completed. A true beauty, a proper frontpiece for the Brigade, it would serve his purposes exactly. Dirlewanger made it mandatory for all of the men not currently pillaging to attend the demonstration and first test of the vehicle. It was a surprise to the men of the camp to find Dirlewanger excited about something that wasn't completely morally bankrupt, and most didn't quite know how to feel about it, but eventually the black band found themselves just as excited as nervous for the unveiling of the great Oskarwagen that had seen so much hype from their leader. Dirlewanger had mandated a few old and broken vehicles to be set up as a target for the gun, and it was with much tension that he personally ordered the firing of the cannon."
 DRL.336.a: "Boom..."
 DRL.337.t: "Cannon Jump"
 DRL.337.d: "None of the men tasked with the construction of the truck had accounted for this. As the Brigade's present men all cheered at the inaugural test, the cannon' massive recoil had other plans. The firing of the cannon rattled Dirlewanger's poor truck so badly that it completely flipped over, crushing two soldiers that had come to stand and watch closely!\n\nThe men suddenly went silent, confused and fearful of what would come next. The only sound that was heard was Dirlewanger intense laughter, utterly amused at the flattening of the two men. That laughter slowly ground to a halt as Dirlewanger realized that his Oskarwagen was a failure. The amusement exploded into fury, and he immediately demanded the four men he brought to build it executed. A few men watching slowly slipped away while others were remained out of respect and fear, they didn't want to risk the consequences that could come from not supporting their Oberführer."
 DRL.337.a: "Smile and clap, boys."
 DRL.338.t: "The Oskarwagen"
 DRL.338.d: "The cheers of the Brigade were loud, only to be deafened by the violent cannon shot. It worked. Dirlewanger was delighted, pleased that he finally had a vehicle he could take charge from and lead great conquests wherever he wanted, the Mountain, the so-called 'great' city Orenburg and the glorified prisoners will stand no match against the his new engine of war. Dirlewanger was so pleased that upon seeing the success of the first Oskarwagen he ordered another one, to act as a backup and another fine engine of destruction to reinforce his Brigade. The pleased attitude spread amongst all present. With that successful test under his belt, Dirlewanger demanded to lead the next raid. He would personally fire the cannon as much as possible. Dirlewanger could hardly wait for the construction of the second Oskarwagen."
 DRL.338.a: "Of course it worked!"
 DRL.339.t: "Panzerkampfoskarwagen"
 DRL.339.d: "While two Oskarwagens, a main and a spare, can ruin homes and crush dreams like no others, what if the Dirlewanger Brigade had even more of them? What use does regular trucks have anyways, all they do is move soldiers from one place to another. But moving is something all normal soldiers can do as well, some may fit on the trucks but others can run behind. The initial motivation, making Dirlewanger's personal vehicle special, was suddenly not so important anymore. New, glorious visions arrived as others faded, truck upon truck with cannons lining up like the old days, barraging helpless villages, and then being able to roll right in and meet no resistance. Squads of four men each, all willing and eager, wanting to pilot their own Oskarwagen into the living quarters of those hiding their valuables.\n\nIt dawned upon him that the Oskarwagen in all honestly was a tank, and that he was about be a tank commander, he lit up as he envisioned all the loot that his plan would bring him."
 DRL.339.a: "The start of something new."
 DRL.340.t: "For Dirlewanger, We Ride!"
 DRL.340.d: "It turned out that the trucks suitable for carrying cannons were not as many as the general staff had hoped, but some trucks were converted. The 1st Oskarwagen division was given a high rank in the order of battle, a term that didn't play any role in Dirlewanger's plans, so that they plan and execute raids without grumpy officers telling them no. This division, but more on the size of a large brigade, would answer only to Dirlewanger himself. The two trucks had already proven themselves in raids, and with an organized structure revolving around the trucks, the 36th were motivated and expected the loot to soon flow in from all possible sources!"
 DRL.340.a: "Nothing can match this."
 DRL.342.t: "The Headcount"
 DRL.342.d: "In a fit of rage that managed to somehow surprise the entire brigade, Oskar Dirlewanger has called for a systematic headcount of every soldier, brigand, and bandit under his command. While such a census had been attempted two years before, it had resulted in completely useless data, the brigade's men seemingly too erratic to be tracked with mere numbers. Despite this previous failure, Dirlewanger doubled down when he was questioned by some brave souls, and with a low growl exclaimed \"If you won't count them, then I'll shoot every last one of my men and count the corpses myself.\"\n\nThis level of urgency has never marked previous headcounts, and almost every bandit has his own personal speculation on why the count is being carried out. The leader himself wouldn't give any answer more solid than just calling it a hunch, which is not making the few soldiers with administrative skills any more confident about the necessity of all this. However, the one thing they fear more than dull bureaucratic work is the wrath of the bandit king, and while everyone might drag their feet, the headcount will nonetheless be carried out soon. It remains to be seen if Dirlewanger's peculiar hunch carries any weight."
 DRL.342.a: "Might as well have a census of rabid dogs."
 DRL.343.t: "300 Missing Men"
 DRL.343.d: "The headcount has come up 300 short. Even accounting for administrative incompetence, desertions, routine disappearances, bear attacks, stray German bombs, communist raids, executions, poxes, frostbite, trips, falls, suicides, bonfire accidents, loot disputes, the common cold, black plague, flu, food poisoning, alcohol poisoning, regular poisoning, irregular poisoning, assassination, STDs, heat stroke, hypothermia, rockslides, science experiments gone wrong, science experiments gone to plan, kidnapping, dog attacks, rabies, aggressive reindeer, raid casualties, gambling arguments, race wars, building collapses, spontaneous combustion, vehicle collisions, shooting competition misfires, target practice, infected wounds, the occasional killing on accident, the much more common killing for fun, stabbings, shootings, Prussian cavalry sabre rampages, crate crushings, lynchings, brain aneurysms, slave revolts, duels, and the general inability for most bandits in the brigade to count past the number of years they've lived, this statistic is still far out of the ordinary. We'll have to investigate it and find the missing men as soon as possible."
 DRL.343.a: "Bring them to me, dead or alive. Preferably alive..."
 DRL.344.t: "130 Missing Men Found"
 DRL.344.d: "After long days of searching pass without results, a large group amounting to just short of half of the missing men has been found on the outskirts of the brigade's area of terror. This group was found camping in a village they had recently sacked, picking through the remains and performing the usual unspeakable cruelties on those they had captured. Upon being questioned by the search party, the perplexed leaders among them claimed it had just been a routine raid, but after the most basic of investigations it became obvious that they were trying to conceal what they had gained and not give the usual cut to Dirlewanger. Trying to cut a profit without including the bandit king. A grave mistake.\n\nThis obviously could not stand. Bruised and bloody they were dragged screaming all the way back to Dirlewanger himself, and not only were they forced to give up the entirety of their earnings, they were required to beg for mercy personally. The mad Württemberger went down the entire line of the quivering 130 men, listening to their sobbing and pleading, executing a few seemingly at random until he reached the end. Those would-be deserters better have learned their lesson."
 DRL.344.a: "That'll show them."
 DRL.345.t: "Fifty Raiders Found"
 DRL.345.d: "The search for the missing men has turned up something useful once more as fifty more brigands were discovered in Kazakhstan. It seems these ones had no intention to desert and were simply out raiding when the headcount was taken. They had been tracking a caravan of Kazakh villagers, who had led them to a nearly undefended, bountiful town. They had gained considerable spoils and captives in their cruel ransacking, a little celebrating until the search party turned up was therefore not entirely unreasonable. When they were ordered to return back to the brigade, no complaints were noted at first, however it soon became clear that they had intended to keep all their loot to themselves. This led to heated arguments on the way home and even a rather wasteful amount of bloodshed. Upon their return Dirlewanger was dutifully informed of their ill intentions, his fury barely containable. He demanded they turn over the proper share as usual. In an unusually brazen act of defiance, they refused right to his madness contorted face. The cracking mask of humanity finally peeled entirely to reveal a seething insanity as he ordered all of them to be executed as traitors and their loot turned over to him personally. The scene afterwards was brutal and ended with all defiant bandits mutilated to a point where even their mothers would not recognize them."
 DRL.345.a: "Looks like the headcount will stay fifty short."
 DRL.346.t: "An Old Mystery Solved"
 DRL.346.d: "As Dirlewanger's men surged through the Black Mountain, they encountered a few familiar faces. It seems that about fifty men who were once bandits in the brigade were trapped in the catacombs of the dark mount, many of them already dead, others trapped, many found in different stages of experimentation. Their pitiful pleas for death granted by the unjudging crack of the bandit's guns. A few had avoided this disgustingly cruel fate and had been working for Lysenko as guards, but these lucky ones were definitely a minority. One soldier thought to check the men against the list of missing men from the headcount a while back, and sure enough these fifty were on there. They had finally been found, though it was too late for many. Those that were still alive were mostly allowed to re-join the brigade, and they told many a horror story of the experiments and madness of Lysenko. The ones who had become guards were declared traitors and taken as captives, lined up in neat rows with each second one shot. The spared ones, faces covered in snot and tears, had to drag a dead comrade each into the mountain cells they had guarded. Their fates will likely be unfortunate as all they will be able to feast upon are the bodies of their former friends. Examples have to be set to maintain an iron grip. Even with this find so long after the headcount, there are still some names on the list yet to be found."
 DRL.346.a: "After all this time..."
 DRL.347.t: "So Close"
 DRL.347.d: "Twenty more of the men who were missing from the headcount have finally been found over the course of many different individual findings. These were the ones who had deserted and joined other, lesser bandit groups. As some of these groups were destroyed or absorbed into Dirlewanger's brigade, the missing men were rediscovered and given appropriate punishments for desertion. Some of these men had been missing for years, and the fact that they were found by complete and utter luck shows that it's likely that many of the men missing from the headcount simply deserted, and that a few might not ever be found. Some might already be hundreds or thousands of miles away, having raided and migrated to other regions of chaotic Russia. However, we still managed to find these men who had been missing for so long, and that on its own still qualifies as an accomplishment."
 DRL.347.a: "Finally got you!"
 DRL.348.t: "An Old Mystery Unsolved"
 DRL.348.d: "Oskar Dirlewanger rummaged through the papers in front of him, searching for an old map of Russia that he had been fond of. It showed all of the villages that had been raided as of a few years ago marked with a little penned cross. He wanted to see which might have had enough time to recover so that they could be attacked again. As he searched, his eyes were caught by another set of old papers that were in the pile. He pulled them out from under a stack of extremely outdated bomb schematics to see what they were. It was a list of names, each one crossed out in either black or red ink. Dirlewanger smiled. It was the years-old list of people who had been missing from the headcount. He read through the pages, looking at each name, but his smile fell away from his face when he got to the third page. There were a few names that were not crossed out but rather circled. The lost that had never been discovered. He counted the uncircled names, which amounted to about fifty.\n\nDirlewanger tossed the papers aside, annoyed, but as he continued to rummage he just couldn't focus. How dare they have run from him, and gotten away with it too! Oh, if only he could know their exact locations, find each of them, punish them personally...he fantasized about hangings, shootings, torture, screams for mercy. He couldn't focus on finding the map anymore. He snatched the old list and went to find someone who could do something about this. These people wouldn't be free yet. No one was free from him."
 DRL.348.a: "But sir, they're probably all dead by now!"
 DRL.349.t: "Weapon Inspections"
 DRL.349.d: "The village was a blazing inferno. Men fled and children screamed helplessly, and the foul odor of death permeated throughout the fallen paradise. The former citizenry, regardless of age or circumstance, were mercilessly butchered by the warriors of darkness, their corpses searched thoroughly for items of wealth prior to their careless discardment in the ashes of what was once 'home'. The raid had been overwhelmingly successful, and as the deranged warriors began to indulge themselves in the fruits of their labor, further horrendous and unspeakable acts of degeneracy occurred against the deceased.\n\nHours following the orgy of violence, the fatigued warriors rested at the village entrance, emotionally and mentally exhausted from the day's bloodshed and degeneracy. By nightfall an odd serenity filled the air, peace reigned at last. However, the silence of the night was shattered, as the warrior's commander arrived at the former-village. As Oberführer Dirlewanger approached the resting men, his deranged face illuminated by torchlight, he let out a blood curdling scream, causing his men to suddenly awake. As they stumbled to their feet, the Oberführer declared it was time for their weapons inspection, the shocked and fatigued men would quickly shuffling into place as the inspection commenced.\n\nThe Oberführer went man by man, displeased, inspecting their weaponry, continuously hurling abuse at his loyal warriors. The soldiers stood there, petrified beyond belief, as Dirlewanger would stand in silent observation. After minutes of contemplation, he raised his right hand and selected several soldiers from the line. From the curtain of darkness, a firing squad emerged, who mechanically raised their weapons and aimed to slaughter the chosen men. Yet despite this, the Oberführer wasn't satisfied yet. He called over the raid commander and his subordinate, and exchanged brief but tense words as Dirlewanger questioned the men. Despite the fact both men possessed significant talent, Dirlewanger pondered about executing both of them to serve a further example to those spared the previous executions..."
 DRL.349.a: "Kill the officers as well."
 DRL.349.b: "Have mercy upon them, they have done no harm."
 DRL.351.t: "A Note"
 DRL.351.d: "God forgive me, I don't know who will find this.\n\nThey took everything. My home, my people, my livelihood. My wife and children. God, Maria, I'm so sorry. I wish I could've done something. If I was there, when it happened...It's too late for that now.\n\nI couldn't find all of them. Little Misha...she's gone. I can't find her body anywhere. My youngest daughter. She's eleven. I don't even want to think about if they took her. Or why. Or what they're doing to her now.\n\nThere's nothing left for me here. The village is in flames. I write this from afar, watching my home burn. All I have left is one gun, and one bullet, and I know what to do with both.\n\nI hope the next life is nicer to me than this one. I'm sorry.\n\n-Grigory Arbuzov"
 DRL.351.a: "Memento Mori."
 DRL.352.t: "The Quietus of Suprematism"
 DRL.352.d: "They set upon the manor at midnight, paying no attention to stealth as they shattered the edifice's stained windows, the only goal in mind to execute the refugees hiding inside and the lone Soviet general which held the estate. As they pillaged every chamber, the substantial art collection it held was treated with utter indifference by the drunken raiders, smashing work after work with no restraint. But for a moment, the decimation ceased as they saw an elderly man standing in front of one painting, sobbing and pleading for its mercy. \"Old bastard, what is this?\" Dirlewanger barked in confusion.\n\nThe man collapsed onto his knees, begging for his father's magnum opus to be spared. The band looked upon the abstract, meaningless composition, their faces sneering with disgust. \"It's just a fucking black square!\" a brigadier howled, prompting voracious laughter. They readied their rifles and began to volley hundreds of rounds towards the man and the degenerate art, shredding its paint and tearing its linen. The rampage soon continued until they ended with a lit match.\n\nAs the mansion went up in flames, one of the soldiers saw something in the smoke. Something that appeared to distinguish itself powerfully from the rest, an apparition that contrasted with the sky so severely that it was impossible for a more perfect, more supreme polarity to ever be imagined. When he turned around, it was gone. The dream-realm of the avant garde has faded away. Only reality remains."
 DRL.352.a: "Farewell to the liberated nothing."
 DRL.353.t: "A Night to Remember"
 DRL.353.d: "At the conclusion of their latest raid, the bandits of the Brigade could scarcely believe their luck. In the cellar of an old distillery, they found a gigantic stash of alcoholic beverages that somehow had not been looted in the decades since Russia's collapse. Returning home with a mountain of loot and captives, Dirlewanger proclaimed that the night would see the greatest party in the history of Russia.\n\nThe vodka flowed freely and the loot was spread far and wide. Quickly the men of the Brigade became heavily inebriated, losing whatever remaining restraint they had left. As the sun set, the camp descended into a cacophony of wild celebration, senseless violence and unspeakable debauchery. The captives were brutalized even more than the normal fare for the band, and by morning few would remain alive and even fewer would be happy to be. The night soon devolved into a further haze of chaos as brawls broke out over the dwindling alcohol. For the first time in decades, the streets of Orsk were alive, albeit with the sound of jeers, screams and death.\n\nAs the overcast sky began to lighten with the dawn, the men of the Brigade awoke disheveled, hungover and surly. Blood, feces, and other fluids lay splattered throughout the streets, and the bodies of those killed by either the chaos of the night or by simple alcohol poisoning littered the ground here and there. Minimal effort was made to clean the place, and soon the bandits simply returned to their more cohesive roles of brutality, hoping to avoid incurring the wrath of Dirlewanger and his splitting headache."
 DRL.353.a: "What happens in Orsk, stays in Orsk."
 DRL.354.t: "The Last Stand"
 DRL.354.d: "Smoke billowed upwards in the distance, only a few hours' walk away by now. The village was filled with shouting and commotion as the terrified townsfolk gathered everything they could carry and rushed out on to the road to safety. Women and children carried precious heirlooms, things carried in their families for decades or even centuries.\n\nAs their wives and children evacuated, the men were shouting and receiving orders, tossing guns to one another and inspecting the weapons they'd be using. Many of the firearms were in a sorry state, not used since the World War and intended only for hunting. Still, a gun was a gun, and even those with hunting rifles made no complaints. They just loaded their weapons and eyed their meager allocation of ammunition nervously. Their stockpile was small enough already, and they still had to make sure they saved one bullet in case of the worst.\n\nThe men looked grim as they took up their positions. Deep down, they all knew they would not live. This was, barring divine intervention, their final stand. Though they could not save themselves, they could still make time for their families. They would make sure their own deaths were the slowest possible as long as it meant they could aim another shot and pull the trigger again.\n\nIn the distance, the faintest hum of motors started to be heard. The makeshift militiamen all fell silent. All that could be heard were heavy vehicles, and the lone, sad song of a solitary bird. The men aimed down their sights and prepared to make their last stand."
 DRL.354.a: "Steady..."
 DRL.5000.t: "The Aftershock"
 DRL.5000.d: "It was almost something akin to a bombastic, gruesome depiction of hell. Eager tendrils of flame slenderly extended and unfolded into the night sky, clawing to escape the wretched earth from which they had been spawned. The bustling creatures on the ground below were projecting a gruesome shadow play onto the salted pastures outside the brightly burning village. The former crack SS troopers and ruthless Russian bandits were now a sorry after-image of their former fear and awe inspiring power, yet still retained their gruesome rejection of any normal moral standards. Not a single poor soul had been left alive after the bandit plague had washed over the small rural community in their search for a suitable place to face their downfall.\n\nSome of their number had deserted, others had been executed, now all that remained were the most determined and steadfast killers that the brigade could offer. Despite this, the men gathering in the strategically untouched village square began to have their first doubts over the outcome of tomorrow's battle. Their numbers had been thinned to an extent worse than at any other time during their rapacious rampage through the Russian plains. Even at full strength the intense ferocity of their pursuers would have resulted in a pyrrhic bloodbath, but now it might just end up being a one sided massacre. Yet they prepared for their doom anyway. Escaping fate was not an option for these damned souls any longer."
 DRL.5000.a: "Where to go now?"
 DRL.355.t: "A New Game"
 DRL.355.d: "The Dirlewanger brigade tended to take rather heavily to the bottle. Most people were aware of this, none more so than the poor souls whose homes had been pillaged by an army of drunks armed with machine guns.\n\nOf course, this didn't mean that the brigade didn't enjoy what they did. On the contrary, many of them relished in their looting and raping of the Russian wastes. But there were other things they did to pass time, much to the relief of the surrounding villages.\n\nWhat started with a German soldier coming up with an idea for a new drinking game, and the Russian contingent supplying stolen vodka, became a great new tradition. It would be something repeated by the brigade for a long time to come, and in later years, unscrupulous American college fraternities. The true nature of the game will be lost to time, but future renditions will generally agree that a live pigeon, an ink quill, and an anthill are all involved.\n\nSoon after on that fateful first night, the \"game\" part of the celebration quickly ended, and dissolved into a wild, debaucherous party the likes of which had not been seen in years. The raucous laughter could be heard for miles."
 DRL.355.a: "Pass me a glass, I want to try this..."
 DRL.356.t: "A Fight Gone Horribly Right"
 DRL.356.d: "The brave fighting men of the Dirlewanger brigade will always find some reason to celebrate - a successful raid, a comrade's birthday, the anniversary of some previous victory, Tuesday, whatever excuse they can find. And those celebrations always involve copious amounts of vodka. Another celebration was held today, this time for a squad's successful shakedown of a local farm for a month's worth of grain and potatoes, plus a silver picture frame and a gold belt buckle. As always, things began to spiral out of control. Ribald jokes about other bandits' endowment and the friendliness of their mothers were taken seriously, and soon a brawl broke out. As the two bandits rolled around in the mud drunkenly screaming obscenities and threats at one another, they quickly became the spectacle for all their fellow soldiers that evening.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot cut through the night, bringing the revelry to a sudden halt. One of the fighters knelt on the ground, staring dumbfound at the Nagant revolver that had somehow made its way into his hands. His opponent was lying facedown, a trickle of blood running out of his mouth. The surviving fighter staggered upright and prodded his unfortunate rival with the toe of his boot, slurring \"Vanya? You alright? You need to sleep it off?\" Receiving no answer, he stumbled away and sat back down at the table, returning to his friends and the bottle of vodka that were there before he was so rudely interrupted."
 DRL.356.a: "He's just napping, right?"
 DRL.376.t: "The Unknown Soldier"
 DRL.376.d: "Jörg was the epitome of a man of the Dirlewanger Brigade. Brutal, slovenly and lacking in any virtuous qualities whatsoever, including patience. So when he and four of his companions began lagging behind the rest of the raiding party as their fifth - the Kazakh raider Ershat - stopped to relieve himself, he threatened to cut the man's genitals straight from his body if he did not hurry up. It was then that they saw him.\n\nIn the long grass about fifty meters away was one of those goody-two-shoes Ural Guards, watching the party and presumably counting their numbers to report back. Seeing that he had been spotted, the nameless soldier quickly but calmly sprung from his position and began to retreat over the ridge behind him. Udo, a man who was as supremely violent as he was mentally addled by years of substance abuse, roared with delight at the prospect of an easy kill and gave chase. Not wishing to be left out of the bloodsport, Jörg and the rest speedily followed.\n\nThe hunt was on.\n\nThe men were eager and their weapons were quickly drawn, but the soldier was surprisingly agile as he ducked and weaved amongst the rocks and trees. Numerous shots were fired but none of them managed to connect, prompting Ralf to stupidly attempt to throw his empty gun at their target - to no effect. Eventually, the chase led them to an abandoned Soviet military compound.\n\nGünter and Marc were almost able to seize their prey at the gatehouse, but with alarming dexterity the soldier sprang up and over the locked gate and soon had vanished into the mess of buildings."
 DRL.376.a: "Where did the bastard go?!"
 DRL.377.t: "Splitting the Party"
 DRL.377.d: "Glancing back at where they had come from, the men soon realized they had well and truly lost the rest of the raiders. Dirlewanger was sure to have their hides if they showed up later as mere deserters - but perhaps if they could bring him a living captive soldier from his most hated enemy as his newest plaything, the boss's temper could be sated?\n\nJörg managed to locate a gap in the rotting fence where the group made their entry. Emerging into a small field alongside some old barracks, they soon realized that they were in a rather extensive compound. Their target could be anywhere, and if they were not careful he could simply slip past them and wander out the way they came. Ralf then had the idea to split up and fan out across the compound. The sooner they could locate him, the sooner they could all converge and beat the daylights out of him, after all.\n\nThe men agreed. Jörg, Marc and Ralf agreed to search the barracks, while Günter took Udo to investigate the admin building. When Ershat moved to follow them, Jörg shoved him back and had him guard the gate to make sure their quarry didn't get out that way. If he did try the gate again, they would easily be able to find him by the sound of the Kazakh's screams. Their roles assigned, the three groups split up to hunt for the nameless soldier.\n\nNot one of them noticed the soldier in shadow, peering down at them from the old watch tower. Through the narrow slit of his visor, he observed the groups diverging, noting their paths and memorizing the layout of the base from above. Planning the choke points. Identifying ambush spots.\n\nPlotting a most grisly end for each of them."
 DRL.377.a: "Come out, come out wherever you are..."
 DRL.378.t: "Death from Above"
 DRL.378.d: "Ershat burned with fury as Jörg and the others departed. His time with the Brigade had been full of bloodthirsty carnage and unspeakable pleasures, yet he eternally resented the Germans and their smug sense of superiority over him and the other Kazakhs. He almost considered leaving them to their wild goose chase and running away. Nobody need know he had ever been associated with the bandits. He could head south, and take up residence with whoever controlled Kazakhstan these days.\n\nOf course, Ershat was a coward who clung to the Brigade because he would rather be with them than against them. So he did as he was told. As always.\n\nSuddenly, his attention was caught by the creaking of wood. Spinning to the source, he saw a dark figure quickly disappear into a small toolshed, the door falling shut behind it. At last, a chance to prove himself! Ershat charged to the shed, preparing to overpower the soldier and present his quarry to those haughty Germans. Busting through the door, he raised his sabre ready to strike, and -\n\nThe shed was empty. There were no windows, and aside from a few piles of old tools there was nowhere to hide. Ershat gazed in furious disbelief at the space, humiliated at his own foolishness and beginning to consider if the Germans had a point.\n\nIt was at that moment he had the strangest inclination to look up.\n\nThere, held up by all four limbs against the walls of the shed, was that infernal soldier, his masked face staring blankly down at him from above. That would be the last thing Ershat ever saw, as the figure plunged down and shoved a dagger through his skull."
 DRL.378.a: "AAAIIIEEE!"
 DRL.379.t: "A Long Fall"
 DRL.379.d: "As he climbed the narrow stairway, Günter pondered on how it was at all possible for him to hate Udo at this moment any more than he usually did. In this confined space, the unwashed bandit's stench was unbearable. He was nigh useless in the search, the brain-addled fool being more content to smash random bits of furniture. Günter half considered finally killing him and blaming it on the soldier, if Udo were not so freakishly and brutally strong that he might tear him in two.\n\nAs they searched the upper floor, Günter glanced out the window and scanned the camp. It was then he noticed Ershat was no longer at the gate. His foul mood deepened as he made a mental note to relieve the useless Kazakh of several teeth once they regrouped. It was then his ears caught the ever so subtle cracking and splintering of wood from the stairwell. His dash to investigate was interrupted, however, as he almost tripped over the knelt down form of Udo giggling over some leftover nude photographs.\n\nJust before he finally snapped and brained the idiot, his eyes darted to the stairwell and locked directly with the unknown soldier, staring at him with no visible emotion. The two bandits almost simultaneously darted for him, but they would never reach him. With a sudden snap the floor beneath them gave way, and the two plunged down to the first floor. The impact was so great, they broke through this floor as well, landing in a heap on the ground floor.\n\nGünter screamed out in pain, his arm and leg broken in multiple places. Udo lay spasming, a huge splinter of wood penetrating his brain. As Günter cried out for help, the soldier descended the stairs, tossing aside the saw he had used to weaken the boards. His gun out of reach, Günter could do nought but watch as the soldier forced the splinter deeper into Udo's skull with his foot before taking a shovel and smacking it repeatedly over Günter's head."
 DRL.379.a: "No, wait! We can-!"
 DRL.380.t: "Down the Drain"
 DRL.380.d: "The other three bandits searched through the various barracks houses, overturning old beds and tearing open dusty cabinets looking for their charge. As Ralf scoured the various buildings, he came across a number of old facilities, including the mess hall and the communal showers. As he wondered curiously whether the showers still worked, the terrible sound of guttural screams and the distant thwack, thwack, thwack of a shovel echoed out from across the base.\n\nJörg and Marc raced off to investigate the sound, but Ralf felt satisfied that they could handle it. It was just one soldier, after all, what harm could he do versus the wolves of Germany? Entering the dank and musty shower quarters, he tried each shower in turn. Disappointment built as one by one each failed to produce its promised stream, until finally one of them miraculously had a small amount of water left in its tank. The trickle was meager and very cold, but for a bandit so dirtied with filth and the stain of his sins it was a refreshing relief.\n\nAs Ralf washed the water over his face and down his arms, he was blissfully unaware of the figure slowly creeping behind him. Too late did he catch sight of a shadow on the wall, cast by the light through the entry doorway. The shadow of a blade raised to strike. He spun around just in time for the blade to plunge into his chest. The ceaseless masked figure raised his blade and plunged it down again. And again. And again. Ralf screamed in agony, his feeble resistance growing weaker and weaker with each blow.\n\nAs he finally slumped down to the ground, life ebbing away, Ralf watched as the figure calmly turned from the macabre scene and walked out the door. As the last trickle of blood left his body the final dregs of water carried it all away down the drain."
 DRL.380.a: "Get away, you Psycho! AARGH-"
 DRL.381.t: "An Axe to Grind"
 DRL.381.d: "Marc roared with fury at the sight of the tenderized bodies of their compatriots. He no longer cared whether he brought their prey back to camp alive or in bloody chunks. For a slav to be so stubborn and refuse to surrender to superior German warriors was the gravest insult he could imagine. He pictured himself catching the wretch and laughing as he begged him for mercy.\n\nAs Jörg began to formulate a plan, another horrible scream rang out from where they had just came from. Determined this time to catch the bastard, Marc sprinted from the building, Jörg struggling to keep up behind him. They raced out across the open grass, hoping that a direct and rapid assault would enable them to overwhelm their foe.\n\nWithout warning, a gunshot rang out from behind one of the barracks, the bullet screaming narrowly above Jörg's head and slamming into the grass. Caught out in the open, the two desperately ducked for cover behind the barracks, as Jörg returned fire with his luger. However, Marc was not quick enough as a bullet slammed into his leg and sent him tumbling to the ground.\n\nAs Marc screamed in pain, Jörg turned just in time to see the soldier emerging and striding with unnatural confidence towards them. He pulled his luger up to fire, but cursed as the empty gun merely clicked in his hands. Falling back behind the nearest building, he began to reload, only to realize that he had left his extra ammunition with the raiding party supply.\n\nMarc writhed on the floor as the figure approached. Laying his rifle to the side, he took a sharp axe from his belt and prepared to swing. His pathetic pleas for mercy were not enough to stop the axe from tearing into his chest, into his arm, into his face."
 DRL.381.a: "No! Please, please! NOOOOOO-"
 DRL.382.t: "The Hunter and the Hunted"
 DRL.382.d: "With his companion butchered before his eyes and his ammunition all spent, Jörg stood frozen, experiencing a feeling he had not had for a very long time.\n\nFear.\n\nThe figure, with the gore from Marc's mutilated body now caking the front of his visor, slowly turned its gaze upwards to face him. A moment of stillness lapsed. Neither making a move.\n\nThe soldier charged. Jörg ran in utter terror.\n\nAs he fled for his life, axe-wielding maniac in hot pursuit, he passed the shower building and caught a glimpse of Ralf's bloody corpse. The chase would also lead him past the shed where Ershat had met his bitter end. Jörg soon realized the true peril of the situation he was in. A pack of six men had hunted one lone wolf, but now only he remained, and the hunter had become the hunted.\n\nApproaching the fence where they entered, he cried out with horror as he saw that his pursuer had even had the damnable foresight to block that off. This was no man, but a calculating demon - or more probably an angel - sent to punish him for his sins.\n\nWith nowhere else left to go, he ran for an old vehicle depot where a few broken trucks still sat parked, and tried to lose his pursuer in the obstruction."
 DRL.382.a: "What are you?!"
 DRL.383.t: "A Last Stand"
 DRL.383.d: "As he crouched behind the old transport vehicle, Jörg tried desperately not to breathe. He could hear the unknown soldier's footsteps, pacing methodically and purposefully around each remaining truck, looking for his quarry. He scanned the place desperately for any sort of thing to help him, when he spotted an old tire iron lying beneath his hiding space.\n\nTaking it gently in his hands, he crept slowly around the back of the truck, hoping to catch his pursuer by surprise. He waited carefully until his pursuer had passed before he steeled himself. Holding his weapon tightly, he swung wildly around the truck and-\n\nThere was nobody there.\n\nA moment's confusion was all he had before he heard the whooshing of air behind him. Jörg ducked just in time for the axe blade to miss him by inches, slamming into the window of the truck with a crash. He spun around and slammed his tire iron into the side of his enemy's head. He forgot, of course, that his opponent was wearing that thick visored helmet of the Guard. The only reaction from the soldier was a mild grunt of surprise. Amusement, even.\n\nCasting aside his axe, the soldier grabbed Jörg by the neck and began squeezing. Choking for air, he slammed his weapon furiously around hoping to strike some sensitive point. For a brief moment he could see the soldier's eyes through the visor, and saw for the first time the burning, malignant hatred.\n\nWith a sweep of his leg he was able to knock the soldier off balance, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Both now bereft of weapons, they resorted to a desperate fistfight, each slamming the other with all their might. They tossed and threw each other around, each becoming drenched in blood.\n\nIn the end, only one man would remain standing."
 DRL.383.a: "Die, damn you!"
 DRL.384.t: "A Final Message"
 DRL.384.d: "When Oskar Dirlewanger awoke the next day, his subordinates would report several members from the latest raiding party unaccounted for. Probably deserters. He would vow to have them slaughtered if they ever returned, and that would be that. The day would go on, Dirlewanger would continue to live his sinful life, and eventually he would go back to sleep.\n\nWhen he awoke the day after, he would leave his tent to a great commotion. His men would lead him out of the camp to a macabre scene. Six wooden spikes. Impaled on the ends of each would be the heads of the missing men. One with a dagger driven through his head. One with a stake of wood lodged in his brain. One whose skull had been cracked open. One surprisingly clean. One filthy with his own gore.\n\nAnd one that was beaten, crushed and broken beyond all recognition.\n\nDirlewanger would ponder this scene for a moment. Then he would shrug and order everyone back to their business. He would continue to live his sinful life, and eventually he would go back to sleep. The heads would remain on the spikes, standing silent vigil over the camp the next day, and the next, and the next, until their remaining flesh slowly sloughed away.\n\nIn the distance, an unknown soldier would watch the camp. He would watch Dirlewanger give little heed to the warning. And he would know then that the only way he would ever get the message is if every last member of his horde of nightmares was hunted to a man."
 DRL.384.a: "Just another day in Russia."
 DRL.385.t: "An Escape?"
 DRL.385.d: "Jörg stumbled into the abandoned farmhouse and collapsed on the ground, his breath heaving.\n\nHaving barely escaped the military base with his life, the once stoic and brutal bandit now lay almost weeping with the shock of what had happened. Seven hardened men of the Brigade versus one man of the effeminate League, and this was the outcome? If he returned now, Dirlewanger was probably more likely to have him killed from mere shame than the act of desertion.\n\nHe comforted himself with the simple knowledge that the beast of a man they had fought was no longer a problem. The last he had seen of the soldier, he lay bleeding profusely upon the ground, a broken wreck of a man. Pondering his next moves, he glanced around the farmhouse and remarked that this was a fine place to stay. Perhaps he could lay low here for a few months, before eventually meeting up with one of the other bands of splitters and returning to his life as a ravager.\n\nJörg climbed into the old bed and tried his best to get some sleep.\n\nHe would not sleep for the full night.\n\nJörg woke to the visage of a man in a mask staring down at him over the bed. Though covered in dents and dried blood, the soldier was very much alive.\n\nJörg screamed as the unknown soldier beat him ferociously with the same tire iron he had once used, before the screaming stopped and Jörg finally slept forever."
 DRL.385.a: "Not you! Why won't you die! AAAHHH-"
 DRL.400.t: "Lysenko Loyalists Flee South"
 DRL.400.d: "It was a dark night around Orsk when a group of mysterious people arrived at the camp of the bandits of Oskar Dirlewanger. Those desperate souls with exhausted gaze and starved bodies talked in an incomprehensible tongue and outrageously insisted from the camp guards to allow them to meet the Bandit King himself. Restraining themselves from murdering them at sight and acquiring their fancy technological toys, the guards couldn't understand at first why would anyone dare to ask such demands from the most dreaded criminals of Southern Russia. Only after recognizing some of the verbal clues they realized that those were the scientists of Magnitogorsk escaping their fate from their former lapdogs in the NKVD.\n\nThose survived Lysenkoists of Magnitogorsk, who learned about the miserable fate of their comrades in the hands of NKVD, immediately left their laboratories and factories, taking with themselves the most valuable items into the wilderness of Siberia. Being aware that for their most horrible crimes no sane communities would accept their presence, the scientists attempted to find refuge in Dirlewanger's camps, believing that the Black Bandit will find a use of their knowledge and will spare them of death.\n\nUpon learning about his new guests, Dirlewanger immediately ordered his men to seize the whole belongings of the scientists and spread them across the camp and tasked his new minions to start mass production of weaponry and supplies, while treating his new servants even lower than slaves. Undoubtedly, Dirlewanger took a sadistic pleasure in the whole process, as he now he has under his cruel thumb the very same people who mocked him for being an illiterate barbarian. For the former Lysenkoist scientists themselves, nothing mattered anymore. Only survival."
 DRL.400.a: "How the mighty have fallen."
 DRL.401.t: "A Most Delightfully Devilish Trap!"
 DRL.401.desc: "After relations between Lysenko and the Dirlewanger Brigade broke down, open conflict was practically inevitable. However, few expected Dirlewanger to have the gall to directly invade the Black Mountain itself, but the Bandit King and his men attempted to capture the peak nonetheless. Reports have arrived of massive losses, and although the brigade eventually managed to fight their way into the facility, booby traps built years ago for this exact eventuality killed dozens of bandits. One of those to fall to the insidious devices was Dirlewanger himself, who was suddenly and violently electrocuted by a trap involving a pressure plate on a door handle. His band, while ultimately successful in taking the mountain, have already fallen into infighting over the spoils."
 DRL.401.a: "A shocking death."
 DRL.402.t: "The Knife's Edge"
 DRL.402.desc: "Members of Dirlewanger's gang of bandits awoke in shock as their leader was found dead, stabbed in the back with an old bayonet in his sleep. While the identity of the assassin is unknown, many believe it was done by a strange man speaking in fluent German who had appeared near the camp a day before. Many believe the man to have been an agent sent by some Nazi official who had wished Dirlewanger dead to assume control of the band.\n\nChaos rapidly consumed the bandits, but German agents soon arrived and offered them employment, and many are now drifting back west on a new mission."
 DRL.402.a: "A violent life ended violently."
 DRL.403.t: "A Rocky End"
 DRL.403.desc: "The seemingly unstoppable collision course between the Black Mountain and the Dirlewanger Brigade has reached its peak today. Following breakdowns in relations, Dirlewanger and his men have assaulted the Black Mountain, most likely trying to capture and execute Lysenko, the mad scientist that inhabits the mountain-turned-laboratory. Soon after engagement with the remnants of the 22nd NKVD Motor Rifle Division, guarding Lysenko and his experiments, it was reported Dirlewanger's men had stormed through the complex with extremely heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nUnfortunately for Dirlewanger, he and his bandits were unaware of numerous traps hidden throughout the complex. In a cunning scheme, several captives of the Motor Rifle Division pointed Dirlewanger and his men towards a door that they claimed led to a room filled \"with all the riches of Magnitogorsk.\" However, in the long hallway of the laboratory leading to said door, one of Dirlewanger's men inadvertently triggered a pressure plate. A trapdoor located above Dirlewanger and his personal guards quickly opened, dropping several heavy boulders from out of nowhere - killing the intruders instantly and gruesomely.\n\nFollowing reports of their leaders death, infighting broke out within members of the raider band, allowing Lysenko's men to take the upper hand. After six hours of bitter fighting, the Dirlewanger Brigade was forced to retreat from the mountain complex, being left to lick their wounds and gradually fall apart."
 DRL.403.a: "Was Dirlewanger stoned or something?"
 DRL.404.t: "Mad Hero of the East"
 DRL.404.desc: "Dirlewanger had recently picked up a horse that he named Conquest of the Urals, or Ural for short. The best of the lot that Dirlewanger had stumbled upon while scavenging on the frontier of his own personal domain, it was a beautiful black stallion with the mark of a triangle on its head. Against the brownish yellow of the plains, it glistened like a skeletal beauty. After Dirlewanger had read a little old pamphlet about the Cossacks, he decided to emulate their brave charges. Mounting his stallion and giving ownership of a group of ponies to his best underlings, Dirlewanger and his posse rode to a Ural camp. Whipping his horse with a determination to defeat his enemies, even the defenders were shocked at his speed, considering his age. Suddenly, Dirlewanger's horse began to buck in irritation. In a moment, Dirlewanger was knocked off and tumbled to the rocky ground. Whether a lucky bullet took down the horse, if it tripped, or was simply overexerted, it does not matter. What is important is that Dirlewanger is dead."
 DRL.404.a: "Just as Genghis passed."
 DRL.405.t: "Eyes Wide Open"
 DRL.405.desc: "After his capture by members of the Ural League, justice for Dirlewanger was swift. Following a rapid trial held in one of the many gulag fortresses in the Urals, the bandit was dragged out and, broadcast on an old radio transmitter to the entirety of Southern Russia, was shot by a firing squad.\n\nDirlewanger had refused a blindfold, and spat at the firing squad before they took their shots.\n\nAt the sounds of the rifles firing, crowds across Russia listening on ancient, scavenged radios all collectively cheered. Even several of the leaders of the warlord states have sent their congratulations."
 DRL.405.a: "It seems he finally bit the bullet."
 DRL.406.t: "Asking for Directions"
 DRL.406.desc: "While his brigands were out fighting and dying, it seems that Oskar Dirlewanger was more content to sit around and get blitzed from his personal stash of liquor in the command tent. His men were experienced killers, while the enemy were a bunch of glorified peasants with rifles, and a swift victory was expected. However, even the greatest soldiers can only do so well with an incompetent commander, let alone a blackout drunk one.\n\nAs the tide of the battle started turning against him, Dirlewanger's aides were terrified to tell him, afraid that he would shoot them in a drunken stupor. Rather, he did not notice until the sounds of enemy gunfire were disturbingly close to his position. Dirlewanger anxiously staggered out of his tent, flopped on top of his horse, and rode off-in the wrong direction. As he neared the enemy lines, the soldiers could hardly believe the sight: their deadliest foe, loping straight towards them and slurring a German drinking song. When he was less than ten feet away from the enemy, he finally realized something was amiss. He vacantly asked, \"Wait, where am I?\" and the soldier in front of him replied by unloading his submachine gun into Dirlewanger's skull."

 DRL.408.desc: "Tensions have always been high between Lysenko and Dirlewanger, and it is no surprise that Dirlewanger attempted to launch an assault on the Black Mountain. However, perhaps he should have taken more time to prepare his attack. Today he and many of his brigade met with a grisly fate today after he entered an abandoned mine that supposedly lead to the core of the mountain. As they entered the mine, Dirlewanger himself at the helm, the entrance to the mine collapsed, crushing several members of the Brigade and trapping more than three-quarters inside. With no supplies, they are not expected to survive very long."
 DRL.408.a: "The locals should have warned him... if only he spoke Russian."
 DRL.409.t: "That Lucky Old Sun"
 DRL.409.desc: "When it was announced that Göring's fabled Sun Gun would be crashing back down to Earth, many responded with shock and fear, worrying it may land in a populated city or somewhere that it may cause mass environmental damage. When its trajectory headed towards the Urals, however, the relief was palpable as many assumed it would land somewhere utterly uninhabited.\n\nThe debris fell south, however, and many in the main 'warcamp' of the Dirlewanger brigade awoke in shock as flaming debris fell from the skies, like a judgment from God. Most escaped on horse or in scavenged vehicles, but when they returned to the camp, they found their leader, Oskar Dirlewanger, and his personal vehicle, both crushed by a massive solar panel stamped with a Swastika."
 DRL.409.a: "It's a thing... a science thing. Don't worry about it."
 DRL.410.t: "One Hell of a Warning"
 DRL.410.desc: "The heavy snowfall from last night had left the ground covered in a white sheet. It was quite undisturbed, apart from a number of...footprints. The mercenary was not concerned, as this was the path most everyone took into the woods. After walking for about a minute, he came upon some branches suitable for the fire. Before he could collect them, his gaze was drawn by a red object on the ground. It was clear enough what it was upon picking it up, a bloodied finger. He quickly let go of it, but then he saw the drops of blood leading further into the woods. The red trail was blocked by a bush, but not one to be stopped, the mercenary pushed through it. He was quickly drenched in the blood that the bush was soaked with but he continued. It was on the other side of the bush that he found the source. There it was, impaled on a large wooden spike. He recognized Dirlewanger's head, even if it was missing the eyes and a chunk of the lower jaw. Next to the head were the burned remains of his uniform, the stench of urine making it clear that it had been quite ruined even before the immolation. The rest of Dirlewanger's body was scattered about the clearing that the bush had concealed. The majority of his naked torso had been crudely nailed to a tree. There were limbs hanging from trees and half-buried guts in the snow. The mercenary wasn't sure how to react, his only thought being that he didn't want to meet the same fate. As he ran out of the clearing, he noticed a photograph. It showed Dirlewanger with a number of masked men behind him, their guns pointed at his head.\n\nBack at the camp, the absence of the commander was becoming obvious and many were already suspecting that he was dead. So when the mercenary presented the picture to his superiors, chaos quickly followed..."
 DRL.410.a: "A man like that makes a lot of enemies."
 DRL.411.t: "The Line"
 DRL.411.desc: "When Bormann instructed his new shadow ops division to provide reconnaissance and tactical support for the Ural League, many were dismayed that their mandate did not include instructions to stop Dirlewanger, and end the warpath of his so called \"brigade\". The \"Butcher of Siberia\" has been a disgrace to the Aryan race for too long, and much of the high command believed that his death would be necessary to cleanse the stain on German honor. Shadow Ops Team Delta Four seems to have agreed, as shortly after their arrival, they broke away from their Ural allies and launched a solo assault on the Dirlewanger Brigade's camp.\n\nAfter nearly three days of intense firefights, and heavy casualties on both sides, a sole radio signal was received from the camp. The team's leader, Martin Valker, proclaimed that he had \"killed the bastard\", and requested immediate evacuation.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports that the higher echelons of the German Leadership are furious with the Shadow Division's diversion from its orders, but if this is true, they seem to have decided to conceal their feelings, and have publicly congratulated and honored the captain. Curiously, Dirlewanger's death seems to have sparked a small-scale redemption of the Reich in the view of the southern ural's populace, and the local supply of collaborators and informers has increased noticeably."
 DRL.411.a: "He must feel like a hero."
 DRL.412.t: "The End of a Road Warrior"
 DRL.412.desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian wastelands have been a violent, chaotic place, with danger present in a million different forms. Even simple recreation can be life threatening, as the events of today have shown.\n\nDirlewanger and a few of his stooges were racing several salvaged vehicles around the outskirts of his compound today, in a competition that was one part drag race, five parts demolition derby. During the event, Dirlewanger was in the passenger seat of his own customized rig, shouting instructions at his driver and firing his sidearm at the other contestants and occasionally at the audience as well. After exhausting his ammunition, in a fit of rage Dirlewanger leapt from the cabin of his vehicle, attempting to hijack a competitor's car. However, it seems he miscalculated his jump, as he missed the door of the car and was crushed beneath it's wheels. He reportedly clung on to life for several more minutes, his last words being \"I don't want to die like this. I want to die historic.\" Reports of infighting amongst the band have already begun to spread in the wake of his death."
 DRL.412.a: "Witness him."
 DRL.413.t: "The Horror"
 DRL.413.desc: "When planning their most recent raid on the peripheral Russian villages near Orsk, Oskar Dirlewanger came up with a novel idea: rather than simply ride or march there, they can commandeer old steamboats and raid along the Ural river. When nightfall came, Dirlewanger insisted to his men that they press on, and his steamer continued upriver; unbeknownst to him, the rest of the men had camped on the riverbank for the night. They attempted to catch up to their leader, only to find themselves increasingly delayed by engine troubles, inclement weather, and harassment by Russian partisans for weeks on end.\n\nWhen they finally found Dirlewanger's steamer, it was half-sunk by the banks of an abandoned Russian village. The rest of the crew were all dead, seemingly killed by bullets and bayonets. The only living man in the village was Dirlewanger himself, sitting emaciated, delirious, and half-dead in a hut. The men brought him back onto one their steamers and immediately headed downriver, hoping to return to Orsk and proper medical services posthaste. However, Dirlewanger's condition continued to deteriorate further, and he finally died less than a day away from Orsk.\n\nThe sight of Dirlewanger's body being unloaded into the brigade's camp immediately sparked chaos, which soon spiraled out into a free-for-all of blood and death. It seems that the 36th as a group died on the river with their leader."
 DRL.413.a: "Herr Dirlewanger-he's dead."
 DRL.414.t: "A Red Wedding"
 DRL.414.desc: "The uneasy alliance between Dirlewanger and Lysenko has often been seen by many as a dysfunctional marriage, hallmarked by a clear dislike of the other, punctuated by crippling distrust.\n\nYet today, it seemed as though things may look up for the disjointed cooperators. Invited to Black Mountain to test new weaponry, Dirlewanger was delighted to accept. For so long he had hoped to unearth the secrets of the mysterious mountaintop fortress, and spared no expense in bringing his best troops with him. After much celebrating and ogling over new weapons, alcohol began to flow like blood from a dead man. Drugs, booze, women, it seemed as though the world, if just for a minute, was just and pure.\n\nOskar should have known better than to let his guard down, even as a beautiful veteran of the West Russian War was calling his name. Lysenko, aided by his vanguard, had disarmed the intoxicated men of the Brigade at their most vulnerable moments. With a sharp yell and the drop of an arm, followed by the cackle of gunfire, the entire floor lay dead. Reports indicate that the body of Dirlewanger was later paraded through the surrounding area, with Lysenko triumphantly exclaiming that the monster of the Urals was dead."
 DRL.414.a: "The Mountain has become a battlefield- no, a butcher's den."
 DRL.415.t: "Mauled"
 DRL.415.desc: "Earlier today, Oskar Dirlewanger attempted to breach the mysterious compound at Magnitogorsk. However, immediately after the expedition began, he was bifurcated at the waist by one of Lysenko's many booby traps, which would go on to claim many more members of the Brigade before they finally reached the core. Despite their victory, the Brigade has been severely weakened, and are not likely to pose much of a threat anymore."
 DRL.415.a: "I've had worse!"
 DRL.416.t: "Makarov"
 DRL.416.desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, fair law and justice has been regarded as a myth, a fairy tale long ago, never to return to the devastated lands of Russia. This, at least, was the view of most people inhabiting the bombed wastelands. However, it appears justice is still served to the most wicked.\n\nSomehow, possibly through bribes or even simply the raiders not taking him seriously, a man claiming to be a 'Ural Ranger' walked into the war camp of the brigade and challenged Dirlewanger to a duel. Upon finishing his laughing fit, Dirlewanger accepted, believing he could earn a thirty-sixth notch on his Luger.\n\nAt twenty past eleven, the duel began. With the brigade in full attendance to witness this spectacle, many believed that the Ural Ranger, referred to as a 'handsome blyat' by some, was about to meet death. These expectations were shattered, however, when the Ranger, wielding a Makarov, quickly pulled out his pistol and shot Dirlewanger with a deadly aim.\n\nAs the chaos following the death of the bandit leader turned to violence, the Ural Ranger seemingly vanished, becoming yet again part of the vast wastes of Russia, never to be seen again."
 DRL.416.a: "Where did that ranger even hide the Makarov? His hip?"
 DRL.417.t: "German Firing Line"
 DRL.417.desc: "\"Shoot me now or shoot me later, every schoolboy to his sport. Death to each and every coward, I renounce your Fuhrer's court!/\" were the words on rogue SS officer Oskar Dirlewanger's lips shortly before he met his end at the hands of a German firing squad. With the Reich's return in force to the lands of Russia, the powers that be in Germania decided there was no room for Dirlewanger's rogue battalion in their new order and the justice that had long eluded the Russians he and his men had terrorized was meted out by a special Wehrmacht task force. With their leader dead and their lands occupied, Dirlewanger's Brigade will cause no more headaches for the Fatherland's march into Russia."
 DRL.417.a: "Surprisingly poetic for a perverted traitor."
 DRL.418.t: "Lysenko's Gift"
 DRL.418.desc: "After his conquest of the Black Mountain of Magnitogorsk, The Black Bandit was hosting a gargantuan feast for the members of his Brigade with booze, women and song galore. It was a moment of celebration for men who for years only knew war, and light and laughter could be heard for miles away. While the ceremony was at its most heated moment, Oskar Dirlewanger himself, the Bandit King of the Urals, fired his Luger from the back of a truck, getting the attention of the crowd. But before he could speak to his followers, the leader of the Terror Brigade started coughing up red blood. The onlookers didn't come close as the crimson fluid ran through the floor, afraid of catching the same malaise as their downed commandant, but they were not spared. Soon many members of the Brigade began pouring blood out of their entrails. Few survived Dirlewanger's feast, and fewer still know what was the cause of the horrific scene, but rumors spread by refugees tell of a weapon being developed by Lysenko nicknamed the Red Death that produces similar symptoms, and it is rumored that members of the Brigade came in contact with its test subjects."
 DRL.418.a: "Lysenko brought a gift to the feast."
 DRL.419.t: "Causes Unknown"
 DRL.419.desc: "During a routine march through a cleared area, it is alleged that Oskar Dirlewanger leader of the 36th Brigade suddenly fell from his saddle, and was found to be dead. The cause of death is unknown, lacking skilled doctors the 36th could only determine that he was not poisoned, no entry wounds could be found on his body, and his neck was not broken in the fall. Further investigations are impossible now as the 36th have largely disintegrated in a leadership struggle..."
 DRL.419.a: "This is my third biggest fear, brain aneurysms."
 DRL.420.t: "Pure Insanity"
 DRL.420.desc: "As Oskar Dirlewanger inspected his soldiers at the camp's makeshift firing range, he suddenly clutched the left side of his body, complaining about chest pains. He was quickly ushered toward the medical tent, where he began coughing up blood-immediately making his bodyguards suspect that this was not a medical emergency but a deliberate attempt on their commander's life. As Dirlewanger was prepared for operation, his last words before losing consciousness were to his surgeons, telling them \"I hope you are all German.\" He would never wake up again.\n\nThe surgery was ultimately a failure-blood had pooled in his lungs and suffocated him, they said-but it did reveal his cause of death: six shots, a unique type of 7.62mm ammunition used in Nagant revolvers, fired into his upper back at close range. The guards searched the camp trying to find anyone with a matching weapon, and soon they found their culprit: a new member named Ivan Bylinkin, who was caught trying to flee the campsite on horseback. After a brief interrogation, he confessed to the crime, with his hope of northern Russia's Soviet remnants welcoming him as a hero. Among his few possessions were letters drafted to important figures like General Georgy Zhukov and renowned aviatrix Yevdokia Bershanskaya, even asking for the latter's hand in marriage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bylinkin was quickly executed by Dirlewanger's bodyguards after getting all the useful information they could. But it was not enough to reassert order; Dirlewanger had not appointed an heir to succeed him, and the camp soon broke out into infighting among the lieutenants."
 DRL.420.a: "That's one way to impress a woman."
 DRL.421.t: "Hounded"
 DRL.421.desc: "Today, infamous SS commander Oskar Dirlewanger was reported to have been brutally killed in his barracks in the Urals. Reports alleged that the Black Bandit had developed a habit of locking prisoners in a small room with a pack of hungry dogs. Seemingly, a prisoner made an escape attempt and thrust Dirlewanger into the dog cage first, slamming the door behind him. The dogs, hungry from days upon days of unlucky raids with no food attacked Dirlewanger, tearing him apart. Once this was discovered by his subordinates hours later, the dogs were immediately slaughtered and infighting between the bandits began. The 36th Division has broken up amidst heavy violence."
 DRL.421.a: "Live by the sword, die by the... hungry dog?"
 DRL.422.t: "A Simple but Sudden End"
 DRL.422.desc: "News from the Urals today report of the death of Oskar Dirlewanger, but not in the way one might expect of someone with such a fearsome reputation as his.\n\nDirlewanger's bandits, while on a raid in yet another village, were busy ransacking the place before noticing their leader wasn't with them. Looking around the village, he was eventually found dead in the mud, with a rock not lying far from his corpse.\n\nAfter terrorising the villagers still alive to see if they had seen what befell their leader, they discovered that an old man, after seeing the dreaded bandits riding into town, picked up a stone and threw it at Dirlewanger. This shot struck true, hitting Dirlewanger clean in the head and instantaneously killing him.\n\nAfter they learnt of this and left the village, infighting broke out immediately and the bandit army is already beginning to dissolve."
 DRL.422.a: "That was one lucky throw!"
 DRL.423.t: "Overdosed"
 DRL.423.desc: "Although some reports coming from the abandoned lands of the Urals can be rather sketchy, it seems to be confirmed that Oskar Dirlewanger is dead. The accepted story is that during a raid on a village, Dirlewanger and his men discovered a stash of desomorphine. In what they considered to be their best find in weeks, Dirlewanger's band rabidly consumed the stash, with Dirlewanger himself taking a larger portion of the desomorphine than any other. Hours later, it appears Dirlewanger was found comatose, with little signs of life. Soon after, fighting among the gang began as each attempted to claim the rest of the desomorphine Dirlewanger had stashed."
 DRL.423.a: "Stay away from drugs, children of Russia."
 DRL.424.t: "Sledgehammered"
 DRL.424.desc: "Reports coming from the south Urals suggest that Oskar Dirlewanger, the dreaded Black Bandit, has suffered a grizzly demise. While raiding a village on the outskirts of the Orenburg Commune, Dirlewanger had cornered a seemingly defenceless peasant in a work shed. Seeing his prey cowering before him, Dirlewanger was plotting a most despicable end for the poor peasant, when they suddenly snatched up the only weapon available to them – a sledgehammer!\n\nThe peasant struggled to lift the heavy and unwieldy tool, and Dirlewanger seemed incredibly amused at their feeble efforts. Allowing them to get a few clumsy swings in, Dirlewanger roared with laughter as he effortlessly dodged their attacks several times. So lost was he in his own mirth, that he did not react as the peasant finally swung true, caving in the Bandit's skull and putting an end to the most wretched man in Russia.\n\nThe brave peasant quickly made their escape, and upon discovering the demise of their leader, the raiding party quickly fell into bickering and bloody infighting. Without Dirlewanger, the once terrifying band of ne'er-do-wells has shattered, and are not expected to trouble the people of the Russian steppes any longer."
 DRL.424.a: "A smashing conclusion."
 DRL.425.t: "The Ides of March"
 DRL.425.desc: "Celebrations have broken out across eastern Russia today as the notorious bandit Oskar Dirlewanger has reportedly been slain, and by no other hand than that of his own Brigade. It would seem a petty dispute over loot was blown far out of proportion, with many of the senior members of the Brigade heatedly arguing with each other to the point of coming to blows. Already in an even fouler mood than usual, Dirlewanger exploded at his men, calling them all 'sons of whore dogs' amongst other choice insults and proclaimed that as their leader, he would receive all the loot.\n\nThis clearly caused a few of the men to finally snap, for later that night as Dirlewanger was out relieving himself, he was ambushed by nearly a dozen figures and stabbed innumerable times. As his life ebbed away, Dirlewanger realized that these were all the same men he had insulted for the final time mere hours previously, apparently led by his own second-in-command, Fritz Schmedes. When Schmedes gleefully went in for the coup de grace, all Dirlewanger could do before his world went dark was feebly curse his men for their ultimate betrayal.\n\nSchmedes then attempted to take control of the Brigade, but fortunately for the people of Russia, many of the bandits refused to recognize his leadership, and violence quickly broke out. Various factions within the Brigade have splintered off and disappeared into the depths of Siberia, and what is left is a mere shadow of what was once a band of nightmares."
 DRL.425.a: "Et tu, Fritz?"
 DRL.426.t: "Komet Sighted!"
 DRL.426.desc: "As the men of the 36th scavenged through the ruins of Black Mountain in the wake of their victory, they found a small hangar with what seemed to be a fully-functioning fighter plane inside! Upon closer inspection by some of the Brigade's mechanics, they confirmed that it was a Komet rocket fighter, likely shot down during the West Russian war. It seems that Lysenko had his minions recover the wreck, haul it to Black Mountain, disassemble it for study, and then repair it to working order. Even more impressively, the mechanics verified that it was fully functional.\n\nOf course, Dirlewanger could not help but organize an impromptu flight show to display the power of the Brigade's new one-man air force. A quantity of sufficient fuel was amassed, a former Russian pilot volunteered, and a makeshift viewing pavilion was erected in an empty field outside of Magnitogorsk. As the Komet took off with a roar, Dirlewanger and the other commanders watched with glee as the rocket fighter did basic maneuvers with blinding speed across a clear sky. But as the pilot attempted to show off his skills and do a barrel roll, something went wrong. Smoke began pouring from the engine, and the fighter spun out of control and began hurtling to the ground at a breakneck pace. It slammed into the ground at hundreds of miles per hour, incinerating everything beneath it-which happened to be the viewing pavilion.\n\nAs the men nervously searched the smoking wreckage, all they found of their leader were clumps of charred bone and shrapnel, too pulverized to even conclusively identify as his remains."
 DRL.426.a: "It's an omen!"
 DRL.427.t: "Hardly Enough to Kill a Man"
 DRL.427.desc: "While Oskar Dirlewanger's drinking problem was not usually a major concern for his brigade, it did sometimes create problems of the more awkward variety. During particularly bad fits of heavy drinking, the commander would often challenge any man in a close enough proximity to a fight. These bouts of combat would usually involve Dirlewanger taking wild swings at his opponent while they pretended that fighting the old man was in any way intense. The battle would conclude with the soldier pretending that one of Dirlewanger's punches had connected and knocked them to the ground. However, this time the battle went awry as Dirlewanger elected to instead pull the man towards him. The commander was already unsteady from the copious amount of alcohol he had consumed and the added weight of the soldier only quickened his fall to the ground. This only elicited some careful chuckles from the surrounding soldiers. The soldier fell with his knee right on Dirlewanger's chest, which resulted in a distinct crunch. The Commander did not seem to react to this and simply staggered back to his feet. While the soldier knew that he had likely cracked his ribs, he decided that it was best to simply not mention it and get off scot-free. Instead, he approached Dirlewanger again and patted him on the back as a gesture of goodwill after the fight. The second slap produced another crunch which stopped the brigade leader in his tracks. He then collapsed into the dirt, quite dead."
 DRL.427.a: "That couldn't have possibly killed him!"
 DRL.428.t: "Strangulation"
 DRL.428.desc: "In a rarely-seen piece of good news in the lands of the former Soviet Union, it has been reported that the feared bandit leader and former SS officer Oskar Dirlewanger has died. Although details are unconfirmed, it seems that the bandit leader was strangled in his bed by another bandit, hoping to obtain all of his loot. Although the bandit was swiftly punished with a brutal execution, order has broken down among the brigade, and it is very clear that without Dirlewanger, his brigade will not survive long in the wastes of Russia."
 DRL.428.a: "Guess Oskar choked on his sharing test."
 DRL.429.t: "The Sky Aflame"
 DRL.429.desc: "It was late in the night when the sky was suddenly set ablaze. The thunder was so loud, the flashes so bright it was as if the gods themselves had opened up the heavens and let forth their full rage. The sight inspired equal amounts of awe and fear in the men of the Dirlewanger brigade, two emotions many of them had not felt in quite some time.\n\nDirlewanger assembled his chief lieutenants in his tent. While the men rambled about the gods, it was clear to the leaders of the bandits that a nuclear war had begun. All that remained to do was decide how they would react. Suddenly, a man shouted that something was coming towards the camp out of the sky, like a falling star. It was not a star.\n\nDirlewanger didn't have time to register seeing the missile before it landed in the center of the camp and plunged everything into atomic flame. Who sent the bomb? Only the ashes know, and they don't talk."
 DRL.429.a: "There is nothing left..."
 DRL.430.t: "On the Battlefield"
 DRL.430.desc: "While Dirlewanger's men were ultimately successful in destroying the Ural League, the final struggle over their last fortress gulag proved to be his undoing. During the battle, a Ural Guard sniper in one of the watchtowers managed to sight in on the bandit as he led his men in burning the 'city' and managed to put a bullet through the bandit's heart.\n\nWhile the League still lost the battle and was scattered to the mountains, Dirlewanger's band soon collapsed, shattering into numerous splinter groups with the death of their leader."
 DRL.430.a: "A rather merciful end for such a man."
 DRL.431.t: "The Gulag's Last Prisoner"
 DRL.431.desc: "When Dirlewanger and his men assaulted yet another fortress of the Ural League, the invasion went much like the others. Massive losses for the bandits, bitter League defenders refusing to give up any inch of ground, a gargantuan battle for a small piece of ancient concrete.\n\nWhen Dirlewanger entered the lower sections of the prison this time, however, clearing out several bastions of resistance with his men, he became cut off.\n\nLost in the tunnels of the prison, Dirlewanger soon found himself in a cell and, by mistake, locked himself inside. His men found him several days later, dead, reason unknown. Leaving his body in its cell, they soon fell into infighting, and Dirlewanger's Brigade is already collapsing into itself with no clear leader in sight."
 DRL.431.a: "A prison to die for."
 DRL.432.t: "Letting Go"
 DRL.432.desc: "Dirlewanger, lured by the promise of the Black Mountain, could not escape. Once inside the vaults and catacombs of the facility, the facility did not let go. Dirlewanger soon became lost in the vast tunnel systems, and finally passed away. The facility, playing many of the noises it heard through ancient microphones on repeat over dilapidated speaker systems, created a new voice to echo through the tunnels with the others that filled the catacombs. It was the result of forgotten devices left on for years, and was meant to carry on the voices of others. It assumed a new likeness in the Bandit. A means of allowing the dead to begin again, speaking into the darkness, into eternity."
 DRL.432.a: "Getting into the Black Mountain is not the hard part. It's letting go."
 DRL.433.t: "Aphōnos"
 DRL.433.desc: "The two men once had a small talk about death prior. Riding back from bloodshed now forgotten but not yet forgiven, they exchanged words on how they had witnessed every way man could turn into matter, how meaningless and routine the unspeakable has become. They speculated upon Dirlewanger himself. His death reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of all godless men.\n\nThe fateful day came after a lost battle, the retreating army receiving the news scarcely a few acres away. The captain is dead, announced Schmendes. Nothing to eulogize upon. He ordered for the group, now a shell of its former self, to move on. And so they did, except for the colonel and the officer. They asked what happened to the Oberführer. \"You have no reason to know,\" he replied. \"Time will come to bury him.\"\n\nUnconvinced, the two deserted the brigade and traced their way back into the site of engagement, soon finding the uniformed corpses of those fallen to the Russians. Upon a hill, there was the wreckage of an automobile known to be the preference of their commander, and a startlingly deep depression upon the ground. The colonel hiked up onto the elevation before he froze, his visage utterly paralyzed at the sight of the hollow.\n\n\"Jesus fucking christ.\" He stared into the hole for some time more, then blinked and he turned around to make his way, his face contorted in a grimace too powerful to regorge.\n\n\"What happened to him, Dietrich?\" He did not respond. \"Dietrich?\" The officer slowly moved up onto the mound and looked into the hole.\n\nTransmission terminates here."
 DRL.433.a: "Gospodi, pomiluj."
 DRL.434.t: "The Drowning"
 DRL.434.desc: "The bartender methodically took every bottle of vodka he owned, poured away half of each, and refilled them with ethanol. He had no way to procure poison, but what he did have was a voluminous supply of alcohol, and foresight of the coming calamity. He knew the pattern in which the brigade struck, and he knew that central to the genocidal routine was deprecating cases of whatever alcohol they could find followed by unbridled drinking, before the most horrific crimes of the rampages began. His plan was to inebriate the bandits until they couldn't lay waste to anyone except themselves.\n\nWhen the furor began, he lay silent in his cellar, listening to the German shouting and laughter above, over time, morphing into screaming, brawling, and vomiting. He knew none of the language, yet he could tell that they treated the vodka as not toxin but a challenge. But as the night raged on, the tremors quieted down, and soon he fell asleep convinced that his contingency failed, and he had saved no one but himself.\n\nAfter awakening the next morning, he arose from his basement, expecting nothing but his bar destroyed and the town razed. What he found instead left him speechless. Strewn across his pub, lifeless bodies of the band were collapsed upon every stool, grasping empty bottles of liquor. The commander himself was slumped over on shards of broken glass, his face almost unidentifiable from mutilation. Every single patron overdosed. The reign of terror was over."
 DRL.434.a: "And they say it is the Russians that drink irresponsibly..."
 DRL.435.t: "The Ghosts of Khatyn"
 DRL.435.desc: "At the exact moment of the rogue Oberführer's death, the lone exile heard the noise of thunder. He looked up to the stormy winter sky, then resumed to tend to his crops.\n\nScarcely less than a few minutes later, a young girl ran to his field and spoke. She was somewhere less than thirteen, yet her azure eyes seemed weary and infinitely old. \"It's over,\" she said to the farmer in Belorussian. He stared at the child in disbelief. He had not heard a word in his native tongue in decades. She then scurried back into the coniferous forest.\n\nHalf an hour passed. The farmer was about to retire into his home until he saw a man, a rifle in his arms, his composition unrecognizable yet his face faintly familiar, approach in the distance. \"Flyora, my brother,\" he whispered, again in his language. \"Come and see.\" The farmer refused to believe that he was not dreaming. Since the massacre, not once had anyone ever uttered his name. Not even himself. He followed the man into the wilderness.\n\nThey walked in silence until they came across the body, the man's daughter and her mother crouched over it, searching his black uniform for anything salvageable. A bullet wound pierced his chest, and blood flowed out of it like the stars of heaven onto the earth. The reunited camaraderie did not need to identify who he was. Standing over the corpse, the two comrades joined hands. And then they began to sing, a song from their youth in Khatyn. They sang a song of spring."
 DRL.435.a: "In the Southern Urals all things are older than man and they hum of mystery."
 DRL.436.t: "Explosive Results"
 DRL.436.desc: "In an apparent stroke of luck for the surrounding populace, the SS officer Oskar Dirlewanger has been reported dead! During a regular trip to pillage a commune in the wild rural areas of Russia, it seems Dirlewanger stumbled upon an unexploded German bomb, dropped during one of the many constant terror bombings that plagued the region. Seeing the opportunity to sell it on the black market, Dirlewanger proceeded to order several men to help him disassemble it.\n\nThis decision, however, proved to be a grave mistake for the bandit leader as the inexperienced pillagers proceeded to smash the bomb open, triggering an explosive reaction which killed Dirlewanger and his assistants. Chain of command in the brigade is reported to have broken down, and the future of the 36th is now up in the air."

 DRL.437.t: " A Matter Of Faith"
 DRL.437.desc: "The church had no name, it had but a few priests. Bent-backed elders and impressionable youths who sought something more than the constant toil of labor were the only ones who resided here. Now it had no roof, the flames licking higher and brighter against the storm darkened sky. Its few trinkets not already consigned to the flames had been piled up for division amongst the Bandits, the most choice piece of loot being a mighty sword supposedly carried to the Holy Land and back by a Crusader lord. The Black Bandit himself took pleasure in executing the nine men himself, forcing them to kneel in the dreadful light of their faith going up in ashes. The ninth man seemed resigned to his fate, content enough to pray while the others begged and pleaded for nonexistent mercy. The sharp crack of gunshots echoed the rumble of distant thunder.\n\nPausing to reload, Dirlewanger spat at the ninth man, and demanded of him via a translator, \"Why do you not struggle like the rest?\" The ninth man simply replied, \"God protected me from the Tsar, God protected me from the Reds, God protected me from the Germans. I have faith above all else that God will protect me from you.\" The man's calm defiance infuriated Dirlewanger, who abandoned his pistol for the Crusader's blade. Intent on battering the priest to death with the age-blunted weapon, he raised the sword high above his head.\n\nThe heavens opened and split. A bolt of lightning struck the Black Bandit, who fell to the ground dead. The 36th scattered in fear, dispersing under cover of the storm. The priest set about burying the dead, and turned his labors to restoring his church."

 DRL.438.desc: "Reports from the Urals seem to suggest that bandit leader Oskar Dirlewanger has died in a sudden accident.\n\nIt seems that after a long day of leading his men through a fight in Lysenko's mountain complex, Dirlewanger decided to take a break in an abandoned laboratory. The laboratory contained several large open vats of an unknown highly flammable substance, and it is theorized that during his rest Dirlewanger tripped and fell into one of these vats, soaking himself in the liquid. Not realizing what he was covered in, he then lit a cigarette, and was immediately engulfed in flames.\n\nAfter the bandit group discovered his charred remains, they quickly broke down into bitter infighting and it is hard to see them surviving after their leader's fiery end."

 DRL.439.t: "Master of Fate"
 DRL.439.desc: "The fight had gone sour. Somehow, these ragged Russian folk defending their village had managed to corner off Dirlewanger and his closest comrades and were ripping through them. The hope was if they managed to capture the Scourge of the Urals, they would be able to bargain for their village to be spared. Fighting with decades-old guns and even rusty farm tools, the peasants cut through Oskar Dirlewanger's longest-standing soldiers and officers until finally they had reached the devil himself.\n\nDirlewanger fell to his knees, guns aimed at his head from all sides. One of his captors spat at him. \"We finally got you, motherfucker. I hope your men refuse to negotiate so I can make your death as painful as possible.\"\n\nThe old man smiled, revealing a hideous grin filled with shattered teeth and rotting gums. \"There is only one man alive strong enough to kill me.\"\n\nWith impossible speed, the aging skeleton whipped out his personal pistol and blew his own brains out all over the snow. He died with that putrid smile still plastered across his face. As soon as his men found out, they fell to infighting over leadership and loot, and the band has now split and begun to fizzle out."
 DRL.439.a: "Only monsters can kill monsters."
 DRL.440.t: "The Pale Rider"
 DRL.440.desc: "Disturbing rumors from the south Urals region indicate that the dastardly Oskar Dirlewanger, along with the vast majority of his terrifying Brigade, have succumbed to a most slow and painful end. Reportedly, shortly after Dirlewanger and his crew returned from a long-distance raid, several of his men became extremely ill. The village they had raided had been curiously silent and the people mostly sick and dying, and it seems the raiders had contracted the very same illness that had struck down that unfortunate village.\n\nBefore the raiders realized what was happening, most of the Brigade was infected, including Dirlewanger himself. The sick were struck down with a horrible fever and abdominal cramping, becoming too weak to even walk. As the days drew on, those that were not already dead soon would be as they began to suffer from unceasing bleeding and gangrene, and their bodies became covered in buboes. Most foreign medical experts who have heard these rumors agree that the symptoms seem consistent with those of Yersinia Pestis – the Black Death.\n\nWithout access to modern medicine, Dirlewanger soon died a bloody, agonizing death. The chaos started much before that, however, with the remnants of the Brigade falling into disarray as those who remained alive found themselves helpless without their leader and stalked by the specter of death itself. The few who were lucky enough to get away uninfected have vanished into the wastes, and Dirlewanger's camp now sits eerily silent, with the mounds of rotting bodies the only evidence anyone was ever there."

 DRL.441.t: "Magic Bullet"
 DRL.441.desc: "The 'silence' of Dirlewanger's camp in the middle of the night was suddenly broken by a single shot, which echoed throughout canvas tents and prefab buildings. By the time Dirlewanger's most loyal men arrived at the scene, Dirlewanger was already dead, a single bullet punched directly through his temple, and a black hat covering his skeletal face.\n\nThe oddity arose, however, when his lieutenants decided to perform a formal 'investigation', primarily with the goal of implicating each other. There was no bullet hole in the tent's wall, no signs of entry, and no signs of a struggle. To make matters worse, the bullet, when found, was revealed to be an entirely different caliber than those used by the rest of the Brigade.\n\nOne final check was performed, checking Dirlewanger's own gun, only to find that it was unloaded, unfired, and spotlessly maintained.\n\nWith this perplexing state of affairs, and what was rapidly shaking up to be a mystery unheard of amongst the Brigade, the band has split and begun to tear itself apart in paroxysms of fear. As the story travelled West, the matter of the 'magic bullet' is spoken in hushed whispers...for who knows if the killer could strike again?"
 DRL.441.a: "Who killed Oskar Dirlewanger?"
 DRL.442.t: "The Bogeyman"
 DRL.442.desc: "Rumors are spreading from out of Siberia that Oskar Dirlewanger, the Black Bandit of the southern Urals and scourge of all Russians, has supposedly vanished without a trace. According to the stories, Dirlewanger and part of his brigade had been raiding a village a long distance from their main camp when a massive blizzard swept the region. In the difficult conditions Dirlewanger and his men were separated from each other, and when the weather finally cleared the Black Bandit was nowhere to be found.\n\nAt first, the brigade expected that he would eventually show up - after all, he and his crew had survived this very circumstance in the West Russian War a decade prior - but as the days drew on and Dirlewanger failed to return to camp, tempers began to flare. When at last the band concluded that he was lost to the wastes, infighting quickly broke out and the once fearsome band scattered to the four corners of the earth.\n\nThe loss of Dirlewanger might be seen as a great relief to most, but for the superstitious peasants who have been terrorized by his band for years, his disappearance has only added to his fearsome legend. Tales abound from the south Urals of Direwanger being sighted in the depths of the darkest forests, in the dingy alleyways of bombed out cities, atop the peaks of the icy Ural mountains and under the beds of misbehaving Russian children. Even as the chance of him showing up alive shrinks into the realm of impossibility, Dirlewanger will likely continue to live on in the nightmares of the Russians, becoming yet another monster to add to the canon of Russian folklore."
 DRL.442.a: "Behave yourself, or the Black Bandit will eat you alive!"
 DRL.443.t: "You're Fired"
 DRL.443.desc: "After decades of horror, Oskar Dirlewanger, terror of Russia, is finally dead. Though the details of his demise are vague to say the least, various people have put together the rather scattered reports to get a general idea of the events of that fateful day. Apparently, a lone Soviet veteran, using his weapon he kept after the war, made his way into the Brigade's main camp, where he slaughtered every single German he could hit. The Russian slaves were set loose, and those that escaped are the main source of information on the killing. According to them, Dirlewanger died after being impaled in an abandoned industrial building on a pipe. The slaves described the unknown soldier as amazingly stoic and resilient, withstanding multiple gunshot wounds, though this is just hearsay and likely an exaggeration. Whoever he was, Russia will be forever in his debt."

 DRL.444.t: "An Epiphany"
 DRL.444.desc: "The Bandit King is no more. Oskar Dirlewanger, the brutal SS officer and bandit leader who plunged the southern Urals into a decade of terror, has been confirmed dead after he reportedly went insane.\n\nAfter yet another brutal raid conducted on an Orenburg village commune, the former commander of the 36th began experiencing what he called 'an epiphany'. Stating that 'one man above controls everything', he allegedly babbled on about topics such as diverging timelines, secret societies, and \"legions of German tanks painted in the colors of the sunset\". As he continued, his ravings soon became intense and fanatical, and he eventually tackled one of his own men.\n\nThreatening to \"kill everyone who put me through this hell\", he uttered one final warning to \"the one who watches me die over and over\" before his inner circle were finally forced to put him down. Although the rest of the brigade was momentarily united in confusion and terror, this unification didn't appear to last, and while the inner circle tried to solidify control after shooting their own leader, the band quickly collapsed."
 DRL.444.a: "The ravings of a monster, his mind brought to ruin."
 DRL.445.t: "I Like My Venison Rare"
 DRL.445.desc: "The black army of Dirlewanger is rumored to feast on everything from souls to human flesh, but on this particular night what was being devoured were several deer that had been hunted out of the local woods. Oskar Dirlewanger was served a plate with a piece of charred venison on top, something which he felt the need to scoff at. \"This is nearly ash! I like my meat nice and fresh.\" The dish was quickly tossed to the dogs, and soon Dirlewanger was served a red and juicy cut of meat. He smiled, revealing crooked rotting teeth that shouldn't have been able to eat meat anyways, and dug in.\n\nThe following morning, it was clear that the bandit king was extremely sick. He was vomiting and green in the face, and with what little medical expertise they had his soldiers guessed he had food poisoning or something of the sort. Expecting him to recover soon, the band was shocked when later that day it was announced by a shaking and horrified bandit that their leader was dead. The camp fell into chaos after a few hours of negotiations and rising tensions, and it seems the scourge of the Urals will no longer terrorize crying women or undercooked wildlife ever again."
 DRL.445.a: "Revenge is a dish best served rare."
 DRL.446.t: "Thirteen Days, Thirteen Nights"
 DRL.446.desc: "While out on a raid, the Brigade's main convoy was hit with an ambush from within the deep snowy white. Bullets and explosives shredded the trucks, leaving bloody holes were men once were and many moaning in the dirty slush below. Amidst the chaos, Dirlewanger himself managed to escape and despite a wound to the thigh trekked out of the warzone alone. He walked for hours, even as the clamor of gunfire and explosions faded, just hoping to reach camp. The blood oozing from his wound froze before it could clot, stiffening his figure and forcing him to limp across the plains. He subsided off of roots and, when vegetation became sparse, he picked worms from the loose soil. On the tenth day the wound became infected and his legs too weak to carry him, forcing him trudge across the ground on his belly as a pathetic slug clinging for life would. At dawn on the fourteenth day of his death throe, he could finally see the camp lights. So close they were he could almost feel the fire's warmth as he approached.\n\nBut he would not come to feel anything more as his stiffened legs and brittle fingers could push him no further. In his blurring vision, Dirlewanger's final sights were of the dancing flames, too far away to do anything for the sad man caked in snow."
 DRL.446.a: "All that struggle, just to die in the end."
 DRL.447.t: "Do as the Russians Do."
 DRL.447.desc: "A few weeks ago, all the leaders of what settlements remained in the Brigade's occupation were given a diplomatic communique by reportedly \"Very shady looking slavs\". The communique contained a single letter, with five words and a date written on it.\nMy camp. Be there. Dirlewanger. (Insert Dirlewanger's death date)\nThe message baffled everyone at the time, but nobody paid too much importance to it. It was probably a scam, a shitty assassination attempt or even worse. The purpose of the letter remained a mystery - to this day.\nReportedly, a daring Russian villager challenged Dirlewanger to throw the greatest vodka party. The villager was of course brutally impaled immediately after, but the fierce words didn't leave the commander's head. He ordered his men to sack every village for all the vodka they could find, human skulls and spices - few that they were. His men dutifuly followed those orders, of course having some fun for themselves while at it, but they knew that the real fun was only about to arrive.\nInvitations were sent to all great men in Russia. The party lasted days, and hectolitres of vodka poured from bottles on a daily basis. Some soldiers were reported to have stomached enough alcohol to give them 20 permille alcohol blood content - truly showing the prowess of Aryan genes. Dirlewanger challenged his men to a game of Truth or Dare - what followed were terrifying confessions and even more terrifying dares. Some villagers who came by the party in its later stages are said to suffer from PTSD just from hearing the 'Truths' spoken by the rogue SS-Men.\nUnfortunately, it was too much for Dirlewanger. After being challenged to zero down a small barrel of vodka mixed with spices, bone dust and blood and actually following through with the dare, the insane commander dropped dead after screaming a final 'Сукаааа папали!'. His comrades seem still shocked that such a staunch Nazi would speak Russian as his last words."

 DRL.448.t: "Right Place, Wrong Time"
 DRL.448.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger, terror of Russia, is dead at last. Reports indicate that during a routine execution of a Russian village, a mysterious young man wearing a black jacket and a red bandanna entered the camp, dispatching Brigade members left and right with nothing but his bare hands. Despite the best efforts of the 36th's finest, he effortlessly fought his way through the bandits, and this unknown assailant eventually arrived face-to-face with Dirlewanger himself.\n\nAlthough he could not speak either German or Russian, it seemed that this man was attempting to challenge the Black Bandit to unarmed single combat. Dirlewanger, either too angry to think rationally or refusing to back down in front of his men, silently nodded and accepted the challenge, as the remnants of the Brigade circled around the two fighters. Unsurprisingly, Dirlewanger was off to a rough start and just got worse. He had the coordination of a drunken boxer, while his enemy fought like he was out of an eastern legend. As Dirlewanger lay on the ground, coughing up blood, his opponent gruffly muttered something in a foreign language before shattering the Black Bandit's skull with a single punch.\n\nThe survivors wordlessly parted for the man as he walked out of the village, his job seemingly done. As he passed over the next hill, a lightning bolt shot down from the sky, despite it being completely clear out. When the men went to investigate, there was not a sign of the mysterious killer to be found."

 DRL.449.t: "A Classic Tale"
 DRL.449.desc: "After a recent raid on a nearby settlement, Dirlewanger and his men were marching back to camp. But as they traveled on, Dirlewanger became separated and soon found himself without direction or bearing. But, as fortune has it, he stumbled upon a local village girl walking to her Babushka's house. Asking for directions, he uncovered the location and soon sped away. When the young girl arrived, she noticed her Babushka, cooking potatoes. Strangely enough, her Babushka had grown a stubble since she had last seen her. And gained some weight. Most surprising of all, her Babushka had grown a full set of teeth back! The young girl then noticed a hand sticking under her Babushka's bed. The intrepid girl distracted her Babushka which inane questions, all while grabbing her handy rifle. Her Babushka smiled upon seeing the girl holding the rifle. 'Now now, what do you have that for? Young girls like you shouldn't have rifles that are for big men like me- I mean for big men like soldiers.' Her Babushka said, smiling with those sharp, rotting teeth. The young lady replied 'I was just going to do some target practice. These roads aren't often tread by little girls like me.' Again, her Babushka smiled. 'Come here, little girl, I'll join you. I may be an old lady, but I know more then you might catch on.' The girl pulled up her rifle to her shoulder and pointed it at Dirlewanger. At the same moment, Dirlewanger lunged. Before his claws could reach her, he was shot dead."

 DRL.450.t: "The Final Hunt"
 DRL.450.desc: "While camping with his men, feasting and carousing in only the most debaucherous ways imaginable, as was normal for Oskar Dirlewanger and his men, the infamous bandit leader announced that he would be going on a grand hunt, and claimed that he had spotted a pack of boars when they had ridden to their new camp.\n\nThe hunt began soon after, and Dirlewanger and his men did indeed discover the boars. However, what they did not expect was for their leader to miss his first shot, and to soon after be mauled by one of the creatures. While the boar was killed and Dirlewanger dragged back to camp, it soon became clear that the medical attention he needed was not going to be discovered, and Dirlewanger soon died of his wounds. His purported last words are to be \"SS-Oberführer Oskar Dirlewanger... murdered by a pig... give me something for the pain and let me die.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the warlord's death, seven factions have already emerged in a war over the remaining spoils. The bandits seem to have been broken."

 DRL.451.t: "General Winter"
 DRL.451.desc: "On a night so cold that men froze where they stood, Dirlewanger and his men marched on. They were on the prowl raiding nearby villages for food and whatever fuel they could find. A storm front rolled in, like a dreadful white Cossack host, cutting men down with markedly more mercy than the man they followed. Visibility dropped to a meter, then less. Dirlewanger struggled to keep his men together, but the storm was so strong that it swallowed all hue and cry. Soon enough, the Black Bandit himself had been separated from his men, facing the scourge of Russian Winter that every German has come to dread.\n\nDirlewanger's body was discovered the next morning, after the storm had blown itself out by a ragged group of his surviving men. He was frozen stiff in the fetal position, seemingly deciding to go out of this world in the same manner he came in. His men were thankful for the fresh supplies..."

All of the weapons of the world were spared on the big players; the Nazis, the Japanese, and the Yanks. To many's surprise, however, some did in fact make it to Russia. Whether by accident or pure, pure hateful spite, the Germans seemed to launch several ICBM's directly into western Russia in a final act of defiance against the Russias.\n\nOne of these weapons, however, must have gone off track, as instead of landing on a town or city, it flew straight towards the camp of the bandit lord Oskar Dirlewanger and wiped the entire installation off of the face of the Earth. Now, there is naught but echos."

 DRL.453.desc: "Surprise seems to have sparked across the world when recent footage from Russia began to hit the press. The video shows a Russian man, presumably one of the bandits belonging to Oskar Dirlewanger, experimenting and playing with a video camera he seemed to have discovered on a raid. While filming, the video shows the band's leader, Dirlewanger himself, marching about and giving orders, when suddenly he ignited into flame. Various members of the band attempted to douse the flames, but it seems to have been for naught, and Dirlewanger's band has already fallen to infighting in the wake of his death.\n\nScientists are baffled, to say the least."

 DRL.454.t: "It Was Just a Dog"
 DRL.454.desc: "News from Russia as an unknown wanderer seems to have cut a bloody path across the Urals to put down Dirlewanger and his men. A scant few survivors claim that while on a routine raid, Dirlewanger had found a man with a well preserved car and dog of his own. When the man insulted him, Dirlewanger decided to sneak up on the man, knock him out, murder his dog and then drive off the car with his men.\n\nReportedly, the man was actually a former member of the NKVD and had been known as the 'Butzemann' among German soldiers for his almost mythological ability to kill and destroy. Dozens to hundreds of Dirlewanger's bandits were killed before their leader was cleanly executed with a double tap to the head."

Reportedly, all was normal, when the electricity from the camp's generators began to fizzle out, and, suddenly, a meteor came crashing down to the center of the camp, wiping it from the face of the Earth like a nuclear blast.\n\nSurrounding villages have not confirmed this, and most just think the brigade finally went and gone insane. The only casualty of this supposed great calamity was Dirlewanger, who was found dead in his room with a gunshot wound. Observers are trying to conjure a scientifically acceptable explanation as to why an entire small army would claim that a meteor hit a camp that was still very real. Most are blaming it on mass hysteria, but some say it was a plan cooked up by members of the brigade to kill Dirlewanger and act insane."
 DRL.455.a: "Hopefully a real meteor will destroy them."
 DRL.456.t: "Proving the Prince Wrong"
 DRL.456.desc: "After conquering the Orenburg commune, Oskar Dirlewanger and his brigade attempted to impose something resembling civilized rule by creating a new police force. Of course, this was nothing more than a roving band of drunk and well-armed brigands who would search houses, seize anything of value, and declare it a tax for the new administration.\n\nIn a rare moment of common sense, Dirlewanger realized that keeping this up would lead to a mass revolt of the surviving townsfolk, one that not even the entire Brigade could resist. So, he ordered a grisly execution for his police chief, an especially cruel Cossack named Ruslan Orlov, and had the mutilated body dumped on the street in front of the city hall. It seems that Dirlewanger was attempting to steal a page from Machiavelli's playbook, where a prince appointed a cruel magistrate to pacify a city; after the city was bloodily brought to heel, the prince executed the magistrate and left the townspeople \"satisfied and stupefied.\"\n\nOf course, Dirlewanger greatly overestimated the amount of goodwill that Orlov's execution would bring him, as he found out the hard way when he visited Orenburg once more. Expecting a pleasant crowd, he was instead greeted with a raging mob calling for his head, and his convoy was quickly overwhelmed. The guards, afraid they would meet Orlov's fate for using force against the crowd, stood back as the mob engulfed Dirlewanger and beat him to death."

 DRL.457.t: "Treasonous Bastards"
 DRL.457.desc: "For whatever reason-laziness, incompetence, pressure from others, or simple madness-Dirlewanger had begun delegating more and more influence in the day-to-day management of the brigade to his lieutenants over the past several months. But since those who want to wield power are rarely the kind who deserve it, they quickly began fighting among one another over who would eventually dethrone Dirlewanger and become the new bandit king of the Urals. And today, it seems that one of them made his move.\n\nIn a meeting with his high command, Dirlewanger confidentially told them that he was considering none of them to be his successor. Rather, he would disband the brigade entirely when he felt he was old and wealthy enough to safely retire. Clearly, this did not sit well with his subordinates, as one of them proceeded to pull out a knife and stab Dirlewanger in the stomach. As they watched their former commander gasp his final breaths on the blood-soaked floor of the command tent, they all agreed that the truth would have to be concealed from the enlisted men. A hasty cover story, one suggesting that a Lysenkoite scientist sneaked in and poisoned his brandy, was concocted and issued to the men.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the lieutenants did not have a change in heart, and the backstabbing and intrigue resumed before Dirlewanger's body was even cold. What parts of the Brigade that haven't defected outright are too preoccupied fighting each other rather than to continue raiding any wealth from the surrounding towns. It seems that the storm cloud looming over the Urals is finally starting to dissipate."

Though the partisan group themselves were long gone once the Brigade proper arrived the men were able to unleash their grief upon the nearest village, which surely must have been aiding the partisans.\n\nWhile the village burned the body of Oskar Dirlewanger was found, and it truly dawned on them that both the leash and the whip was dead. Without Dirlewanger at the helm, the Brigade has splintered into infighting and desertion.

One man claimed the old man blew his own brains out after being cornered by peasants in a raid. Another said he disappeared while traveling through a mountain pass. A slave said that he died after eating rotten venison. A nearby villager swears that something fell from the sky and obliterated the whole camp, while another says that the bandits were all wiped out by plague. One of his soldiers even claimed that he had frozen to death and been eaten by starving bandits, explaining the lack of a corpse. Despite all this, not a one of the claims has been able to be verified. All that is known is that the monster is gone, but everyone is still asking one question:\n\nWho killed Oskar Dirlewanger?"

 DRL.460.desc: "The International community is coming to the realization that Oskar Dirlewanger, leader of his widely feared bandit brigade, is dead. Reports claim that Dirlewanger left his camp several days ago, hearing of a particularly enticing stash of munitions stored in a mountain complex just Northeast of his territory. He brought with him a small contingent of his most loyal men, and a light pack of rudimentary camping gear. Unbeknownst to Oskar's brigade, as the small convoy vanished into the Siberian wilderness, it would be the last time that their leader would be seen alive. Almost a month later, they had not returned to camp. With infighting threatening to tear the group apart, a reconnaissance group was begrudgingly dispatched to retrieve information on the Bandit King's status. After a week of harsh travel, the recon mission came across a befuddling sight in an area known by natives as 'Dead Mountain'.\n\nWhat had appeared to be the remnants of the band's camp was buried halfway in snow. The large tent had a sizable hole on one of its walls, seemingly cut open with a knife. As the group followed a trail of light footprints down the hill to the edge of a nearby forest, they saw the corpses of two men, huddled around a nearby fire. Their bodies were coated in ice and nearly as pale as the snow they lied on. As they continued into the woods, they found a dark object sticking out of a nearby snowbank. It was the arm of Dirlewanger's malformed corpse, almost completely covered by rocks and ice. Before the group could even return the news to the remnants of the brigade, the brigade had split into rivaling cliques, many of which declared it 'disbanded'."

Others believe that the Black Bandit died of natural causes, brought on by his advanced age and harsh conditions of the Russian weather, or perhaps illness. Still more deranged members believe that Dirlewanger is still alive, having simply escaped Russia and left a body double behind, much to the confusion of other members of the Brigade.\n\nHowever, whatever the cause of Dirlewanger's death, his Brigade has fractured, with its members separating and fleeing to parts unknown. And while the Black Bandit is dead, countless deaths will never be avenged, and he will never face the justice that he deserves."

However, instead of keeping the hated marauder alive, the doctor used this as an opportunity to make Dirlewanger pay for all the misery he brought upon his family and the whole of Russia. Rather than giving him a proper medical treatment, the doctor injected Dirlewanger with what he called 'Sodium Tri-Ethalene', the doses of which were enough to kill a human being. By the time Dirlewanger noticed, he had less than ten seconds to live. The dark irony of a bandit putting his life in the hands of a person whom he once threatened to murder was not lost on the venerable physician."
 DRL.462.a: "Can't say that this was a violation of the Hippocratic oath."
 DRL.463.t: "A Petty Dispute"
 DRL.463.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger and his most loyal followers strolled casually through the blazing flames of yet another village they had razed. Screams and cries for help could still be heard as the rest of the brigade went wild upon these folk cursed with the poor luck to be in the sights of the bandits. Dirlewanger's inner circle surrounded their leader, laughing as they executed maimed men and women they passed by. Dirlewanger himself had an expression colder than the Russian winter.\n\nAs they wandered, Dirlewanger noticed a dazzling gold necklace that had somehow been missed on one of the corpses. He knelt down to grab it, but it was snatched from him before his very eyes by one of his brigands, a scarred Russian boy who couldn't have been older than twenty. The man's face, hardly more mature than a child's, was lit by the flames, while Dirlewanger's ancient features were cloaked by the night.\n\nDirlewanger spoke with an icy tone that could freeze over the Atlantic. \"Hand it over, boy.\"\n\nThe Russian bandit, due to the darkness, did not recognize his own leader. \"Fuck off, old man.\"\n\nNo longer willing to deal with this, Dirlewanger reached for his pistol. He would take the trinket himself. Before he could even draw, however, he felt his face erupt in anguish as the Russian boy rammed Oskar's skull with the butt of his gun. Dirlewanger fell to the ground. The boy was quickly shot, but it was too late. The Scourge of the Urals was a frail man, and even that one hit was enough to kill him. Perhaps the boy would rest better knowing how many he had avenged."
 DRL.463.a: "He will never know how much he has done."
 DRL.464.t: "Kindred Spirit"
 DRL.464.desc: "It was late at night at the camp of Oskar Dirlewanger's bandit brigade. After a particularly successful raid, many of the men were drunkenly dancing and singing around a bonfire. Dirlewanger himself, tired of the festivities, left the group and wandered just a bit into the nearby woods to piss.\n\nHe heard the branches rustling as he pulled up his pants. He drew his gun with the speed of a man who'd done it ten thousand times before and whipped around to deliver a shot, but for one of the first times ever he hesitated. In the darkness he saw a gaunt, skeletal face staring at him, with eyes just as cold as his own.\n\nIn that brief moment, the seemingly mirrored image of the bandit king lept and tackled Dirlewanger to the ground, pinning the elderly German to the jagged rocks and dry pine needles. Now with a better view, Dirlewanger realized that this wasn't a reflection, merely a man with a passing resemblance that had tripped him up. He tried to escape, but it was too late. The gaunt man bashed Dirlewanger's head in, leaving the monster dead. When his corpse was found, Dirlewanger's shoes, coat, and pistol had been taken away. The killer had been nothing more than a scavenger, not knowing that he was killing the scourge of Russia. For an act as heartless as killing a defenseless old man to steal his possessions, he probably had been just as depraved as the tyrant he'd unwittingly assassinated."
 DRL.464.a: "A fitting killer."
 DRL.465.t: "Into the Darkness"
 DRL.465.desc: "The last moments of Oskar Dirlewanger were moments of thoughtfulness. The man who had caused so much suffering looked out the doorway, seeing a raging snowstorm, hearing the screeching winds. He looked as though he was, for the first time in his entire life, serene. With no warning, he stood up, and without grabbing his coat he opened the door and walked into the blizzard. His men quickly noticed and ran after him, but the snow obscured their view even a few meters in front of them. To pursue their leader would be suicide. They waited for hours, hoping that the bandit king would return, but he never did. He had accepted his own fate and traveled into the darkness, knowing there was no return. For reasons that perhaps nobody would ever truly know, Oskar Dirlewanger had chosen his own destiny, and chosen death.\n\nHis body was never found."
 DRL.465.a: "If any man deserved not to find peace, it was him, yet he found it all the same."
 DRL.466.t: "A Worthy Opponent"
 DRL.466.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger smiled as he saw the chaos all around him. Another raid brilliantly executed by him, and with naught but a few casualties. His most loyal lieutenants were busy satisfying their desires, and he was left alone to breathe in the atmosphere of fear that he had created. It, therefore, angered Dirlewanger greatly when his crafted bliss was interrupted by the sounds of someone behind him. He spun around to find a young man attempting to sneak up on him.\n\n'Fancy yourself the savior of Russia, kid?' Dirlewanger said. The would-be assassin merely looked at him defiantly. Dirlewanger pointed his pistol at the man.\n\n'Wait!' The man said in German, surprisingly enough. Dirlewanger paused. 'I ca- I can tell you why you do all these things!'\n\n'What are you talking about? I know why I pillage and destroy very well,' Dirlewanger replied, amused. 'It's-'\n\nThe man interrupted him with four words, barely audible. Dirlewanger mused over the words in his mind. They were not earth-shattering revelations like it was made them out to be. Dirlewangers's musings were suddenly interupted by a pain in his chest. The bastard had shot him! Dirlewanger's pistol dropped to the ground, followed by Dirlewanger himself. He looked the man in the eyes one last time, struggling to do something, anything to survive. It was all for naught, for the man fired the second bullet, which implanted itself in Dirlewanger's brain.\n\nThe man chuckled after it was clear that Dirlewanger was dead. A simple distraction was all it took. It was ironic, he mused, that one of the most feared people in all of Russia was ended by four simple words."
 DRL.466.a: "You needed worthy opponents."
 DRL.467.t: "A Sudden Stop"
 DRL.467.desc: "In the end, it was not his sins or battle wounds that killed Oskar Dirlewanger, but rather the most innocent thing that's likely to be found in a bandit camp. A mere standard-pattern farmer's stepladder.\n\nWhile surveying some slave laborers putting up a new watchtower in his camp, to replace one that had collapsed due to a stray mortar shell, Dirlewanger absentmindedly climbed all the way to the top of a stepladder in an attempt to climb up to the top of the scaffolding. However, in a twist of fate, the universe deigned that this was not to be.\n\nThe next thing anyone heard was a scream, as Dirlewanger's weight on a section of the ladder never meant to hold a full grown man lead to it tipping over, directly onto a patch of waste material from the construction. As a mighty cloud of dust flew from the debris, and Dirlewanger lay strangely silent, the slave laborers hung back out of fear of the Bandit King, pretending nothing had happened to avoid a potential reprisal for the sin of getting in one of the Germans' way.\n\nEventually, half an hour later, while inspecting the construction, one of Dirlewanger's raiders found his body, skull caved in by an unfortunately-shaped log, and legs still lodged between the rungs of the ladder.\n\nOf course, by this time, the laborers were long gone, and heated arguments between the men that found the body had begun to lay the seeds of the 36th's death."
 DRL.467.a: "It's not the fall that kills you."
 DRL.468.t: "Hotline Orsk"
 DRL.468.desc: "The bandit king is dead. Early in the day, Oskar Dirlewanger reportedly received an odd and strangely innocent message on his personal radio, claiming that there would be a delivery from someone named \"Iakov\". Thinking this was just the usual administrative nonsense that he cared little for, Dirlewanger ignored the message and went on with his day. In the evening, however, he would come to regret not investigating it. A man wearing a snake mask and weilding a submachine gun went on a rampage in the building Dirlewanger was residing in, single handedly killing all the guards and making his way to Dirlewanger's quarters. The masked killer never revealed his face and simply smashed Dirlewanger's head in on the concrete wall before vanishing. When the room was investigated, it was found that the only thing the masked killer had left behind was a very worn postcard from America, depicting a sandy beach and palm trees."
 DRL.468.a: "What a brutal massacre!"
 DRL.469.t: "Joyride"
 DRL.469.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger is dead. After a day of heavy drinking and with the sun bathing the world in afternoon light, the scourge of the Urals reportedly appropriated the largest available vehicle for himself and granted several others to bandits he had been drinking with. Together they embarked on an afternoon road rage rampage, racing through the ruined streets of Orsk, ordering slaves to be let loose in the streets then trying to run them over, and firing guns from their windows as they laughed with glee.\n\nFinally, drunk out of their minds and feeling unstoppable in their machines, Dirlewanger challenged a brigand to a game of chicken. He accepted, and the two revved their engines before charging at each other down a decrepit street. To the surprise of nobody, neither one ever veered away and the vehicles collided head-on, killing both drivers and several onlookers. Realizing the gravity of what had happened, the other drunk bandits took their vehicles and fled far away while the brigade devolved into chaos."
 DRL.469.a: "At least Dirlewanger wasn't a chicken."
 DRL.470.t: "Anticlimactic"
 DRL.470.desc: "The day was one of the hottest on record. This was extremely odd as just the day before there had been a snowstorm, and it was expected to be cold for the coming weeks. However, the snow had already melted, and it seemed as if Hell had finally thawed after being frozen over. Oskar Dirlewanger and his men were practically panting in the heat, struggling to even walk a few feet. They were returning from a raid, but even with some of them having taken all their clothes off it was still too hot.\n\nThe heat was too much for someone as old and frail as the bandit king. After struggling along for a few miles, he collapsed, and soon after he was dead. The inexperienced medic guessed it was heat stroke or something similar. The rest of the small party fell to infighting over water and supplies, and when the news reached the greater brigade that conflict expanded a hundredfold. The unusual heat soon faded, but its consequences remain."
 DRL.470.a: "Divine intervention, perhaps?"
 DRL.471.t: "King of the Mountain"
 DRL.471.desc: "The expedition was one that Dirlewanger and his men had done many times - traveling through an obscure pass in the snow-choked Urals to flank a fat, juicy peasant village clinging to the side of the mountain on an isolated plateau. However, this trip quickly turned out to be one like no other, as winds whipped the raiding party and snow threatened to bury them alive.\n\nFollowing Dirlewanger's calls and a sergeant's lantern from ahead, the men began to turn back for the safety of their camp, and the slightly more stable descent where they had came from.\n\nIt took them until they were halfway down the mountain that they noticed Dirlewanger's calls had ceased, and the lantern was the only thing left guiding them. After an earnest attempt to find their leader, however, there was nothing they could do. Crestfallen, the squabbling band fled back to their camp, losing several more men to falls and tree wells along the way.\n\nIt was not until days after the band had begun to disintegrate that Dirlewanger's corpse was finally found, frozen solid and half-buried under a snow drift. The Ural Guardsman that located him noticed two things, the first of which was the rot that had already set in across his body, turning an ugly, evil man into an even more ugly ruin of mummified flesh. The second was his posture, his arms frozen in front of him, as if he was shielding himself from something assailing his face.\n\nTo the Ural Guard, of course, this was irrelevant. After a quick discussion, the body was simply dumped off the nearest cliff, and left to obscurity forever."
 DRL.471.a: "Perhaps it's better to never know the truth."
 DRL.472.t: "Disputed Reports"
 DRL.472.desc: "The day after Dirlewanger traveled to Magnitogorsk upon the invitation of Trofim Lysenko, the mad scientist who had taken control over the black mountain, he disappeared. For several days his fate has been a mystery, until now. A spokesman of Magnitogorsk has announced that Dirlewanger was returning to his stronghold in Orsk when his truck ran off of the road and fell hundreds of feet down the mountainside, killing everyone inside upon impact. However, rumor indicates that Dirlewanger was not returning from a successful meeting, but trying to escape. It is said that Lysenko's men tried to capture Dirlewanger and his guards alive after the meeting, but they escaped the ambush and were trying to return to their territory when they were discovered and forced off of the road to prevent their return.\n\nWhatever the truth is, the effects of the bandit leader's death are already apparent. The former Dirlewanger brigade is already fracturing as various gangs and cliques attempt to seize control or break away. It seems that the terrors of south russia will not outlive their leader by long."
 DRL.472.a: "Those mountain roads can be so dangerous."
 DRL.473.t: "Lab Rat"
 DRL.473.desc: "When Dirlewanger accepted Lysenko's invitation to Magnitogorsk, he believed that he would be negotiating the terms of an alliance between the two of them against the Ural League. After a lavish banquet to celebrate the alliance in which the food and booze were both plentiful, the bandit king and his men retired to their temporary rooms to sleep off the party. It was then that Lysenko struck. His men stormed the hotel where Dirlewanger and his retinue were staying, taking them by surprise and capturing almost all of them with very little struggle. As he was carried out of the hotel bound by his wrists and ankles Dirlewanger shouted and cursed in German at his captors, at his men, at the shocked bystanders, and at anyone who could hear him. He has been transported to Lysenko's personal laboratory deep within the Black Mountain, where it is rumored that the scientist has already planned several experiments he wants to try on his new favorite test subject.\n\nWhile Dirlewanger may not technically perish for weeks or even months depending on how long he can hold out, he is in all senses already dead, gone from the world. With no chance of rescuing him and no other source of central leadership, his band has already collapsed into infighting and is scattering back into the wastes from which they emerged."
 DRL.473.a: "Lysenko's tests are a fate I would not wish on anyone, except Dirlewanger."
 DRL.474.t: "The Lethal Plunge"
 DRL.474.d: "The trip from the Ural League's well-guarded frontier is a wooded area, filled with old logging roads and bereft of much accessible water. However, what little exists is not to be underestimated.\n\nWhile fleeing from the border following a successful raid on the Ural Guard barracks there, Dirlewanger's truck careened down a road that he had travelled many times before. As he crossed into a familiar clearing, however, he noticed a tree had fallen across the path he usually took. Swearing and veering the steering wheel to one side, the Bandit King took the road less travelled - an area that he had surveyed in case he'd ever needed to use it.\n\nAfter breaking into a clearing with a smooth, snow-covered forest floor, he realized he had not surveyed it thoroughly enough. With an alarming lurch, the ground gave way under his vehicle's wheels, and chunks of ice began breaking up beneath him.\n\nTo his credit, the Black Bandit managed to smash his way free of the truck's cab, and swim upwards towards the light above. But nothing could save him from the shroud of ice that lay above, trapping him in the freezing depths. Clawing at the lake's frozen covering while his truck sank to the bottom behind him, Dirlewanger finally fell, not to battle, but to asphyxiation."
 DRL.474.a: "To Davy Jones' Locker With Ye!"
 DRL.475.t: "Dance Until You Drop"
 DRL.475.desc: "After another day of debauchery and cruelty, Oskar Dirlewanger and his company were gathered around the bonfire, laughing and doing as they usually did. One soldier pulled out an exquisite and rare violin that he had stolen and said that he knew how to play. He started playing a traditional German folk tune, and all the German soldiers laughed and stood up and started to dance. After a while even the Russians and Ukrainians joined in, and to the shock of everyone Dirlewanger himself jumped up and started to move when the tune sped up.\n\nThe group danced for a few minutes, and even Dirlewanger was giggling with glee. He jumped and trotted and waltzed and did whatever dances vaguely came to mind, when suddenly his left foot hit a puddle of oil. He slipped terribly and his skull smacked the ground with a sickening crack not unlike two pool balls hitting each other. The violin immediately stopped and his soldiers gathered around him to see if he was okay. He very clearly was not, and after a bit of poking and prodding it became clear he was dead. The dance quickly turned into a panic as the revelers tried to figure out what to do next."
 DRL.475.a: "His moves weren't bad, but his precision needed work."
 DRL.476.t: "Thorough Documentation"
 DRL.476.desc: "Under the kind \"recommendation\" of Lysenko and his scientists, Dirlewanger's screaming hordes fell upon what had been a village hosting several former Soviet researchers that had refused to come with the mad scientist to the Black Mountain. While personally butchering his way through the peasantry, Dirlewanger came across an undecorated home in a slightly wealthier part of the town. Smashing his way inside with a rifle butt, the first thing he saw was a man with dead, blinded eyes looking his way.\n\nThe blind man reached a hand out to stop him - and the Black Bandit shot him dead without a second thought.\n\nAfter frisking the body for any valuables, and propping the corpse up against a wall, Dirlewanger scoured the rest of the house for things to loot. There was nothing for him except a single small safe embedded in the wall.\n\nShooting the lock bought him easy access to the contents, and like a child opening a gift, he withdrew...papers. The safe contained nothing but old documents inscribed with the markings of the Soviet Union. A stack of photos was clipped to the top, a photo of what seemed to be the blind man standing atop a mountain and waving, with more mountains behind him. The classic scape of the Urals unfolded in the photograph, of exceptional quality.\n\nDirlewanger laughed, and threw it aside, into a pool of blood.\n\nThis was, by the sights of his band, the last thing that he ever did. Oskar Dirlewanger disappeared in the night an hour after the raid ended, leaving no trace but the footprints of a man running for his life."
 DRL.476.a: "It seems some things are not meant to be seen."
 DRL.477.t: "The Pox"
 DRL.477.desc: "Shooting and burning pains in the back and lower limbs; paralysis; sudden loss of balance; finally, psychosis and death. To a trained medical eye, the telltale symptoms of late-stage untreated syphilis - to Oskar Dirlewanger, leader of the infamous horde of bandits bearing his name, the causes of his own demise. A disease that can remain asymptomatic for years, even decades, syphilis, nicknamed \"The Pox\", is a sexually transmitted disease that claimed swathes of victims since its introduction in the Old World from the Americas in the 16th century. Sometimes the symptoms become noticeable mere days after the contagion - other times, the Treponema pallidum which causes it simply hides in the organism, before suddenly manifesting itself and causing the demise of its victim in a matter of days. Dirlewanger fell into the latter case, and since when the symptoms first started, it took only a few days before his men found him dead in a contorted pose, his face turned into a mask of agony."
 DRL.477.a: "A fitting end, it seems."
 DRL.478.t: "The Duel"
 DRL.478.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger was gathering up his usual cut of the bandits' loot at the end of a raid when one of the younger ones asked for a greater share than usual due to his exceptional work in the raid. Dirlewanger looked up and guffawed before saying no. The young bandit, however, wouldn't budge either. He said that he had a challenge for Dirlewanger. They would duel, and whoever won would get the entire cut. Dirlewanger hadn't needlessly murdered anyone for two days and so accepted.\n\nThe two placed their backs against each other and each began to walk ten paces. Dirlewanger, of course, had no intention of being honorable and whipped around on the seventh, his gun out and ready to fire.\n\nUnfortunately for him, his opponent had turned around on the sixth.\n\nA bullet hole appeared right in the center of Dirlewanger's forehead, and the old man fell over, dead. The young bandit couldn't celebrate for long as he was quickly shot too for killing the bandit king, but the damage was done. News of Dirlewanger's death spread quickly, and his brigade is likely not long for this world."
 DRL.478.a: "The only person who can beat a cheater is another cheater."
 DRL.479.t: "A Knock on the Door"
 DRL.479.desc: "Following the Black Mountain NKVD's takedown of their former master, they wasted no time in crushing the Black Bandit as well. The battle-hardened but disorganized bandit brigades could not contest with the well-drilled 22nd Motor Rifle Division, and they quickly fled the field, taking heavy casualties.\n\nDirlewanger, however, had escaped quite handily, fleeing to the south alone as his Brigade collapsed around him. After setting up shop in a house abandoned by its owners, Dirlewanger fell to an exhausted sleep.\n\nIt was to be interrupted, however. At one in the morning, it came. The dreaded knock on the door, followed by four crack NKVD soldiers breaking into his bedroom. Unable to resist in time, they dragged the Black Bandit into one of their trucks, and disarmed him. Then, the accusations began.\n\nTwo thousand seven hundred fifty-eight counts of murder, four hundred ninety counts of rape, heinous actions against the Soviet Union, gross terrorism, serving as an accomplice to the Nazis, political unreliability...\n\nThe 'trial' of Dirlewanger lasted forty minutes, and ended with him, naturally, as guilty on all counts. A rag was stuffed into his mouth to end his pleading, and he was shot through the head by the NKVD squad's commissar. The 22nd Motor Rifle left the area immediately after pouring gasoline on the body and setting it ablaze, leaving only Dirlewanger's corpse, now smoldering into naught but ash, to show that they were ever there at all.."
 DRL.479.a: "Here they come, to take one more..."
 DRL.480.t: "Pride Cometh Before a Fall"
 DRL.480.desc: "On their journey to seek fresh plunder for their troops, a detachment of the Brigades had come across what they described as unimaginable wealth and power on a barren hill three days south of the main camp. They came back with stories so unbelievable they could only be true, of weapons and gold and food in a secret Soviet military cache. So Dirlewanger had picked a handful of his most trusted lieutenants and left the next dawn, visions of gold and lead and fire bursting in the space behind his eyes. It was clear that whatever motivated him wasn't even entirely rational, if indeed his rationality had ever been there.\n\nThe journey had been arduous even on his veterans; a creeping fever or a madness had claimed most of the team, many slipping into the night screaming of \"accursed visions\", demoniac appearances. But Dirlewanger only saw power shining in the day and night skies, a new drug pulsing in his decaying bloodstream. It didn't matter how long he took - and now he thought about it, hadn't it been forty days since he'd set out? No matter. He would find it. He would.\n\nThe hill came to him as in a vision; weak with hunger and thirst, he fell alone on that barren hillside and screamed out the primal noises of victory. His team had all fallen away, but he was here - he was here! Everything was impossibly bright. Contours shifted. A blurred figure, leading him on to the edge of a cliff. He saw his petty kingdom, forged at gunpoint and held together by terror and pain. Sounds like words, faint but unmistakable. 'You bought the world and broke your soul, Oskar. Chaos and blood spill from your mouth. Now your destiny is destruction, your belly is your god, and your glory shall become your shame. Die, Oskar, and find no peace.' Then he fell, forever."
 DRL.480.a: "Death in this life - justice in the next."
 DRL.481.t: "A Lack of Faith"
 DRL.481.desc: "Despite the Brigade's best efforts, they were unable to stop the Ural Guard's well-trained forces from marching closer and closer to Orsk. As they were on the outskirts of the brigade's camp, Dirlewanger made the decision to evacuate with a couple dozen of his closest men and hide out in the Ural foothills, leaving the majority of their loot behind.\n\nDespite their increasingly dire circumstances, having to constantly flee from the ever-approaching Ural Guard, and sparse supplies, Dirlewanger told his men to keep faith and stay loyal. He had a plan, he promised, to recover their ill-gotten earnings, enact their revenge on the Ural Guard, and flee west to salvation in Moskowien. However, this plan was constantly shifting and nebulous; one day it involved sparking a civil war in Magnitogorsk, raiding gold supplies in Orenburg the next, and breaking comrades out of Ural Guard prisons the day after. To his rapidly dwindling number of followers, it seemed that Dirlewanger was becoming delusional, or simply saying whatever his men wanted to hear in order to stay alive.\n\nUnsurprisingly, they eventually had enough. One of his men chose to rat him out, leaking the location of his latest hideout to a Ural Guard scout. As the Guards approached, the men scattered into the night, leaving Dirlewanger to fend for himself. However, the Black Bandit was found dead at the bottom of a ravine, seemingly having committed suicide to avoid capture."
 DRL.481.a: "His time has passed."
 DRL.482.t: "The Grassy Knoll"
 DRL.482.desc: "On parade to celebrate another successful purging of a village and the destruction of those who would oppose his rule, Dirlewanger was figuratively and literally high. The adrenaline and bizarre concoction of methamphetamines, barbiturates and random tribal creations in his bloodstream would have sent most doctors into cardiac arrest, except perhaps for the one who had treated Adolf Hitler himself. He swayed back and forth on the back of a half-scavenged Kettenkrad, out of his mind with bliss, and his men prowled the streets of the town, howling with laughter and drunkenness. They slipped into homes, in the pairs and quadruples, and soon the homes were alive with terrible noise, or silent.\n\nIn the second story of the building once known as a library, a hundred yards off, the sniper cleaned his rifle with a methodical ease. His name would be lost to time, but his deeds would not. He scrubbed the scope one last time, hefted the rifle onto the window-ledge, and aimed. NKVD agents 547b and 547a took their pistols to hand and began walking towards the main street. Their purpose had been made clear in the briefings. Failure was to be followed by termination. There would be only one window of opportunity for the action to be carried out. They reached the square, saw the figure dancing on the Kettenkrad, aimed. A lone gunman who had drifted down the swirl of dust and blood that was Western Russia had also turned up; radicalized by communism, he would be the one the Brigade punished with terrible fury in the final hours before it fell apart. He reached the horrified, staring crowds, pulled out a ludicrously long-barreled pistol, fired from the hip.\n\nThe bullets reached Oskar Dirlewanger and his team in 4.53 seconds, puncturing them in 15 separate places at different angles and rebounding. Oskar was killed instantly. Witnesses reported seeing the largest contiguous chunk of his head fall back, and to the left, before slapping on the pavement like so much rotten meat."

 DRL.483.t: "Terminal Lumbago"
 DRL.483.desc: "It started with a small complaint about soreness in his lower back to the camp doctor. It was brushed off however, as being a result of a rough night's sleep, and could be avoided by sleeping face-up the following night. But the next morning, however, the problem did not go away, despite following the doctor's advice. However, it was not a debilitating issue, and it could not impede him from continuing to lead his men. But as time passed, Oskar Dirlewanger's situation continued to worsen. His back pain increased, going from a mild ache to a sharp, stabbing pain every time he walked or bent over. Formerly simple tasks, like riding a horse or firing a rifle, became unbearable tortures. Every time he tried, he felt a pain that he compared to someone holding his back over a bonfire.\n\nDirlewanger soon found himself bedridden, unable to even sit upright without subjecting himself to excruciating pain. He tried his best to continue running the Brigade, despite his camp doctors encouraging him to rest and avoid exerting himself too hard. Frankly, that was the only advice they could give, since they had no clue what could be causing this mysterious illness-was it a herniated disk? A pinched nerve? Some form of polio? They had no idea.\n\nFinally, Oskar Dirlewanger died one morning in his bed, howling with pain. Alcohol and morphine only provided brief respites from the suffering, and not even they could dull the pain he faced at the very end. When his cries finally stopped and he fell limp, the men of the Brigade silently felt relief that their overlord's suffering was over. But as the body grew cold, everyone realized something: Dirlewanger, delirious with pain, had never appointed a successor. Unsurprisingly, arguments about the Brigade's leadership soon escalated into firefights, and the camp fell into chaos that very day."
 DRL.483.a: "What a slow and painful death."
 DRL.484.t: "Barbarossa's Last Swim"
 DRL.484.desc: "In one of his numerous raids in Southern Russia, Dirlewanger heard a tale about a village church that contains priceless icons that the local residents consider to be sacred, but everyone who attempts to steal it from the villagers died a horrible death. Inspired to take another satanic feat of his name, Dirlewanger placed a bet to his fellow bandits to steal these famed artifacts and burn down the whole village, putting an end to this silly and childish legend. As the village was closely protected by a humongous mountainous barrier, Dirlewanger realized that the easiest route to it was lying across the river and assembled a few boats for his last adventure. In his hubris, however, Dirlewanger greatly overestimated the capabilities of his boat he was sitting on. After crossing half the river, his boat couldn't handle the pressure of a sitting crowd and thick bags with equipment. Crackling under such unbearable weight, the boat eventually broke down into tiny pieces, leaving Dirlewanger and his closest men to drown in the frozen river. As Dirlewanger quickly died from a heart attack after the shock from the cold water, his men on other boats could only watch the humiliating death of their leader, while planning to take his place as soon as they reach the shores.\n\nWith the Bandit King's death, the village population can now sleep calmly without fear to be attacked by the marauders, as Dirlewanger's men turned on each other as soon as they reached the land, leaving themselves incapable to launch a raid without their heads being raised on pitchforks by furious villagers, a fate which followed those unfortunate souls who didn't try to escape with captured loot of their former combatants."

 DRL.485.t: "Rodina Awakens"
 DRL.485.desc: "Deep down, Dirlewanger suspected that this would happen. You can only raid and pillage so many villages before the civilians start to think that fighting back is an option. They had dealt with resistance before, of course; that was to be expected. But organized fighting had been considered impossible on the part of the feeble Slavic peasant; and yet a group of them stood before Dirlewanger's personal detachment, demanding he leaves.\n\nOskar leaned out of the window of the truck and began shouting at them. \"Get the hell out of my way!\" He boomed. \"Do you want to end up like everyone else who crossed me?!\" The villagers looked at each other, smirking before an older man with a funny hat pulled a pistol out from his pants. He opened fire upon the vehicle, riddling the driver with bullets, and the peasants stormed the vehicle, killing the others in brutal close-quarters combat and dragging Dirlewanger out of the truck.\n\nThey threw him kicking and screaming into the middle of a circle formed by the villagers. He stood up, and looked around him, to see the angriest looking people he had ever seen. They stared him down, clutching their weapons, and he slowly assessed his situation. Dirlewanger gulped and closed his eyes. \"Make it quick\", he muttered, and they obliged."
 DRL.485.a: "Like any king, the Bandit King did not love his subjects. And they didn't love him back."
 DRL.486.t: "The Red Feast"
 DRL.486.desc: "After the defeat of the Ural League, the Dirlewanger Brigade pillaged triumphantly through the newly conquered territories, slaughtering and butchering as many civilians they pleased. Once the pillaging stopped, Oskar Dirlewanger and some of his officers went to the victory feast with Lysenko. Thousands of women also accompanied both Lysenko and Dirlewanger's men as the party appeared at the capitol building in Magnitogorsk. The party was both rambunctious and chaotic as thousands upon thousands of bottles of vodka were showered upon the Brigade. Oskar himself was of course delighted with the voluminous amounts of alcohol, and soon: his already terrible alcoholic rampage intensified as he spoke proudly of his brigade and started to ramble nonsense. These ramblings were a diverse mix of wishes, ranging from wanting to ravish every woman in Russia, to acquiring every single bottle of vodka his brigade could ever have. His drinking was coupled with his gorging on fresh chicken and bread that was perfectly created by Lysenko's chefs. He stuffed himself so much in his drunken glee, that he inevitably started choking. Before long, his men also started choking, and then followed by Dirlewanger himself who was also unable to breathe. He then looked up in pure agony and rage and saw a smiling Lysenko at the end of the dinner table, revealing a small vial of arsenic from his pocket. Before the clock struck midnight, every single officer in the Brigade was dead, killed by their own gluttony and wanton desires to pleasure themselves."
 DRL.486.a: "Don't bite more than you can chew."
 DRL.487.t: "Overthrown!"
 DRL.487.desc: "Shocking news today as Dirlewanger has been killed by his own men. After failing to pay them in loot and stolen goods, the various bandits, mercenaries, and former SS men under him apparently overthrew their leader and imprisoned him before finally having him hanged outside of their old camp.\n\nThe band is in chaos now, and many splinter groups of the Dirlewanger Brigade have already formed to terrorize the wastes. Still, with Dirlewanger dead, the group's power has diminished greatly, and the remaining groups already appear to be collapsing or retreating deeper into Russia."
 DRL.487.a: "The enemy within."
 DRL.2000.t: "The Brigade Breaks the Mountain"
 DRL.2000.desc: "Today, Black Mountain is no more. The endless halls and laboratories have ransacked and picked clean by Dirlewanger's men. A few of the more inventive are already synthesizing new drugs from the stored laboratory chemicals. The broken and shackled men, women, and children within the experimental facilities have mostly been released from their cells by Dirlewanger's order, though this was only so they could be dealt with in typical Brigade fashion.\n\nSeveral of Lysenko's top scientists were able to flee the carnage, but Lysenko himself stayed to the last, dying in his office after a quick firefight. The dead mad scientist was dragged outside to the cheers of brigadiers and shocked silence of the captured researchers who had not yet been executed. The corpse was decapitated, and Lysenko's oh-so-intelligent head stuck on a pike. As for Lysenko's body, Dirlewanger himself was reported to have said, \"leave it on the ground. It will be his last contribution to agriculture.\"\n\nWith Black Mountain in ruins, and the Brigade likely to soon pillage the area surrounding Magnitogorsk, the balance of power in the Urals has irrevocably changed. Time will tell if Dirlewanger's brigade will keep what they have taken here, but for now one thing is certain: the Urals no longer tremble at the thought of Lysenko. They have a much greater threat now."
 DRL.2000.a: "Brains are no match for brawn, it seems..."
 DRL.2001.t: "The Brigade Crushes the League"
 DRL.2001.desc: "With the fall of the last fortress-gulag, Oskar Dirlewanger has declared victory over the Ural League. Hundreds of Ural soldiers have been executed by Dirlewanger's gang, and villages once thought to be safe have been looted by the swelling group of bandits.\n\nTo to surprise of many, Dirlewanger made a speech in front of nearly the entire brigade of bandits, speaking of victory and spoils of war, which led to a happy outbreak of gunshots and cheering. All is not as peachy as Dirlewanger stated it to be, as while the vast majority of the Ural League's forces are now dead, there are still some who have fled to the wilderness and have reportedly vowed to continue fighting.\n\nThe brigade has become even more violent with the fall of their greatest enemy, and it seems that the Southern Urals have entered a new age of destruction and chaos..."
 DRL.2001.a: "Victory!"
 DRL.2002.t: "Victory Against the Commune"
 DRL.2002.desc: "The city of Orenburg was once a shining, if inefficient, beacon of progress in the Ural wastelands. Its people were courteous and hard-working, and its leaders were sectarian but well-intentioned. All of that is gone now; Dirlewanger's forces have burnt the city to the stones. Its riches have been carted away by the soldiers, its people slaughtered by bloodthirsty bandits, and its leaders imprisoned, tortured, and executed. The Bandit King sits on a throne of the dead.\n\nThis all wasn't particularly difficult, of course. The militias of Orenburg were just that; militias, with no training, no standard equipment, and no competent leadership. Dirlewanger's army is bloodthirsty and barbaric, but no one can deny its skill in combat. The SS soldiers had no trouble gunning down the poor men fighting desperately to protect their homes and families, and any casualties they did inflict on the brigadiers were rare occurrences. For those who fled Orenburg, there was little quarter to be found.\n\nTonight, the men of Dirlewanger's Brigade dine and eat well, for they have well earned it. It will be interesting to see how long this good feeling lasts; whether more victories feed the mood, or defeat at the hands of capable enemies causes rifts within the bandit's camp."
 DRL.2002.a: "Orenburg, we hardly knew ye."
 DRL.2003.t: "A Final Purge"
 DRL.2003.desc: "There was a dream.\n\nA dream of Russia.\n\nA united, strong, socialist, soviet Russia. It was almost ironic that the Black Bandit's Waffen-SS brigade finished off the last remnants of the NKVD, one secret police organization putting the other out of its misery. Despite their best efforts, the last bastion of the Soviet Union died like rabid dogs. Oskar and his Brigade executed the last survivors of their raid as the sun rose over the frozen wasteland that used to be their headquarters.\n\nToday, that dream died in a bonfire that reeked of death and cheap nylon uniforms.\n\nMagnitorks burns, and with it, the last hope that anyone in the Ural region can stop the Black Bandit and his trail of death."
 DRL.2003.a: "The black spot grows blacker."
 DRL.2500.t: "A Cornered Dog"
 DRL.2500.desc: "Lysenko's Black Mountain, the fortress of the Southern Urals, has fallen to the closet communists, the Ural League. Their organization, little more then raider groups dreaming of something greater, seized the fortress and have declared Magnitogorsk liberated. Lysenko was once one of the most powerful leaders of the region. He set out on daring raids into every neighboring state and claimed themselves as the true successor of the Soviet science program. But the Ural League has defeated them, and they have raised their dirtied flags above the former dictatorial state and shown the inhabitants the might of their soldiers. Of course, this liberation is a lie, little more then a facade used as a fabrication for a power grab, but there is little we can do.\n\nAs the Ural League grows in power and Mendriks grows more greedy, we must turn our nation into a fortress. A fortress to resist all attacks. A fortress to retain the freedom of our men and the captivity of our slaves. We are the last entity in the Urals to defend against these rats; we will not give up as easily as Lysenko's band of technocrats!"
 DRL.2500.a: "No surrender!"
 DRL.666.t: "The Black Bandit on Black Mountain"
 DRL.666.d: "Twenty years ago, not even madmen would have told us that Oskar Dirlewanger and Trofim Denisovich Lysenko would ever meet as allies. Yet today history has been written which will surely shape the future of the Russian landscape. Today at exactly 08:00 AM the Black Bandit arrived with thirty of his best men at Lysenko's compound upon Black Mountain, bringing with them twenty of the choicest prisoners taken in our most recent raids, including a famous Soviet singer, as gifts for the mad scientist.\n\nThe meeting was far from typical meetings held between leaders, lavish dinners exchanged for much more practical uses of time. Upon Dirlewanger's arrival, he joined Lysenko to inspect the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD, followed by a tour of Black Mountain's defensible positions. More excitingly, this was followed by a tour of several of Lysenko's laboratories and demonstrations of technology and techniques. One experiment demonstrated upon a young Polish woman brought particular delight from the Black Bandit.\n\nFinally, the day was concluded with a three-hour meeting between Dirlewanger, Lysenko and their respective translators. The two men appear to have taken a quick liking to each other, and the agreements between our forces and these boffins to finally destroy the Ural League has progressed significantly. For simply handing over the population we seize after our inevitable victory, we shall gain our pick of the countless technological marvels Black Mountain has hidden within for so long."
 DRL.666.a: "The Montagues and Capulets unite at last."
 DRL.1000.t: "2주 후"
 DRL.1000.d: "The camp was more silent than it had been in years. The murmurs and pleas of the slaves were no more, for the slaves had all run away or been killed. The hum of engines was absent, for the trucks or their fuel had been stolen. The horses did not whinny, for the horses had been butchered for meat. And the men did not speak, for the men were perhaps less than a quarter of their original number, and those that remained no longer trusted one another.\n\nNo longer was there a great bonfire in the center. There were only tiny campfires made of twigs and rubber scattered around, the small groups that still maintained some kind of criminal camaraderie huddling together, suspicious of every other group. Fritz Schmedes himself watched the scene from his window and sighed. They had to regroup soon.\n\nHe decided it was time for a brigade-wide meeting. He walked down the stairs and through the doorway, but as soon as he emerged a gunshot cracked and a bullet whipped by his head. He instantly retreated, but he soon realized he wasn't the only target. The gunshot had triggered a chain reaction of panic, and soon the camp was in an open firefight with every man seemingly for himself. Why they were fighting or what they were fighting for no longer mattered. All that mattered was survival, for petty scraps of food and ammunition. The pathetic remnant of the brigade had finally collapsed, torn apart by its own instability."
 DRL.1000.a: "Take cover!"
