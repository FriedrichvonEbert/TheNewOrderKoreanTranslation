 ## c) Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_JOHN_MACCORMICK_DESC:0 "Some men throughout history are considered great through their blood. Others are considered such for great victories of blood and tears. John MacCormick is all the more astounding for needing neither to achieve his goal in life. Born in 1901 to a captain and a nurse, there was little to mark MacCormick as a man to be watched in his early years. Though from an early age associated with Scottish nationalists, MacCormick and the SNP he helped found were more moderate, but the constant failures of the English leadership causing the deaths of countless young Scotsmen swiftly changed that view over the course of the 2nd war with Germany. War caused his party to go from strength to strength, increasingly drawing even more moderate Tories and Labour party members to the SNP simply to be free of Britain's accursed battles. But for all that MacCormick remained loyal to the United Kingdom almost until the end.\n\nAt the same time as the official surrender was sounded, MacCormick began approaching the ragged remnants of the 51st Highlanders when they regrouped in Edinburgh under Douglas Wimberley. It was an act of convenience and desperation, but with Wimberley at his side MacCormick marched into a hastily convened parliament in Edinburgh castle, made up of those few southerners who refused to accept the surrender but more importantly the majority of politicians from Scotland proper. Scotland could, 'either surrender to German tyranny for a thousand years chained to England, or keep the flame of liberty alive if separate and independent.' Perhaps it was his oratorical skills or perhaps it was the presence of an obvious military man like Wimberley at his side, but MacCormick organized Scotland's declaration of independence within just 24 hours of his speech at Edinburgh. A military was founded, a constitution written and the Germans were informed that as Scotland was no longer a part of the United Kingdom it would not be occupied as per the peace treaty.\n\nScotland's road since independence has been a rocky one, with MacCormick treading the fine line between appeasing the Germans and keeping what remnant of freedom he can find alive. Wimberley has grown somewhat distant from MacCormick over the years, some say because the man views even business with the hated conqueror as being a step too far. Yet Scotland under MacCormick has seen something of a renaissance as well, with a constant trickle of English refugees, be they political or economic, seeking relief from southern oppression. Yet after nearly twenty years at the reigns MacCormick is beginning to tire, and some wonder if perhaps, it is time for another to take the reigns of the land of the free."

 POLITICS_DOUGLAS_WIMBERLEY_DESC:0 "Born in 1896 Douglas Wimberley was present for the rise and fall of the United Kingdom. From it's height in 1921 to it's fall and dissolution in 1945, as a commander in the ill-fated British Army he watched as the pieces started to fall around him. Recalled from Africa for the defence of the homeland he would fight valiantly to defend the UK and then the newly established Republic of Scotland. Although failing in defending the UK from collapse he would be instrumental in defending the fledgling Scottish Republic from defeat at the German hands and this leadership earned him the position of Field Marshal of the Scottish Armed Forces. From this post he watched with weary eyes at the new Einheitspakt and the collaborationist England to the South, ever watchful for the oncoming invasion. He pledged to ensure that never again would his homeland fall to the boots of German soldiers and treads of their tanks. This pledge would shape the man that Wimberley would become and in turn shape the Scottish Armed Forces, making it become a haven of anti-German and anti-Pakt paranoia which would grip it to it's core. With the traitorous government removed Wimberley has now saved Scotland from stagnation and defeat and is at the precipice of greatness. However he is old and he must retire soon, his successor will inherit a difficult position as the Scottish people grow in their opposition to the new post-coup government."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BOSWELL_DESC:0 "Born in 1928 Alexander Boswell was present to the Second World War and the collapse of the United Kingdom, as a young nationalistic Scot he fought to defend his fledgling republic from the jackboots and tank treads of the Germans. After the ensuing peace he rapidly rose through the ranks to become a high ranking officer in the Scottish Army becoming what some would call a protege to ageing the Field Marshal, Douglas Wimberley. Enthusiastically against any form of rapprochement with the German Reich and it's Pakt puppets he would become a staunch supporter of the Field Marshal's extreme stance on Germany and many saw him as Wimberley's expected successor in a couple of years. The coup changed little and only cemented Boswell's position as the expected and almost guaranteed successor to the new Wimberley led government. With the beloved Douglas Wimberley dead Alexander Boswell has assumed the office of Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff and now has complete control over Scotland. He must navigate the difficult path of continuing the military dictatorship while keeping the people happy, ever watchful of any German attempt to interfere in the beloved Republic of Scotland."

 POLITICS_PRISCILLA_BUCHAN_DESC:0 "It would be nigh impossible to find a woman more dedicated to the ideal of Great Britain on the isles than the leader of the Unionist Party, The Rt Hon. Lady Tweedsmuir Priscilla Jean Fortescue Buchan, a woman who has won an extremely unexpected success against incredible odds.\n\nBorn to a Brigadier, Mrs. Buchan, or at the time Priscilla Thomson, always had a silver spoon in her mouth. Studying in England, Germany and France Pre-War, she eventually settled down with Major Sir Alan Lindsay Grant, and had two daughters in 1934. In 1939, like many families, her husband went back to war, and she went to war as any good englishwoman did, working on the production lines. In 1944, she received news. Her husband had died on the German front to a bullet wound, leaving her a widow and her daughters fatherless. She waited from that day for the Germans to be eliminated from the isle, but that day never came, as MacCormick declared the Republic of Scotland.\n\nAfter the war, things happened fast. Motivated by her love of the UK, she entered politics immediately, skyrocketing through the ranks of the Unionist Party due to her sharp oratory skills, gaining prestige throughout as the main representative of English Exiles. She remarried to the exile John Buchan Jr., son of the former governor-general of Canada and veteran of the war in 1946, adopting the name Priscilla Buchan.\n\nHowever, in the 60's, something strange began to happen to the Unionist Party. An influx of certain members, of military men from England began to enter the party, gaining considerable influence through threats and violence, slowly growing roots. Buchan has issues with these men, of course, but now she has power. She cannot tell the people of Scotland of their fate, but she hopes that they can be part of a greater people. A British people."

 POLITICS_ROBERT_MCINTYRE_DESC:0 "Men of vision are often ignored, but their vision is sometimes rewarded. Such was the case with Robert McIntyre.\n\nA medical student at Edinburgh University, Robert was initially attracted to the Labour Party, and became a member in 1936. However, he increasingly became disillusioned with the organization, which culminated in him leaving it in favor of the Scottish National Party in 1940. Quickly, he rose through the ranks of the movement, becoming membership secretary and then National Secretary. In the meantime, he continued his work as a general practitioner in the field of public health in several hospitals around Britain, before being elected as the first SNP member of parliament in a by-election during the war.\n\nAfter the Scottish Constitutional Convention declared Scotland's independence from the UK, it was time for the ones with the vision of an independent Scotland to be rewarded. As the highest profile politician in the party, and one who had oftentimes butted heads with the more moderate John MacCormick over Scottish independence, McIntyre was the obvious choice for the role of Prime Minister of Scotland, and the one to officially head Scotland through the tumultuous early years of independence, a job which he has done fairly successfully.\n\nDespite all that ails the young nation from within and without, Robert McIntyre's unwavering commitment to a free and independent Scotland, unshaken since his early days as a student, will always be there. And that may just be enough to guide it through these times."
 
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_WOLFE_DESC:0 "People often say they have determination, but when it comes down to the line they don't. William Wolfe is not one of those people.\n\nBorn in 1924, William has certainly seen the world change. After being educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, the world looked full of possibilities for the young man. The war then broke out and he joined the Scottish Horse unit of the Royal Artillery. As the very war he had fought in had been brought home, he strived for one thing. Scottish Independence.\n\nOnce Scotland was independent he joined the very party that had made Scotland independent, the SNP. However, unlike some of the members, he had views that would not mesh with the greater ideals of the SNP such as his stance on union rights. Protests had started with disenfranchised workers who had started to want more rights. Wolfe and some others supported the unions, the main body of the SNP did not. He left looking for a party that he could support with his ideals, and then he found the Independent Labour Party.\n\nWhen William Wolfe found the ILP, it was a shell of the old Labour Party in Britain. It was only remnants and seemed to be getting smaller by the day. With determination and grit, he had gone to work on making the ILP a legitimate contender for the Scottish elections. He succeeded in doing this and now the ILP is seen as a contender in the Republic of Scotland. However, the ILP wants to steer Scotland away from the influence of other nations and factions such as the OFN. William Wolfe will do anything to keep Scotland independent."

 POLITICS_PADDY_MAYNE_DESC:0 "Robert Blair Mayne, called Paddy by virtually anyone that knows of him, currently has only one priority in life in his role as a member of the Scottish branch of the SAS: defeating the collaborationist traitors in England. When he saw how the traitors cravenly surrendered Britain to the German jackboot rather than fight to the end as they were called, he vowed to see them toppled one day. Until that opportune day came, Mayne and his comrades waited and watched for an opportune time.\n\nThat opportune time came when their more weak-minded fellow loyalists in the Unionist Party took power in Scotland. Sensing an opportunity, the SAS seized the wheel of government to help Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance in their struggle against the collaborationist menace, and chose Mayne to serve as the leader of this new interim military government as it began actively militating against the Pakt presence in Scotland.\n\nBut not all is well. There are whispers of disunion. The Old Guard want the military to maintain strong governance and actively fight against the socialists and other groups that threaten Britain. On the other hand, democrats want to end the interim government and organize free and fair elections. Who among them will win out is far from certain, and may depend on Mayne's decisions.\n\nPaddy Mayne, on the other hand, will be satisfied if Britain from Scapa Flow to Southampton is free of German and Royal Party oppressors and empowered to make her own way in the world once more. Then he will most willingly return to his hometown to drink, make merry, and schmooze with his fellow Masons as he once did."

Many of these individuals want Scotland to return to the United Kingdom one way or the other, be it by swearing itself to the Royal Party or to the HMMLR faction. Making matters yet more difficult, many of them are poor; this of course can lead very easily to radicalization if not contained. If Scotland is to avoid destabilization, or worse yet a coup by those who consider themselves British rather than Scottish, it must find a way to deal with these Englishmen and loyalists.§!"

 SCO_Itchy_Trigger_desc:0 "The British heritage of the Armed Forces of Scotland is readily apparent at first glance. Tormented by the memories of defeat at the hands of the Hun, the Armed Forces are paranoid and fearful of a German invasion. This attitude, encouraged and abetted by Field Marshal Douglas Wimberley, while useful for the defence of the nation, sometimes results in... greatly regrettable incidents. While some might claim that the Armed Forces are in dire need of reform, there is no doubt in the mind of any patriot that the Armed Forces are ready and able to defend Scotland at a moment's notice.\n\nWhile Scotland's independence may have been born in the fires of a German invasion, the Armed Forces will ensure that the freedom of Scotland will never be destroyed by another."

Many of them turned in suspected Socialists to the state for questioning and then imprisonment and have been awarded ration tickets. The Junta has decided that this is the perfect moment to announce elections, for local councillors and Scottish Parliament. This will be seen as a reduction of our rule but this is only to gain the hearts and minds of the Scottish people, of course the elections will be influenced and our enemies will be banned from running, but to the people it's a return to normalcy. It will start on the local level for the people to elect "representatives", then move onto more broad parliamentary elections for the nation."

These elements have caused many issues for us, one of them being the recent, but failed revolution that ended with the summary execution of the ringleaders.

 SCO_ILP_Victory_desc:0 "They said that it couldn't be done, but it has. Our modest organization has toppled the mighty SNP for the first time in the history of Scotland. Now we stand with a majority and the ability to deliver the people of Scotland a government that has their interests in mind.\n\nWe have our first opportunity ever to push our agenda. Let's make the most of it. We only have a limited amount of time until the next election. And the first ILP government must be a historic and productive one."
 SCO_ILP_A_Scotland_For_the_People_desc:0 "For all the talk of Scotland being delivered to her own people, the SNP has never really done things that would improve the lives of them. The rural areas are forgotten. Workers toil for long hours and no pensions if they find themselves unemployed. The English refugees remain destitute. Unions and any attempts to organize are stopped dead in their tracks. And the government remains oblivious and opaque to those who watch it. This ends now. We are the ones who will not only truly deliver Scotland to her people, but make her work for them instead of the other way around."
 SCO_ILP_For_The_English_as_well_desc:0 "The English refugee had been given a burden that few of us can bear. They have lost much under the collaborators in England, and they have lost more when they fled up here. And we treat them like trash, the unwanted refuse of a hostile society. Their poverty and struggle is a stain on all of Scotland, and our treatment of them is a far larger one.\n\nWe will be clear, Scotland is for all the people who live in it, regardless of where they are from. We have a duty to care for and help these people. Then, we can show these refugees a truly shining example of democracy, one where society benefits all, and not just a few at the top of a race based oligarchy."
 SCO_ILP_Language_dispensation_desc:0 "We agree that the Scottish Language should be brought back as part of our attempts to rebuild our culture after years of neglect and destruction. However, we would be lying to ourselves if we cannot admit that certain aspects of the SNP's language classes have some faults. English students are hit especially hard, since they scarcely have opportunities outside of class to put their skills to use. It's hardly fair to force another unreasonable hurdle between them and graduation. If we reduce the requirements, we won't be promoting as strong a cultural identity as before, it's true. However, we strengthen Scotland by allowing the English students to integrate more easily."
 SCO_ILP_culture_allowances_desc:0 "Despite what some say, English and Scottish people are actually quite different. One is descended from the celtic villagers that have lived here since time immemorial. The other has extremely strong ethnic ties to the germanic tribes that settled the island after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Despite years of close proximity and interaction, we still have pretty significant differences, ones that the SNP has ignored. We would be wise to keep these cultural differences in mind, and allow a bit of room for them. It will make our relationship better in both the short and the long run! "
 SCO_ILP_Calming_down_the_nationalism_desc:0 "The Independent Labor Party is made up of loyal Scottish people, who love this land, our heritage, and our way of life. Regardless of what some of our more extreme members think, we stand committed to the freedom and dignity of the Scottish people with no compromises. And that will never change. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't tone it down a little.\n\nConstant nationalism and xenophobia isn't really helping our relationships with the English minority. They are feeling harassed and threatened by this, just because they were originally from a different part of the isle. Let's just keep in mind that it's ok to be Scottish, but it's not ok to fight your neighbors over it."
 SCO_ILP_Making_Promises_desc:0 "The biggest concern most English have is for their friends and family that are still on the other side of the wire. It's more prominent an issue than most that affect the English here in Scotland. And addressing it would go a long way to making them comfortable.\n\nWe will make clear to every group of exiles that our greatest foreign policy goal is the liberation of the island and the establishment of a democratic government to the south. If we can convince them we really mean it, then we'll take care of the biggest concern of many refugees. And it will make them exceedingly happy.\n\nOf course, if this doesn't come to pass, we'll be in major trouble."
 SCO_ILP_Wimberley_is_a_madman_desc:0 "Without a doubt, the most dangerous man in Scotland is Field Marshal Douglas Wimberley. Not dangerous in the sense that the Germans or collaborators are, but as dangerous to Scottish democracy, if not more. He constantly oversteps the military budget and spends it on expensive military purchases, unapproved research, and unnecessary warships. That alone is enough for concern.\n\nBut more worrisome is what happens if we say "no" to him too often. He's convinced that the Germans are coming, and we must be ready, regardless of the outside circumstances. If he thinks we're in his way, he'll do something dangerous, and a democracy must never be in this situation. He needs to go, or at the very least, sidelined."
 SCO_ILP_But_he_is_sometimes_right_desc:0 "With that said, Wimberley does have some relevant and constructive criticism regarding the state of our national defense. Specifically toward our ability to arm and resupply ourselves. Recently, he has fixated on our domestic arms industry being small and unable to equip our forces, saying that we must step in. And we agree with that assessment.\n\nThe surest way to solve the problem is through a direct subsidy to the arms industry. With some more money, we can get them to focus on expanding production of weapons. A new facility would help our situation quite a bit. And, hopefully, calm Wimberley down quite a bit."
 SCO_ILP_Empower_the_unions_desc:0 "People forget that everything in their lives comes from a working person somewhere. The food they eat, the clothes they wear, the home they live in, all of it comes from the working people of Scotland. For too long, we ignored them, stepped on them, and crushed them. No more!\n\nFulfilling our mandate, unions will now have our full support. They are the backbones of worker representation, both the ones that exist, and the ones that will. No longer will we attempt to break them up and leave the proud men and women in them high and dry. And no longer will the regulations of the SNP keep the organized worker down. The ILP will heed labour's call, and so shall the toilers of our nation!"
 SCO_ILP_Empower_the_Workers_desc:0 "Just working with the unions isn't enough. What good does that do for the workers of Scotland who aren't in one? They may be too poor to pay for the dues, or struggling to organize their workplace, or simply choosing to piggyback on the hard work of their organized brethren. Well, we're going to improve their lives, if they fight for it or not. We'll introduce some legislation limiting the hours they have to work. And thus, we will fulfill the old cry of "eight hours for work, eight hours for sleep, and eight hours for what we will.""
 SCO_ILP_Welfare_state_desc:0 "If the worker works, they eat. If they don't, they starve. It's as simple as that, supposedly. But what happens when the capitalist decides that hiring the worker would cut into their share of profit too much? Then the worker starves through no fault of their own. This is the state of Scotland right now. But it doesn't have to be.\n\nUnemployment payments will insure those who have no choice but to look for work may be able to pay for their basic needs while they do so. It's not much, but it is better than nothing. And that might be enough to save many from poverty and homelessness."
 SCO_ILP_Empower_the_People_desc:0 "Despite the charges of some, we are not a communist party. We don't make decisions for the good of our party. Nor are we a "worker's state," where the employed make the important decisions. We are a party that believes the government should work for all the people, those who vote for us, and those that don't. Those who work, and those too young or infirm to. The people of Scotland will know that we work for them, and they will believe in us.\n\nAn ILP government is a government that is transparent and open, allowing the common person to know what we are doing or how we make decisions. An ILP government is a government that interacts with the people it represents on a regular basis. An ILP government is a government that people can trust and believe in. And we'll make sure that even if it isn't an ILP government, Scotland will remain as open and accessible as one."
 SCO_ILP_Connect_the_nation_desc:0 "Scotland was never regarded as the shining jewel of the British Empire, and the state of our infrastructure shows this. While they preferred to concentrate on grand projects in Canada, India, and Africa, our roads and railways were few and far between, and rapidly aging. And the problem has only gotten worse with age. If we put some funds toward infrastructure construction, we can repair some old roads and bridges, while providing some new ones. It will also put plenty of unemployed Scots to work. In the end, everyone benefits from this project, so why not do it?"
 SCO_ILP_Provide_jobs_desc:0 "Everyone wants the government to stay out of private industry. That is, until they start sinking. Then they demand a bailout.\n\nInstead of just paying people to build dams or paint the walls of post offices, why don't we put them into an actual, permanent job? As much as we might not want to admit it, it is inefficient to just do make-work projects all the time until we hit full employment. Investing in some commercial workshops will keep the same people out of the breadlines. And it will also grow the Scottish economy by improving industrial output. We'll eventually run out of bridges to build, but Scotland will never stop wanting more goods in their stores."

Once they reach a friendly port or even a beach, they can signal the shore with a small lamp, and then the exchange will occur.

During these missions, they will also look for any documents or plans from the Collaborator army. However, we have heard reports that German soldiers have been spotted so our agents will need to be extremely stealthy in this mission.

Mayne has authorized SAS soldiers and soldiers in the army who are sympathetic to us to help us coup the government fully and place Mayne in control, this would help us make our mission easier.

 SCO_English_Invasion_desc:0 "Scotland has been invaded!\n\nRight now as we speak, English troops are beginning to attack our soldiers who are dutifully stationed across the country. If we want to remain as a country, we must stand our ground as we did twenty-odd years ago. Scotland must not fall to the Anglos. Even it means to the last breath, we shall not falter."
 SCO_English_Invasion_Reserves_desc:0 "After the formation of Scotland two decades ago, one of the first things that we had to begin to assemble was a reserve army. This group would function and be modeled after a similar system in the United States. With training operations occurring every few months, and the reserve soldiers living their life as normal citizens until they are needed.\n\nRight now is the time they are needed. As English troops swarm the borders, we must call on the brave of Scotland who is in these units to take up arms and prepare. The war that we are fighting will be brutal, but it will be a testament to our people if we survive. "
 SCO_English_Invasion_Concessions_to_the_English_Minority_desc:0 "We are at a standstill currently. We know Scotland has a decently sized English community that could be willing to help us in our fight against the Collaborators. We also know that many of them had retreated to Scotland to evade the Collaborators. It may seem in our interests to begin talking to the leaders of these English communities and offer them concessions. These will hopefully get more people to join the fight against them.\n\nWe plan to offer the English the prospect that once we have won the war, the government will be run by elected officials. The government will be formed on the same ideals of the Scottish one. Upholding democracy and liberty. This should work, right? "
 SCO_English_Invasion_Arise_For_England_desc:0 "Many of these English people that live in Scotland are still patriotic for England however. While this may have caused an issue in the past, we can begin to recruit English soldiers on a large scale to help us fight back the incoming storm of invaders. These divisions will be primarily composed of English soldiers with English officers. Unlike what we may have done in the past, they will have no oversight by Scottish commanders. This is on the line for every citizen of Scotland. Whether they had been born in the country or not, it is their duty to help protect it in dark times. Right now is one of those times, and hopefully the last."
 SCO_English_Join_for_Scotland_desc:0 "If our numbers are correct, along with our census statistics, nearly half of all of the men aged eighteen to twenty-five are able and fit to serve in the Scottish Army. While we are not at the stage of conscription yet, we can begin a massive recruiting campaign to garner interest. Many of these men had grown up hearing stories of great Scottish soldiers during the two world wars, protecting Scotland oceans away. Hoping that their fighting would guarantee that their children wouldn't need to fight. As much as we wish this never occurred, it has with England coming knocking on our front door.\n\nWe must defend Scotland, so arise men of Scotland. In Defens! "
 SCO_English_Build_for_Scotland_desc:0 "It's not enough to just throw a bunch of men and guns at the problem and hope it solves itself. We must back up our forces and make every step cost the English. And if we can't provide steel armor for all our men, we should give them concrete, or at the very least a layer of dirt.\n\nAll our residents will be mobilized to build forts and trenches all over Scotland. Our forces must be assured that the landscape is optimized for their defensive operations. And that if they retreat, similar fortifications await them. Scotland will be defended to the last, and that last will be exceedingly difficult to defeat."
 SCO_English_We_Will_Make_You_Fight_For_Scotland_desc:0 "It has come to the time when we must begin to conscript men across Scotland to help assist us in the war. While it may be seen as unpopular it is what must be done if we intend to see Scotland survive in this bitter world. Along with this, we have begun to plan out an even bigger recruitment drive to foster even more interest. Compiled with this campaign, we will begin to take the role of a woman in the armed forces more open. It was only a matter of time before we had begun to open up roles to women. While this may have forced our hand a little, people will remember that we are defending Scotland. "
 SCO_English_Invasion_The_Flag_Will_Fly_Forever_desc:0 "Scotland has been in this position dozens of times before. A powerful and angry southern aggressor tries to fight us, and we swat them back every time. The first go-around at an independent Scotland lasted nine hundred years. We aren't going to give up at 20 for this run.\n\nScotland is not going to dissolve with a swift push from the South. We planned to fight off far worse than England so there's no excuse for giving up now. Our troops will hold their ground. Our reinforcements will rush to their aid. And Scotland will stay free forevermore!"
 SCO_English_Invasion_Open_the_Stockpile_desc:0 "Scotland needs men, yes. And we have men. But it also needs weapons. And we can't simply produce all of them. It's time we start procuring weaponry from other sources, such as museums, rifle and hunting clubs, and civilian arsenals across the country.\n\nThat's not to say we'll be completely ridiculous. We won't send our men into combat with muskets. But is an assault rifle really necessary for guard duty at a base so far from the front? Of course not. We can't give everyone the best, so we'll limit them to what they need."
 SCO_English_Invasion_Necasary_Production_desc:0 "One of the basis of microeconomics is that if you devote your entire resources to producing one thing, instead of two at once, you will eventually end up with far more of one thing than what you would get with two things. It's called specialization. And now, we have more need for weapons than anything else.\n\nAll our efforts will go to arms production. Every lathe, drill press, and worker we can afford will be producing guns and ammunition. If anyone wants anything else, they have to go elsewhere for it."
 SCO_English_Give_the_Army_a_Blank_Check_desc:0 "Scotland has had some issues with military oversight and budgeting in the past. All that is gone now. Right now, the only thing that matters is our survival. Everything else is secondary.\n\nWe will give the Army what they want. No matter what the cost, we shall provide. And our oversight of them will be curtailed as well. They can do and ask for what they need. All we want in return is victory."
 SCO_English_Invasion_The_good_type_of_Collaborator_desc:0 "As we successfully secure the territory of the German puppet state to our south, we should consider establishing a provisional government to better manage the region and ensure a smooth transition to British reunification. In order to do this, we will have to begin recruiting, for lack of a better term, collaborators within England itself. Of course, none of the old government will be included in this provisional scheme, but this for surely rear a few heads in both London and Edinburgh. Nonetheless, it is what is needed for the country."

 SCO_Improve_comunications:0 "정보 통신을 개선하라"
 SCO_Improve_comunications_desc:0 "Our Armed Forces are in drastic need of new infrastructure. Now with the Collaborators winning the English Civil War, we must be ready. There are some backwoods roads that are forgotten and a bit off the beaten path. We can start to refurbish these by improving them with new asphalt. There are also some clearings that we can start to build small checkpoints for our soldiers. Along with these checkpoints we will build a small central operations base that is near the border that will serve as the command center."
 SCO_Build_Up_the_Industry:0 "산업을 육성하라"
 SCO_Build_Up_the_Industry_desc:0 "If war is coming to our very country, our soldiers must be supplied with the best weapons we can get them. If this means we need to start buying weapons from nations such as the USA, so be it. However, we should only resort to that if things go badly. Let's start by building our industry up. There is lots of underdeveloped land north of the border that we can start to build factories on. These will be used to primarily build weapons for our soldiers but some will build MBTs and APCs."
 SCO_Choosing_A_Plan:0 "계획 선택"
 SCO_Choosing_A_Plan_desc:0 "Our research and development teams have started to look at tactics and doctrines that will help us be more efficient in the field of battle. There are two fields that we have been looking at. One is the school of defense. This would primarily help us defend Scotland if an attacker comes to us and we are pushed back. The other is the school of offense. This would help us engage in an attack on the English. However, we should ask the military experts for more advice before we make any decisions."
 SCO_Flower_of_Scotland:0 "스코틀랜드의 꽃"
 SCO_Flower_of_Scotland_desc:0 "Our defences on the border such as our trench lines and forts are clearly understaffed and under-armed. We need to start to increase our recruitment efforts tenfold. Once we start to recruit these men, our border fortifications will start to be filled up slowly. Scotland has no shortage of men who are willing to fight for the very freedom of our country. Posters will be plastered around Glasgow and Edinburgh that will inspire Scottish independence and freedom."
 SCO_Our_Native_Rock:0 "우리 국가의 바위"
 SCO_Our_Native_Rock_desc:0 "Our country itself is a great rock, one that is hell to fight through. We can use this to our advantage heavily in case the Anglos get bold enough to cross the border and try to take Scotland. Scotland herself is naturally defensible, our border may be short, but we can increase our border security with checks and fortifications across the border to make any attack a living hell to foreign invaders. Our border crossings will start to include heavier firepower to ward off any attacker. The many hills across Scotland will help us greatly to serve as cover for men and armor. Scotland will stand free."
 SCO_We_Will_fight_and_Die:0 "우리는 싸우다 죽을것이다"
 SCO_We_Will_fight_and_Die_desc:0 "Our war council has started to discuss the current shortage of weapons. Our advisors have discussed a law that makes it possible for the people of Scotland to give us their weapons that they have to help the army be more supplied. We have implemented this policy and it has worked. Weapons have started to be dropped off at the local police stations. We have received weapons dated from the First World War and many old rifles that the former British Army used in their futile defence of the Island."
 SCO_And_Stand_agianst_Them:0 "그리고 그들과 맞설것이다"
 SCO_And_Stand_agianst_Them_desc:0 "Scotland will not fall, it is our duty to preserve the Scottish way of life and the very freedom we bring. We are the last bastion of democracy on the isles and we will outlast England and any dream of a United Kingdom. We will not fall, we are the light in the North. If the Anglo dogs try and come take our very land that is stained with our blood, they will need to take it with a force that has never been seen. We are united as Scotland."
 SCO_We_will_Rise_Now:0 "우린 지금 일어설것이며"
 SCO_We_will_Rise_Now_desc:0 "The government and armed forces are planning for the head of the army to make a radio address. We are planning the speech to open with patriotic music that will inspire the people of dear Scotland. The head of the army will then address the army buildup on the border and the sudden crackdown on travel between the countries. Along this will be a message to all able-bodied men who are single. This message will be to go to the recruiters and learn about a possible career in the armed forces. We must prepare."
 SCO_We_Will_Withstand_the_shock:0 "이 충격을 견뎌낼것이다"
 SCO_We_Will_Withstand_the_shock_desc:0 "Our border defences must start to be built up. Our planning and discussion from advisors have told us that we should start to build a trench network that will extend along the border and there will be large fortifications along this line. Our engineer corps will also be expanded to help build these defenses. Our border is 154 kilometers long and we can defend every single bit of it. Our forces across the country have been ordered to amass on the border and help to build the defenses. Every hand helps."
 SCO_Of_England_and_the_world:0 "스코틀랜드와 세계를 위해"
 SCO_Of_England_and_the_world_desc:0 "Scotland has fought back the Anglos many times, from the legend of William Wallace and the King of Scotland, Robert the Bruce. We remember these heroes and their fight against the tyranny of the English. We had stood united for hundreds of years and we will stay independent against the Anglos. We are one nation with no allegiance to an idea of another "United Kingdom", only the Scottish country. Our forces have been training for a day that they invade and will stand on guard."
 SCO_Looking_over_the_sea:0 "바다를 바라보다"
 SCO_Looking_over_the_sea_desc:0 "Our borders are safe from the wretched Anglos, however, there is one more route that they can take to invade our dear home. This is the great ocean that surrounds Scotland, our country is surrounded by it and we need to remember this and start to build defenses to ward off any potential naval invaders. We can learn from the disaster that was the Invasion of Britain and know the mistakes that led the Germans to gain ground so easily against the ill-fated British Army."
 SCO_Scot_the_brave:0 "용감한 스코틀랜드"

It was necessary to be on par with the Wehrmacht equipment if an impending German invasion was to be successfully repelled. As such they now ask in retrospect for the government's permission.\n\nIf they allow them to conduct the research, they will certainly be pleased and might be able to present their results in some months. However, they undermined its authority and it would appear weak if it let them proceed unhindered.

He is reportedly very concerned about the government's passivity in wake of a supposed German invasion.\n\nThe cabinet can allow the Armed Forces to continue their venture.

The problem is, neither the location nor the construction in general is government-approved. This is yet another attempt by the Field Marshal to undermine the government's legitimacy.\n\nHis response was, as usual, that the government is not putting enough effort into being prepared for an invasion by the Einheitspakt. He claims the planned sea fort is a modern and firm piece of military art to be reckoned with by the Kriegsmarine.\n\nIf the ruling party would allow this infidelity, the coast will be bolstered with an "impenetrable" sea fort. It would, however, greatly diminish their authority in the reforms and cost quite a sum of money.

Allowing the Army the ability to raise divisions from thin air is something we cannot alow, however a large and trained armed forces is always needed with the nation ever being in the German's crosshairs.\n\nWe can approve the funding and allow the division to be created or we can deny it and forcibly disband the unit before it is properly formed. However disbanding it would anger the military and perhaps put somethoughts in their minds we don not want, allowing the unit to form would give us a stronger military and would make the armed forces more happy with our administration.

 SCO.253.desc:0 "The committee, composed of Admiral of the Fleet Edmund Anstice, Marshal of the Scottish Air Force Eric Brown, Field-Marshal Bernard Lennox, along with several other high ranking officers had finally reached an agreement as to how the Scottish Military Readiness Assessment would be carried out. It had been agreed that each Head would be responsible for their separate branches, and after some deliberation, each base - be it naval, air force, or army - was responsible for the assessment of their own forces. Officers from separate bases, but of the same branch, are to be the ones who conduct the assessment as there was some concern if an officer was to assess his own men, that he would give them higher praise or rank them as more so ready than they really are.\n\nThe reports will detail not only the readiness of individual groups, but will also assess the bases themselves. This will include a review of the warehouses, the stockpiles of weaponry as well as other necessary goods (such as rations, oil, and necessary mechanical equipment), as well as the overall readiness of the base.\n\nIn the end, any stumbling blocks that are discovered will be reported and as much as possible will be done to rectify any necessities - be it a larger budget or the improvement of equipment.\n\nThe end goal of this report and the committee's decisions, of course, is to be prepared as much as humanly possible for a war with a foreign power, be it a great power such as Germany or a weaker power such as England. In either case, Scotland must be prepared to fight for her life."

The technology currently employed by the SAF is, by modern air-force standards around the world, archaic and in need of severe improvement. Furthermore, the size of the SAF poses an issue as well - should war break out, even if the entire SAF was overhauled and modernized, we would likely see the SAF fail to achieve parity with an invading force simply due to the magnitude (or lack of) of the air wings. Thus, it is this committee's conclusions that the SAF must undergo a stimulus of funding in order to promote the modernization efforts necessary as well as recruitment and production of pilots and planes, respectively."

Furthermore, this report shall cover the overall modernization shortfalls and opportunities of the NSN.\n\nPage 348/350\n\nConclusions: \nThe NSN is one of the most powerful fleets in the Atlantic, falling short of the Kriegsmarine as well as the US Navy, but remains one of the most outdated fleets across the globe. While there is no need to decommission any flotillas, as we are within our naval capacity, there is a clear difference in technology used by the NSN and other modernised navies throughout the world. Thus, we as the SMRA Committee have arrived at the conclusion that much work must be done to bring the NSN to a place where it may pose a considerable threat to even the navies that supersede the size and scope of our own. This will require a budgetary increase for the NSN, particularly in the realm of acquiring new technologies and going through the operations of refitting our current ships with said technologies. These must include, but are not limited to: updated electronic surveillance equipment, improved munitions transportation from magazine to naval artillery turrets, updated naval artillery turrets, updated pipes and electric work, etc. We are confident that with these changes, the New Scottish Navy will become a premiere naval force in the Atlantic..."

The men have been found to be in excellent condition - both physically, mentally, and in terms of discipline. During the assessment, they were found to be more experienced and capable than they were during World War 2 and the time period immediately afterward. Furthermore, they are well stocked with ammunition, rations, and other necessary items. They also boast well-planned logistics - be it time tables, supply routes, etc. \nFurthermore, the defenses on the border between Scotland and England are extensive, well maintained, and continue to be reinforced as world tensions continue to rise. At this time, while we are confident in the readiness of the Scots Army, we still encourage an increase in the budget to account for recruitment, training, and better armaments.

Now, over two decades after Scotland finally won back her freedom, it seems we must prepare for yet another assault.\n\nThe rabid jingoism of England's National Front has concerned us for some time now, but in recent weeks their idle blabbering has crystalized into something far more overt. Their government has spoken at length of the historic importance of the United Kingdom and the tragedy of its dissolution, and have declared their absolute intent to see it restored "by any means necessary." Of particular concern is an idle comment overheard from Prime Minister Chesterton, who remarked that the ultimate restoration of British dignity would be "swift justice to the Scots, who abandoned the Union to its destruction."\n\nNow, English forces amass in the north, close to our borders. It cannot be denied; the English are coming, and they do not intend to ask politely whether we wish to join them or not.

The true people of England have risen up- a full-scale civil war has formed, between the unruly German puppet state, and a resistance government, referring to themselves as "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance." This "HMMLR" group seems to have a sense of undying loyalty towards you, promising to reinstate you if they are seen victorious.\n\nThese are extraordinary times. While our nation and yours have been uneasy towards each other ever since our creation, i'm sure both me and you can mutually agree that any reduction in the Reich's sphere of influence would be fantastic for both of us, and any other country with a sense of morality. Thus, inspired by their battle for freedom from the Reich, we have pledged our support to this faction. We now ask if you would be so noble as to do the same."\n\nWe do not expect you to start shipping troops off immediately after reading this. Technology in the past few years, particularly communicative devices, have advanced rapidly. More and more people have television in their home, more families have radios in their living rooms, more people are tuning in than ever before. And with this gives us a new weapon: Media. Show the people your support of these freedom fighters, not with army men and generals, but with broadcasts. In this new age, we believe television appearances and radio interviews are one of the best way somebody can spread support for a group\n\n\n\nThis is what we ask of you- Your clear, public support for these people, and a hope that the Reich is driven off of the island once and for all.""

A not insignificant minority of Scots seem to view the current situation as intolerable and consequently have heaped abuse upon the more vulnerable or standoffish of the refugee populace, who seem to have taken the ill favour with as much grace as could be expected.\n\nAs might be obvious, this is no situation with a simple solution, and as such it has been decided that inaction might be for the best, so as to let tensions simmer down."

These clashes have not gotten better they have gotten far worse than was ever desirable, and now people are starting to notice. The government as it stands has two distinct choices to which it can turn, it can continue to stick the proverbial head in the sand or it can act decisively and identify the root cause of these conflicts before they turn into something even worse.\n\nThe faction for a true investigation point out that the government cannot be seen to fail to give aid to a vulnerable minority under threat, or worse a minority with voting power, but those for inaction take the position that the very act we hope will dull the conflict could well spark it.

With the Germans glaring over the border every other day for the last pair of decades or so, it was a miracle to have the collaborators shot down by their own hubris. It was poetic, in a sense. Even still, collaborators or not, the notion of Scotland and England were mutually exclusive at best, and an inevitable source of friction at worst. It wasn't like the Unionists were any proof of anything otherwise, and Scotland had been divided like a broken mirror at best thanks to them. If today's orders were anything to go by, though, he was about to fix that. Chuckling behind the collection of concrete barriers set up by local authorities, Grant thought to his first orders given to the people of Scotland. "Under the orders of the Scottish Army, you are all to stand down. Surrender your weapons, and come out with your hands up." As of 9:30 AM, Scotland was to "go through the wringer" so far as the high-command was concerned. To use a term that Paddy Mayne had used in his first official communication with Scotland, the Republic was to be "born anew". Scotland was to be saved from the English, and Scotland was to be saved from itself. That is not the perspective that many within Scotland had taken. From the sounds of the comms across Scotland, Grant's assigned municipality wasn't the only one to take to the streets. Once confronted with the army, they resorted to the typical methods: throwing insults and rocks, pushing and shoving the officers on the scene, and from there escalation was nothing more than a formality. By midday, Zhadanov cocktails were being flung, and gunfire had begun to rock the city. Once night had fallen, Grant's detachment had still been waiting on reinforcements from Edinburgh. According to dispatch, they were the last to mop up opposition.\n\nGrant peaked over his cover. The sky was alight just as it had been once the sun had first shone that day- the streets now alight with gunfire and terrified unionists than sunlight. Of course, as the streaks of jets could be heard overhead, the streets would soon be filled with neither."

The war then led him from France to northern Africa, and finally all the way back to the Scottish border where the German onslaught of Operation Sea Lion could be stopped.\n\nSince the end of the Second World War, the Field Marshal was always weary of what he thought to be an impending German invasion. He greatly popularized the idea of paranoia-ridden Armed Forces, always ready for everything. Subsequently, this granted many headbutts with the government, whose actions he often despised as too reluctant.\n\nIn recent times, however, he became increasingly pleased with the actions the government undertook to apparently ensure Scotland's defense.

The ruling party is presented with four fateful choices.\n\nGeneral David Young joined the Royal Scots in 1945, shortly before the end of the British demise in the Second World War. He was selected Commanding Officer of the Royal Scots some years ago. Thereafter, just a few years prior, he was appointed commander of a Mechanized Brigade. His selection would slightly favor anti-paranoia. If he was to become Commander of the Armed Forces, spending would strongly represent Young's preference of mechanized and motorized divisions as well.\n\nNext up is Lieutenant General Alexander Boswell who was commissioned to the Highlanders after military academy education in 1948, working his way up to being appointed second-in-command. Some time prior he became commander of an armored division. His selection would be an enforced continuation of the Field Marshal's policy of a paranoia ridden Armed Forces. Besides, Boswell would greatly boost the expansion of the armored branch of the Armed Forces.\n\nAnother potential pick would be Air Marshal Thomas Kennedy. Joining the Air Force in 1946 he was sequentially picked for officer training. He rose quickly through the ranks. Commanding his own squadron he rose up to one of the highest Air Force ranks a few years ago. Picking him would greatly reduce the Armed Forces' paranoia. Additionally, the Air Marshal would logically put his efforts into expanding the Air Force of the Armed Forces.\n\nLast but not least we are presented with Admiral Andrew Miller. Joining the Royal Navy in the last year of British humiliation in 1944 he oversaw the end of the war and joined the Scottish Navy in the ensuing time. Having been given command of several ships he quickly climbed up the career ladder, becoming Admiral recently. Favoring him would minorly continue Wimberley's policy.

They set up a booth and appealed to passersby. Forms were sent to factories, and canvassers lined the train stations. 30,000 people in Glasgow signed. Nobles, parliament members, and other notables voiced their support. The President turned it down.\n\nAdam's father was now bent, haggard and aged beyond his years. Adam's mother could only stare into the fire and tell the press how her son had used to bring stray cats and dogs into the house and once an injured bird. How violence was alien to him. Adam had grown more distant as the day of his execution approached, seemingly more and more disinterested in his appeals. If he was saved or not, he thought, it would be God's will.\n\nAll options ran out on Tuesday morning. He was escorted to the room next to the cell by police. There, he found several police, executioner Robert "Jock" Stewart, the Minister of the Interior, and a noose. At 8:02, the deed was carried out."

This would ensure the Armed Forces' continued exercising of authority on the nation. Yet another coup, however, would greatly anger the population and opposition.

This sublimely prepared site will be place for a day of celebration and tomorrow will act as the place for the first reenactment of the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nDuring the Scottish interregnum in 1291 Edward I of England was declared Lord Paramount of Scotland in his deceitful arbitration. This Plantagenet having been declared the next king of Scotland this King immediately started working against Edward I. This led to the first War of Scottish Independence, lasting from 1296-1328.\n\nAt first Edward, "Hammer of the Scots", defeated us in battle after battle. By 1304 Scotland was brought to its knees by near total conquest. In 1306 the famous Robert de Bruce seized the Scottish throne and started a relentless guerilla campaign against the English. Edward I's death and the incapability of his son, later infamous for his downfall at the hands of his own wife, contributed to the reemergence of Scotland.\n\nWanting to relieve the siege of Stirling Castle Edward II prepared for the famous battle. Only half of his 27,000 requested men arrived, however. Robert's numerically inferior troops dealt him the fatal blow, killing up to 10,000 of his troops while losing less than half of this themselves, and forced him to retreat in the decisive battle lasting for two days. A few years later the independence was manifested via diplomatic means, which their ancestors, we, just recently regained.\n\nThese deeds of Scottish heroes shall enjoy an ever-lasting legacy."

This is a years-long campaign to take over Scotland, led by Paddy Mayne and his clique of sleeper agents. I gave you the names already, all the little biographies I pieced together while tending bar at the UP national office. Almost forty percent of the party have ties to the Stirlingite operation, and once the shooting starts south of the border a call will go out."\n\nThe journalist shot a brief, skeptical question.

An anticipated agenda item since the recent elections, the NLA focuses on reducing the ability of unions to organize and negotiate, along with greater surveillance on their leaders and socialist allies.\n\nMany union leaders have already united to oppose the act, and militant strike waves have rocked the nation's urban centers. A particular bête noire is the "individual prosperity" clause, which states that unions may no longer require all workers to join them. Labor leaders say this will crush their ability to collectively bargain, while the UP claims this will end "socialist tyranny on the shop-floor". Despite major opposition from the Act's targets, it seems that the initiative will remain with the government and its international corporate allies, rather than the increasingly battered Scottish labor movement."

Papers had not been difficult to forge and he had quickly risen through the ranks to be where he was now - in a position of significant power. Abram and Barrow had been discussing for quite some time what could be done to assist the operation being slowly set into motion, and Barrow had identified two ways that he could help.\n\n"Now, here's the deal. I have connections with the local police as well as within the Scottish Army - sympathetic connections, I should say. And while both sides owe me favors, it'd be a bad idea, quite frankly, to use all of them at the same time. Not just because we might need them in the future, but because if we decided to go ahead and have both the army pull back as well as have police officers reassigned, that would be too obvious. Surely, you understand that."\n\nAbram nodded, and Barrow continued. "So here's my solution - I could either work to have the army be pulled back far away from the city. This arguably might be more difficult, due to the amount of strings needing pulling, but it can be done. The other option we have is that I can use my contacts in the police as well as the Justice department to get police reassigned to other cities, leaving less of them to respond in the case of a move by us. Both have their shortfalls - more police, means potentially a faster, but weaker response. The army being nearby means a slower, but possibly more powerful response. What do you think?""

Now, here he was, at the head of a committee that had been assembled with the purpose of investigating known "ex"-SAS officers. None of them knew of his own connections with that group, and knew him more as "Bain, the True Scot." A title he planned to use to great effect today.\n\n"Gentlemen," he rose.

He knew he was pushing it, as some of the collected photographs and schedules spoke otherwise, but he continued. "These men have left their English past behind them. While one couldn't say that they were fully fledged citizens, one can say that they have become a productive part of Scottish society. Therefore, I move that we change the overall goal of this committee, as we can use the resources available to us to achieve a better goal than the investigation of a few middle-aged men."\n\nAfter a few hours of deliberation, the committee had arrived at two proposals - both of which, Logan thought, could only benefit the operations the SAS had planned.

"Our idea is twofold - we can only pursue one course of action, so we must think hard on which course of action to take. If it turns out that we took the wrong one, the operation could be over before it even starts and all of you, as well as your men, will be exposed and likely prosecuted for treason." Heads nodded around the room.\n\nLogan Bain spoke, "So what are the options you have arrived at?"\n\nAbram jumped at the question. "Essentially, there are two ways we can essentially sabotage the road system. One is more direct, another more... political. The political option is, using all of our contacts as well as the pull that the SAS has with the current government, we can push for the ceasement of all road building to and from Edinburgh. While this would leave many avenues still open for movement, it keeps it relatively controllable." He pointed at the main roads to the capital city. "The more direct approach is we actively sabotage the roads. Be it explosives, digging in the middle of the night, "flash flooding", and the like, we can make the roads heading to Edinburgh hell for everyone from the infantryman to the truck to get through.

If we have men in strong roles in the ministry, then they can cause all sorts of havoc, including delaying the army's march on Edinburgh were such a thing to happen."\n\nHarry Adams nodded - it was a good idea after all, but he had another one to put forward. "The danger, of course, is that by implanting SAS men into the ministry, we run two risks. One, the men could be found out and interrogated. Even if they don't divulge the plans under significant pressure, the mere possibility that they are SAS men could kill the baby in its crib, so to speak. Two, we lose men that could be on the front lines of keeping the peace and ensuring a peaceful transition. An idea put forward to me by one staff sergeant the other day who's assigned to the defense ministry was this." He leaned forward and clinked Ardis' glass. "Instead of implanting men, we could instead use our current plants to promote men who would be absolutely incompetent in the face of greater responsibility, or better, in the face of an intense situation."\n\nMajor Ardis' eyes glazed over as he thought over Adams' proposal in his alcohol addled brain.

However, a discovery has pointed to an unsettling conclusion as to an outside source of aid for these operations.\n\nInvestigations of several of these bombings have found remanents of pencil detonators, physical detonators that light a fuse and give the user time to escape. This is a step-up from previous methods employed by the rebels, where they used simple fuses or lit cigarettes in a matchbook. The possibility they have acquired a stockpile of our own engineering equipment has been discounted, as the English military has been using electric blasting caps since the end of the war.\n\nThe OFN would be a possible source of these detonators, but our intelligence says they prefer blasting caps as well. Our files, however, indicate that production of Number 10 delay switches was shifted up north to Scotland during the Second World War after Operation Sealion. It's extremely likely the Scottish military is continuing to produce the type, or has developed quite a stockpile. And rebel groups have long trespassed into Scottish territory to receive supplies.\n\nThe implication of this evidence is clear.

"Find Mayne," he barked. "Get that rat alive."\n\nBy morning, Scotland was once again in new territory. The voice of Wimberley himself was broadcast across the nation, saying that the fall of Mayne's clique means an eventual return to democracy, but for the time being an emergency military government must function, to root out subversion. Few Scots could feel much optimism that day, having just seen their supposedly unique and impervious democracy be ripped apart by military toughs for the second time that week. Was Wimbereley telling the truth, was this all temporary? Two shoot-outs in Edinburgh left few with fighting spirits."

"Building secured, sir. Preparing statement now."\n\n1950 hours. The cabinet members had been shunted to their offices by multiple SAS soldiers, moved away from the dozens of security guards ripped apart by rifle rounds. The Minister of Defence, once in this room, was then escorted away while the rest of the cabinet looked on, wondering whether they were witnessing betrayal or execution.\n\n2000 hours. Televisions around the nation ran the same broadcast: the ever-familiar nightly commentator extolling the virtues of Mayne's new government and the victory over traitors to the nation. In Douglas Wimberley's quarters, he poured what was now his fourth glass of scotch. The emergency line was dead, no other general even tried to contact him.

Soldiers who valued the new government (or simply their own skin) would be asked to help escort the highest ranking officers on their base to SAS and police agents.

Some of the men who had been participating in the toss had been members of the Highlanders. The top throw of the day had been Evan Smart, one of Wimberley's Highlanders who landed the Caber perfectly at the 12:00 position each time he went. There was a small break before the next events. One of Wimberley's advisors asked if he was going to be a contestant in the hammer throw. Wimberley grinned and replied saying he was too old for this, but he did say he would watch.\n\nAs the day went on, more events came by. There were astounding displays of strength in the weight toss.

Across the floor, Priscilla Buchan had the same reaction but was already thinking of ways to use this.\n\nAfter a few hours, William Wolfe had been talking to his fellow MPs and some members of the UP who had agreed to collaborate with the ILP. As the Leader of the Opposition, he made a speech that announced the funding of the military calling it a gross overreach of rights established by the constitution. He then asked the Leader of the Majority from the SNP to tell him where the funding had been acquired from. The Leader of the Majority didn't answer him, Wolfe was dumbfounded; he wondered if the SNP would bend the knee to the Army so easily. He then walked off the stand after his speaking time was done and Priscilla Buchan walked up. She reiterated many of the same points of the ILP but said that she pledges to use the money from the bill if it fails to help the people of Scotland even more. She got lots of nods and whispers of agreement from the rows of seats. During this speech, Wolfe was paying half-attention and had collected himself. During this, he was considering offering a compromise to the SNP about this bill. He agreed on the facts about the Army. Maybe he could receive a compromise when half the funding is achieved. He reminded his subordinates that the Army's primary defense of Scotland, so this bill would protect them. Some of the ILP members hadn't agreed with this action and had planned to vote to abstain.

That violates a bunch of laws, as it turns out. So they set up a blockade to find the ship and bring the crew to justice.

And what was the civilian government going to do about it? The answer to the last question was: nothing. They would just wait it out. The people protested, but the government was still firm about not moving. Because of secret information or indecisiveness, the people could not know.\n\nFinally, the navy decided they had accomplished their goal.

They were so close to the finish line, but he still had to pass muster with the guards on his way out of the complex.\n\nGetting in had been, actually, relatively easy. The guards had at first been on the defensive and were about to detain them until Abernathy began shouting at them that they were about to make him jobless, wifeless, and penniless - even though he had the full authority of the airport to do the work he had been paid to do. At that, the guards had become rather sheepish, but still resistant, until Abernathy pulled out the falsified work order and read through it for about 5 minutes before the head officer on staff waved him through.\n\nInstalling the equipment, by comparison, had been a breeze. The airport had been completely empty besides a very small amount of janitorial staff, and nobody paid each other any mind outside of their own work. Once everything was hooked up (and facing towards the clusters of troops out on the tarmac and in the lobbies), they had quickly made their exit before anyone had any bright ideas about questioning them.\n\nAs he pulled up to the gatehouse, to his relief, the same troops who had given him pause when he first arrived were still there - and recognizing him, they waved him on through.

"What kind of world do we live in where a nation can't trust its own military to not be up to any good?

A few hours ago, the troops who had been gathering at the airport had suddenly moved out of the localized area that they had secured previously and began to spread through the airport. According to one of the newspapers that Campbell had furnished, the army had essentially forced any and all personnel out and replaced the essential personnel - such as the air traffic controllers - with their own men. One of the civilian controllers had said that they had come into the tower and told each controller to re-route any flights heading to Aberdeen to other airports, and as each controller had finished his list, was replaced with a military air traffic controller. He reported that they had not been treated ill, but there was enough tension in the air that no one had dared to resist their orders.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] rubbed his eyes and breathed out a sigh as Campbell finished the report. "So, it's safe to say that they had no authoritative permission to do this. No government official - not yourself and none of the other heads - had given them permission to do this?"\n\nCampbell replied, "No, [Root.GetLeader].

Giving one of the guards his papers and the work order that had been drawn up for them, it had seemed like they'd be let through rather quickly, without a hitch. That is, until the goddamn military police had arrived.\n\nThe officer in charge had taken one look at Abernathy and subsequently grabbed the papers from the guard who he'd been speaking to. He had proceeded to question him on several topics related to the documents and then walked away into the gatehouse and made a call. When he stepped out of the gatehouse, the papers were nowhere to be seen - instead, the officer brandished his pistol and directed his men to do the same with their firearms. His team had been dragged out of the van, and now here they were, about to be gunned down for God knows what. Suddenly, the quiet was broken by the officer's voice.\n\n"Alright, you Burgundian scum, do you have any last words?"\n\nAbernathy couldn't believe his ears and was about to respond when the officer spoke up once more.\n\n"That was a joke - there is no mercy for traitors or spies.

Apparently, from the moment the official investigative committee arrived at the airport, the military had more than just accommodated the officers. They had been allowed to conduct interviews with random soldiers, pilots, and officers. There was apparently even a luncheon where they had discussed the situation over a local meal.

As he was marking down supplies, an officer came up to him and started a conversation.\n\n"Bryce, Captain's orders, we need to get this shite loaded onto the ships by noon today, something has come down from the President I heard to get us moving out of 'ere" As the officer said this, his eyes darted around and he looked nervous.\n\n"Alright, I'll send some sailors to get these loaded" Bryce replied sharply after this. A salute was exchanged between the men and then the officer walked away.\n\nA few hours later the four men assembled in the dock house once again, Daniel had signaled that a message had come from Edinburgh. Once the men had been assembled they learned of the bombardment plans. Reactions from the men had ranged from confused to worried, but then they heard the foghorn of the NSN Belfast. It seemed to be leaving port in a hurry along with the other ships. The men looked at each other and shrugged. It seemed their job had been done."

 SCO.7079.desc:0 "Constables Davies and Rhys left the chief constable's office with a warrant to the Scottish Navy. It had been given to them by the chief constable who in turn had been asked by the Scottish Government to investigate the ships of the Scotish Navy who had docked on one of the wharfs in Glasgow. They both entered their panda car and drove to the wharf. Once there, they walked around the wharf to see if they could find another entrance before giving up and walking towards the front gate.\n\nAs they walked up to the sentry, he asked for the reason they had come here to the wharf. He looked at the two constables with confusion. Davies handed the sentry the warrant. The sentry looked at the warrant and then asked the two men to wait as he fetched a superior to bring to the two constables. Davies rolled his eyes as the sentry ran off to grab an officer. Rhys however was focused on the three men on the bridge of the SNS Anson who had been looking around at the River Clyde with a pair of binoculars and then marking spots down. He pulled Davie's arms to look at the bridge. The two men began to write the encounter down and then the sentry came back with a gruff looking officer. He took a look down at the warrant before grunting and letting the two constables into the wharf. As they had walked around the dock, they had started to observe the operation of the Navy. Men flowed in and out of the ships carrying all sorts of equipment. The two constables walked even further down the docks hoping to find something.\n\nAs they walked down the wharf, they came upon the end of the dock where it branched out to the left. Docked right next to it was the NSN Grafton, as they walked down it, they noticed that a piece of paper had flown out the window. They grabbed it and quickly put it in a small bag and then started to leave the wharf, careful to make sure they had not left any tracks."

 SCO.70791.t:0 "Glasgow Police Report #684"
 SCO.70791.desc:0 "Detail of Event: Constables Rhys and Davies encountered an officer on the second day of the investigation against the Navy who agreed to be questioned by the police force. During the session, the officer said that the mission of the navy was to assist the coast guard in an interdiction mission and to start a recruitment drive in Glasgow. The two constables have verified this after two more officers have been brought in for questioning.\n\nEvidence Piece #004: A piece of paper was found by another constable during the investigation. The contents of it seem to be about a day of recruitment with plans for streamers and balloons to be set up around the wharf. It also has a list of local businesses that have agreed to put up signs promoting the Navy. Another list was also included of recruiters who would go into the local schools and on the streets trying to recruit the local populace to join the Navy.\n\nEvidence Piece #005: A folder was given to the police by the captain of the NSN Belfast Lewis Gordon. Inside of the folder had been photos of suspected smuggling vessels that had been sent into Scotland to drop off illegal weapons that could possibly end up in the hands of citizens with deeper aspirations who intended to overthrow the Scottish Government. They had been marked for interdiction and along with this in the folder had been photos of weapons that had been smuggled in and marked for destruction.\n\nSummary: While it may seem like at first, the Scottish Navy had looked suspicious due to their actions by docking in Glasgow, it seems to be a bit of confusion. After consideration and cross examination, it appears that the Scottish Navy have no plans to attempt to influence the government or scare the Glasgow City Council. Their reason for coming into Glasgow was to attempt a recruitment drive and help the coast guard out in a joint operation."

 SCO.70792.desc:0 "Detail of Event: Constables Rhys and Davies after three unsuccessful events had acquired another warrant to go aboard the NSN Belfast and investigate the inside of the ship. After the third day of being onboard the ship, files had been dropped to them from an unknown benefactor. Inside them were pictures of Glasgow that had been marked with pens it seems and some other notes that included estimates of damages and number of shells that needed to be filed. Immediately after this, the two constables left and reported this to headquarters.\n\nEvidence Piece 002: In the file mentioned in the above passage, they contained photos of landmarks around Glasgow that had been marked for demolition. Due to the presence of the SNS Anson and its armament of 14-inch guns, it has been assumed that they are planning to bomb these marked locations to limit a response from the civil government in a coup d'etat. This has raised concerns in the internal police force about the ramifications of an uprising done by the military.\n\nEvidence Piece 003: A drawing that was retrieved by Constable Davies had been brought back to headquarters. The drawing was of Glasgow with more locations marked out on a map. While the quality of the drawing is quite shoddy, we have put more forensics agents on it to determine the areas that would receive extra security incase of an event such as a coup d'etat or bombardment by the navy.\n\nSummary: Due to these circumstances, the case has been considered officially closed, while inside the government, the case is very much still open. We have called both constables back from the assignment and have started to send in new ones due to fear of reprisals against Rhys and Davies. The central government in Edinburgh has been alerted of this and has currently been planning solutions to these developments."

No less than 5 MPs had walked in that morning alone, each with newspapers from different sources - yet all had said the same thing.\n\nIt appeared that the flights from SAF Lossiemouth had recently undergone a change in how they plan their practice flights, as the papers reported that there were far more flights near, and in some cases, over city centers. [SCO.getleader] leaned back in [SCO.GetScotPresidentPronounLowercase2] black leather chair.

It could be that they had simply changed their flight times - the SAF usually carried out practice missions during times of day when they wouldn't be as noticeable, be it the early morning, evening, and even night time. It could also be that they had decided it was time to switch up their flight routes, that the men had gotten too used to routine and the commanding officers had decided that they needed some shaking up.\n\nHowever... and that was the fulcrum on which this all balanced... however, it could be possible that the SAF was preparing for something. Preparing, not for a foreign threat, but a domestic one. And that's what worried [SCO.GetLeader]."

He had considered creating some form of proposal to [SCO.GetLeader] to allow him to send a few of his most trusted SIS agents to the base so that they could see if anything nefarious was being planned... but it seemed like [SCO.GetLeader] had been ahead of him, although in a wrong direction.\n\n"So what do you think, Jimmy? Should we go on in and arrest the officers? Start an inquiry? These changes to practice missions are too close to our population centers to make me comfortable."\n\nJimmy saw his chance. "Frankly, [SCO.GetScotPresidentPronounLowercase4], while I do think we need to do some form of investigation, going in guns blazing may not be the right call. I'd recommend going in ca canny. Let me put together a surveillance team, which could then collect some information for us before we decide to take any action.

They stated that he was, rather, Len Findley, a fire inspector contracted by the airbase to ensure that their fire systems were up to date. High command had decided that this was the best way to get him inside - an officer would be too conspicuous, and a standard maintenance man would unlikely be allowed in to where he needed to go.\n\nHe thought of the other agents on this task - one, Agent Gilreath, who had already slipped in, as a grease monkey and was likely already planting his microphones along with other bugs amongst the planes on the airfield. Then there were Agents Hasting and Bannerman, who were in the sewers attempting to attach bugs to the numerous phone lines heading out from the base.\n\nThis was the big one. If any of them were caught, this whole operation would go up in flames and all Scotland would only suffer for it.\n\nThe guard finally closed his identification papers, handed them back to "Mr. Findley", and opened the gate to let him through. Once he found a parking spot reserved for on-site contractors, he grabbed his tools, his "fire alarms", and smoothly made his way to the headquarters located towards the east of the complex. Soon enough, he was inside the building, and got to work. He worked quickly, mapping out the paths of officers and guards as they passed. As he finished up installing an alarm in one of the rooms across from the map room, an officer stepped out the door and went on his merry way. Agent Atcheson took the opportunity to enter the room, having seen that there was nobody else in the room. He quickly went to work, snapping photos of just about every document and map he could find with the small camera SIS had provided him with, whilst also dropping all manner of bugs everywhere he could - vents, holes, and the like.

They had analyzed and reviewed hundreds of recordings and photographs, and with this final report Jimmy had brought to him, confirmed that the planes out of Lossiemouth had simply made a change in their flight paths and times. There was no evidence of a conspiracy to bomb either Scottish government or civilian buildings.

Photographs of maps with targets marked on them - targets of major city centers, of government buildings. There were aerial as well as street level photos. The problem, however, was staring him in the face - these were Scottish cities and buildings.\n\n"My God..." whispered [SCO.GetLeader]. He had hoped it wouldn't have ever come to this... a hope that had been clearly misplaced. Halliday began speaking, telling him of pilots speaking horrid phrases like "Bombs way" and "Target in sight" as they flew over cities such as Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee... the list went on. He tried to keep his composure, and while outwardly he might have been successful, inside he could feel a fear welling up... as well as a certain type of relief, one which Halliday spoke out loud.\n\n"Be grateful that my team was successful and we found out about all of this before it was too late.

However, as he approached, he could almost smell that something was wrong. The gatehouse seemed more staffed than previous intel had suggested it would be, and the base itself seemed to be on some form of alert. Cars behind the fences darted to and fro, MPs patrolled in groups.\n\nDonald felt a sinking feeling in his chest and hoped that Agent Gilreath hadn't been captured. As he got closer and closer to the gatehouse, the feeling continued to increase steadily. Even if he managed to slip into the base, with everyone so on edge, he imagined it would be unlikely they'd allow him to move anywhere without a guard which would make his job many times harder than initially expected. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Agent Gilreath - but he was not alone. He was being dragged towards a small building by two burly MPs and Acheson could swear that he looked bloodied. He realized with a stark realization that the mission was compromised. He prepared to make a U-turn, hoping to seem natural, and reached for his radio at the same time in order to signal the rest of the team that the mission was a loss.\n\nHowever, as he made his U-turn, 2 security cars that he hadn't realized were behind him swung in front of him, forcing him to stop.

As [SCO.GetScotPresidentPronounLowercase] continued to discuss the situation with Halliday, they were left with two working theories. One, it could be that they had simply decided to "test the waters", so to speak, and see if they needed further training on the new practice mission schedules. Having been satisfied, they went back to their old routines, as their old routines were more in-line with a defense of Scotland from foreign invasion.\n\nThe second conclusion, however - one much more dire - was that they had conducted enough missions to collect data for some other purpose, and to avoid suspicion had ceased the new flights. Either way, the flights had stopped, and there was little chance for them to find out any more information as to what was the deal with the strange flights."

In hindsight, while they hadn't had much evidence to make a clear verdict, Halliday had suggested that they could be possibly forced to resign over the supposed "danger" of having bombers and other planes fly so close to civilian centers. "Disturbing the peace" he had called it, and "threatening the general welfare". Essentially, they had threatened the staff with all sorts of punishments, from dishonorable discharges to prison time if they did not resign themselves. It appears that the commander had... reservations about this. "Alright, send it in. And so he did.\n\nIt was an hour since [SCO.GetLeader] had given the go ahead to bring in the delivery, and now he sat amongst mounds and mounds of documents, photos, and recording devices. He had Jimmy in his office, and they both perused the contents - but they knew what they said. The senior staff had been innocent. Copies of everything from maps, photos, to in-flight recordings all said the same thing - the flight changes had been a legitimate attempt to conduct new and unfamiliar practice missions. Halliday handed [SCO.GetLeader] an envelope - it was addressed to him from the Captain. What followed was one of the most scathing pieces of literature [SCO.GetLeader] had ever read in his life, ranging from calling the whole situation a "political stitch-up" to proclaiming that they were in the pockets of the Germans.

Another played black box recordings, with moments where the deadliest buttons on an armed bomber were pushed particularly highlighted. Finally, a pair of agents showed photos of maps with targets listed on them along with other documents - memos, aerial photographs, and the like.

"Well, we could go in loud and or we could try the quiet approach. Both have their own drawbacks. We could arrest the leaders of the exercise - generals, colonels, what have you, and begin an investigation as to what they were doing. We could also go in quietly - attempt to sneak in some agents while following up with aerial surveillance via a spy plane.

Tensions are at an all time high, and you need to find out if this exercise is an actual exercise to prepare for the English, or if it's to prepare for an action against Scotland."\n\nYou nod as Minister Halliday continues. After an hour of briefing and preparation, you are dismissed to a truck waiting outside with your team. You hop in the truck and drive off to a safehouse near the highlands."

As you march with the other soldiers through the hills, you steal a glance at the sky. Somewhere up there was a small plane that was continually snapping photographs of what was going on on the ground, while you were making mental notes and taking photos on the ground, transmitting them at night.\n\nGetting in had not been too difficult - you had arrived with your team and split off into different directions around the main camp only to move into its heart at the multiple entrances, so as to not seem too suspicious. You had been brought before your commanding officer and explained that you had essentially lost your way out in the highlands. He had bought it, and after reviewing your (forged) documents, deemed you fit for duty and sent you on your way to be ingrained with your unit. You had been mixed in with a unit of infantrymen, and since a few days ago, been living the life of one.\n\nYou have been spending the last few nights mapping out the camp as well as the guard routes and their shift changes.

He hoped, of course, that the exercises had been legitimate and designed to prepare for a fight with an external enemy. However, there was no way to confirm that any longer. At least, he thought to himself, they hadn't decided to take that moment to descend from the Highlands on the rest of Scotland and install a martial government. Of course, that didn't mean they wouldn't do it in the future - God knows the relationship between the civilian government and the Scottish military apparatus wasn't in good shape. "Alright," he finally said to Jimmy Halliday. "We may have missed this opportunity, but we won't miss the next one if possible. Who knows what the military is up to?"\n\nHalliday nodded.

To the knowledge of the local commanders, the exercises had been scheduled legitimately with the correct forms; said forms had been sent through to Edinburgh for the Government's reference and eventual approval.\n\n3.

While some men had complained and protested, stating "Once again, the government interferes in our affairs", Malcolm and several of his compatriots had disagreed. As they had recounted to the PM and to the Security Service officers who had interrogated them beforehand, the exercise had seemed odd to just about all of them.\n\nThe exercises, they explained, had seemed to be less about fighting a formal enemy, and more about fighting some sort of internal enemy. While they had set-up positions designed to fight an encroaching army, the majority of the troops were given orders more in-line with a dissent suppression effort. Furthermore, the exercise ground had been transformed into a sort of city, and they had even practiced instituting martial law, with some of the soldiers being chosen to play the part of civilians.\n\nOverall, it had been dubious, but the army had operated under the assumption that the exercise was legitimate - the officers admitted they had led themselves to believe that they were training more for an invasion of England, rather than themselves being invaded.\n\nAt the end of their explanations, the Prime Minister dismissed them. Their escorts led them back to the vehicles they had arrived in, but instead of being sent back to what was, in reality, a prison, they were driven back to the nearby barracks.

In fact, Halliday had warned, one of his agents had notified him that one of the officers being questioned had documents showing that the government had received advance notice of the exercise and had pre-approved it.\n\nSure enough, that had been the smoking gun for the army at the hearing this morning. The Security Service had made its case first, citing strange troop movements, reports of a large collective of soldiers and equipment in the Highlands, and the lack of notification. The officers, however, had essentially put a gun to the head of the accusation and pulled the trigger. They had brought their own documents from the actual exercise. This would have likely been enough to show that their hands had been clean, but the real "trigger" moment took place when they showed a board documenting the process of the approval of the exercise. It had been put forth by a few officers, approved by their seniors and passed on up to the generals, who had also approved it and then put forth the plans to the government. Sure enough, there were papers with the signatures of several government officials officially allowing the exercise.

According to his own account along with several of the files he had brought with him, the army had been conducting exercises associated with suppressing dissidence and instituting martial law. This in and of itself wouldn't be an issue... that is, if the government hadn't had any plans to institute martial law in the future.

"English refugees typically lacked financial resources when they arrived to begin with, so this support helps them get back on their feet when they return."\n\nReaction to the program in Scottish media has been mixed.

Auchinleck read the letter for a moment, and then smiled and shook the ambassador's hand.\n\nAt that moment, for the first time since 1707, Scotland was recognized as an independent nation by the English government."

After that, the ambassador was allowed in. The President greeted them all personally, and asked what the children thought of Scotland. Then, the letter of credence from Auchinleck was presented, signifying the ambassador was the official representative of England to the President. A picture was taken of the handoff, with both the President of Scotland and the English Ambassador smiling.\n\nThis photo got a lot of coverage in Scotland the next day, as well as the Scottish ambassador in England presenting his credentials at the same time.

And many times, you heard the stories of refugees, telling horrifying tales and saying that you were certainly next. Those days are over!\n\n"Gone are the waves of refugees fleeing oppression from down south. Gone is the militarized border. And gone are all the Germans and their lackeys from the isle. Marshall Auchinleck and HMMLR now greet Scotland as an independent and democratic power, no different from themselves. Now, the immediate existential threat to Scotland has ended, to be replaced with calm and easy relations with England.

It's a no-brainer, but we still have to decide where to put it.\n\nInverness is a top choice amongst many members involved in the planning of the League, and the reasons are obvious. The highlands!

We take them on a few hikes and boating expeditions, make them throw a few weights, and they'll love this land and the people that live in it.\n\nBut Edinburgh is also a good choice. We could bring them on many tours of museums and civic institutions. The goal is to broaden their cultural and civic awareness, so they know about Scottish culture and how their nation works. This will in turn make them better citizens, and give them an understanding of the long history of Scotland and their ancestors.\n\nSo there's two choices, two cities, two values we could instill in the youth of Scotland.

At 12 o'clock that day, as a band played Arrival Fanfare Number One, he and his wife stepped onto a red carpet at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington DC, greeted by a cordon of US military personnel, the US chief of protocol, a reception committee, and an American schoolchild with a bouquet of flowers. The Scottish and American national anthems were played before a motorcade took them to Blair House.\n\nThe next day was the entrance ceremony, held on the White House South Lawn. The President of the United States met McIntyre there, along with many other government officials. The anthems were played, a 21-gun salute was fired off, and McIntyre inspected the American troops. Then came the remarks, where the President welcomed the visitor, and McIntyre thanked him and everyone else. They went inside the White House, McIntyre signed the guestbook, there was an exchange of gifts, a quick photo in the Oval Office, and then McIntyre departed for the State Department luncheon.\n\nThat night was the State Dinner in the White House. She-Crab soup, Beef, and Corn Pilaf were served. A toast between the two leaders was made before dinner. Afterwards, a performance by Frank Sinatra was held in the East Room before the night closed with sparkling wine and social dancing in the Entrance Hall.\n\nIt was a long day, but even still, McIntyre was excited as he went to bed. Tomorrow, he would address a joint meeting of congress, and host a return dinner in the Scottish Embassy.

His speech to Parliament had gone over well, he thought, and the informal government meetings had gone well too. Well, almost all of them.\n\nWhile leaving Westminster Abbey after laying a wreath on The Tomb of the The Unknown Warrior, he had run into David Stirling. Stirling was well known to McIntyre, a Scottish war hero who had founded a commando unit back in the war, ended up getting captured, released after the end of the conflict, and had never stopped fighting, really. His Special Air Service unit had played an important part in the ECW, and he had gotten on well initially with McIntyre.\n\nInitially, the topic had been about Stirling's war service, and how the unidentified British Soldier from the First World War might have very well been a Scotsman. However, the conversion slowly drifted to Scottish politics and Unionism, which made McIntyre a little uncomfortable. Why did this man have an interest in the political situation of Scotland?\n\nMcIntyre decided not to think anymore of it. Lots of people down there wanted to know about the prospects of Scotland under the English boot once again. And Stirling might have been trying to talk about a common topic of interest.

McIntyre and his wife Letitia were treated to a welcoming ceremony by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and the Coldstream Guards. Some small protests by people who believed McIntyre's Scottish National Party betrayed the United Kingdom in the Second World War were held, but the crowd was largely positive toward the visitors.\n\nAfter an informal lunch at Buckingham Palace, McIntyre then held meetings with the Prime Minister, other cabinet members, and the Leader of the Opposition. During these meetings, several trade agreements between Scotland and England were finalized, including one where Scotland agreed to purchase several aircraft for their flag carrier airline.\n\nIn a speech to Parliament today, McIntyre spoke at length about the shared historical and cultural links between England and Scotland, especially the recent support of HMMLR during the civil war by the Scottish Government. Members of Parliament who hoped for a change in the SNP's stance against unionism were disappointed, although President McIntyre did state that Scotland would gladly work with England as an equal partner in economic and defense issues. The visit to Westminster was capped off with President McIntyre laying a wreath to The Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey.\n\nA state dinner was held for the Scottish President in Westminster Abbey this evening, with 150 guests in attendance. In remarks before the dinner, McIntyre thanked the people of England for their hospitality, and offered to host the Prime Minister on a state visit to Edinburgh in the near future."

The first attempt was to see if they could move into any of the buildings abandoned by foreign governments who didn't like the new people in London all that much. London considered this possibility, but decided it would make more sense if these structures were kept under their control in the case of one of these governments suddenly breaking with Nazi Germany and deciding to pursue a more independent policy. They did attempt to make a bid for the old German Embassy, but this was never taken seriously.\n\nSo, they had to shop around for a location, and settled on an area near Belgrave Square. This was an obvious choice, as many nations had nearby embassies. But it did take a bit of time to find a building that was big enough to handle the work that was expected to happen. Scotland was expected to be England's biggest trading partner afterall. The English government helpfully offered the old Malayan High Commision building for cheap since they were now a Japanese military reservation, but the space issues led Scotland to reject this proposal.\n\nFortunately, only two blocks away, they found a row of buildings that were perfect. It was on a major road, across from the palace grounds, and, best of all, was damaged after being attacked in the ECW. They quickly bought the place, fixed it up, brought in some new furniture, and put a new coat of paint on the inside. Finally, the ambassador, in a short ceremony outside the building, raised St Andrew's Cross above the entrance, declaring the Scottish Embassy to be open."

They did have a series of former consulates from before the Second World War, and many nations used those to conduct business with the Scottish government. England wanted a bit more than that, however. They wanted something a bit better, more...imposing to get the message to Scotland they were the top dogs in this relationship.\n\nUnfortunately, large, ominous buildings were a bit of a rare commodity in Edinburgh at the moment, and many people didn't want to spend money on a new structure that might not be completed until Scotland rejoined the UK. So they decided to compromise and purchase a pre-existing structure that was close to Scotland's government. They found what they needed in a building almost next to the Old Parliament House in Edinburgh. It looked like an embassy, it had the space for one, and it was close enough to get the message across, so the English set up shop there. It was absolutely perfect.\n\nExcept for the US Embassy being next door, and closer to the Scottish Government."

However, there are some laws that we think a national approach is best. Electricity and power is more of a national issue anyway and we're sure London can handle as well as Glasgow. Having separate drug policies might lead to confrontation between us and the English. And Employment and Social Security is an issue that affects us all, and is best run from London.\n\nThe Scottish language needs to be protected as well.

Are you ready?\n\n"So, before we begin, I must tell you that the Scottish National Party was always gonna drive a hard bargain before they would ever join a UK again. They want their own governing body, no, not like the scottish parliament of yore, no, a fully independent governing body that they elect themselves. And that governing body has authority over every domestic matter in Scotland, taxes, laws, whatever. What you do in London stops at the border.\nn\"They also are extremely clear that they want to keep teaching Scottish in their schools and use it in an official capacity like on government notices and road signs and such. They're willing to teach English as well, but they don't want their language to get messed over by London.\n\n"So this is what the Scots want before they agree to a United Kingdom. I know it's a lot, but that is what the SNP wants. Though if this seems a little much, we could try and get some compromises on this from Glasgow.""
 sco_fen.35001.desc:0 ""Allow me to reintroduce myself. I'm Jack Holland from the US State Department. My colleague up north just got the list of the Scots want before they would reunite with you.\n\n"So the ILP wants to have a powerful Scottish legislative body. Everyone in it is going to be elected by scots, and it's going to handle everything that happens in Scotland. They have, however, conceded that several matters, such as electricity and power, employment, social security, and drug policy, are better off on a national scale, rather than a local one. But the taxes and laws that take effect in Scotland are mostly going to come from the Scottish parliament rather than from London.\n\n"There is also the matter of language. Scotland has worked really hard to bring it back these past few years, and they insisted there be protections in this agreement that it isn't going to go to waste. They'd like to keep teaching it in school, use it for governmental usage up there, just generally make sure it's still used and understood by the people of Scotland.\n\n"All in all, I think it's a good compromise. They made some concessions to you, and they'll still be fairly happy up there. So what do you think?""

 sco_fen.38.desc:0 "The Gretna Bridge was the last road bridge over the River Sark before it met the River Esk, which soon flowed into the Solway Firth. It wasn't that distinguishable from the other bridges that crossed the other rivers around the British countryside. Two lanes of traffic, brick construction, two arches with a base in the middle of the river. It would be utterly unimportant if it wasn't the westernmost border crossing between Scotland and England.\n\nBy the time the bridge had been built, the situation between England and Scotland had calmed down enough that it scarcely needed to be guarded. Just a toll house on the Scottish side was needed. On the English side, an inn was established. For many years, people crossed over the bridge regularly, thinking hardly anything of it.\n\nThen came the war. The border, which was hardly even noticed, was manned and armed. The Toll house was manned by Scottish Troops, who turned it into a border crossing. Collaborationist forces manned the inn on the other side, turning it into a border station. This nondescript bridge became a link between the free world on the Scottish side, and the slave world under the collaborators on the other.\n\nWhen the slave world was chased off, some normalcy returned to the Scottish border, but there was still tension. What would Free England do? They wanted to reunite with Scotland, but the Scottish wanted to protect their freedom. What if these differences were insurmountable? Would there be war?\n\nBut none of the fears that troops would cross the bridge were justified. Scotland gave their terms for reentry, and England accepted. As simple as that, the gates on both sides of the border went up, the troops went away, and soon normalcy would return to the bridge, once again not a link between two worlds, but a link under a single flag of two united peoples."

They are concerned that these protections would dramatically increase the effort and bureaucracy they have to put into basic governance. I know protecting native culture is necessary, but is it worth replacing every road sign in England? Is it worth printing two of every document, one in english and one in scottish? It's not feasible to make everything from Dover to the border be in both languages, especially if nobody outside of Scotland will use it.\n\n"Look, I know it's hard for me to ask you this, but you have to compromise.

And we really agree the same thing should be applied here.\n\n"Running around independently is great and all, but what happens when a massive disaster happens? What if the Nazis finally invade? You want somebody at the top to coordinate the response. You want a centralized system that makes the major changes and leaves the minor ones up to you.

Why this is an issue is that England has several laws that they don't want to be possibly overridden by Scotland. Things more basic, such as criminal law and economic policy. They fear the possibility that some whackos might make it legal to beat their wives up here and London couldn't do anything about it, for instance.\n\n"I know, that's an extreme example. But the point still stands. What if someone commits a crime in England and flees to Scotland? Who's responsible for their apprehension and their deportation? What if a company based in England runs afoul of Scottish Pollution laws? If hunters and fishers run afoul of Scottish game regulations, but not English ones?\n\n"There has to be national laws and standards on some things.

That built an empire that spanned the globe. That developed the sciences and industries that had made the modern world that so many others claim mastery over.\n\nBut the most unfortunate circumstances tore the nation apart. England lay subjugated to the Germans and starving. Scotland lay up in the north, supported by independence-minded politicians and their friends in the British Army. They stared at each other from across the border for years, until a free England, devoted to the old British ideals of freedom, burst forth and ended the fake England imposed by the occupiers. For a brief moment, there was hope that the two nations could once again reunite.\n\nIt was not to be. The Scots demanded too much from England. So much so, that a true Union would be impossible. There would only be a scrap of cloth and little else in common between England and Scotland. And this would not do.\n\nScotland has failed to see reason.

As it was in the United Kingdom, it was under the collaborators, and it still was in a free England.\n\nRecently, the prospect of a merger with Scotland had hit the papers. It had excited the population, who believed it the next logical step after the overthrow of the fascists towards recreating the United Kingdom. However, Scotland joining the OFN stopped any optimism towards the prospects of such a Union. And as the negotiations became more and more dragged out, another fear started gripping the papers and a public. The prospect that the Scottish unreasonableness and the English desire to sit atop a United Kingdom would lead to yet another war.\n\nLate in the night, after the evening tabloids had come out, an urgent press conference was called on the subject. While the people slept, reporters funneled into a room in London with some government officials and the Americans who had been negotiating with the scots. When they filtered out, they immediately called up their papers, whose editors instantly called for the presses to stop. This story would trump anything else that happened yesterday.\n\nThe next morning, the papers had come out. On the doorstep, in the hand of the newsboy, in the dispensers, in the newsstand.

They were the lapdogs of the worst people imaginable, and they were obviously going to cook up a reason to invade you sometime. And an OFN state with a heavily armed land border with a Pakt state was going to cause problems for us, and probably escalate them right into nuclear war.

But you fucking idiots decide that your best isn't good enough and reneg on the terms. And we're left here, mouths agape, wondering just what the fuck you people are thinking.\n\n"So here's what happens next. I leave here and tell London that you like your own deal now.

And then England comes in with bombs and tanks and artillery, and they blast every young man you throw in their way.

Well, I'm going to tell you that's not quite accurate. The OFN is more a united front against Nazism, and not a general alliance that will rally under the banner of any member that starts a war for any reason.

Yet one party in Scotland has undeniably benefited from the victory of the Reich's allies in London, the Independent Labour Party.\n\nOnce a mere fringer opposition entity in Scottish politics, the ILP has seized on the discontent of the English minority towards the situation in the south, swelling to become not just the premier force of leftism in Scottish politics, but the bastion of the free English spirit as well. Yet the distrust once felt towards the Unionist party is not present when most acknowledge the ILP, for they at least can be trusted to fight the collaborators unto the end of time itself."

When threatened by the Germans the SNP did not waver, when Scotland was at its bleakest the SNP soldiered on, and if the SNP have anything to say about it the fascists will never tread so much as a foot inside Edinburgh.\n\nIn times such as this, the stable option is ever appealing to the ordinary man."

For all that the English population of Scotland dislike some aspects of the Independent Labour Party, at least they are not advocating peace with the men who destroyed English democracy.

And the public has been conditioned to believe it.\n\nWe've been relying on other ways to get around this. The radio and the television has broken this monopoly on truth. People can hear the words out of our own mouths now, and in full, with context. But not everyone can watch or listen at that time. People may prefer getting their news from a more in-depth and traditional source. And in a few days, when people want to remember what we said, they go to the papers. And we are back to where we started.\n\nThe solution is clear to the ILP. If we want to get our message out, we are not going to be able to do it through corporate media. We will do it through a paper of our own. Not a trashy tabloid one picks up for some coupons in the checkout line, but a legitimate, morning paper. One that covers a wide range of topics.

"Many newspapers in Scotland have corporate owners and conservative editors," said Gazette spokesman Jonah McIntosh, "and people aren't being properly informed of what is happening in Scotland because of it. The Gazette will bring its readers unspinned information and take the position of compassion and humanity in moral debates."\n\nThe Gazette is not without its critics, however, including some of the major established papers in Scotland. In parliament, the opposition Scottish National Party denounced the magazine, calling it ILP propaganda. The Union Party went even further, unfavorably comparing The Gazette to Nazi Germany's Völkischer Beobachter.\n\nIt's unclear at this point if the ILP's venture into publishing and print media will be ultimately successful, but early reports say that a large number of the papers have been sold already. If these numbers are maintained and appeal to more than the ILP base, their belief that Scotland needs a new source of news will have been proved right."

After working there since he got out of the army, Cillian was laid off from the weaving plant. That weekend, Tommy's leg was fractured in a school rugby game. This sent the family into a panic. They did not have the funds to deal with the crisis. Many options, such as a second mortgage or pulling Anya out of college to work were considered. All of those were painful.\n\nBut it turns out, it was an overreaction. The government's unemployment subsidies kept the family afloat while Cillian looked for another job. The healthcare service took care of Tommy's broken leg without major expense to the family, and paid for his therapy and medication in full. No extreme measures needed to be taken, and the Shaws were able to handle the crisis without much harm.\n\nToday, Cillian works in the Post Office, sorting mail and packages for the southwestern suburbs of Glasgow.

Following the crushing of the English uprising, Parliament sessions were in immutable dispute - over the flood of more English refugees crossing the border, over the rather conspicuous exercises caught by aerial reconnaissance. But today, economic policies were hung out on the rack, and have been hung dry and bared for all to see.\n\nThe ILP has made its position clear - trade with Germania's loyal servants is an affront to the struggle of the English people to free themselves from London's yoke. On a less ideological note, the opening of Scottish trade to the English would also, in their eyes, significantly hamper local businesses and labour, the backbone of the ILP's support.\n\n"To the right honourable Mr. MacDowell, an embargo of the English would leave our economy in tatters! I'd regretfully say that a deal with London is a deal with the devil, but it would be suicide to not seize this opportunity"\n\nOn the opposite side of the chamber, the SNP has also affirmed its position - trade with the newly victorious Kingdom would be indeed going against what the Republic has stood for, but the time has never been so perfect to strike a deal with London, especially when one considers the leverage that Scotland has simply by not being devastated by internal conflicts. The capital and investments Scottish firms could provide would be immense in England's recovery, and could prove to be a step closer towards the closer integration of both nations' economies.\n\n"

And he didn't have any other plans besides walking from the Scottish Government Building to Holyroodhouse But it was going to happen, even if he was the only one.\n\nThe day came, and to his surprise, a sizable number of people showed up. Fellow exiles who hated the idea of working with the collabs. Nationalistic veterans who refused to give an inch to the people they fought against. SNP voters who felt betrayed by the government's soft position. ILP supporters who were happy to voice their frustration with anything the SNP did. It was a diverse march, united only by a hatred for England and anyone who would work with them. And it got plenty of media attention.\n\nNext week, the protests in Edinburgh were even bigger. And copycat events in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and Inverness happened as well. It seemed there was a massive reservoir of anger and resentment of the nation, and Wood had struck it with a pickaxe, causing it to burst forth."

There were occasional bangs as he kicked the door to the van, but these didn't bother the other officers.\n\nEventually, some officers got in the front of the van and drove off to have the prisoner interrogated, leaving behind a group of police to comb the scene for more evidence to help their case against him."

 sco_collab.2050.desc:0 "It was a calm afternoon for the President of Scotland. It had been relatively uneventful. The President wondered time from time what the English were up to across the border. He never expected this, however. In the late afternoon, their lunch was disturbed by his personal secretary. She had an urgent message that must be delivered. The President grumbled and got up, little did they know the message would affect all of Scotland. The English had sent a message that afternoon, full of demands. The pivotal one was that the Scottish Republic would cease to exist and be absorbed by Collabarist forces. Soon after this revelation, the Scottish Army was elevated to high alert and there was to be an arming on the border in case of a possible attack by the English. Scottish Parliament was immediately called to deal with this possible threat of war. Generals dusted off plans for a possible invasion, wondering if they would have to use them. The American diplomat to Scotland, David K.E Bruce was notified by his attache and a wire was immediately sent back to Washington and OFN headquarters. It would only be a matter of time before they must respond. The Field Marshal was notified after the fact it had been brought to the President's attention, exploding into a mix of passion and rage after hearing the fact that a crisis was starting to boil on the Scottish-English borders. He suspected he was notified after due to his temper and his anxiousness when it comes to events such as this. After hearing the news, he called all of his generals and marshals to Glasgow Barracks, to the war room to start planning a possible invasion and counter attack. Scotland would not be lost. "

An invasion of Scotland could not be possible, especially if the OFN was backing them.\n\nAny possible conflict would be destructive and the threat of nuclear war was looming in the distance. The English would need to play their cards right if they wanted to come out as the victor in the crisis. The decision was made, they must ask the Germans for aid. The borders had been in a state of panic as the message went out across the Kingdom of England.

The officers hoped that friendly Yankee faces would soon arrive in case the English don't back down. The Field Marshal however, was pacing the war room in the Glasgow Barracks. He had been meeting with generals ever since he got the news of a possible English invasion. It was a mix of intrigue and paranoia for the Marshal. Would his army be prepared incase of a war? Did they truly train enough? Are they ready to face the greatest enemy on the Isles?

They all knew the risk that would be taken if they decided to delve right into England. Luckily they were not alone. They had some help with HMMLR divisions and militias that had risen up against the Collaborators and their rule.

Mayne thought about if the fight against tyranny was truly worth it. So many lost for nothing. However as he thought, a fire was ignited in him. He would not let a setback as big as this crush the plans he had made for Scotland. While this could have been seen as devastating to some, to Mayne it was just another day.

We had attacked him and the remaining terrorists out by Newcastle Upon Tyne. So now I'll ask this question. How do we know this?" Asked Ackenshire to the York, who was slumped down in a chair, sweating bullets.\n\n"Well, you see sir, we had been out on patrol near the border when all of a sudden bullets began to fly near our head. We've walked that path hundreds of times and have seen Scottish soldiers who usually stare at us with rifles mustered or taunt us." Ackenshire motioned for him to continue. "Well, we scrambled to find cover. Unlike the soldiers we had fought before, some had the knife patch on them. They had also chased us across the border" York finally finished and slumped over even more in the chair, before shooting up after remembering he was in the presence of a Colonel. However, before Ackenshire could respond the phone rang.\n\n"Ackenshire, what seems to be the issue?" He pulled the phone a bit from his face for a few seconds, before putting it closer again.

He had received some backlash from the other members of the junta. However he reminded them that they overthrow the Unionists so democracy could return to Scotland. However he still had to decide what party to officially endorse.\n\nThe natural choice was to endorse the SNP. There was an issue with this however, they had experienced a harsh split and then the party nearly breaking down when John McCormick passed away due to sickness. He was weary of the SNP possibly collapsing in on itself. Compared to the other option of the ILP, it seemed to be the best choice. It worried him to see a Scotland corrupted by the influence of less savory individuals such as communists. The Marshal after thinking for a few moments decided that the best course of action was to support the SNP. Wimberley, after talking to some of the other members of the junta, decided that he would need to make a public announcement saying that he intends to support the SNP.\n\nWimberley had decided to make the speech the following day after talking to the other members and writing it into the late hours of the night. While it didn't need to be perfect, it needed to sound convincing enough to the Scottish public so that would support the actions. However this was just a ploy. While it seemed that all of the parties in Scotland could have a chance of running and winning, it was set in stone that the SNP would win.

Wimberley then excited and walked onto the stage and began speaking to the crowd.\n\n"Today as the fair people of Scotland gather, I believe that we should be truthful to every one of you. We had overthrown the Unionists due to their actions. They had threatened the foundation of Scottish freedom and independence just to attempt to reunite the Isles and take away something we fought so hard for against the English. While it may seem like this was an unlawful action, I will ask you this. What would you do if your son was sent to England to die for a cause that they don't see as noble? What if they didn't come back and all? This question was the one that had made us take action."\n\n"Many of us could not agree with the actions of the Unionist Party. Why would we send our men to die for a cause that we didn't agree with on both a personal level and patriotic one? For these reasons, we had to overthrow the Unionists and attempt to preserve Scotland's independence. Now I will say this. I am fully committed to returning Scotland back to its democratic roots. However this will take time and dedication from all Scots to prepare for this. I do not have any fear in this, we Scots have had an independent and strong country for nearly twenty years. We will stand strong."\n\nThe crowd roared in approval. The other remembers of the junta had been standing behind Wimberley, clapping with approval. For once in Scotland since the Unionists, all seemed calm."

His Public Relation Team had worked days and nights to produce the greatest recruitment campaign one could hope for. He couldn't wait to start the distribution of thousands of posters. He wanted to see one placarded on every shop and public building of the country. The most creative minds of his office had worked on the poster. The result was fresh, young and resolutely patriotic.\n\nA poster with bold font and bright colors. "Join the Heroic Army who saved your country." it said. "Fight against cruelty, cowardice and ineptitude. Join the ranks of the victors." The sentence was followed by an image of two young men with bright smiles on their faces. They were both heavily armed and striking a dynamic pose. The image exulted power, strength, health and virility. In big letters you could read "Join the army and learn next to the saviours of the nation! Join their ranks and leave your own mark in history. Make your country proud! Be the next hero! Be the greatest man you can be! Be the proud soldier we know you can be!"\n\nWimberley himself felt somewhat moved by the image. The next part of the recruitment campaign would be to send their most handsome soldiers and most attractive nurses to go and talk with the population. They would send their agents next to colleges and cinemas, shops and postal offices. In the next few weeks, they would be everywhere. They would be sailing on the army's new reputation as the nation's savior. They would use this momentum to double their numbers."

Many soldiers and generals were going to be there. The choir would sing the national anthem while the Junior School children would greet the soldiers and give them flowers. She even heard from her neighbor that one of the generals would receive the city's key as a symbol of gratitude for their bravery during the war.\n\nMiss Wellington felt a bit uneasy with the military in general and she couldn't bring herself to feel grateful. Not after all the fighting and killing. She couldn't celebrate those men. She was however very excited for the city fair. It was her biggest contract in months. Everything had to be perfect. Her reputation, her florist shop and maybe even her life depended on it. She didn't want to think about the consequences of failing an event of this significance. She was preparing flowers bouquets and centerpieces. Wreath for the doors and crown of flowers for the women. Headpiece for the children and baskets full of flowers to put on the stage. After months of austerity, Miss Wellington was happy to cover the whole town of fresh flowers. It was like a second spring for the people of Southery."

Grayson said he would be in the park around 4:30. He decided to open a newspaper and look through it. Ever since Wimberley had taken power, only a few newspapers had been allowed to be published. The Edinburgh Times was one of them.\n\nAs he flipped through the paper, he read the text on it. It was shorter than the issues before due to the limited amount of news inside Scotland at the moment. He noticed on the second page that there was a full page recruitment ad for the Armed Forces of Scotland. It was in full color with all the patriotic colors of Scotland. Luke rolled his eyes and flipped the page. He then came upon an actual news story. It was a transcript and a small story that had been written about the Marshal's speech. Luke's life has basically remained the same since the Marshal took power a couple of weeks ago. He read the transcript slowly, curling his lip once he read that Wimberley had decided to step up and take over as the head of government. His eyes widened even more when he saw that Parliament was being dissolved until the new elections. It made a bit of sense to Luke, they had basically been sitting in Holyrood since the Armed Forces had taken power. He was relieved to finally read that elections would return.\n\nHe read the rest of the newspaper and was bored with it by the time he reached the eleventh page. Just more normal news and stories, opinion pages today. Some light news about oil possibly in the North Sea. He laughed at the idea of this, how could there be oil out in the North Sea?

"English and Scottish citizens have always interacted at a high level, and we'll expect that to continue. They'll visit for rest and relaxation, they'll do business across the border, they'll live over in the other country, they'll fall in love with each other and marry. They'll inevitably be on a close level with us, and we will be with them.\n\n"So I started thinking, we both have a large degree of familiarity with the other nation's culture, history, and customs. We both speak English, and can easily communicate with anybody from down there. And now we're both friendly with the other government. Why not just make it easy for everyone to do what they want to do and allow them to become citizens easier?"\n\nThe elder MacCormick was intrigued. "Explain, lad."\n\n"You see, if a person from England wants to move up to Scotland, they get some of the requirements waived or limited before they become a dual citizen. We'll assume they have a lot of familiarity with Scotland already, and they don't have to live here as long as other immigrants. Dual citizenship will be instituted, and any child born to a english person and a scottish person gets it automatically. That'll make it easy for all those mixed nationality parents."\n\n"I see your point. But we'll want England to..."\n\n"We ask them to do the same thing. It'll build ties and make working together extremely easy. I can make the call to begin discussions as soon as I get back to the office, dad.""

"But there's also us recognizing dual citizenship, so they don't have to give anything up by becoming a citizen of the other country. The whole thing is to help make it easier for everyone to work and live in Britain. It was Iain's idea."\n\n"I suppose it would make the amount of visa paperwork go down as well," said Gabe as he threw his paper cup into the park trashcan as they walked past. "And it would also cut the traffic at the border stations, I suppose. But I don't know how London is going to take it."

 sco_snp.11.desc:0 "The recent citizenship agreement with England has left many people excited and confused. Many are wondering how this will affect them or their loved ones. That is why the Scottish Ministry of the Interior has made this handy pamphlet to explain the agreement recently made between England and Scotland.\n\nNATURALIZATION: Previous requirements of Scottish citizenship were for the person to be over eighteen years old, of upstanding character, having lived in Scotland for five years with fewer than the number of allowed days absent. The immigrant must also have passed an English language and cultural literacy test. Under the agreement with England, an immigrant from England will have the English language section of the test waived, as well as being granted a modified cultural test that does not put as much emphasis on historical events or figures. They will also be able to apply for citizenship with three years of residency, while also having the same amount of allowed absences.\n\nDUAL CITIZENSHIP: A person who meets the qualifications of citizenship for both Scotland and England will no longer have to renounce their citizenship of one nation. They will instead be considered a "dual national" and retain the rights granted to them by both nations. Citizens will no longer be asked to renounce their previous nationality during a naturalization ceremony.\n\nLEGAL RIGHTS: Dual nationals are granted the full legal rights afforded to any other national in Scotland. They will be allowed to work or live in either nation without need for a visa, however, any non-dual citizens accompanying them would need a visa. Dual nationals must follow the laws of the nation in which they reside. If they are convicted of a crime, they will not be eligible to be deported to the other nation the are a citizen of.\n\nENGLISH CITIZENSHIP: Qualifications for English citizenship are roughly the same as in Scotland. However, one must reside in England for a period of time before they qualify to be naturalized. One cannot obtain English citizenship while residing in Scotland. Some residents of Scotland who qualify as an English Refugee In Scotland (ERIS) may already be English citizens. For more information, we request you contact the English embassy in Edinburgh."

 sco_snp.15.desc:0 "Carl Zeiss AG. Founded in 1884, Germany. Optical firm, known for cameras, lenses, and various other optical instruments. Their regional headquarters in Edinburgh had been of recent interest to the Scottish Security Service. A visitor had been coming from and going to Germany a lot, specifically company headquarters in Oberkochen. This was not unheard of, but the short stays of the visitor aroused suspicions that they were sending something back to Germany.\n\nJohn McDermot remembered the briefing as he stood in the hallway, looking out for anyone who may stumble upon the operation that Henderson and Stuart were doing in the director's office. He was thankful they did not need to use force to get into the building, as the Scottish custodian was more than willing to help them out for a few pounds. Now, he would just keep a lookout for any early arrivals. Not that he expected any, the daily operations of the office were well documented and they wouldn't expect company for quite a while.\n\nJohn knew what Henderson and Stuart were doing in the office. He had been a part of operations like this plenty of times before. They would divide the room in two so no man would search the same thing twice. Then, they would go search everything. Every drawer, every book, every window, behind every painting, the panels on the walls, everything. No matter how innocent, search it, they were told, because a quick search is worse than no search at all. And they took great care to make it look like they were never there.\n\nAn hour and thirty five minutes after the search began, Henderson and Stuart walked out of the office. A quick shake of Stuart's head told the whole story. Nothing unusual was there. No evidence of corporate espionage. And the visitor, it turned out, was relaying company information to Edinburgh, and not from. It seemed that Carl Zeiss, at least, was playing fair."

The main chemical company in Europe, it had its hand in plastics, fuel, medicines, agricultural chemicals, film, and slave trading. And they were suspected of funnelling industrial secrets out of the free world to the slave. John McDermot's team was to make sure they hadn't stolen any from Scotland.\n\nAfter entering through a ventilation duct in the dead of night, the team had made their way to the head office for IG Farben's Scottish subsidiary. Stuart kept watch as John picked the lock on the door. He was having trouble, but he still kept calm as he worked the lock. A broken lock would surely alert the Germans that something had happened last night, he reminded himself. Finally, he heard the satisfying click and opened the door.\n\nPointing his light inside, the first thing that caught his attention was a paper package shaped like a bottle on the desk of the director. It appeared like it had been placed by a visitor in the time between the director leaving and the closing of operations. John motioned for Henderson to work on the other side of the room as he walked up and took the bottle out of the package.\n\nA bottle of red wine. American, from Napa Valley, California. Nothing too unusual about that, but the writing on the inside of the wrapping paper? The one that looked like notes on a chemical production process? That warranted further investigation. He called Henderson over, who took a look, and silently nodded, confirming John's analysis. But John had a suspicion there was more to the bottle.\n\nAs Henderson held a torch steady, John took a knife and worked his way around the edge of the label, peeling it back slightly. He only went a short way around it before finding microfilm. If the paper had the process, he thought, then this film must have the recipe. Then he popped open the cork, finding a vial full of a chemical that wasn't red wine attached to it.\n\nOne package, three pieces of evidence, and irrefutable proof of corporate espionage."

They were granted a visa so they could conduct market research and make contact with potential Scottish distributors. Duck's case wasn't unheard of, and they lost our attention for a good while. However, recent evidence has caused us to reevaluate Duck, and we have concluded that Duck is a possible agent working for the German Reich.\n\nDuck popped back up on our radar when they had purchased some ham radio equipment from a store in Glasgow. Local authorities were tipped off about the sale, and found it suspicious that Duck had not applied for a radio operator's license before the purchase of the equipment. It was then passed on to us, which led us to begin surveillance of Duck throughout their normal routine.\n\nDuck's career requires them to make constant trips around Scotland, one that Duck prefers to make by car. Duck's travels near several important military and civilian installations on these trips, such as ports and the defensive structures on the English border, allowing them ample opportunity to observe the happenings at these locations. We cannot discount the possibility that Duck is using their job as cover to gather information about these potential targets.\n\nThe evidence we have raises the possibility that Duck is either a Swiss national working as an unregistered agent for the German government, or a German who entered Scotland under false pretenses. They have been working in Scotland since that time to scout out possible targets, and have acquired radio equipment to ease the transmission of that information.\n\nOf course, none of this is definitive, and Duck could really be a Swiss national in Scotland for a legitimate purpose, entirely unrelated to the purchase of the equipment.

However, we now have reason to believe that he has begun to work as an informant for the English government.\n\nRecently, Plaza has made several visits to the English Embassy in Edinburgh. We cannot determine the nature of these visits, but they are out of character for Plaza, who has not made any previous visits to the embassy. More worrying is that he was reported to have been seen with a known employee of the embassy in a public setting.\n\nPlaza may be meeting with English Embassy staff for any number of reasons, most of which would not compromise the security of Scotland. But embassy staff are known to be an easy way to insert government intelligence agents into a foreign country where they can establish spy cells. This was a favorite tactic of the prewar MI6, and it's likely England has learned from their predicessor's playbook.\n\nWe have been looking for a possible motive to explain Plaza's possible disaffection towards Scotland. Plaza hasn't expressed any radical political positions at work. Their spouse is an English exile, and they could be an agent of the English government as well. However, the English government may be holding up an exit visa for one of the spouses relatives instead in an effort to coerce Plaza's cooperation. This would explain the embassy visits, and why Plaza's spouse has never been flagged as a spy.\n\nAt this point, we cannot recommend a course of action to take for this situation.

Reports from them make pointing out the exact political alignment of the group hard to pinpoint. Many are supporters of the English resistance group HMMLR, but there seems to be a deep divide between those who support the more left leaning elements and supporters of Claude Auchinleck and the right wing SAS. One member opined that the Collaborators had elements that could offer a favorable deal to both English and Scottish alike, but they were ostracised.\n\nMany of the Party members are English exiles, though there are some native Scottish residents as well. Many are members of the Union Party, though some are members of the ILP and are vocal that the UP supporters are idiotic in their support. Others have no affiliation other than to the Rangers Football Club, apparently.\n\nHow they plan to recreate the United Kingdom is also up for debate. One or two of the more radical members are vocal about taking over the government in a coup, but this is a small minority. The vast majority of the Young Britain Party believe protests and supporting Unionist candidates is the way to go, though the small size of the group makes any large scale disruptions unlikely. Some of the more elderly party members have suggested a sustained letter-writing campaign.\n\nConclusion: Despite the beliefs of some of its members, the Young Britain Party is too small and too paralyzed by political infighting to pose a threat to Scotland, and it's unlikely to pose one in the near future as long as it is home to the same group of misfits it currently has.."

All of this had climaxed at seven in the morning when the polls opened, and the people of Scotland were allowed to vote on the future of their nation.\n\nPolling places for the referendum were everywhere. Churches in remote villages, schools in small towns, libraries in the suburbs, and community centers in the big cities were ready to handle the massive amount of expected voters. And turnout was high, more than other elections. Lines for the polling places spilled out onto the sidewalks, and they only grew bigger as the day went on. Each of these individuals would be given a ballot, and asked one question; "should Scotland and England join together as a single country?"\n\nAt 10 PM, the polls shut. Only those who were already in line could be allowed to vote after that. Those who weren't in line were glued to their television sets, waiting for news. Some exit polls had come out, but nobody could know for sure how things were going to go.\n\nSlowly, the numbers came in. "Yes" took a lead in Orkney, while "no" outnumbered the opposition in North Lanarkshire. More votes came in, and people argued about what it could mean. But eventually, a clear picture started to appear.\n\nThe people of the Scottish Broadcasting Company could see this picture clearer than most. Their mathematical models computed the numbers, and began to suggest a trend, one that became more and more pronounced. Eventually, the head of the elections board had seen enough.

And finally, last night, the tale up there reached its climax, as the people of Scotland voted to sign a treaty of union with England.\n\nThis caused massive celebrations all over England. Traffic was blocked as the throngs of celebrants crowded up traffic. Crowds of people were seen throughout London, in front of Parliament, in front of Buckingham palace and No. 10 Downing Street. In front of the Scottish Embassy, huge numbers of English people celebrated and cheered the Scottish Ambassador when he came out to greet them.\n\nAlmost immediately, a certain worry about the future began to take hold in some quarters. What would this new United Kingdom look like? How much influence would either country have over the other? What if they couldn't come to an agreement about how this new nation should work? What would happen then?\n\nBut most didn't care. For a long time England had been working to recover from the oppression and barbarity of the Nazis. They had thrown the Germans off the island. They had built a new, more free government. And now they had healed a massive geographical scar left by the war.

We haven't had the most friendly relationship with England, it is true. And our nations have had extreme conflict in the past, and a highly contentious relationship in recent history. However, it would be foolish of us to forget that Union with England did, in fact, bring us some tangible benefits.\n\nUnion suddenly opened up administrative positions for Scots across the empire, as well as giving the Scottish economy a massive boost. Raw goods from the empire built up the industrial base in Glasgow and Edinburgh. And let's not forget that together we built one of the largest empires on earth. Our armed forces stopped Napoleon and Wilhelm from ever setting foot on our island. Sure, we couldn't stop the Germans, but England lost far more than we ever did, and their sacrifices tired the Germans just enough that they had no choice but to leave us alone as the last remnant of democracy on the isle.\n\nWe won't look at our history with rose-tinted glasses and say the English were entirely benevolent. But we will recognize that not everything they did was terrible for the people of Scotland. And we will understand that the people of Scotland would be fine with another union if had a few more rights than last time. In fact, such an arrangement might be preferable..."

The goal was to give our students a full and complete understanding of the threat that England has been towards the people of Scotland."\n\n"I don't think they'll get a full and complete understanding if it's so negative all the time. We can't have the good things that happened in England like the Magna Carta and the Glorious Revolution be swept under the rug. And you and I both know that the United Kingdom wasn't entirely doom and gloom for us, and it wasn't for all of the colonies. Hell, I took a peek at a textbook, and all I heard about Auchinleck was that he's a bootlicker who messed up Africa and the Home Guard before selling out to the huns. Our kids are reading that, and then they go outside and see him getting worshiped as much as Nelson or Francis fucking Drake!"\n\n"Hmm...now that you mention it, these standards do seem a little out of date."\n\n"You think? We're training our kids to be afraid of something our ancestors gave their lives to defend.

It would be the first time anyone outside the government knew that the ILP was going to do this.

Nothing has been written down and the English have not been informed as of yet, but the government is committed to making such a deal happen."\n\nThe exiles were astonished. "That's great news," said the leader of the Anglican Church in Scotland. "But why do you want to keep it a secret?"\n\n"The idea's more in the trial phase more than anything else," said Wolfe. "We haven't even contacted the English about it. We're just trying to start getting the idea out there to see if it gets pushback. If word came out we had a deal, it could be disastrous.

So what do you suggest we do about it? Regulate them more tightly?"\n\n"We tried that, but they know that nobody is going to build another rail system up here. And they are going to abuse that fact in every way they can. No, there is only one thing we can do about it, and that is to nationalize the line."\n\nWolfe thought that over for a second. "So it's the only major railway up here, there's an extremely high barrier to entry for competition, and it's a critical part of our economy. I think that's reason enough for us to do it.

The amount the government had put forward was far below the actual worth of the company, and made the takeover unlawful, according to Muir. He also said the takeover would doubtlessly lead to massive job losses, which would affect both urban cities and rural communities hard.\n\nGovernment lawyer Felix MacKie had a different view of the situation, however. In his argument for the defense, he said the Scottish Railway had engaged in price fixing, as well as anticompetitive behavior. The actions the company took made it necessary for the government to intervene for the good of the people, said MacKie. The defense also cast doubt on the effects of the takeover, arguing the company was rich enough to absorb the losses that would result from the lack of compensation.

It is a series of cases of people not having enough, with different causes and different levels of severity. It is also a case of some people having too much.\n\nIt may seem paradoxical, but extreme concentrated wealth is exacerbating the welfare situation in Scotland. The rich are holding onto far more than they can spend, and take much of what they earn out of economic circulation. They also spend more money on housing and real estate than poorer Scots, outpricing the needy out of the housing system.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the English Diaspora also make them more likely to be poor. Many of them had to leave whatever wealth they had when they fled to Scotland. When they came here, they also had few, if any, connections that would allow them to get work. A cold attitude by many Scots toward these refugees also hurts their prospects.\n\nMuch is made about poverty in the cities. Depressed slums and beggars are everywhere and easy to see if you go down the wrong street. But less noticeable, yet still bad, is the poverty in the more remote and rural areas of Scotland. These communities are often reliant on a single good or industry, and aren't diversified enough to handle a decrease in demand for that good. These communities, due to their size and remoteness, also lach the education and healthcare systems present in the big cities, further hurting them.\n\nWe can try to alleviate some of these problems. Increasing taxes on the rich will help curb inequality and give us more funds to work for the welfare of the people. Job and education programs targeting the English population specifically will help us with the disproportionate poverty they experience. And antipoverty education programs in the country will help the workers there develop necessary skills for a modern economy. This may not solve the problem entirely, but the important thing is that we're trying."

 sco_ilp.20.desc:0 "Scotland has always had a small english population. It's just that it was never capable of handling one as large or as desperate as the one that arrived during and after the war. Millions of English arrived up north, some of their own volition, but most without choice. What they had down south had been destroyed, and they were lucky to not be amongst it.\n\nTwenty years later, the English refugee is still far poorer than the average Scottish person. They live in worse housing, eat a worse diet, work worse jobs, and have a worse future than their neighbors. A lot of them are just above the poverty line, and a disproportionate number are below it. Even with the surge in emigration following HMMLR's victory down south, many still remain up north, determined to live in Scotland and continue the lives they have spent twenty years trying to rebuild.\n\nImproving this should be our top priority. The ILP has long believed that nobody should suffer from the ravages of capitalism, especially those that fled from fascism down south. We will give funds to businesses in the English areas, or those set up by the English, to encourage investment and job growth in their areas. We will give money to the English that lack work, so they will still be able to eat and care for their families. We will set up anti poverty programs in predominantly English communities, so they can get the skills that can make them attractive to employers.\n\nBy doing this, we will elevate the English community out of poverty, and be able to hold them up as an example of how, if we just decided to help each other out a little, we could improve everyone's life. Some may complain that the money would be better spent on those that have been Scottish from the beginning. We say how we treat the poor, no matter where they're from, says a lot more about Scotland."

We served the area under our jurisdiction for years with no complaints from the United Kingdom, or from the local governing bodies of England. However, when the war came, we complied with all the wartime rules and regulations on railroad service set up by the crown, which included moving our operations and most of our surviving rolling stock up to Scotland. When the war ended, our executives and most of our staff found ourselves on the other side of the wire, separated from our lines. With few other options, we decided to continue operations for Scotland under the banner 'Scottish Rail.'\n\n"Our competitors, the other three major railway companies, were less eager to help out the British, preferring to stay behind and get captured by the Nazis. They collaborated with them, taking our assets without payment, and operating them for the occupiers and the new regime. Even after you liberated England, they still refuse to hand over what is rightfully ours.\n\n"Quite honestly, negotiations have broken down, and we are now asking for legal assistance from the government.

Critical operations were moved to Edinburgh from London, as well as a large amount of critical executives and staff. A massive ammount of our rail stock was also moved away from the encroaching Nazi menace, so that it would continue serving the war effort, up until the last days of the war. However, the most valuable part of the LMS, the rail infrastructure, had to be left behind, and was thus taken by the Nazis.\n\n"Whatever you say about the case, there can be no doubt as to the patriotism and loyalty of the LMS. We can not say the same about the other three railway companies. They had stayed behind in London and allowed themselves to be overrun by the Axis. Worse, they made deals with the invaders to take our track and captured assets without payment to us. These companies shipped German soldiers to the Scottish border on our tracks and carried off the wealth of England back to Germany with our engines. On our tracks, these companies shipped dissidents to the concentration camps, moved forced laborers to the Nazi factories, and sent crammed boxcars of jews to their fate.\n\n"The legal question is about property, yes, it does seem that simple. But the real question is about our past, and how will we atone for it. The three companies in question stayed behind, and reaped the rewards from the Nazis, and then the collaborators, all while exploiting the misery of the English people.

But when the war ended, the rails they had were abandoned, and they changed their name to Scottish Railroad, apparently forgetting all about their assets to the south of the border.\n\n"At its peak, the LMS held over four thousand miles of track, a lot of which was in England, though some of it was seized in Northern Ireland and Wales. These tracks served much of the Western Midlands, and had a lot of communities relying on them. In the immediate aftermath of the war, it was clear that these lines would have to be serviced. And if we stayed away from them, the government would operate the lines themselves, and the collaborator government in competition with our private enterprises would be the worst case for us. So we made a judgement call, and paid a fair price for the license.\n\n"Now, if this new England is the legal successor to the old England, as well as the territorial one, this contract would still be valid under English law. The rights to the tracks were forfeited by the Scottish Railway, and they were purchased by the other railroad companies. It's as simple as that. If they could prove that we did not pay a fair price for them, they could be entitled to it, but we paid a fair price, so they are not.\n\n"So we see no reason why we should have to surrender the tracks that we have paid for. If this case goes through, it would set a terrifying precedent that every deal made by the previous government, no matter how mundane or harmless, is subject to dispute.

They argue that the seizing of their tracks in England was done unlawfully, and that if the defendents held onto the tracks, it would be "tantamount to punishing them for the Nazi invasion," in the words of their lawyer, Jan Grant.\n\nHowever, the lawyers for the other railroad companies have a different version of events. They contend that when the LMS moved into Scotland, they wrote off their rails in England by becoming Scottish Railways. They did not want the rails to remain unused as they are critical to several communities in the east of England, so they made a deal with the collaborator English government to operate them. "The Scottish Railway abandoned them, and we paid the government for their lease to use them," said Archibald Scott, a lawyer representing Southern Railway, one of the defendants.\n\nLegal experts are watching this case closely, as it is the first case where the new Supreme Court of England will rule on the rights of refugees to claim property seized by the axis during the collaborationist government.

 uob.1.t:0 "Capital Issues"
 uob.1.desc:0 "With the establishment of the Union of Britain, a nation of true equals rather than a puppet to the interests of the English like the old United Kingdom was, many questions have come up for how the Union is to be organized. A large portion of the Scottish representatives are in favour of Edinburgh being established as the new capital to harken a new era for all the oppressed peoples of the British Isles, and if Scotland happened to benefit it would merely be an added bonus.\n\nThe English participants in the talks are in favour of London remaining the capital of a united Britain, not for any benefit to the English of course, they insist it is merely a matter of continuity of government and fairly representing the largest city in the country. However, a third faction has emerged.\n\nComprised of a mix of all delegates, this new faction insists that Nottingham would be an ideal location for the new Union capital, as a midway point between Scotland and England it would be a compromise worth considering, but there is also the added bonus of a small and insular capital that would not hold too much influence at the expense of the rest of the country. In the end however, a choice must be made."
 uob.1.a:0 "Edinburgh will will do."
 uob.1.d:0 "London has always been at the centre of Britain and shall remain so."
 uob.1.c:0 "Nottingham has a rather charming appeal does it not?"

 uob.2.t:0 "The First of Many"
 uob.2.desc:0 "The Collaborationist forces are now dead and gone, Britain is now again whole, if perhaps a little less under the yoke of the English than they might like. But if Britain had one good legacy worth keeping it was the electoral system that it pioneered. And so like beetles from the woodwork political parties have emerged to contest these new elections.\n\nConservatism is an ideology looked at by many with suspicion due to first Tory and then Royal Party collaboration with the German occupier. But the actions of Claude Auchinleck have redeemed the idea in the minds of some, and out of the ashes of the UP and the right faction of HMMLR the New Conservative Party has emerged as one of the principle challengers in the Union elections.\n\nLeftism on the other hand distinguished itself fighting against the fascists from almost the beginning, but the fractured nature of the Left Resistance did not lead them to victory in the English Civil War, and in the aftermath of liberation the United Labour Party has come into being. A grand union of communists, socialists and social democrats of all sorts dedicated to progress and a free Britain.\n\nThe Liberals were a dying force in politics long before the Germans made a point of purging them out of the British political system where they could, and what has come to call itself the Liberal Party bears little connection to that which it was named after, being described by some as the English Branch of the SNP, though undeniably some English elements unsatisfied with the other options have hitched their horses to the Liberal Party train as well. But come one come all, the elections are set to begin and the competition shall be fierce. The Union of Britain shall decide its fate one way or another not by the sword, but by the ballot box."
 uob.2.a:0 "The winner is..."

 uob.3.t:0 "A Common Return"
 uob.3.desc:0 "Elizabeth of Windsor stepped off the Liverpool docks to a swell of cheering supporters, yet she did not return to the land of her birth as Queen or traitor, instead she returned as a simple citizen as per the arrangement with the government of the Union of Britain. A staunch opponent of the collaborationist government, much unlike her not overly lamented Uncle, The Union of Britain recognises her contributions to the freedom of the isles from Fascism and as such was willing to come to terms when she questioned whether the house of Windsor could reemerge from exile.\n\nThe House of Windsor shall retain the Windsor estate and some associated lands for the income and maintenance of said property, all other property and lands that were once attached to the crown would be confiscated in return for a pension to be paid to the house of Windsor. Citizen Elizabeth was reportedly reluctant to take the proffered deal and some elements of the government were reluctant to make it, but the threat of fascism and the scars left on England have overridden the concerns of both parties.\n\nIt is not completely over and done with of course, many English parties do seek the restoration of the monarchy as an institution whilst the more republican elements of the Union dislike the Windsors presence in Britain at all. But the peace is being kept, and should not the former royalty have as much opportunity to be citizens as all the rest?"
 uob.3.a:0 "Citizen or Queen, she is a woman to be respected."

 uob.4.t:0 "Hopefully the first of Many"
 uob.4.desc:0 "They called themselves the Free England, the England that would return hope and democracy to all the people of the isles. To all who would listen they proclaimed that never again would tyrants walk the streets of their cities, but where one tyrant had fallen another merely rose in place. They would have incorporated Scotland forcefully if they had their way, and in our victory we have had the opportunity to create a new and more equal Britain, rather than a series of puppets dancing on the strings of England.\n\nYet in the upcoming elections there is little unity to speak of. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party squabble over the mining towns, the English National Party skirts the lines of legality whilst campaigning in the cities. In this election there are but three real contenders. The New Conservatives, descendants of the right wing of the SNP aligned with moderate members of English establishment. The Independent Labour Party, absorbing the right flank of the socialists and what social democrats remain, and the Liberals, not the old Liberals of English fame but a coalition of the SNP core and the less objectionable English politicians.\n\nWhomst shall emerged victorious is unknown, but there can be only one, and the fate of the Union of Britain shall rest upon their shoulders. "
 uob.4.a:0 "The winner is..."
 uob.5.t:0 "Riots"
 uob.5.desc:0 "That an Englishman would ever look again at foreign boots marching through London, York and Manchester is not something many believed possible. Yet the eyes of millions do not deceive them and Scottish troops, for the uniforms of the Union of Britain have yet to be issued in great number, occupy all the major urban centres.\n\nMany perceived this as yet another invasion, the scots and germans being increasingly seen as similar unwanted occupiers, especially in the south near London. Riots have broken out in these regions, not usually the murderous variety but looting has been common along with the vandalism of scottish owned establishments. Some pro English figures have sought to take advantage of these outpourings of emotions but the security forces have been able to step in and detain the majority of those vultures. It looks to be an especially tumultuous time for the Union of Britain, but all great things must crawl before they learn to walk. And once something can walk running is but a few steps away. "
 uob.5.a:0 "Mayhaps this will not remain the case for long."
 uob.6.t:0 "More of the Same"
 uob.6.desc:0 "A match alone can only burn for a time before darkness plunges back to the fore. A match with some tinder to burn can light up the entire world for days upon end. In the case of the Union of Britain whilst the English are not what one might call tinder their anger burns bright just the same.\n\nScotland defeating their old overlords was not supposed to happen. Scotland pushing back into the English heartland was unfathomable to most, and Scotland establishing a new union in which England was not at the fore? To say the least the pride of many an Englishmen was tickled. Many citizens do not want England to be ruled by a foreign power, which Scotland is considered nowadays, and this latent anger combined with the perceived flaws inherent to the Union of Britain has caused the major cities to erupt in a conflagration of riots, vandalism and looting.\n\nThe response of the Union government is undoubtedly going to be to put down these riots, but some ask whether this makes them as bad as the old United Kingdom? Those involved can only pray that is not so."
 uob.6.a:0 "Hopefully things will calm down."
 uob.7.t:0 "Hung Parliament"
 uob.7.desc:0 "In a result that surprised relatively few of those connected with the political establishment, the result of the first parliamentary election for the Union of Britain was a hung parliament. Whilst one party did emerge, for lack of a better word, victorious in the elections, this did not extend to an outright majority. Thus in order to get anything passed through parliament there must, by necessity, be some degree of compromise. And in a political landscape as riven as that of the Union of Britain this has stoked some unfortunate tensions.\n\nCommunists and nationalists, Scots and Englishmen, indeed Scots and other Scots have all taken to blaming one another on some level for the dysfunction. In most areas this has resolved itself peaceably. But in some regions, especially in England, violence has erupted in the form of politically or nationalisticly motivated mobs taking on one another in the streets. Whilst all sides have taken to the old sport of ganging up on what fascists show their faces, this does represent a worrying token of what future the Union of Britain may have to look forward too."
 uob.7.a:0 "Damned British, they ruined Britain!"
 uob.8.t:0 "A Cruel Irony"
 uob.8.desc:0 "The English National Party are a quaint group, insistent on the right to English self-determination when asked publicly about their beliefs, and equally insistent that the proper place of Scotland is beneath the boot of England when talking privately. The party is not truly united by any ideology except nationalism and anti unionist sentiments, so it should come to no surprise that many have taken issue with the authority of the local law enforcement.\n\nClashes are uncommon but vicious, with the beat of truncheons and the yells of angry men echoing into the night like banshees, and in the English south especially mobs of the ENP have engaged police en mass. To little success of course, like every other fringe group they are simply not capable of forming a cohesive enough structure to effect real damage. All the same though, they represent a concerningly large number of the English populace."
 uob.8.a:0 "The English National Party are truly a tiresome group."
 uob.9.t:0 "Trouble at Home"
 uob.9.desc:0 "Scotland the brave is a rather nice tune, unfortunately it is also rather a bit too accurate for the liking of some as over the past weeks Scottish nationalists have been repeatedly protesting in the major cities. From Edinburgh to Inverness the more radical nationalists have been voicing their discontent at the reemergence of Britain, even if Scotland is thought by many to be the leading party.\n\nBut for all the vulgar showings there is a deep rooted fear even amongst many moderates that the whole business with the Union of Britain could backfire very badly if handled wrong. Questions are asked about whether the English were truly voluntary in entering the Union and certainly some question if the English want to stay.\n\nBut even as the flag of blue and white is waved in the streets the Union government is dismissive of these concerns, stating that the Union of Britain is the last and best hope for peace amongst the isles."
 uob.9.a:0 "Those Scots sure are a contentious people."
 uob.10.t:0 "Troubling Signs"
 uob.10.desc:0 "In a concerning discovery near Stratford upon Avon, a recently uninterred pit was found by the local constabulary by an old barn. Initially reported merely as a formality, the Union government took an interest when a former member of HMMLR, now bereft of a leg following the Civil War, revealed that the pit had been a weapons cache for the local militia, subsequently abandoned at the wars end.\n\nForgotten by most, but it would seem not forgotten by all. Forensic analysis has determined that the cache was only disturbed a week or so before being discovered, but that still leaves many places the diggers could have taken the weapons, especially if they used vehicles to do the moving. An alert is being posted to all nearby villages to be on the alert but the police are not hopeful about the likelihood of finding the cache now.\n\nThe former HMMLR member, when asked on what weapons the cache actually contained, was silent for a time before replying. 'Big ones' is not especially descriptive, but it is all we have to go on."
 uob.10.a:0 "We shall need constant vigilance for any signs of the weapons."
 uob.11.t:0 "Free at last"
 uob.11.desc:0 "The English Civil War was a disaster for the HMMLR organisation and its allies the Left Resistance, as despite a supremely valiant effort they were ultimately utterly defeated and most of their senior leadership killed, but many of the less important members of the rebel cause did not meet this fate.\n\nIn prisons and in work camps across England our soldiers have been able to liberate many thousands of former rebels from their collaborator overseers, and whilst many will have to be in recovery for some time from their ordeals, there are a great many more who wish to sign up for a new cause that believes in freedom for the Isles. The cause of the Union of Britain.\n\nFor the moment however this will have to wait some time whilst we organise the new military structures and fill in the ranks, but the HMMLR will certainly be reliable candidates when we need to look for recruits."
 uob.11.a:0 "Even in the darkest of days we yet find allies who will stand beside us."
 uob.12.t:0 "Good Signs"
 uob.12.desc:0 "Never would a Scotsman who grew up with the ever present threat south of the border think he would be welcomed into an English home like a returning hero, but increasingly events of the like are being reported throughout our garrisoning of the major English cities. The previous government it would seem was, perhaps not shockingly, hideously unpopular with the average Englishmen and the perceived return of not only a united isles but a democratic state of being to England has given us some good favour with the English everywhere. Even in London our troops have earnt themselves a begrudging respect from the citizenry as thanks for our liberation of their fair city, and the sight of highlanders once more patrolling buckingham palace is a refreshing call back to better times for many. But everywhere we are, even if not greeted with a smile at least with a respectful nod."
 uob.12.a:0 "Perhaps this little experiment will go well after all."
 uob.13.t:0 "We will remember them"
 uob.13.desc:0 "The collaborationist regime despite its viciousness and casual brutality was quite fond of keeping its parks open, and because of that the new Union government possessed the perfect site for a memorial. In Hyde Park now sit twenty great marble slabs, none taller than the other and all covered with names. The names of soldiers who fought for what they knew was right, the names of civilians who gave shelter to the HMMLR and Left Resistance partisans and paid the price, of men and women, communists and capitalists, Scots, Welsh and English alike, of martyrs to the cause of freedom.\n\nEach slab is covered from end to end, and the government has several additions ready as new names come in by the day. But surrounded by an honour guard, the people of Britain can look for the names of those they lost. Sons who never returned home, and fathers who took up arms to protect their children. Daughters who fought for what they believed in, and mothers who never gave up the struggle.\n\nThe opening ceremony is a somber one, but those who remain do not complain. For they stand as a testament to the sacrifice of those passed that their lives were given for something. And that it succeeded."
 uob.13.a:0 ""
 uob.14.t:0 "A Dissapointment"
 uob.14.desc:0 "The first elections of the Union of Britain have been, to say the least, a dissapointment. Despite the strenuous efforts of all the parties involved the results have left not clear victor and left the nation without a governing majority, though one of the participating parties has secured enough seats to become the main voice of this hung parliament.\n\nImportantly however, the general public appears to have taken this revelation with a surprisingly small amount of protest, though voices of disquiet to echo now and then. Most interviewed citizens seem more concerned that the political establishment may not be capable of compromising to govern effectively than they are concerned about the legitimacy of the elections themselves, suggesting that this new order may be close to cementing its roots in the public consciousness.\n\nOverall, the elections have come and gone with little enough fuss, the question is whether this will stay the case in the long term."
 uob.14.a:0 "Whilst not the best of results, it could be far worse."
 uob.15.t:0 "Out into the Light"
 uob.15.desc:0 "The once leader of the greatest revolt in the British Isles since the days of the first civil war, Claude Auchinleck was freed from his prison in the East Midlands today to great fanfare on part of the local, HMMLR supporting populace. Avoiding the fate of many other imprisoned HMMLR leaders by dint of the fact that his warden wanted to use him as a bargaining chip with the new Union government, for the first time in years the man seen by many as the living embodiment of the English spirit could feel the light on his face.\n\nSupported by his wife and walking on crutches to the podium, Auchinleck gave a statement to the assembled press, he mourned news of the passing of fellow fighters like Bill Alexander, he thanked the Scottish forces for securing his release and to the surprise of many gave his approval to the new Union of Britain. Auchinleck admitted that the United Kingdom of old which he had sought to restore was not without its faults, and that perhaps this new ideal of Britain could succeed where his own fight had failed.\n\nIn the days after the speech, Auchinleck gave another statement announcing his retirement from public life given the toll his years in prison had taken upon him. The Union government in turn made a small public notice that Auchinleck, like all members of the HMMLR and Left Resistance crippled in the fight against the collaborationists, would receive a government pension for the rest of his natural life."

 SCO.7011.t:0 "Off-Site Convention"
 SCO.7011.desc:0 "They're leaving again," said one agent to the other as he snapped a couple photos of the people leaving the headquarters of the Scottish Army and getting into the same car. The men they were trailing were Major-Generals in the Scottish Army, division level commanders just prominent enough to be of interest to the Scottish government.\n\n"I suppose they'll go to that place again," said the other agent. "Third time this week. I mean, it is suspicious enough that we would be assigned to trail them. What are they up to?"\n\n"They could be having lunch, I guess."\n\n"Or, they are actively conspiring against the government in a secret facility. They're leaving a building where they could be overheard. They are meeting up in an area they control. We don't know why they are meeting, or what they are discussing. We need to get more people on this, this could be a prelude to a coup."\n\n"It could be," said the other agent as he thought it over. "But they just as well could be getting lunch."
 SCO.7011.a:0 "But we won't trust that they are."
 SCO.70122.t:0 "Home Improvement"
 SCO.70122.desc:0 "The mansion in Edinburgh had always been concerned about crime in the area. Anyone could break in and steal property, or even worse, spy on the meetings that the owner was having with his fellow generals. Thus, the household was extremely diligent in keeping their alarm system up to date. So when several workers from the alarm company showed up to conduct maintenance, they were allowed in without any questions.\n\nThe workers went around the sides of the house, checking the windows and doorways. They checked the wiring of the burglar alarms, and made sure the systems were working well. Most of the system was in good working order, but some maintenance had to be done. Two window alarms were replaced, and a door alarm was upgraded. The workers were nice and professional, and the affair was over shortly.\n\nUnbeknownst to the homeowners, several other devices were left in the household. These devices would relay what went on inside the building to a nearby van. There, the government of Scotland would hear exactly what went on inside the home. In an ironic twist, the mansion's obsession with secrecy allowed the perfect opportunity to breach it."

We are pleased to say that it has. The bugs are working, undiscovered, and providing information.\n\nSo far, we have confirmed that the generals in question do have regular meetings inside the building. They talk about a wide variety of subjects at the moment, ranging from lunch to politics. We have successfully identified the generals by voice as well. We are able to get recordings of their conversations, and provide transcripts as well.\n\nIt will take a while to gather evidence for this case this way. It is best to wait and let any treachery reveal itself. We will record all of it, and pass on any notefull information from our investigation.

But it's not an official product, right?\n\nGeneral C: No, it is not.\n\nGeneral A: Those soda companies should put the flavor in the bottle before it leaves the factory. So at the store you could get Coke, or Cherry Coke, or Vanilla Coke. It would be a nice variety of choice.\n\nGeneral C: Perhaps.\n\n(Silence, with sounds of chewing.)\n\nGeneral B: That looks good.

They found these-" he put a small plastic sandwich bag with several devices on the table, "-and are trying to find more. The general has been moved to a separate location, while our men continue the search."\n\nThe Security Minister recognized the bugs instantly. He tried to play dumb. "That's a horrifying security breach! Who is behind it? The Germans? The English? Possibly even the Burgundians?"\n\n"We did some research of that ourselves," said General Miles, "and found these models of wiretapping devices are used by the Scotland Police."\n\nSilence.\n\n"Now, minister," said Wimberrley, leaning in, "just what the hell is the Scottish government trying to pull?"

 SCO.7016.desc:0 "Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, five generals leave their desks at 11:30 in the morning. They stop their work, put on their coats, inform their secretaries to hold their calls, and go downstairs. The five generals meet up in the lobby of army headquarters, then go to the parking lot. They crowd into a single car, and drive away.\n\nThe generals park in the driveway of a mansion in Edinburgh. They then go inside, with bags of food ordered from a restaurant they visited along the way. Inside, they hold a lunchtime meeting, which lasts an hour. The contents of the meeting are unknown, as is what they are discussing. Then, they go back to the car and drive back to work.\n\nThis has been going on for quite a while now. Initially, it seemed like it would set off alarm bells in the federal government. And it did, causing an investigation. But this investigation has stopped, for one reason or another. The government is now content to just let these meetings continue, with their knowledge of them. Maybe they think they know what's going on. Or they hope what's going on actually is."

 SCO.7017.desc:0 "Good news! The raid was a success! Edinburgh police raided the mansion this afternoon. There was a brief scuffle at the door, but all five of the generals have been detained at the site. No officers were injured, and plenty of evidence was recovered.\n\nIn the room they were eating lunch in, we caught them with documents related to a coup attempt. There was a manifesto written by one of the generals, as well as a list of grievances. Our investigators believe that had we not acted when we did, we would be dealing with a coup attempt against our government. The evidence is enough to have them charged and convicted.\n\nThe army is denying any involvement, but this is a huge loss of face for them. Wimberley is going to have to behave himself for a while. And any other extremist elements have been put on notice that we are watching and we will put them in jail. All in all, this outcome is the best we could have gotten. The generals go to jail, and Scotland remains a republic for another day."

 SCO.7018.t:0 "A Spirited Afternoon"
 SCO.7018.desc:0 "The five generals had collectively decided to order something new that day. One of the generals was excited that a restaurant in Edinburgh was serving an Italian dish called "pizza." This was available when he had been in New York, he said, and it was good. The generals didn't harbour any love for Italy, mainly stemming from the years some of them served in Africa, but they agreed to be open-minded, and purchased one. And they had to agree, it was tasty.\n\nOne of the generals then said he heard pizza was technically a pie. This started some discussion. Some said it could be a pie, due to its crust, assorted ingredients, and round shape. Others disagreed, saying there was only a small amount of filling, and it was more of a flatbread. But another said they heard of a pizza from chicago served with a large amount of filling. One officer, seeking compromise, proposed the pizza could be considered a savory torte instead. It soon became clear both sides were entrenched.\n\nSuddenly, the door was kicked open by a police officer who proclaimed they were all under arrest for treason like he found Guy Fawkes hiding behind a gunpowder barrel in the House of Commons basement. The protests of the generals were ignored as they were dragged out and occasionally hit by a batton. The police threw the generals into the back of a police van, and then searched the home for evidence of this non-existent treason.\n\nNeedless to say, the Army was tremendously displeased with this course of events."

 SCO.7019.desc:0 "There's a coffee shop opposite the army headquarters. We can put two officers there, and have them do paperwork while they watch. When the generals leave, they can let us know, and we can start the observation. They will not attract suspicion, as plenty of police officers use coffee shops for paperwork and a quick snack.\n\nWhen the suspects leave, we can put a regular police car behind them, with no signal on.

  sco_flavor.1.desc:0 "Alex rubbed his eyes, the salt stung more than usual. It was just another day when the catch was low. As he looked into the North Sea he frowned. The thriving industry had started to drop slowly in Scotland. The once large fleet had started to dwindle down slowly. The other fisherman remarked that the Germans and the Norwegians had overfished the North Sea causing it to decline. Some others blamed it on the overfishing of the current fish stocks.\n\nAs the boat motored into Aberdeen, he saw the much larger trawlers and even some factory ships leave port. He scoffed at the factory ship leaving. If there was anything that was killing the industry, it was those corporations and their ships he said to himself. They fish for days on and end and process the fish inside the ship. He shook his head and sailed into port. Once he arrived at his mooring, he called over a dockhand to help him unload the few crates he had full of fish. Today it was only him and his first mate, Tate. The dockhand looked like he had just woken up a few minutes ago and pulled down the winch for the crates of fish. Only three today, with the third being barely full. Not much cod in the waters of Scotland anymore. As the dockhand left, Alex and Tate began to clean the boat. It was hard, but rewarding to the two men.\n\nAs the boat was finally done an hour and a half after they came into port, they could finally collect their earnings and go home to sleep. Alex walked into the fishmongers office to collect his earning for the day. After getting his check, he shrugged and put it in his pocket. Once he was back by the boat, he split half of it with Tate. After the money had been split, the two men went their separate ways. Once thing that did stand out to Tate once he saw his cut was the amount of fish they hauled. Could the stocks be making a comeback?"

It was hole 18 during the final round and he was eight strokes away from winning against Bob Charles, the kiwi.\n\nThe two men had recently tied with each other in the last round. Arnold Palmer had recently finished in twenty-sixth, after being a heavy favorite due to him winning the past two tournaments. As Phil Rodgers walked to the ball, Bob Charles watched, hoping that he would win his first Scottish Open. As the crowd was quiet, Rodgers hit the ball with a nine iron, hoping to get it just a tad closer to the green. However he had hit it a bit too hard and it ended up landing in one of the many sand bunkers on St. Andrews. He walked over the Swilcan Bridge to his ball, once again the crowd was quiet. As he hit the ball once again, however this time it did go far. Rodgers bit his lip at this revelation while Charles clapped with the rest of the crowd watching with much interest.\n\nAfter twenty more minutes passed, it was apparent that Rodgers was going to go over par. He double-bogeyed in the end. Bob Charles smiled as it was announced he would win. He walked down the Swilken Bridge to thunderous applause and shook his opponents hand and to receive the trophy."

  sco_flavor.5.t:0 "Old Firm, New Troubles"
  sco_flavor.5.desc:0 "It is inevitable that two sports organizations in the same city will lead to a rivalry, especially for ones as accomplished as the Celtic and Rangers Football Clubs. Collectively known as the Old Firm, these two Glasgow teams are by far the most popular in the country, and the most successful with many Scottish Championships, Scottish Cups, and Scottish League Cups won between them. Of course, only one can claim to be the top team in Glasgow, so their matches against each other garner a considerable amount of interest.\n\nBut the rivalry is not as simple as mere geographic coincidence. A racial component is also at work in this competition. Celtic F.C. was founded in 1887 as a way to raise money for poor Irish Catholics in Glasgow, and always had a sizable support base from that bloc. Ulster Protestants who arrived in Glasgow to work on the shipyards in the early 1900's adopted the nearby Ranger team. This undercurrent only grew as outside events in Ireland drew a wedge between the groups. Everyone began to see the Rangers against the Celtics not as a game, but as a battle between competing religious, ideological, and racial identities.\n\nThe war only made the situation worse. Many English Protestants arrived in Glasgow, and identified with the team celebrated by the Unionists and the conservatives, who did battle against the hated Irish who stabbed them in the back during the war and joined the Axis. The Celtics supporters began to associate the other team with the right wingers in the Union Party, and too committed to a British identity to comfortably fit in an independent Scotland.\n\nThe teams have many fans, most of which refuse to engage in unsportsmanlike conduct. However, some do, and it overshadows the entire competition. Police have to keep the fans separate on the day of a Glasgow Derby, when the teams compete. Fighting between the two fan bases are common, with serious injuries and sometimes murders resulting. And most neighborhoods only support one side or the other. In many ways, Scotland's political and social issues have manifested themselves on the pitch, and the fans take these issues out of the stadium as well."

  sco_flavor.6.t:0 "What Do I Do..."
  sco_flavor.6.desc:0 "...if the Germans are invading?\n\nThe first rule in all this is preparedness. In the event of warfare, we expect an inevitable air raid against civilian targets and major cities. An alarm will sound if Luftwaffe planes are in the area. Upon hearing this alarm, immediately seek shelter. Most public places have a location marked for people to seek safety in the event of an air raid. You can also build a shelter at home, as discussed in the free booklet "Defense Tips for the Householder".\n\nIn the event of a nuclear attack, we may not always be able to guarantee warning, or that you will have time to seek protection. The first warning for this attack will be a flash of light. IMMEDIATELY, take cover behind a wall, duck down, and cover the back of your neck with your hand. Attempt to cover your face with paper or clothing, to protect against radiation. You will stay in this position, until a policeman or other authority informs you it is safe.\n\nBut the most important thing to do in the event of war is to STAY PUT. The goal of targeting civilians is to have them flee and clog the roads, slowing down our forces from reaching the front. This tactic was used by the Germans all across Europe. We must not fall for the same trick, if we wish to defend ourselves.\n\nAct like a soldier! Say "our lads will deal with them," not "I must get out of here." Do not panic, stay put. Fighting men must have clear roads. Don't clog them with your car or bike. Stay put, no matter if you are at home or at work. No matter what you hear, or what you see, YOU MUST STAY PUT."

  sco_flavor.7.desc:0 "The Scottish borders were well known to be a source of supply for HMMLR forces, and the terrain offered protection for many guerrilla organizations. Thus, it was important for the collaborationists to pacify it. The offensive in one area of the region forced the rebels to retreat and gather in an area where they would make a stand: around a crossing in the Scottish border.\n\nDay and night, artillery pounded the position, and machine gun fire permeated the air. But still, outnumbered and outgunned, the rebels refused to give up. This caught the attention of the Scottish soldiers on the other side of the fence, who dug trenches and watched the soldiers on the other side. Media began to gather on the Scottish side as well to record the situation.\n\nThe fighting got worse and worse. Occasionally, HMMLR rebels would hand off wounded comrades to Scottish troops to receive emergency medical treatment unavailable in their stronghold. These handoffs grew more and more common. Shells started landing closer to the border, setting fires in buildings near the border. A few landed on the other side of the fence, causing those in Scotland to take cover.\n\nFinally, the Scottish commander in charge of the border station had enough. He went over to the HMMLR headquarters and told them to stop fighting. There was no way they could break out, and it was almost a certainty they would be overrun eventually. They would be allowed to retreat into Scotland, and would certainly be treated well. Nobody would blame them, they had performed to the best of their ability in the face of insurmountable odds.\n\nThe rebels politely refused the offer. They were diverting enemy forces, they said. They still had the means to resist. And they need only hold on for a little more time before the collabs collapsed. The commander returned to the border understanding the sentiments, but amazed that a position cut off, surrounded, and without hope would continue to resist in spite of all logic."

All those Nazis are gone, those new folks care about the people in the country, and Scotland's no longer in a state of permanent war. But if there's one down side, it's that I keep getting asked 'so when are you leaving, Mr. Webb'?"\n\n"Everybody seems to expect, with a quiet joy, that every Anglo in Scotland is going to pack up their things and go back to England now that things are over. That we're going to go to a country burned to ash, with rubble in every street, and fascist hooligans running around in the gutters. They think everyone is just going to leave, and then they can have all their terrible jobs back, and Glasgow is going to turn into a paradise.\n\n"You know how much money I put into my mortgage? I saved for years to make the down payment on a four bedroom house in the suburbs. That's on top of the corner stop I was running before that. I spent all that money, and just when I'm finally able to get my head above water, every customer asks when I'm 'going back' as small talk.\n\n"What would moving do to my son? Scotland is all he's ever known. All his friends are there, in the school. Such a massive interruption would be terrible for him. Especially since he's doing well in his classes. The school tells me that. And then after that, they send me a pamphlet talking about how to transfer a child to the English school system!\n\n"This attitude makes me sick. Everyone wants me and my family out, and says that we have no excuse not to. But I'm staying. I'm not leaving. I'm going to outlast them all.

  sco_flavor.9.t:0 "Where One Least Suspects"
  sco_flavor.9.desc:0 "Scotland has never really been considered an ethnically diverse area, at least not for much of its history. Sure, there have been plenty of people from other areas of the British Isles, but not many from other areas. A few Eastern Europeans have recently settled here, though. The Nazi Empire is entirely reliant on slaves, and several relocated to England took advantage of the same opportunities afforded to other Anglos. But there is a significant and surprising ethnic group that exists within the Scottish borders.\n\nMany in the world believe Poland is a dead nation and culture, a statement which provides many with sadness and some a source of glee. However, one need only take a bus route in Glasgow or Edinburgh to find themselves surrounded by red and white, with signs in Polish script and kielbasa, pierogi, and bigos advertised in the windows of the restaurants. And one, upon seeing this, would probably ask "why?"\n\nThe answer lies in the Second World War. Many people end the history of Poland on October 6, 1939, when the last Polish position at Kock surrendered. However, Poland had never really stopped fighting. Many soldiers had used neutral countries to traverse to England, and so did a sizable number of civilians. Many of them ended up retreating into Scotland, and there were still a few Polish units on the border when the war ended.\n\nThe Poles in Scotland aren't nearly as significant or as large an ethnic group as the Anglos, numbering only in the tens of thousands. However, they are still there, and are just as proud and committed to keeping their new home free of German occupation. Some see the existence of their neighborhoods as a fluke of history. But many see it as proof that a proud people will find a way to survive and prosper in the face of determined genocidal opposition."

Whether they'd gone to church or not, they'd spend the afternoon and evening carousing at the festivals. Before independence, people had at least paid lip service to it as a religious holiday, but since the fall of the United Kingdom, Saint Andrew's Day had become little more than a day of nationalist chest-thumping - a day when the flag was more important than the religion the day was devoted to.\n\n"Pastor?" asked a small voice from one of the pews.\n\n"Ah, Miss Whitney," Renwick said with a smile, his eyes resting on a child who'd stayed behind.\n\n"Well, I was just wondering if ye'd be at th' festival?

Both had grown up hearing stories of the Loch Ness Monster, affectionately known as Nessie to the inhabitants of the many towns in the surrounding areas of the loch.\n\nHenry had been lying on the boat with his line in the water with his feet dangling over the edge when he had suddenly gotten a bite. He yelped and began reeling it in towards the boat. Unlike most of the other fish they had caught such as carp and pickerel, this thing had seemed to be putting up more of a fight. Andrew stood up on the wobbly craft attempting to get a better look.\n\n"Mate, what do you think it is?" yelled Andrew to Henry who had been battling with the line. The rod looked as if it would snap at any second as the bobber raced across the glassy loch.\n\n"Don't know, and it definitely ain't no pickerel!" replied Henry who had seemed to be putting all of his weight on the line.\n\nThe line then snapped and Henry fell backward, nearly throwing the two boys into the drink with whatever had attacked the line.

  sco_flavor.19.desc:0 "Parker was what felt like sweating bullets. Less than a day ago, Marshal Wimberley had overthrown the government citing dangerous forces had taken over the country. Later that day the army had arrived at the news station in Glasgow to give them a script detailing why they had overthrown the government as well as a set of parameters they needed to follow. Most of them had been basic ideas that a junta would set up "No German Influence" "You can only be live during these hours". Parker had read them and shrugged. Easy enough he thought, however as he read the list, the parameters had gotten more totalitarian and enclosing.\n\nAs the light that signified they had been live lit up, Parker began his opening statement, trembling in his speech, making sure he wouldn't anger the soldiers.\n\n"Good evening Scotland. As I'm sure many of you had heard, the former government had been overthrown by Marshal Wimberley. However citizens of Scotland. I would not be worried, the Marshal has promised he will be a fair leader of Scotland during these times. I can assure you he will, as he had come to our offices and had a peaceful discussion with us about this sudden change of power. While it may seem unlawful, the Marshal believes these actions had been just to protect Scottish sentiments and traditions. Evil forces had begun to influence the former government and change had to occur to protect the Scottish way of life that many of us live. While things may seem haywire at first, the Marshal has said things will return to normal as soon as possibly but it will take time to rid Scotland of its evil influences."\n\nIn Parker's head he was starting to crack. How much longer would he need to spout this propaganda promoting a coup? He thought the former government had been doing great. What had angered the military? It worried Parker. He had a feeling in his stomach that this could go south fast."

  sco_flavor.20.desc:0 "Parker Williams had just gotten his coffee and was walking back to his desk to examine the script that had been made earlier. While they did have a teleprompter, he preferred to also have a hard copy to get more familiar with the notes. As he looked out his window, he noticed a few fires in Upper Glasgow. Maybe some kids had lit fireworks and didn't pay attention? He shrugged and continued reading. Right before he was about to turn the page, he heard gunshots ring out and was startled, nearly hitting his mug onto his papers. He darted to his window and saw armed men dressed in all black enter the building complete with flak jackets.\n\nParker nearly fell over and ran through the office. People stared at him and soon swarmed to the window. He ran into the head producers office and told him about the men entering the building. The producer looked at him, asking if he was under the influence before hearing the door into the main studio break down and the armed men swarm into it, yelling at everyone to get down.\n\nParker sat to the side of the main set with his hands tied behind his back and sitting looking at the set. In the past thirty minutes he had learned that the UP had been infiltrated by what seemed to be members of David Stirling's rebels from England. Parker had heard of them, but had never seen them in person. Robert Mayne was the leader of the men and was present with this group. He had grabbed the nearest anchor he had and put them on the set with a hastily written script. The anchor had been nervous and on the verge of tears. Mayne grunted and told his men to grab another anchor from the fifteen people in the room. He grabbed Parker and told him to read. Parker nodded and started to read, all while holding in his fears."

It hadn't really stopped. This is just one of the ongoing consequences of it. People fleeing a regime set up by foreign enemies, only to find unfriendly and unforgiving lands waiting for them.\n\nThe ground here is just mulch. He's heard that some of the nicer camps have found roads to camp on, but most have simply set up their tents on whatever ground they could. He tries to keep the scowl off of his face - the smell is getting to him, and even though he hasn't really spent any time here the miserable condition of the camp is starting to turn his stomach. He looks around at the drawn, pale faces, some racked with coughs, others wiry from hunger, and thinks that these people hadn't known hardship before this. He looks into the shadowed eyes of the children, sunken into gaunt faces, and thinks that they never should.\n\nThe visit goes as well as it could. He shakes hands, hears thanks, smiles and moves on. On the way back home he can't shift the thick roiling in his gut, and when Arna asks what's wrong when he gets back home, he can't quite stop the quiver in his voice."

The yelling from the crowd was growing and growing, and the anger was building - soon enough, they'd have a riot on their hands. They were lucky enough to avoid a strike from this - Wolfe had to diffuse the situation before the workers' anger boiled over.\n\n"Brothers," he began, "I wish that I could save you from this. This shipyard was your life, and now that life is changing." The grumbling of the crowd grew. "But it is not the end. We will do everything in our power to ensure that you and your families will be unaffected by this. We will move on from this." The discontent began to quiet. "We must look on to tomorrow. Never forget, to our south an enemy lies in wait. They would crush our freedoms if given the chance - so, we must not, not ever, give them that chance." He could feel the mood of the crowd swing, and pressed on. "Today, this shipyard closes, but tomorrow, another opportunity will open. We have to come together, to stand strong against the menace at our borders, as true brothers and sisters of Scotland!"\n\nIt wasn't his best work, but the swell of cheers from the crowd allayed his concerns.

Not English, not British, not anything but simply, truly Scottish. His poems were on the spirit of Scotland, their heritage, their present, and their future, and so it was simple reclamation of their heritage for him to publish his latest anthology of works in Scots. And yet, printed on the front of the paper before him, drummed up outrage and slander.\n\n"Exclusionary Poetry!" "Wolfe Publishes Elitist Poems!" Spin, spin, and more spin. He wanted to yell at them that it was poetry, not a bloody policy statement!\n\nHe throws the paper onto the table with a huff and sips at his drink.

It's something he's believed for years, ever since the Pope rolled over and showed his belly to Mussolini, met and dined with Hitler, called Franco and Salazer saviors and not oppressors.\n\nThe Catholic Church has become something vile, corrupted and fetid. The Vatican is no city, nor a state, with a population less than most rural Scottish villages. It has no place in politics, let alone propping up and profiting from fascism and oppression across Europe.\n\nHe's can already hear the backlash to this one. It may even end his career. But he's right, and he'll speak, because if he doesn't then maybe no one else will. He'll speak, because right now, in Scotland, he has the loudest voice. Thousands upon thousands will be tuning in on their radio sets right now. Now's the time to make a difference.\n\nRed light. He's on the air. Deep breaths, William."

No dealing with whining ministers, no seething crowds from mine closures. The tour of the distillery goes well, and where he usually simply smiled and nodded, today he feels some genuine interest. They give him some whiskey to taste, and the workers of the distillery all gather around as well. The taste is brilliant, and his saying so brings a smile to all their faces. Their conversation lightens his heart.\n\nLater, he gives a speech by the entrance gates to a small crowd of reporters and visitors. It's the usual rubbish, but he adds some lines about heritage and Scottish identity as well. It's true, for once. He pulls the cord and the curtain falls away from the gates - Balvenie.

He adjourns the meeting quickly, the ministers filing out and muttering to each other.\n\nThe next few hours are utter chaos. Emergency meetings, intelligence dossiers, drafting troop movements. Part of him believes that this is not their fight, that Scotland has spent too long chained to England. To wade in now would be to entangle themselves in another war that isn't Scotland's. The other side of him sounds eerily like the Unionist ministers that he's been listening to all day. Abandoning the Resistance is supporting the fascists, they say. To ignore the suffering of the innocent is to aid in their oppression, he thinks.\n\nSomeone is still talking, but he's not really paying attention. He sits up straighter and steels himself. He has a duty, not just to Scotland, but to the victims of fascism. By the end of the day, the first shipments of arms will be prepared to be sent to the Resistance.

The children - no more than ten - are being incredibly well behaved, he thinks, even though he spies a pair at the back with pursed lips and barely concealed snickers. He asks if they're all enjoying their day to a chorus of 'Yes, Sir's. He's impressed when one particularly intrepid boy at the front quickly volunteers what they'd been learning. History, and the Battle of Bannockburn. He smiles at that. Good, proper Scottish education.\n\nThe rest of the visit goes just as smoothly, and when he leaves he can't help but feel somewhat proud.

He thought it was enough that the plaque bearing his name was also engraved with 'Father of the Nation,' an appellation that the man himself would have winced at.\n\nIt's not a particularly accurate representation, but it's good enough, he thinks. He's lost his paunch in the transition, and he can't ever remember him with such a peaceful smile, but it'll do. Besides, they didn't put the statue up for the man himself.

A break from the unending scheming of Edinburgh - and a rare one, at that.\n\nMcIntyre had to appreciate these small breaks. It was a rare day that the Government went without some disaster or another, so his holiday-taking had to be carefully managed and extremely infrequent. He takes in a lungful of chilly air and gazes over the hills. This kind of peace had to be treasured - it was in such short supply. He thinks about tomorrow, and the day after, and wonders whether or not his premiership will be remembered fondly. Perhaps. It's not in his control, however. He has to focus on the immediate problems, and come up with immediate solutions. He has to secure and protect Scotland's future. If he's successful, then the rest will slot into place.\n\nHe'll enjoy a day or two here, but then he has to return. He has a duty to perform, a Government to corral, and a future to defend."

Any foreign threat, either in Britain or from afar, will find themselves utterly outmatched." McIntyre's not entirely taken in by the hyperbole, but as he watches a group of recruits nail drill after drill, he can't help but find some part of him agreeing with Wimberly.

The moment he walks in he gets some sideways looks, but that's nothing unusual. Then, an old woman comes up and asks if he's Robert McIntyre. The moment he says yes, he's damn near swarmed with people wanting to shake his hand, telling him how proud they were to vote for him, how he's helped their sons or daughters. He can barely believe his ears and simply smiles back. When he goes to fish his wallet out to pay for the food, the server just shakes her head, clasps his hand, and says "No need to pay, Sir. You've done more for me than you can know."\n\nIt's the best damn fish and chips he's ever tasted, and he's almost skipping on the way back to the office.

"Esteemed Collegues, it's clear that we are divided along this house on the position of Britain." There's jeering. "But what is also clear is that this war our neighbour is embroiled in is one of righteousness. I understand that the English have often benefitted at the expense of the Scottish, but this is no excuse for complacency here. Were we, twenty years from now, to look back on this moment and realise that we could have aided in assuaging the suffering of our fellow man, aided in the downfall of a corrupt and malignant regime, and done nothing, we would rightfully feel ashamed." Their side of the house cheers, and McIntyre shifts in his seat. "This is not a matter of policy - this is a matter of morality. We must support the Resistance."\n\nThe house explodes with noise.

Clothes had been strung on ropes that stretched from tent to tent that had been assembled hastily by the Scottish Government. As Buchan walked through the dirt paths that had been turned to mud, she saw faces in the tents. Ones of children and their parents, hoping for a better tomorrow. Buchan walked to the central building that seemed to be erected fast with zero to none care about the weather. As she walked around it to examine it, she noticed the siding falling off and one of the gutters completely missing. She shook her head and opened the door, expecting to be face to face with the "mayor" of the camp. However when she entered, she frowned. There was no mayor to be seen at all, only the desk and some scattered papers. Her brow furrowed and she exited the building to be greeted by a small child with her parents walking past the central building. The child looked to be in high spirits, skipping ahead of her parents. The parents looked to be in a much worse place. The father looked as if he hadn't shaved in one or two weeks and the mother's hair was all over the place.\n\nBuchan walked to the couple and asked for their names before having a discussion.

It really just meant you took the salute while the troops marched past. Not exactly hard work in most cases, and Glasgow's parade wasn't unusual. Standing at attention for a while in the review stand wasn't entirely pleasant, but then you could sit back when the civilians would march past. And there would always be civilians. Scotland was a democracy, and they still wanted to honor civic institutions as well.\n\nThe units on parade today were a variety of local reserve units, some officer candidates, and the First Scottish Armour. Right now, the IFVs were passing the stand, their commanders standing up in the turrets saluting the review stand. Wimberley was happy to see a proper Scottish division of any type. This was not the army he had taken command of after the war. And this was a division with armour, one that showed the people of Scotland they were not without panzers of their own.\n\nWimberley had seen these IFVs before, many times actually. What was of greater interest was how the civilians reacted. Looking at the people on the other side of the street, he could see many of them were reacting positively. Little boys were excited and amazed. Women and girls applauded the soldiers as they came by, and so did the older men. The teenaged boys were imagining themselves as those commanders, surely. For a brief moment, Wimberley locked eyes with a man, before he quickly turned away. Wimberley thought nothing of it, as the scouting platoon was announced as next.\n\nUnbeknownst to Wimberly, the eye contact had put the man into a momentary panic, before he got hold of himself. He didn't know, the man reminded himself. It was a coincidence, surely. But just to be safe, he would move away from this spot. He shouldn't be compromised, he thought.

But sure enough, the letter from Edinburgh was telling him to do what he thought it was telling him to do. And that would pose a conundrum for the Field Marshal.\n\nOrdinarily, it wouldn't. The civilian government was really the one in charge here. They were the ones who were chosen by the people to represent them, not him. If the people wanted it, he would do it. He swore loyalty to the Scottish constitution, and the people elected by it. He wasn't supposed to question it, if that's what the government wanted. To do otherwise would be a challenge to the legitimacy of the civil government.\n\nAnd yet...he abhorred the order on its merits. North Sea patrols were critical to the defense of Scotland. Without them, U-boats would wreak havoc upon the shipping to North America that kept the nation supplied. Even worse, there was always the possibility that while the troops were busy in the south, Germany could land forces at Aberdeen and Moray, pulling a flank attack from the north.\n\nWimberley sighed, and put the memo inside his oak desk, right next to some memorada about fuel reserves. Admiral Anstice would not be notified of this order. North Sea patrolling was at a rate sufficient to protect shipping and the coastline, he decided. It needn't be curtailed. And it's not like the civilian government would notice their order had not been carried out. He closed the desk, and that was the end of the order.\n\nThat was the right move, Wimberley thought.

He moved on before stopping in front of another cadet. "You look familiar," he said. "Was your father in the Fifty-First?"\n\n"Yes he was, sir," said the cadet. "Captain Spencer McGregor of the First Battalion Gordon Highlanders. I was hoping to take his assignment one day."\n\n"If you're half as good as your old man, you won't have to worry about making Captain," assured Wimberley. He then kept inspecting the line, before stopping in front of another Cadet. "And what's your name, soldier?"\n\n"Mateo Beverbrooke, Field Marshal."\n\n"That's not a really Scottish name, isn't it? Are you a refugee?"\n\n"Not really sir. My family has lived in Dumfries as far back as we can trace it."\n\nWimberley smiled and kept up the inspection. These cadets would make fine officers, he could tell. And all of them would do what they must to defend the nation of Scotland."

He would be making this donation eventually, so he might as well do it now. And they needed these funds anyway.\n\nThe receiver of these funds would be the University of Dundee, a research university in the town of the same name. He had always had a sort of soft spot for the university, and was not unsympathetic to their desire to be independent of the University of St. Andrews. He had been trying to help them out from behind the scenes, but there was only so much he could do in his current position. Adopting a more subtle tactic was a better way to make the change. By funding the University, it could expand, and an expanded university could make a better case for being independent. Already, the plan was bearing results, and the university was gaining a greater degree of autonomy. There was talk about becoming an independent operation soon.\n\nWimberley briefly thought of what the money would be used for. The new engineering building, most likely. The civil and mechanical engineering departments were getting a new structure to hold classes and labs in. This money would help them build and outfit the facility. However, the building would not bear his name, he was certain. In fact, outside of a few people in the leadership, nobody would know where the donation had come from.\n\nThat was just as well. The last thing the school needed was controversy. And how would the socialists in the dorms respond to the possibility of attending classes in Wimberley Hall? Maybe not right now. But perhaps after he had gone out of the limelight would Dundee decide to reveal their mysterious benefactor."

  sco_flavor.41.desc:0 "Why was he losing sleep over this, thought Wimberley? This wasn't anything to be ashamed of, he thought. Everyone under him agreed it was the correct decision. And it was for the benefit of Scotland anyway. This is what needed to be done. And yet, he still doubted himself.\n\nOn one hand, what he mostly did was minor, and it would scarcely be noticed by anyone on the outside. But on the other, it was likely to raise concerns with the government. On one hand, these things had been agreed upon by the military as necessary and strategically important. On the other, it went against what the government thought was necessary and strategically important. On one hand, he believed these were the right things to do. But on the other, men of similar convictions and lesser offences had been jailed or expelled from the military.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the civilian government, he thought, it was the people of Scotland he was disobeying. They were the ones who decided what was enough overall, weren't they? And he was acting against their express wishes. What did that make him, the one betraying those he had sworn an oath to protect? Was there any difference between himself and-\n\n"Dear?" asked Elsye Wimberley, who was lying beside him.\n\n"Yes honey?"\n\n"This new Thai restaurant opened up downtown and I'm thinking we should try it tomorrow."\n\n"That sounds lovely. We really should."\n\nWhat did they eat in Thailand, anyway? Probably rice or noodles, much like the Chinese. Loaded with spices and special sauces, surely. And obviously there would be a variety of roasted meats. But would there be special foods or recipes one would only find in Siam? Wait, not Siam, Thailand. Or was it still Siam? Everything had changed to Thailand all of a sudden..."

  sco_flavor.42.t:0 "Shower Thoughts"
  sco_flavor.42.desc:0 "Douglas Wimberley was washing his hair one morning, when the question struck him; was any form of authoritarianism tolerated in a democracy? On the surface, the answer was no. But with more thinking, it became more complicated.\n\nBy its very design, Scotland was not a true democracy, the people didn't vote on every law that was proposed. Rather, it was a republic. The people delegated authority to a group of parliamentarians to make the decisions for them. And sometimes, the decisions were beyond the role of the leader, but excused by the circumstances surrounding it. A local governor might declare a state of emergency to get relief to their population, for example.\n\nThe leaders of the country were also not immune to overstepping their boundaries to get away with it. The supposed world's greatest democracy was a prime example. Jefferson overstepped his authority to buy Louisiana from Napoleon. Lincoln suspended the right of criminals to appear before a court and burned a sizable section of his own country. Those two were carved into the side of a mountain in South Dakota. Woodrow Wilson targeted leftists with the Espionage Act, and they still had a high opinion of him. Why? Because what they accomplished with that power was apparently worth the transaction.\n\nEven the one that started it all, Rome, had dipped it's toes into authoritarianism when there was no other choice. Everyone remembers Cincinatus, who willingly wielded absolute authority in war yet ceded it in peace. But what of the less noble example of Caesar? Or his descendents, Cromwell, Napoleon, or Hitler? They did not give up the power once they had seized it. But they never intended to. No threat was there requiring them to take power, and no circumstances needed them to maintain it. After emergencies in democratic societies, rights were restored, and people were allowed to continue as they had before.\n\nWimberley then came to the conclusion of his thought process. There was plenty of historical precedent for a temporary suspension of democracy. If Scotland required it, democracy should be halted for a time. Once the emergency had passed, power could be ceded back, and nobody would think any lesser of the leadership because of it. They might put them on the side of a mountain as well."

  sco_flavor.43.desc:0 "General Derek Lang hurriedly rushed into the office and closed the door. "We have a problem, sir," he said, out of breath.\n\nWimberley looked up from his paperwork. It wasn't like Lang to suddenly rush in. "What's going on?" he asked.\n\n"I just got word from the First Fusiliers," explained General Lang. "One of their men has been missing for a few hours now. Ordinarily, there would be no reason to raise alarms in headquarters, but this is different. They've raised the possibility of the involvement of German intelligence."\n\n"What evidence is there to make such a claim, Derek?"\n\n"Well, it makes sense, sir. The soldier was involved with communications. He's seen the defenses in the south of the country. And he was close to the English border. You have to admit, sir, that's awfully tempting for the Abwehr. He could have run across the border with a few documents, and some other interesting items."\n\nNow Wimberley understood. "Mother of God...what are we doing to respond to this?"\n\n"I'm having all the codes changed, for starters. And we're trying to see if anyone in his unit is also involved. But there's only so much we can do. We need to get the civil authorities on it, so they can start tracking any angles outside of the military."\n\n"Fair enough, Derek. You do what you have to, and I'll get the Prime Minister on the phone immediately.""

"Read this," he grumbled, handing the letter to Lang without looking at him.\n\nLang silently read the paper. "...And furthermore, your accusation of enemy involvement in this matter is without merit and entirely baseless..." He paused and looked up, surprised. "They're not going to investigate?"\n\n"They fucking aren't," confirmed Wimberley. "And it isn't much use appealing; I've already raised hell with the Prime Minister about it. You weren't the first person I called after receiving that."\n\n"Shit," said Lang. "And I thought they'd at least help us out on this."\n\n"Bloody useless bureaucrats," Wimberley said.\n\n"Well, we do have to contend with the fact we haven't been able to dig up much on the soldier on our own, sir."\n\n"And is that because the government isn't helping us, or is it because there really is nothing there?"\n\nLang couldn't answer. "We'll try to go as far as we can, sir. Maybe something interesting that would cause a reevaluation comes up."\n\nAnd maybe we'll convince the bastards to actually look at it, Wimberley doubted."

  sco_flavor.45.t:0 "Final Reflections"
  sco_flavor.45.desc:0 "Wimberley set down his pen and looked around his office. He would miss this place, he thought, the room from where he managed the Scottish Military since the formation of the country. The room where he kept the watch on the Tweed. And the room from where his successor would take his place. It was sad, but he was getting old, and he was just happy he could leave the Army after a long career, and on his own terms.\n\nHe wondered how everyone else would see his career. Surely, his place in the history of Scotland was secured. His deal with John MacCormick made the country, hadn't it? And after that, he had been the main figure in Sotlnad's Army for many years, organizing it, and keeping it ready to respond to a German incursion. And one could not discount his deeds before then in the World War. No, his position was secure, and nobody could bury it or wipe it away.\n\nBut would it be a flattering position? Wimberley was not a fool, not everything he did was popular, well received, or even legal in some cases. There was an entire segment of the political spectrum demanding more than his retirement. And they all regarded him as a paranoid madman who could have ended democracy if he felt like it. They hadn't seen what he had seen, there was no way for them to understand what he felt. Would that last after he had gone? Would the schoolbooks regard him as a danger to the public, propped up only by past deeds?\n\nIt was a terrifying thought, but Wimberley then considered another angle. He was not without his supporters, both in the Army and in the political sphere. Many in the military felt the same way that he did. And at the end of the day, he had achieved his goal of keeping Scotland free, atop his other achievements. He would be guaranteed a level of sympathy at least, and many would see him as a Scottish hero like those of the middle ages. Wimberley would have to be content with that.\n\nAnd he could still tell his side of the story anyway."

He couldn't remember when the King was a figure of national unity and not a symbol of oppression. He could barely even remember his home. Just a strange land that he and his family had fled from years ago for the safety of the free North.\n\nBut his parents could. He didn't know why they didn't understand. They tried to tell him to stay when the fighting started, but how could he? His home needed him. He had a duty, as his grandfather had before him, and his father before him. England had begun to throw off the yolk of the fascist oppressors, and he would rather be dead than abandon his duty.\n\nEven before he reached the border he could hear the ringing peals of gunfire further south. He'd didn't really have a plan past this point, but that didn't matter. By morning light he'd be neck deep in the battle for liberation, and his parents would find the letter on his pillow. He was going home."

  sco_flavor.47.desc:0 "Longtown is situated on the south side of the River Esk, in Northern Cumbria. It is a small town of 3,000 people. Nothing of much significance really happens in a rural town such as this. But a recent sporting event has drawn considerable interest in both Scotland and England.\n\nAfter the HMMLR victory in the English Civil War, many people have been interested in the normalization of relations with Scotland. Nowhere has this been more anticipated than in the border region. For the longest time, the line was widely considered to be the boundary between the free world and the slave. As such, it was heavily fortified, and home to many military drills. Now, the tension has stopped, and what soldiers there are on the border are in a more relaxed mood.\n\nOn the opposite border, the Scottish town of Gretna proposed a football match between their local team and Longtown in order to celebrate this relaxed atmosphere. Permission was granted by the English and Scottish governments, who felt the idea was sound. Today, a bus full of Scottish football players went over the River Sark, and into England, bringing a group of local fans in tow. A similar attendance in England made their way to the town park in Longtown to watch the match.\n\nThe game opened with a short ceremony where the mayors of Gretna and Longtown declared their hope that England and Scotland would be at peace forevermore, and that the bonds between the countries would heal and grow stronger. Unfortunately, that seemed to be the most interesting part of the match. The teams were made up of local amateurs, and it showed on the pitch. The game was eventually called with a score of 1-1. The teams then shook hands and left for home, with the possibility of a match to really determine the victor still up in the air."

  scoil.1.t:0 "Below the Seas"
  scoil.1.desc:0 "On the deck of the SV Kraken, Callum stared into the deep blue sea. He was one of the few engineers who had been sent to the North Sea to see if oil was truly located in it. Ever since their first trip, they had come up with traces, but no big wells. Their outlook was getting more and more grim as time went on, with little to look forward to besides steaming into port to see their families for a day or two before heading back out into the North Sea.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes from the sting of the salt water before walking into the main hull of the ship. While the vessel had been a former fishing boat used by one of the many seafood companies, they had since gone under due to declining stocks. The ship itself had been saved from the scrapyards by the Scottish Government, who bought it as a survey vessel. While the general goal of surveying remains the same, more specialized equipment had to be brought from the United States to Scotland to be put inside the ship. Most of the equipment took lots of modifications to be fit into the ship. As time went on, the budget of the survey program had gone up exponentially. Due to this, some cuts had to be made such as living quarters and the galley.\n\nAs he walked into the hull, he hoped that a pot of coffee was made. Instead, Scott had turned their small galley into a makeshift lab, complete with a screen. The other men had crowded around the small little table as they looked at the screen. While small and seeming to be useless, it could be the lynchpin that sets off the Scottish oil industry, something that the men could only dream of. Then Scott yelled, surprised at what had come out of the screen. It was hooked up to the gravimeter they had on the boat. He hit the screen, thinking it was a visual glitch. However the lines didn't go away. The other men soon realized the same thing. Oil was truly in the North Sea. Callum threw his hands in the air, amazed that something was found. Now, he thought, this trip was exciting."
