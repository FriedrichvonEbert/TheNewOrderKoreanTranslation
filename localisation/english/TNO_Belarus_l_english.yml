 POLITICS_RADASAU_ASTROUSKI_DESC:0 "어떤 이들은 급진적인 희망을 잃지 않기 위해 피와 땀과 눈물을 흘리며 이데올로기의 불길에 매달려 평생을 보내기도 합니다. 라다슬라우 아스트로우스키는 이런 이들에게 표시되지 않은 무덤을 가리킬 것입니다. 원래 물리학과 수학을 공부하던 아스트로우스키는 학교 시스템에서 많은 좌절을 겪었지만 정치위원이 되면서 보상받았고, 곧 제 1차 전-벨라루스 의회의 정치인이 되면서 벨라루스 독립이라는 야망의 불씨를 켰습니다.\n\n출세 후 아스트로우스키는 벨라루스의 독립을 위해 온갖 사람들과 함께 노력했습니다. 공산주의자들이 밀려들자 그들에게 호소했고, 심지어 폴란드인들 사이에 의견을 장려하기 위해 폴란드-벨라루스 학회를 설립하기도 했습니다. 전쟁 초기 나치가 왔을 때에도, 그는 소련과 폴란드처럼 그들과 함께 일하고 싸워야만 결국 성공이 있을 거라고 생각했습니다. 소련군이 무너지자 동방이 무너졌고, 민주주의 연합군이 주춤거리다 서방에서 후퇴하면서 라다슬라우 아스트로우스키의 계획은 성공했습니다. 그는 2차대전의 맹공을 견뎌냈습니다. 벨라루스의 땅에서 그는 독립에 대한 숨겨온 열망과 새롭고 빛나는 정부 자리를 가지고 있었습니다.\n\n하지만 나치 치하에서 통치자가 되는게 일을 쉽게 만들진 않았습니다. 나치의 승리 이후, 나치는 아스트로우스키와 그의 동포들에게 벨라루스 유대인을 학살하거나 나치 농장에 속박하기 위해 모든 주민집단을 추방하라는 요구를 했고, 아스트로우스키의 자유로운 벨라루스에 대한 꿈을 가증스럽게 만들었습니다. 하지만 아스트로우스키는 자유에 대한 꿈을 가지고있고, 또 다른 묘지를 만들 정열적인 혁명의 유혹에 굴복해서는 안 된다는 걸 이해합니다. 오히려 그는 세가지를 계속합니다. 그들과 함께 일하고, 함께 싸우고, 지평선 너머에서 성공을 찾는 것입니다."

 BLR_Bring_on_the_Youth_desc:0 "Now is the time of national liberation, and all must do their part to fight for Belarus. The men have been sent off to war, the women have been put to work in the fields and factories, but the children remain idle and useless. This must change if we wish to win this war.\n\nRecruitment drives, propaganda, and various other forms of encouragement will be used to motivate the youth to do their part for a free Belarus. Every honorable teen will join our ranks, and they will serve with pride in our divisions."
 BLR_This_is_Our_Land:0 "This is Our Land"
 BLR_This_is_Our_Land_desc:0 "The homeland of the Belarussian people has been occupied for centuries, traded between various empires like a pack of cigarretes. Conquerors have marched their armies through Belarus time and time again, as war after war has been fought through our hills and forests. However, while these empires may know our land, they do not understand it like we do.\n\nBy using our knowledge of the backpaths, the passes, and the secret trails built by years of partisan activity, we will fight for every inch of Belarus we can. Any enemy who dares trespass on our soil will be torn to shreds, never even seeing those who took their lives."
 BLR_For_Belarus:0 "벨라루스를 위해"
 BLR_For_Belarus_desc:0 "For centuries, the Belarussian people have been oppressed by numerous masters. Sometimes it was the Russians, sometimes the Poles, once even the French and the Swedes. Currently, our latest masters have been the Germans, who have been exceptionally brutal in their attempts to grind us into the dirt and wipe any mention of Belarus from history.\n\nNow, however, we find ourselves in a stellar position to win our freedom for the first time in centuries. Germany has fallen to pieces in its own desperate struggle, and Ostland collapses in a bloodbath even more chaotic than the one in Germany proper. In this time of crisis, Michal Vistuka has risen to lead us forward into a new dawn, one of prosperity and freedom for all Belorussians. Fight on, brothers, for a better future!"
 BLR_The_Black_Cat_Spirit:0 "The Black Cats"
 BLR_The_Black_Cat_Spirit_desc:0 "While the battle for Ostland may before the first trial of combat for many, it is certainly not the first fight that Michal Vituska has found himself in. When the Germans first entered Belarus, sweeping it out of the hands of the Bolsheviks, Vituska was trained to be the leader of an anti-bolshevik partisan group, the Black Cats. Ever since then, he and his organization have spent years patrolling through Ostland, fighting communists wherever they crop up.\n\nNow, the Black Cats' experience and training can be put to good use. Our new recruits will be trained in the ways of partisan warfare, just as Vituska was long ago. Soon, every solider will be an experience guerilla fighter, ready to destroy any enemies that dare challenge us."
 BLR_We_Are_Like_Vipers:0 "Like Vipers"
 BLR_We_Are_Like_Vipers_desc:0 "An army is only as good as its soldiers, and we must make sure our soldiers are the best in Ostland. While the German contenders have professionally trained troops at their disposal, and Kovner's band has decades of experience under its belt, our soldiers currently are what Vituska had at his disposal, along with numerous groups of lightly trained Belarussian citizens. Therefore, where we lack in training, we must make up in ferocity.\n\nEvery soldier, no, every citizen must know how to resist against any foreign occupier. Men will be trained in the art of hit-and-run tactics, women will be taught how to use weapons and stop invaders, and even children will be trained in various, low-level forms of warfare. Every citizen will fight as hard as they can against any enemy, draining their will to fight and strength to push onwards. If we cannot have the resources or experience of the other actions, our will and motivation will more than make up for it."
 BLR_For_Ostland:0 "오스틀란트를 위해"
 BLR_For_Ostland_desc:0 "Belarus is free, but the fight is not yet over. To our north, various factions still grapple over the fate of the Baltic States, wreaking havoc across the plains and rivers. Each of these factions has nothing but the worst in mind for their citizens, and we must step in to stop them.\n\nThese factions are traitors to Germany, or even outright enemies, and Vituska has stepped in to put an end to it. We shall call upon all true sons of the Reich to join our righteous cause of autonomy and freedom, and we shall crush those who still stand against us. All of Ostland will be in our hands!"

 BLR.1.desc:0 "Vituska pondered over the choices left open to him. And in his own mind, he still had his own thoughts haunting him as they stared at his face. As war claimed Ostland and sank its teeth into it, the man wanted to be careful.\n\nAnd he indeed was careful. He could go one way or the other. But after taking one way, there was no going back. One path could get him the support of the people of Belarus, and another could secure him superior weapons and more competent fighters.\n\nYet, to him, choosing now seemed difficult. If he sacrificed the choice of siding with the partisans, he could face greater trials in taking and holding on to the land. If he didn't, he could run the risk of facing defeat due to a lack of experience and an absence of firepower.\n\nYet, no matter how much he wanted an alternative to simply choosing one while forsaking the other, it was time to choose. There was no more time."

There are two ways we can take for the sake of our homeland.\n\nWe can look for our comrades among the freedom fighters. Or we can seek the aid of the Germans and the other collaborators.\n\nWe can only take one out of two of these paths. Once we take one, there is no going back for the other one."
