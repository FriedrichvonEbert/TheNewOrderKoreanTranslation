 PHI_Jose_Yulo:0 "호세 율로"
 POLITICS_JOSE_YULO_DESC:0 "Like most of the KALIBAPI's upper echelons, José Yulo Yulo has the peculiar distinction of having served under both the Commonwealth and the Republic. In his case, the bar topnotcher and lawyer by trade practiced a career of guiding Presidents Quezon and Laurel's legislative agendas through court since 1935. Such a distinguished career informed his decision to retire in 1959, after which he planned to resume his old profession as a corporate lawyer.\n\nSaid plans, like the rest of the Republic, were thrown awry when President Laurel died and the rebels declared all-out war later that November. Deadlock had consumed the National Assembly while cities fell and battle lines inched closer to Manila. After weeks of contention between the Greater East Asia Ministry and the KALIBAPI's predominant \"Laurelist\" faction, Yulo became seen as an acceptable compromise - and so he was hastily sworn on Christmas Eve as the Second Republic's second, if temporary, president.\n\nAlthough the rebels have been stymied since his ascendancy, President Yulo has a long way yet before he can declare \"mission accomplished\". Vast swaths of the country remain under rebel hands, and those the Republic does control fare little better. But the 14th Army will take care of it in due time; for now, Yulo has preoccupied himself with abolishing the late president's less popular policies until he inevitably steps down."
 PHI_National_Assembly:0 "국민의회"
 POLITICS_PHI_NATIONAL_ASSEMBLY_DESC:0 "Article III of the post-war Constitution of 1947 established that the Republic of the Philippines is a democratic republic governed by a unicameral legislature known as the National Assembly. Every four years citizens from 46 provinces and 8 chartered cities elect two assemblymen registered with the Kapinsan ng Bagong Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas (KALIBAPI), the country's sole legal party. The Constitution further granted the 108-man Assembly the power to appoint a President among their ranks, who will serve until either recalled by a no-confidence vote or deceased.\n\nSpeaker Benigno S. Aquino hence presided over an extraordinary session of the National Assembly following President Yulo's untimely assassination. As constabularies searched high and low for his killer, assemblymen convened within Session Hall to choose his replacement. Hopes for a speedy resolution were dashed by the Constitution itself; while it delegated appointment to the Assembly, none of its articles prescribed any schedule or procedure thereof. And with the specter of insurrection having fled seemingly for good, the old fissures it had suppressed resurfaced as negotiations stumbled along listlessly.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that KALIBAPI unraveled like a ball of yarn not one week after bullet holes riddled Yulo's corpse. Fists were raised and insults flung as factions settled old scores: Laurelists and reformists, reformists and securocrats, patriots and traitors, Filipinos and foreigners, men of one label and men of another. Government has effectively halted with its members so preoccupied, and inside sources say they might remain so for the rest of the year."
 PHI_Quentin_Paredes:0 "퀸틴 파레데스"
 POLITICS_QUENTIN_PAREDES_DESC:0 "Caution and initiative are the two backbones of national politics, and balancing both is a game Quintin Paredes has shown himself as an adept time and again. Consider his tenure as Minister of Public Works and Communications, in particular his role in creating President Laurel's ambitious National Development Plans. Despite budget hawks on one hand and grifters on the other, industrialization continued apace with the right people appeased - and with a shoestring budget at that.\n\nParedes' achievements and political acumen made him a kingmaker within the KALIBAPI, a position he first truly wielded during like-minded President Yulo's appointment. The proverbial king's inadvertent death suddenly cast his reforms' lastingness in doubt, with the likes of the firebrand Recto and despot Osmeña aiming for his seat. Their candidacies dispersed all reservations the former Speaker had harbored.\n\nSeveral favors and one landslide later, and Quintin Paredes now presides over his predecessor's oathsworn duties. The arduous task of rebuilding, healing and reuniting the country falls to the \"industry shogun\" and his close advisors. Perhaps an old, capable hand like his will guide the Republic through the night before dawn."
 PHI_Claro_Recto:0 "클라로 M. 렉토"
 POLITICS_CLARO_M_RECTO_DESC:0 "Lawyer, poet, and nationalist firebrand - Claro Mayo Recto, Jr. is many things, but most of all he is more alike to José Rizal than his detractors claim. Like Rizal he possesses a keen mind and mastery of logic, which served him well in the courts and the Assembly. Like Rizal he writes eloquently on love of country. And like Rizal he harnessed both tendencies towards opposing the imperialists who had plundered his country. The results speak louder than those who question his sincerity: a free Philippines, aided in no small part by his decades-long tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nTherein lies the contradiction beneath the \"Great Academician\". For a nationalist and former Senate Minority Leader under the Commonwealth - and is that not an indictment in itself? - he seemed far too eager to trade one overlord for another. The man agrees in part. Make no mistake: the Japanese Empire is no different from the Americans they replaced, whether in their seductive rhetoric or in their rapacious, self-serving intent. In his quieter moments Recto wondered if freedom was worth abetting the many, many crimes the 14th Army had committed against his people.\n\nIn the end, Recto concluded that nothing else mattered more than his motherland's freedom. No mean is too distasteful for such an end. Hence he shackled himself first to the Quezon government, who promised freedom in ten years; then to the Greater East Asia Ministry, who promised freedom forthwith. He shackled himself a third time to the Laurelist sycophants with the Presidency in sight, and in doing so the Assembly appointed him the Philippines' second most powerful man next to the General of the 14th Army. For the first time in his storied career, Recto the idealist has superseded Recto the pragmatist.\n\nModernization, centralization, and true independence - beloved Pilipinas will have them all, he swears, lest he had compromised on his principles in vain."
 PHI_Sergio_Osmena_Jr:0 "세르지오 오스메냐 주니어"
 POLITICS_SERGIO_OSMENA_JR:0 "Sergio Veloso Osmeña, Jr. is a businessman by trade rather than a politician. He speaks a language disdained by the Tagalogs of Manila. His ideas deviate more from KALIBAPI orthodoxy than the most principled reformist's. His family had left for America with President Quezon and never looked back. He has few friends in a city where connections decide how far up a man can get; indeed, his fellow KALIBAPI claim he wouldn't be one if President Laurel weren't so hard-pressed for Cebuano assemblymen. Not for nothing, then, do the Manila press corps call Osmeña the \"black sheep of Philippine politics\".\n\nNevertheless, \"Serging\" is an Osmeña and a businessman before he is a wayward lamb. An Osmeña makes do with what he alone has; a businessman pounces on every opportunity he finds. When the 14th Army sought contractors for its supplies he became that. When assemblymen sought donors for their campaigns he became that too. His machinations eventually earned him an advisor's seat in the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and from there he and his newfound industrialist friends grew inseperable. No jealous rival could prevent him henceforth from becoming the party's chief financier. Soon enough, no one at all could prevent him from becoming President.\n\nOsmeña enters Malacañan buoyed by the alienated, whether it is the businessmen who chafe at the government's overbearing reach, the loyal dissidents unwelcome in the KALIBAPI, or the Bisaya endangered by Tagalog assimilationism. Which voices his administration shall project remain known only to himself. Amid the tumult the new President leaves behind his wake arises only one certainty: the businessman at heart knew business all his life, and he will run the country like one until he no longer can."
 POLITICS_DWIGHT_EDWARD_BEACH_DESC:0 "Prior to the Philippine Conflict, the most service in the Pacific Dwight Edward Beach could claim was Guadalcanal and New Guinea, as a field artillery officer. He had no history in the region otherwise: no investment in any one of its long, grueling wars, no connections with the natives to draw from, nor the magnetic charisma holding insurgencies together like glue. A MacArthur, Wainwright, or a Fertig he is most decidedly not. Nevertheless, the Pentagon chose this Army man as the fourth Commander of the United States Army in the Philippines.\n\nWhat the 45th Infantry Division's general did have, however, is more firepower than any of his predecessors ever had. The increasingly desperate Joint Chiefs of Staff approved limited escalation before the decapitated USFIP bore the brunt of Japan's reprisal; in other words, they handed Beach a blank check for equipment heavier and more blatantly American than the \"deniable assets\" already in theater. M55's, ATGM's, Pattons, honest-to-goodness Skyraiders - he names it, he gets it.\n\nBeach may be no MacArthur, come to return with his corn cob pipe, aviator shades, and the full might of the US Army. He may be no Fertig, so trusted by his men that they would follow him to the ninth circle of Hell. Then again, the actual MacArthur's an invalid in a military hospital. The actual Fertig's six feet under. What good would aping those failures do him now?"
 UPH_Carlos_Romulo: "카를로스 페냐 로물로"
 POLITICS_CARLOS_ROMULO_DESC:0 "Made to choose between two masters, men would inevitably hold to one and despise the other. Carlos Peña Romulo disagrees; after all, his two masters are one and the same. This was the epiphany he reckoned with as General MacArthur's personal aide, and it had only evolved during his exile. For he found in lively, orderly San Francisco not just a second home, but an example his first home should emulate.\n\nNot that it could have after the Akagi Accords ended the Commonwealth. To his credit, Romulo counted among a handful of its officials who remained publicly active thereafter. The former Resident Commissioner of the Philippines offered his expertise to the State Department's Division of Far Eastern Affairs in late 1945, who hired him as an advisor. Since then the accomplished journalist had used his position primarily to garner support for the liberation of his old patrimony: an ambition which even he would admit was a fantasy by the turn of the 60's, as his influence waned and as the Manila government trundled onwards. After decades of fruitless service, the old warhound was ready to retire.\n\nFour years later, the Filipino people elected Romulo as their first legitimate President in more than twenty. How things change so radically in so short a time. Some things never do of course - in Romulo's case, his unwavering belief that the Filipino and the American, the two masters whom he had long served, are brothers across an ocean. With a nation's resources on his fingertips, Romulo now commits himself to applying that belief until the Philippines is every bit as prosperous and alike as its sibling.\n\nYet one can only wonder: if Romulo is building a new America in the Pacific, then does he truly love his two masters... or does he despise his first for falling so short of his second?"
 UPH_Carlos_Garcia: "카를로스 폴리스티코 가르시아"
 POLITICS_CARLOS_GARCIA:0 "Carlos Polistico Garcia hails from the humble, nascent nucleus of a political family in the Visayan island of Bohol. Having served four terms as town mayor, Garcia's father taught his young son the tools of his trade all throughout. Said teachings would inform the lawyer's decision to pursue an elected seat, first as representative of the Third District of Bohol in 1925 and '28, and then as the island's governor in '33. Eight more years of quiet, efficient governance would pass before Garcia entered national politics, this time as a senator registered with President Quezon's own Nacionalista Party.\n\nJapan's invasion prevented the rising star from assuming his senatorial term. Instead Garcia left Manila for his home island, whereupon he served in its anti-Japanese civilian government organized following the proclamation of the Laurel regime. He was much more reluctant in ceding authority to General Fertig; only after sufficient concessions were negotiated, among them his province's autonomy, did Garcia accept Tacloban's suzerainty. What began then was a professional relationship, if at times adversarial and fraught with haggling, between the Philippine Department and the man who would eventually become its highest-ranking civilian official and quartermaster.\n\nGarcia's credentials and experience, with encouragement from his friends and fellow public servants, helped him lead the reconstituted Nacionalistas to a comfortable victory in the post-war elections. Although burdens heavier than armies now rest atop his back - empowering the Filipino, not the Tagalog or the Bisaya or others; quashing the Communist plague; rebuilding wartorn cities and desolate countrysides - the future still seems bright for the twice-representative, governor, senator, and finally President of the Republic he has served for over half his life."
 SPH_Lorenzo_Tanada: "로렌소 타냐다"
 POLITICS_LORENZO_MARTINEZ_TANADA_DESC:0 "No matter how his story will unfold from here on, Lorenzo Martinez Tañada will forever be remembered as the one man who openly defied the Laurel regime and lived. Head of the Civil Liberties Union of the Philippines, the lawyer-activist's crusade for the Filipino's freedoms continued into the Occupation, earning him the Kempeitai's ire and charges of sedition. To their surprise he successfully appealed his case before the Supreme Court; in a rare act of clemency, and despite considerable pressure from Japan, then-Chief Justice José Yulo personally acquitted Tañada of his charges.\n\nThose who had hoped the experience would cow Tañada into irrelevance would be proven wrong in the 1949 elections, when he would set yet another precedent by winning one of Manila's two assemblyman seats despite owing no allegiance to the KALIBAPI. The Assembly's sole independent then used his seat as a pulpit for speeches decrying the Laurel government, and as a conscience vote for the reformists' occasional good bill. This quid-pro-quo lasted a decade before Tañada alienated his on-and-off allies by denouncing Yulo's \"illegitimate inauguration\" in 1959. Sensing opportunity, the Kempeitai drew their knives anew and acted - and if the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive had struck any later, then perhaps Tañada today would be sleeping in a cell in Syonan-to, rather than in Malacañan Palace.\n\nAs it is, the Coalition found the ideal compromise candidate: principled, universally beloved, but unaffiliated with either half. \"Ka Tanoy\", for his part, has plans beyond mediating between the militarists and the Communists. He envisions nothing short of a grand revival for the country he loves so dear. The schemes of men seem paltry before such a vision - but if he must walk their tightropes a fourth time to bring it about, then walk again he shall."

As fate would have it, the mechanic would come to her aid decades later as a beloved general, against a threat far more insidious than even the 14th Army itself - but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nRamon del Fierro Magsaysay, Sr. fixed trucks in the Army long before he earned his stars. When Bataan fell, he escaped and formed a guerrilla band in his home province. The newly-minted captain's first campaign lasted until the Akagi Accords; like most resistance groups, Magsaysay began his second after the massacre at Kawit. He ruled Zambales from its hills until the 14th Army proved too much to bear. Faced with either retirement in seclusion or cooperation with José Lava's communists, Magsaysay chose the former. It would last until 1959, when Russell Volckmann, his old superior and friend, convinced him to participate in the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive as a fellow general. He found some accommodation with the communists when Taruc took over, who agreed to a desperate truce as he retreated.\n\nThe preemptive strike he had planned after the liberation of Manila would be precluded by none other than General Fertig himself - and so the fervent anticommunist watched, unable to act, while communists sabotaged the post-war government the Old Man had given them. As they too proved too much to bear, so too did he and his men retire a second time. Chaos reigned thereafter; disgraced, Tañada offered Magsaysay the country to save it.\n\nNow \"Monching\" sits atop the short-lived Coalition's corpse, inheriting from it a war-torn land blooming with the red cancer. It won't be long, he swears, before it is excised in full - and from there shall arise a nation reborn, a people enriched, and a land forever unsullied by false prophets' taint."

As He would have it, Takayama Shinobu departed Tokyo for a reunion with the land of the dead.\n\nFor the Philippine Islands now, as it had then, offers nothing but death. This lesson he'd learned as a lowly colonel under General Masaharu Homma. He'd seen better men than he succumb to its jungles and the bandits within. Heard their pitiful wails in the hospitals and the medical tents, teenagers-turned-conscripts begging for aspirin, their parents, a quick and painless death. Held their coffins before planes carried what remained of them home. No glory awaited the Empire's sons here, and such a place was worth only purgation, through and uncompromising, lest any more of them fell.\n\nIf only its generals learned the very same, rather than vaciliating between half measures for decades. Then the 14th Army wouldn't have died far away from home. Its commander, Masazumi Inada, wouldn't have gutted himself in shame.

Thus, the experienced hand eased its successor into the convoluted web of friends, allies, and acquaintances taking \"ignorable\" slices of the Republic's wealth.\n\nMuch to the detriment of the bureaucrats whose funds buttress the country's growth, or the conscripts bereft with proper housing and equipment. Then again, did it really need the money? Anything more than a skeleton force? Not in the last decade, so surely neither in the next.\n\nThen came 1963, when it suddenly did. Yasuda's collapse upended the status quo, as the Philippine economy nosedived after Tokyo stopped writing its checks. The Blitz crippled its system through its flaws, as ill-equipped conscripts died helplessly before the rebel hordes. The Manila Incident ended the system, and much of its participants, for good. Now the capital's skyline glows cherry-red with fire; meanwhile, Tokyo has entrusted Inada to quell it.

Or is it something as mundane as chance - being in the right place, with the right deals, at the right time? Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos' experience suggests a pinch of everything... but mostly the last three.\n\nFor the Marcoses were the kingpins of Ilocos when Japan struck its blow. Rather than reach out to the southern resistance groups after the Kawit Incident, then-Major Marcos withdrew with his father Mariano to their home province, fending off government forces with a sizable private army. The Marcoses' insulation from Tacloban placed them closer to the AFRSR than most nominally-USFIP formations: a fact which the elder Marcos dealt with force of arms. Free to deal as he sees fit after his father's death, \"Ferdie\" instead found his enemy's enemy in Luis Taruc. So began a bargain that held even after Marcos' compatriots further south died beneath the red onslaught.\n\nSaid bargain ended the moment Taruc became king of the Philippines' ashes. With the victory-drunk reds purging the landlords in their closet, Marcos rallied everyone right of the Huks - former USFIP, former KALIBAPI, the lone Japanese expat - and struck out of self-preservation. One firefight later, Marcos proclaimed himself President while Taruc's bullet-riddled corpse cooled beneath his feet.\n\nThe thrice-right man has won the musical chairs for a land that has seen more war in ten years than it had in a hundred.

The firebrand general's word now carried even more weight after the Party's fighting retreat, and he leveraged his magnified standing by launching a scathing critique of their then-General Secretary José Lava. Had Lava not held his men back so many times, he accused, then perhaps the fascists wouldn't have compelled them to cower in the Cordilleras. Lava's dogmatism and caution have cost the Revolution far too much to overlook; perhaps now they should correct course before their chance is lost forever.\n\nWith desperate, frenzied applause it was decided: Lava shall go, and Taruc shall take his place.

For a time it lived to its ideals; liberated farmlands were parceled to its tenants, villages were freed of onerous taxes, mouths were fed three meals a day and hands were paid their labors' worth. It seemed as if socialism at its most idyllic found purchase in the land of the landless.\n\nThen came the Offensive of 1959. Whatever the cause, victory came not for the Revolution but for the fascist. Heavily wounded, it was salvaged only by the Huks' heroics and an arduous march to the base areas of the Cordillera Mountains, where partymen hoped to bide their time for another strike.

For the United States it signaled the steady return to the bad ol' days of the Depression, brought about by its first humiliating defeat since 1812. The unbridled optimism and invincible aura which had carried her people through civil war and penniless peace alike went alight with Pearl Harbor, seemingly for good. And while America grieved for her losses, their murderers in Tokyo gloated of a new order built atop their carcass. What else can a mother bereaved do but grin and nod until the desecrators bade their leave?\n\nSo went the same for her dominion across the seas. The Rising Sun was swift and thorough with its blows, and by war's end had claimed the Philippine archipelago in its entirety like one pile of ill-gotten spoils among so many. A people promised freedom in ten years' time greeted the eleventh under another empire's jackboot. Resigned to another century of servitude, much of the old Commonwealth had laid down their arms and asked for clemency in the days following Akagi.\n\nSome, however, fled to the jungles north and south of sprawling Manila, where the foliage proved too thick for both the Laurelists' hawkish gaze and Tokyo's piercing rays alike. Here flourish a resistance defiant and convinced that good endings await their side of an unsung war. For the Filipinos await their freedom, fought and earned by their own two hands; for the Americans left behind, a ticket home. Two kinds of men, their differences stark as night and day, yet both pine all the same for something dear but not quite near. Not yet... or if fate is unkind, forever not.\n\nWhose story shall we follow?"

Lesser nations may scoff at such a boast, yet had we not made conquests of every realm our brave warriors had trodden since? Had we not leapt from victory to victory, at times against overwhelming odds? And had we not ended war itself with light so radiant it scorched men with a single touch, made permanent their shadows on the ground beneath their feet? The rich swathes of land we have claimed, the many new peoples under our aegis, and the bloody due we had dealt for both -- far from idle boasting, they were facts the sons of Emperor Jimmu had welcomed with utter aplomb.\n\nAlas, even victories so overwhelming are ephemeral. Much like the solstice, our sun had inched downwards with every day that followed. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Philippine Islands, which had seen little peace since it was supposedly struck seventeen years ago. Rebels yet roam the countryside and ransack villages beyond Manila's grasp. Unruly dynasts and cliques yet hamstring the republic's day-to-day affairs, undoing bit by bit the legacy of their departed President Laurel. Our own 14th Army is yet to recapture the fearsome strength it had ended the Liberation War with. Assailed by threats from within and without, and embroiled by war since its founding, the Empire's brother Republic might not live to celebrate its eighteenth birthday.\n\nBut whatever awaits us and ours, know that the Emperor has willed the Philippines to live long and prosper.

But this morning their greatest strength became their greatest weakness; most fell silent before they could tell the Army something was afoot.\n\nNext were the villages and barrios along the front. Any other day and the villagers would wake in the early hours to prepare for the harvest. Men with guns by the hundreds forestalled their daily routine as houses and fields were captured without a shot. Some runners evaded notice enough to make for civilization.\n\nThird were the city outskirts, better defended than the backwater hovels of the provinces. It is here where armed men met other armed men and traded bullets and shells as the sun peeked above the horizon. Precincts received the outposts' distress messages and the village runners - right as explosions claim the lives of a dozen Constabularies. Death himself had roused the townsmen from their sleep.\n\nLast to receive them all was Manila, the Pearl of the Orient. From a distance, pillars of black smoke arose with the morning sun. Gunshots and explosions intertwined and formed hollow, echoing staccatos so far away yet so close all the same. Only now did the Army receive its reports: positions overrun, casualties reported, barrios lost, and cities besieged from Pampanga to the Negros.\n\nIn the span of four hours, both rebel groups were less than a hundred miles from Malacañan Palace."

Maidens met their princes, children laughed and trotted, and elders watch the follies of youth with stolid, yet warm complexions. Years preparing for war had fostered restraint among Manila's denizens; with war's spectre banished for good, the energies restraint held bay had cast it aside and engulfed the city by storm.\n\nAnd at its eye stood the Republic's beloved savior. Gone was the recalcitrant old relic of the late Laurel's ministry. At its place emerged an equal who had snatched victory from the twin jaws of communism and imperialism. Millions held firm to his wizened helmsmanship and were rewarded the lasting peace their fathers sought, and so they cheered his name from the rooftops and windows along the 19 de Junio, whereupon his Mitsubishi motorcade ambled at leisure's pace. Better then for the President's adoring legions that he had eschewed a roof -- reach close enough and one may even catch a glimpse of his fiery gaze.\n\nThen thunder clapped beneath the cloudless, daylit sky. An instant later, the fire was gone.

Only pointed reminders of the Commonwealth's precarious situation (and many a shattered cup of coffee) prevented escalation beyond repair. Nevertheless, the men assembled were still men of flesh and blood.

To welcome their old master into their government's beating heart, and so soon after breaking free at that, would send a poor statement to their charges.\n\nBut now the Laurelists and their own masters are gone. The dread communists of the northern hinterlands had followed suit, as well as those traitorious few among the USFIP's ranks. American bullets and American bombs saw to that copiously.\n\nWith no one left to contest, the Islands' old master let itself back in to the triumphant bombast of \"Stars and Stripes Forever\". The march's namesake fluttered in flagposts across Manila's concrete husks as General Dwight E. Beach addressed politicians and fellow soldiers within Session Hall. War, he said, had ruined the nation beyond the capacity of its natives to repair on their lonesome. With the assent of Congress and the Philippine Department, the Philippines was thus entrusted to the Organization of Free Nations as an interim mandate.\n\nHalf the crowd exploded to applause.

Romulo, one-time Resident Commissioner of the Philippines, long-time advocate for its independence from Tokyo, and among a handful who remain from President Manuel Quezon's wartime government. Revelrous Manila garnished itself with Quezon-era nostalgia in anticipation: flagposts with the Stars and Stripes, marching bands with the Marcha Nacional Filipina, and the best English spoken this side of the world. Like the Commonwealth had never left it all this time.\n\nOther families congregated elsewhere, grumbling. Why shouldn't they? Old Man Fertig vested civilian government onto them, not the exiles. Their struggle ended in the Akagi. The Philippines' rightful leaders had fought for the right since the '46 Leyte Proclamation. So they rallied behind another Carlos, this time among the Garcias of Bohol. The \"new Filipinos'\" delegate to the Philippine Department has shouldered his burden anew, this time to represent them in the land's highest office come Election Day.\n\nAs the nation recovers, its politics revolve increasingly around two Carloses. One offers the return of the old, American way of things. Another offers an opportunity to build something uniquely Filipino from the ashes.

With all influence from the decrepit collaborationist government or any subversive forces gone, both factions are now free to determine the future of the islands as they please, and a new concept has emerged. A coalition government.\n\nThe new unified state, as it is planned, shall be called the Coalition Government of the Republic of the Philippines, with an emphasis of close cooperation between the socialists, Tañada's nationalist party, and the will of the people. And with this, finally, blood shall stain the islands no more.\n\nOur task is not yet done, however, we shall rebuild the broken islands, and we shall pave the way to a bright future of a free and independent Philippines.

So far they've tightened their belts for twenty years and counting. What's a day more of sacrifice in honor of the lost?\n\nSo HQ, and a handpicked selection of the Forces' best, boarded a train to Bataan at dawn. The closest stop was a sleepy town named San Fernando. From there a convoy carried them southwards to Balanga, then past Mt. Mariveles, and finally to the port at the peninsula's tip. Part of the entourage, young and hotblooded, bickered endlessly throughout: whether about the heat, the potholes, the seats that were either hard as bricks or dank from rot. The few greyhairs that came along counted their blessings as their soles tingled with blister scars. Thank God, they didn't have to walk the whole way. Not anymore.\n\nFertig and his men rode barges for the last leg of the trip, arriving at Fort Mills by sundown. After the 14th Army had pounded the fort to rubble Manila deemed it worth less than the cost to rebuild, and so they left pristine an island dotted with ruins, shells, and the crosses of shallow graves. In time Mother Nature reclaimed with weeds and brambles - the parade grounds, the barracks, the batteries - what Lady Columbia's guns could not.\n\nThe ceremony at Topside lasted minutes, versus the near-day it took to get there.

Never could he forget his unwillingly patriotic act before his superiors, years of salary he bribed his regimental commander for a recommendation letter, or the girlfriend he broke up with just because she hated Tokyo where the Guard Divisions are at--all for the gold oak leaves on the cap that only GD members can wear. And now, with the upcoming deployment of the Guards to the burning islands of the Philippines, it all meant nothing to him."

 PHI_flavor.5.desc:0 "CLASSIFICATION: SECRET\n\nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY | DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE\n\nSubject: Conflict in the Philippines, Update\n\nWhile the situation in the islands has stabilized after the 1961 ceasefire concluded the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive (see Memorandum - 1959 Philippine War), succeeding developments may force another, more decisive confrontation in the near future.\n\nThe power struggles within the fractious Communist Party of the Philippines (PKP) culminated in General Secretary José Lava's ouster by Luis Taruc, commander of the party's armed wing (see Memorandum - Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon), following their retreat from Central Luzon to the Cordilleras Base Area. Reports from surrounding villages suggest that the hardliner is marshalling resources to rebuild his depleted forces ahead of a second offensive.\n\nSimilar efforts are being undertaken by the Philippine Department (see Memorandum - United States Forces in the Philippines) further south, aided by overt and covert shipments received in Davao City following its liberation. Having likewise regained the Bicol before the ceasefire, General Fertig has since fortified the USFIP's sole toehold in Luzon while his forces recover. Optimism for the islands' total liberation remains unabated by recent setbacks.\n\nIn contrast, agents in Manila describe the prevailing mood as fatalistic. Government reassurances belie a record number of both arrests for \"seditious behavior\" and luxury liners leaving port. After years of repression, faith in the Yulo regime has plummeted to an extent where its lastingness is being openly questioned."

 PHI_flavor.6.t:0 "Memorandum to: William Colby (Chief, Far East Division)"
 PHI_flavor.6.desc:0 "SUBJECT: Imminent Communist Offensive on USFIP1. The ceasefire between USFIP forces and the All-Filipino Revolutionary Socialist Republic has been tenuous ever since its ratification in 1957 (TAB A). Despite their many points of contention, however, leadership on both sides tacitly agreed that the status quo will remain as-is until the reclamation of Manila. Having done so before the communists, a large segment of the Philippine Department then voiced its discontent over ongoing negotiations with Luis Taruc. The fate of the peace mediated by Gen. Russell Volckmann of USFIP-Northern Luzon (TAB B) became increasingly untenable.\n\n2. The situation escalated on Monday, 0526 Zulu Time, when the Phil. Dept. suddenly lost contact with Gen. Volckmann's headquarters in Ifugao Province. This coincided with Taruc's hurried departure from Manila premises, likewise ending negotiations unilaterally. Frantic communiques from the capital were either unanswered or rebuffed.\n\n3. This state of affairs persisted until Friday, 1210 Zulu Time, when Taruc issued a public ultimatum by radio (TAB C). While he reassured the Phil. Dept. that Gen. Volckmann and his charges were kept safe in an undisclosed location, he also demanded the withdrawal of USFIP forces from Manila to secure USFIP-NL's safe passage into Bicol. Shortly after, Gen. [UPH.GetLeader] issued mobilization orders to units stationed along the Demarcation Line.\n\n4. Analysis concludes that Gen. Volckmann's situation is unsalvageable. War will re-engulf Luzon weeks before the Japanese 14th Army returns, severely depleting USFIP's capacity to resist a qualitatively and quantitatively superior force. For all intents and purposes, it will have to fight alone."

 PHI_flavor.8.desc:0 "A hotel in Tottori-ken, one day after the 14th Army's remains returned. The door is ajar in one room at the far end of the hallway, and the fluorescent lights within reflect off the varnished hardwood with a dim, eerie glow. Inside lay yen bills next to disheveled clothing, shards of glass, and empty cans of cheap sake. Water seeps from beneath the bathroom door; the tap is open, its muffled, rushing flow obscured slightly by the loud, crackling static of a dead radio. The air is laden with cigar smoke and alcohol. Though they did their level best to make it unlivable, someone clearly lives here.\n\nMetal grinds against metal like a sword unsheathed. Shaky breaths, then a yell cut short by something sharp ripping through flesh. A soft thud - the yell became sobs, then whimpers, then rattles. Someone no longer lives here.\n\nSomeone was Masazumi Inada. Someone was a general once. Someone will be remembered by someone else, maybe - but not now, not while the lives someone had doomed were still so keenly missed.\n\nThe next afternoon, in a temple ground further east. Services which began at the crack of dawn end just as the sun dips below the glimmering orange sea. Plumes of ash-smoke trail upwards from a furnace; a dozen more from a dozen other furnaces in the city climb with it towards the silver terrace-clouds above. The crowd has thinned into clumps idling about, yet the wails of the bereaved linger like echoes from six hours ago.\n\nFrom within the temple emerges an army man, sharply dressed. He allows himself one last moment to reflect. Then he leaves the temple grounds just as quickly, gloves clasped around a letter with the Chrysanthemum Seal.\n\nTakayama Shinobu has learned to treasure such moments now, for in the coming months he will have no time for reflection, or for grief. The 14th Army dead demand only justice."

 PHI_old_soldier.2.desc: "\"Fancy seeing you anywhere not in a mess hall,\" called out Evan Tyson to the pitch black night. Grass shuffled as footsteps neared up to some paces behind the sergeant. Though the intruder's face blended with the midnight murk, Chester Brannen's lilt was unmistakable.\n\n\"It's gotten unbearable even for me,\" said the Irishman as he sat next to Evan. \"Ever seen the Captain choke on some dead baby chicks?\" He shuddered. \"Wish I hadn't.\" The sergeant stifled a snort, but otherwise took another silent drag from some homemade cigarette. When a man's odds of surviving the next week are so small he'd need lenses to see it, of course he'll let loose before a bullet does him in.\n\n\"Say,\" began Chester, \"you never told me about your kid before.\"\n\nNow that was out of left field. What was even there to say if he hadn't seen the kid at all? \"Well, we had some names prepared. Both if it was a boy or a girl.\"\n\n\"Five bucks says it's a boy and there's at least a Dick in there somewhere.\"\n\n\"My wife bet on a girl, and it's either Ruby, Jade or Crystal. Not even close, Chet.\"\n\nThe two men shared a laugh under the moonless night. Times like these will be few and far between soon enough, and by then there won't be enough to spare for reminiscing.\n\nWas that a bad thing or not? The old soldier couldn't tell."

I was worried our rather capricious mailman would single mine out for this reason or that, even after he pocketed some of my spare yen easy as you please. Let's hope it hasn't come to that.\n\nHQ sent our battalion and some others to (REDACTED) some time ago. The name's hard to pronounce but, then again, nobody bothers besides our CO. A cluster of huts lodged deep in a jungle a ways off from a dirt road to nowhere? It might as well be our last ten deployments in a row. Nothing worth writing home about, certainly - if it weren't for what we found in the village itself.\n\nHuts with guns and ammo, huts with shells, huts with barrels of fuel all lined up as neatly as you can get them without heavy machinery. A nearby tunnel led down a cramped space with honest-to-goodness tanks and artillery pieces parked like in a motor pool. Matsu called it an ammo dump at the least. One so far away from civilization the Army had caught wind of it on a whim, and one with abnormally heavy ordinance at that. No doubt many more hide beyond our reach.\n\nI'll be long gone from this malaria-infested swamp before brass seeks them out, Heaven willing. A few more months and we can sightsee Kyoto like I promised. And yes, Lie's a good artist. I'll see if I can get him to draw some pandas before I come home.\""
