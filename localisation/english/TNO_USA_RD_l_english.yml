RD.1.desc:0 "The two men shook hands as they entered the Oval Office. "Congratulations on your reelection, Mr. President," the first man said.\n\n"The pleasure's all mine," said President-reelect [USA.GetLeader]. What wasn't to be pleased about? The economy was going up, race riots were becoming a thing of the past, and America's largely moved on from Watergate and South Africa. Everything was going fine and steady... except.\n\n"Mr. Secretary," began the President as he occupied the Resolute Desk, "what can you tell me about the Ports?"\n\nThe Secretary of State bolted from his seat, sending it scraping across the floor. He turned back to the entrance saying, "I'll notify JCS immediately-"\n\n"Don't. What do I look like, a Rightist nutjob?" President [GetPresidentLastName] chuckled, gesturing to the Secretary's chair. "I'm not gonna escalate, if that's what you thought. I've something bigger in mind."\n\nEyes widened in dawning realization. "You mean..."\n\nA nod. "I want a report on my desk by tomorrow morning - likelihoods, risk assessments, angles of approach, everything you think I need to know. We'll discuss this in detail with the rest of the Cabinet."\n\n"Right away!""
RD.1.a:0 "And with that, the Handover was in motion."

RD_SAF.1.t:0 "What Do We Do Now?"
RD_SAF.1.desc:0 "President [GetPresidentLastName] watches as his Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff continue to argue over the best course of action for the South African War. Since the enemy has been a tougher nut to crack than expected, it was now up to him to sort out the mess. One suggestion is to focus on nation building and winning the hearts and minds of the local populace, undercutting the support that the fascists and Boers get, the so called CORDS Program that Donald Rumsfeld has come up with. The other is to jump on the Germans with both feet, use the full force of the American armed forces to bludgeon the enemy into surrender.\n\nBoth options have their pros and cons, and after listening to everyone argue about it, it's time for the President to decide."

RD_SAF.2.t:0 "Meeting with Rumsfeld"
RD_SAF.2.desc:0 ""Mr. President, I do hope that you've had time to examine my proposal."\n\nDonald Rumsfeld set his coffee down on a side table, glancing at the presidential seal on the coaster. With his close-cropped hair and vast chin, he looked every part the Princeton defensive back that he used to be. President [GetPresidentLastName] stared at the report that sat on the Resolute Desk.\n\nASSESSING THE VALUE OF NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS\n\n"I can see," said the President, "that you have a somewhat different perspective from much of the brass. And the Cabinet."\n\n"Indeed. With all due respect, Mr. President, McNamara is concerned with the wrong things. He'll put out statements about advisors in this sector, or new deployments to this province, to make us seem strong. He's a numbers man, as I understand it, so that makes sense. But numbers aren't everything. We need to focus on counterinsurgency and free up South Africa proper to fight the Germans. I believe in protecting American lives, as you do, but that can't be accomplished without combating attrition in the South's own territory. We need to be smarter about this."\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName] thought it over. Rumsfeld made some good points, and he seemed to know what he was talking about."
RD_SAF.2.a:0 "Let's give this plan some more consideration."

RD_SAF.7.t:0 "Letting the Other Shoe Drop"
RD_SAF.7.desc:0 "President [GetPresidentLastName] had called Rumsfeld and McNamara into the Oval for a reason, and while he was confident, he still felt like he was telling the kids about an oncoming divorce.\n\n"Mr. President, this would be a mistake!" McNamara was the first to object. "We are closer than ever to winning once and for all!"\n\nRumsfeld followed suit. He may not have liked Bob, but he didn't want to seem like a coward.\n\n"We cannot just abandon our allies like this. Retreat now would be catastrophic for our soft power elsewhere, to say nothing of all the spent lives."\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName] had been ready for this. "Bob. Donald. We can't go on like this. I believe that we are in a position in which favorable ceasefires can be made, and I trust that I'll have your support on this. It's what's best."\n\nThe two defense men looked at each other for a long, long moment."
RD_SAF.7.a:0 ""Yes, Mr. President.""

RD_SAF.12.t:0 "The Cape of Good Hope Incident"
RD_SAF.12.desc:0 ""I suggest you take some time out of your schedule, Mr. President. We're getting some reports out of South Africa I think you'll want to take a look at immediately". Ten minutes later, President [GetPresidentLastName] was sitting comfortably in the large leather chair behind his desk in the Oval Office, flanked by Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, as the Admiral began his briefing.\n\n"We've been getting cables from Cape Town. There's been a naval skirmish some hundred nautical miles south-east of the Cape of Good Hope. Two of our destroyers patrolling the area, Agerholm and Sarsfield, were involved and apparently Agerholm took a few hits. No real damage. We don't know the extent of casualties among the Nazis and South Africans, but they're likely to be light."\n\n"Did you say South Africans?"\n\n"Yeah. The skirmish began with a Nazi raid on a Southie convoy headed for Durban. In accordance with your latest orders, we had our destroyers move to investigate and one was fired upon. Honestly, the Nazis might've struck our vessel by accident, thinking it was one of the Southies. They sure retreated in a hurry after."\n\n"It's almost a shame." McNamara interjected, "If this had been more of a real battle it could've given us just the push we need to move forward with..."\n\n"Who says it wasn't?"\n\n"I'm not sure I follow you, Mr. President."\n\n"If we call it a battle, who's to say it wasn't?""
RD_SAF.12.a:0 ""I like the way you're thinking, Mr. President.""

RD_SAF.13.t:0 "A Small Deception"
RD_SAF.13.desc:0 ""You're right, Mr. President, who's to say this wasn't a battle? We can certainly make it look a little more like one. Our reports say the damage is limited to outer armor layers, but we know the public aren't all that informed on naval terminology. We could find out how many were penetrated and call them all 'breaches'. That'll sound a lot more dangerous, don't you think?"\n\n"Oh, and what if we empty the sick bay completely when the ship hits port, send every hung-over, sea-sick or syphilitic sailor to the hospital? We could announce the number of transfers without specifying their ailments. Best of all is we won't be lying about anything, just be... selective in our public briefing." Having stood up from his chair halfway through making his suggestion, McNamara calmly sat back down to signal he was done speaking. After a short silence, Donald Rumsfeld, his counterpart on the other side of the table, was the next to speak. "Mr. President, if there's one thing I know to be true it's that people don't like being misled. If we do what he says it'll come back to bite us later. I'm sure of it. Besides, I'm not sure we need this in the first place, we're looking at Nazi ships firing on American vessels even if we don't embellish a thing."\n\n"I'm not sure about that," President [GetPresidentLastName] replied, "I know a few senators that would need the extra push...""
RD_SAF.13.a:0 ""... And a good war story will get everyone roaring to win us this conflict.""
RD_SAF.13.b:0 ""... But a foreign power firing on an American vessel will have to be enough.""

RD_SAF.14.t:0 "The Truth Is Relative"
RD_SAF.14.desc:0 ""It's a good start, Mr. President, but I still worry if it'll be enough. There are still a lot of people that are skeptical about the war in Africa, and I think it'll take a little more to convince most of them." McNamara flipped a page in his copy of the incident report, "What if we portray it as a raid on us, rather than the Southies? We'll just say they attacked a convoy and that our destroyers moved to defend it, then we can let people connect the dots on their own. There's also the numbers to consider. If you look here at the end of page two in the report..." \n" "Multiple unconfirmed sonar pings" - The Admiral said some of those might be ships we missed but it wouldn't be completely out of the question for all of them to be. A handful more ships, a few submarines - that'll drive home the severity of the threat we're facing." McNamara closed his paper folder as if to punctuate his short speech.\n\n"I still caution against this," Rumsfeld cut in, "our integrity is too important to jeopardize for an opinion boost."\n\nAfter weighing his options, President [GetPresidentLastName] spoke, "Well, people do hate submarines...""
RD_SAF.14.a:0 "... Let's add it to our report!"
RD_SAF.14.b:0 "... But we won't go this far."

RD_SAF.15.t:0 "A Necessary Invention"
RD_SAF.15.desc:0""I'm really liking how we're shaping up this report. But if I may, I suggest we add just one more thing. I took the liberty of requesting a report from the boys down at the Cape Town radar facility and look here at what they came back with. These data/images from just 45 minutes after the Incident are somewhat consistent with a grouping of vessels, just thirty nautical miles away. I think we could argue that the only reason for such a grouping would be another engagement. Secondary to the main battle, of course. If our report says the Nazis struck twice, well, no one will question their intent then, or the necessity of a retaliation that shows we mean business."\n\nAfter he was satisfied McNamara was finished speaking, the President turned to Rumsfeld, who was looking very intently on the incident report in front of him. It seemed no more arguments would be coming from the man, and that President [GetPresidentLastName] would have to make up his mind without him."
RD_SAF.15.a:0 ""All right, we'll add it to the report.""
RD_SAF.15.b:0 ""There's no need to make stuff up.""
