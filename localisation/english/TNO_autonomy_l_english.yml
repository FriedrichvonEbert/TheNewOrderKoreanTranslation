 autonomy_china_warlord_regime_tt:0 "§LWarlordism in the China of today inherits a tradition of governance going all the way back to the post-Zhou breakdown of order in about 771 BCE. Indeed, many of the greatest, most humane rulers of Chinese history – such as Liu Xiu, Emperor Guangwu of Han, who lived out his reign as emperor without killing even one of his generals or advisors and even spared many of the pretenders to his throne – began their rule as warlords.\n\nAs a result, it has become far more refined than its foreign counterparts, which generally amount to the institutionalization of brutality, cruelty, and other stereotypical instances of military rapine and slaughter. This also means that being a warlord in China is not as stigmatized as it might be elsewhere. Instead, Chinese warlords are essentially autonomous civilian or military governors with control devolved upon them from the weak and decentralized central government, more reminiscent of relatively milquetoast civilian or military dictatorships than up-jumped bandits or military men gone wild.§!"
