 #Leaders
 
 POLITICS_PLAEK_PHIBUNSONGKHRAM_DESC:0 "Born in 1897, the Grand Marshal was given the name "strange" as a young boy - few could predict how prophetic this title would come to be, as he now rules over a Thailand unrecognizable from all those years ago. Decades of grooming the Thai nation to fit his idealized image has led Plaek Phibunsongkhram to this moment - opulent, prosperous, yet woefully out of time.\n\nPlaek sits as the Pater Patriae, at the helm of almost thirty years of brutal modernization and cultural rejuvenation programs. Championing the successes of fascist movements in Europe, Plaek emulated it's deeply authoritarian nationalism by taking inspiration from Italy's Duce and Germany's Führer to rival the European empires encircling the underdeveloped nation. If anyone is responsible for dragging Thailand into the modern day, kicking and screaming, it is Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who did so with ideological conviction and martial abandon.\n\nHaving involved Thailand in the violent and bloody uprooting of European colonialism across Asia in Japan's nationalist coalition, Phibun's public support grew in zeal. Yet, the passing of the 'Patriarch Charter' - abolishing the monarchy and assuming sovereign power - had prompted others to finally draw out their daggers in the dark. The Grand Marshal's ailing health degenerates; the people ask more questions of the future - will he live long enough for him to answer them?"

 POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC:0 "Many wonder how absurd it would be for the Grand Marshal to have a friendly relationship with someone so distant from his doctrinal beliefs, but it seems Thawan Thamronnawasawat was just the man to stand firm in such a way to remain in his position. Commander-in-Chief of the tender, yet considerable, Thai Navy, Thawan's aloof stance has been considered by many apolitical; others thought him a dormant mastermind.\n\nRising in the ranks of Thailand's nascent navy, Thawan has served in the force from a time where the world considered the fleet ceremonial. Now, he presides over what he considers the pride of the nation's standing across the world; the seas offered Thawan a version of Thailand, however, a safe distance from the truth - his homeland was ruled by a tyrant, and no admiral could change the fact.\n\nAs the army frothed at the mouth with spewings of ideological militarism over the years, or indulged in opportunism to advance an officer's career with violent force, Thawan's navy, disciplined by crashing waves, remained largely unmolested by the stoked divisions that plagued its sister branch. Now, he sits in the seat of the President, keeping the divided army cliques at bay, and bitterly holding together the shattered pieces of the republic's legacy against military rebellion and civil war."

 POLITICS_PRIDI_BANOMYONG_DESC:0 "The new president of the Republic of Thailand sits in the most powerful seat in the country, but many still ask if he truly is the most influential man in Bangkok's halls of power. Swept into power with the vast support of the people and political establishment, Pridi Banomyong's election was an event many saw on the horizon, but none could know of its consequences.\n\nPridi's past relationship with the Khana Ratsudon is a complicated one; once respected as a nationalist who had worked tirelessly to establish a modern constitution as well as cancel unequal treaties with the west, he had fallen into partial disgrace as his rivalries with military wings of the party consumed his position of power. Plaek's rise to the seat of Prime Minister rolled Thailand further towards military dictatorship; Pridi could not stomach a dictator in place of an absolute monarch, and harbored resistance to the totalitarianism of the Grand Marshal's regime, before being shelved to positions of little temporal authority.\n\nToday, the Grand Marshal is no more, living only in the memories scarred into the landscape Pridi has inherited as president of the republic after Thawan's resignation, and yet his progeny crowd the young democracy. Pridi may have outlived Plaek and his thunderous wrath, but he could not outlive the deep marks he has left on Thailand forever."

 POLITICS_SENI_PRAMOJ_DESC:0 "Few could have predicted the return of Seni Pramoj to Thailand's soils, and even fewer could utter the title 'President' before his name without a smirk - yet he sits in the most powerful office in the land, to the surprise of the nation and many abroad. In a bizarre turn of events, it seems that the champion of the late kingdom has returned to make his mark on the seat of power.\n\nSeni Pramoj, part royal in blood, had spent much of his life back and forth throughout western countries, studying and practicing law, until he was sent to the United States as ambassador in 1940 in what is best described as an 'unofficial exile.' As his homeland was consumed by war and generals preying upon the future of the country, Seni began to abandon the duties of his post to organize a resistance against Plaek's government. However, as Hawaii burned in atomic fire, and as the Americans were forced to the negotiating table, the embers of resistance dimmed before dying out completely.\n\nThawan's coup of the Bangkok government following Plaek's death, however, signaled a change in course for the future of a free Thailand; the Admiral had promised reform, and it concluded in an election none on earth could predict. The exiled democrat now sits in the seat of the president, urging his countrymen to support his government as Thailand wanders towards a new future where she may finally find peace."

 POLITICS_THANOM_KITTIKACHORN_DESC:0 "Thanom Kittikachorn knows war and cruel violence like few others in the halls of power; even fewer can leap with such dexterity to it. Organised, disciplined, and inexcusably fiendish, Thanom commands not only armies in the field, but the personal loyalties of those lurking in the shadows of government where one would least expect it.\n\nThe well-educated strategist spent his youth in military academies and institutions until the opening of war against the Europeans in 1940, wherein his service in the Burmese campaigns earned him promotions for his leadership and initiative under extreme pressure. To many, it seems the extreme pressure of the campaigns had built a monster out of a man excelling in the field, who then treated politics like war. Each medal pinned to his uniform were but insignia of his killings; rewards for his ruthlessness.\n\nThanom's grueling victories during Operation Issara in the East, as well as his rapacious influence in ascent to the inner circles of the Rongrean Nai Roi military clique, had spun him a web of influence, willingly or unwillingly ensnaring those in the general's orbit. Now, after launching a coup against the interim government, these snares have grown intrusive and more barbarous - his forces now run Thailand; he, the Commander-in-Chief of whatever horror he can craft from the mud of the battlefield."

 POLITICS_KRIS_SAVARA_DESC:0 "A man thrown into the bloody aftermath of Marshal Thanom's hate, and the screaming chaos that has swallowed the nation since, Kris Sivara is a man with the burden of millions of futures on his shoulders. Power rests in his junta's hands, yet as shadows begin to crawl from the corners of his vision, no one is sure of who can be trusted.\n\nIn his earlier years, Kris had risen to local prominence serving in the armed forces; his advances into British-controlled Burma had landed him among the same circles as Thanom Kittikachorn, wherein he consolidated relationships with those who would come to form the linchpins of the Sisao Thaweet clique. Thanom, having taken notice of Kris' reputation, kept him neatly within select various commands and, after his coup, government posts to carefully monitor his activity - until it happened.\n\nThanom's barbarian reprisals of students and civilians in the streets of major cities had pushed Kris and other like-minded officers to act; they had forced the tyrant marshal from power, and severed the head of the brutal regime. Kris now heads a council running the young republic, whose wounds gape and bleed, gashed by the scourge of man. Only time will tell if his house of cards will stand on the shaky foundations so many have bled and wept over, and if dignity will wash up on Thailand's shores ever again."

 POLITICS_CHATICHAI_CHOONHAVAN_DESC:0 "The only son of Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan, supporter of the Phibunsongkhram regime and face of the old guard, Chatichai Choonhavan has stepped beyond the shoes of his father for some time now. His family name an insignia and rite-of-passage in Bangkok's halls of power, Chatichai has become a face frequented by anyone who is anyone in the young republic.\n\nAs war had raged on in Indochina against the French and then the British, Chatichai shadowed his father's efforts to lead the armed forces into battle and take the bloody fight to the imperialist europeans. Bravery under fire and excellent strategic planning, although restrained by the Japanese high command, had earned the Choonhavan name great fame and respect; he and his father's tales were often retold at dinner parties in wealthy establishments.\n\nHowever, as Operation Issara came to a grinding halt, and all of the republic's daggers were pointed to his father, Chatichai sat outside of the spotlight of Thailand's military affairs. Now that the Grand Marshal is dead, the ranks of soldiers call the Choonhavan name once again. Chatichai is young and inexperienced in the seat of the President, but few cast their doubts over his passion for justice."

 THA_The_Thai_Renaissance_desc:0 "Thailand no longer feeds from the crumbs Europeans threw to her from the riches they had beaten out of the oppressed peoples of Asia. Just twenty years ago, Marshal Phibunsongkhram was able to free the nation and cast the Franco-British capitalists from Indochina.\n\nToday, Thailand is a modern nation - she has entered a golden age, with a surging economy and formidable military. This thriving era of prosperity, however, is built upon blood, bones, and the victims of decades of state repression."
 THA_A_Military_Roulette:0 "A Military Roulette"
 THA_A_Military_Roulette_desc:0 "The Thai National Army is now the undisputed institution of prestige and power in the country; anyone who is anyone has served within its barracks and in its battalions. However, it is plagued with factionalism, draining the state of its resources and expertise.\n\nRivalries between the Soi Ratchakru and Sisao Thawaet factions heighten and grow unruly, and it is not long before the enmities spill into audacious conflict as they compete over visions of how Thailand should be governed."
 THA_The_Shadow_War:0 "The Shadow War"
 THA_The_Shadow_War_desc:0 "Officially, the Republic of Thailand is a co-equal member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In reality, however, Tokyo's diplomatic pressure had secured the unwelcome presence of Japanese military envoys gnawing away within Thai territory.\n\nIn the fallout of this rift, Phibunsongkhram's cunning had coordinated with a counterbalance - the CIA. With a handful of American black sites operating across the country, Thailand is precariously placed within the crossfire of two of the world's superpowers."
