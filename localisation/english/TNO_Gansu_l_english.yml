POLITICS_MASANOBU_TSUJI_DESC:0 "If one were to ask a high-school student in Kanazawa or Nagano or Osaka about Tsuji Masanobu, the result would be a glowing review. To Japanese from Kamikawa to Kitakyushu and beyond, General Tsuji is a war hero, a great champion of the Pan-Asian dream, who freed Malaya from the British imperialist bastards through his innate genius and cunning planning.\n\nThe real Tsuji, the one known to the oppressed from Davao to Lanzhou, is far different. He is a ruthless, brutish mass murderer, a butcher in willing, fanatical service to a new imperialism. True, he is the general that planned the invasion of Malaya and brought it to completion in a month. But that was done in an orgy of cruelty and brutality that painted streets from Alor Setar to Kota Tinggi in blood time and again.\n\nAnd that was not the end, for bleeding Malaya white once was not enough for Tsuji. Since then, he has partaken in a multitude of massacres and targeted genocides, not least among these the brutal Sook Ching – Purging-through-Cleansing – of Chinese Malayans and Chinese in Singapore, and the terrible Bataan Death March in which prisoners died or were slain like flies.\n\nNow, after some time spent in Japan, the old brute is let out of the doghouse to tear people to shreds once more. The Imperial Japanese Army headquarters have dispatched him and a Northwestern Area Army to pacify the unruly northwest of China. He will do so with gusto, partaking eagerly in yet another festival of blood and murder. A rapacious, iron-fisted, ruthless, and conscienceless brute is needed to defeat the last bastions of Chinese resistance, and one could not ask for a better example of that than Tsuji Masanobu." 

#POLITICS_MASANOBU_TSUJI_DESC_OLD:0 "Tsuji's past is shrouded in myth, created by the terror surrounding the man. Depending on who you ask, he was either the slaughterer of hundreds of thousands or the general who won the war through unorthodox means.\n\nTo the peasant, he's a man who ignored due process and executed anyone suspecting of taking part in the resistance. To the discharged army man, he's an insane general who threw human waves at a resolute army. To the current army man, there is no one else they would serve under, in his infinite benevolence and strangeness.\n\nThe hearsay dictates that he was indeed responsible in large part for certain military operations, and went on to serve in some particular institutions and organizations in the Japanese apparatus. The psychologist would say that Tsuji had a greed for power, and needed to elevate himself to a seat on the Imperial Diet. The loyalist would say that Tsuji had great plans for Japan, and it was only the Chinese collaborators and communists that compromised his plan and forced him to lose his election. The traditionalist would say the emperor personally exiled Tsuji for the rumors across the empire. The Pan-Asianist would say that they heard he walked through Manchukuo and Mengjiang, taking his time to tour the glory of the empire on his way to his new appointment.\n\nThe Muslim would say that he came to the west to torture the Prophet's Followers and put Ma Bufang to the stake. Tsuji would say that he was simply serving his duty. The western observer would watch and say that there must be an end to the conflict in the northwest soon, while the local would say that the torment of the iron hand never seems to fade. To all, however, one thing is in agreement; The Mad General prepares for war. "
