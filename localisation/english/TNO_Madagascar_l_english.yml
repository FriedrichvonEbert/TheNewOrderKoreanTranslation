 COUNTRY_INFO_MADAGASKAR:0 "§G==마다가스카르 국가판무관부==§!\n\n독일의 아프리카 영토 중 가장 값어치 없는 곳은 단연 §G마다가스카르 국가판무관부§!입니다. 원래는 유럽 내 유대인을 수용할 계획으로 국가판무관부는 독일 내 유대인 문제를 잠재울 수 있는 철저히 통제되고 효율적인 섬 전역의 게토가 되어야 했습니다. Instead, it has become the principal repository of the Reich's racial pariahs; All those men who in spite of their insufficiently aryan ancestry, could not be themselves consigned to one of the island's ghettoes due to political reasons. Moreover, once the slavery system was legalized during the 1950s, and those european Jews who had not been deported became enslaved, Madagaskar's raison d'etre - and its funding - disappeared. Unsurprisingly, placing anxious exiled functionaries in a low budget environment made any pretense of carrying out the §BMadagaskarplan§! laughable. Thus, the Reichskommissariat has slowly degraded into a hemorrhoid at the bottom end of the Reich, as more and more concessions were made to the native and jewish populations by the bickering factions of the §GGeneralbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten (GMA)§!, in futile attempts to gain the upper hand.\n\nToday, Madagaskar is a major embarrassment to Germany, in which the SS is a front for §YMalagasy nationalism§! and the §SWehrmacht§! plots against its own government. Moreover, the colony's hinterland is a ticking time bomb, with the first cases of a §gfamiliar disease§! being reported. However, these embarrassments pale in comparison to the fact that, like the other German African Reichskommissariats, Madagascar is not but the personification of its leader.\n\nPossessing the apathy of §YWolfgang Schenk§!, the administrative skill of §YSiegfried Müller§!, and the liveliness of §YHans Hüttig§!, the 1/16th Jewish §LEmil Maurice§! is the single greatest cause of Magadaskar's degenerate practices. That is, at any rate, what Hüttig, scornfully looking across the Mozambique channel, actually believes. Those still living in reality, however, are acutely aware that Maurice has never attended a GMA cabinet meeting, or exercises any power in the colony whatsoever. The fiction of Reichskommissariat's existence is kept alive only by a dedicated clique of junior bureaucrats, led by §jWilhelm Stoph§!, and permanently undermined by Generalfeldmarschall §SErhard Milch§!. Nevertheless, there is something to be said about Maurice's perpetually depressed attitude affecting the state of the colony, as noted by the fact that his uncharacteristically active participation in §Ydiplomatic talks§! about the §Tlifting of the OFN embargo§! on the island has led to unexpected success..."
 POLITICS_GABRIEL_RAMANANTSOA_DESC:0 "For almost seventy years, has the Malagasy people not been given the right to determine their own destiny. Since the collapse of the monarchy, Gabriel Ramanantsoa's people have suffered humiliation after humiliation, at the whims of the distant European masters.\n\nHaving trained amongst French soldiers in the Saint-Cyr military, Ramanantsoa's assignment of commanding the native forces in his home island made him plainly stranded and disenfranchised as the forces of Germany rolled over Africa, and his own home; however, he had something the Germans lacked, and the French were desperate: knowledge of the island terrain like the back of his palm, admiration and support from the native peoples, and seemingly, a mercenary spirit, as he cast aside his own medals and alliance to the Fourth Republic fairly quickly, taking command for the training of the Malagasy Waffen SS divisions.\n\nHowever, Gabriel was never a traitor to the idea of a free Malagasy. He was simply patient. For ten years he waited, training what was seemingly the highest cadre of traitors of not only his nation, but his people, as well as dabbling upon the black market, with the excuse of arming his troops with supplies that Germania couldn't be bothered to send.\n\nOnce Maurice took his bow, and the chain of command broke, he revealed his master triumph: the SS was nothing but a cover for the true organization under his adage, the Mouvement de lá Révolution Malgache. His black market contacts were not disenfranchised war profiteers, but Japanese contacts and providers.\n\nGabriel has never seen a free Malagasy. But he can make one, or die trying."
 POLITICS_HAIM_BAR_LEV_DESC:0 "1940년대부터 유럽계 유대인들이 갇혀있던 아프리카 게토 위로 들고일어난 하임 바 레브는 증오에 찬 나치에 맞서 승리하는 것 뿐만 아니라, 전투가 끝난 후에도 도덕적으로 그들보다 우위에 있는 걸 추구합니다.\n\n히트나그두트 운동의 많은 사람들처럼 바 레브의 저항 인생은 국가판무관부가 탄생한 직후 마우리체와 장군들 사이의 권력투쟁이 있던 때부터 시작되었습니다. 독일인 사이의 내분으로 식민지의 본래 목적인 마다가스카르 계획의 실행은 빠르게 잊혀졌습니다. 이 행복한 무지의 은혜로 유대인 사회는 자유롭게 내분을 시작할 수 있었고, 이는 저항운동을 조직하려는 노력을 계속 방해했습니다. 초창기 히트나그두트 조직의 가장 온건한 파벌을 대표하는 바 레브는 망명동포를 진정시키기 위해 개입했고, 이 운동을 구성하는 이질적인 파벌들을 타협하는 능력으로 빠르게 존경을 얻었습니다.\n\n히트나그두트의 지도력을 얻을 후, 바 레브는 라마난초아의 등장으로 두 반독세력 간 휴전에 도달하기 위해 말라가시 원주민들과 극도로 긴 협상을 하면서 1950년대 후반을 보냈습니다. 이후 마우리체 전복을 위한 군사 봉기 계획을 세우던 중, 예상보다 사건이 빠르게 전개되었고, 섬에 있는 모든 사람들과 마찬가지로 이제 밀히에 맞서 싸워야합니다.\n\n바 레브가 성공하기 위해 마다가스카르에 머무는 동안 많은 일들을 했지만, 한가지 공통점이 있습니다. 도덕적 목적, 즉 독일인보다 더 나은 사람이 되기 위한 노력입니다. 유대인 지도자는 만약 자신의 사람들이 나치수준이 되어버린다면, 어떠한 군사적 승리도 피로스의 승리가 되버릴 거라고 걱정합니다."
 POLITICS_ERHARD_MILCH_DESC:0 "Like many in Göring's clique, Erhard Milch is a decorated man. A brave and patriotic soldier who first distinguished himself by serving with honor in the First World War, and who then went on to be an instrumental figure in the organization of the Luftwaffe, he is a respected and important figure among Schörner's band of militarists. So why would an esteemed General of the Wehrmacht be sent to such a remote location as Madagascar?\n\nUnusually enough, Milch was not assigned to the Red Island as a punishment; or, at least, he wasn't the one being punished. Truth is, he is here to keep Reichskommissar Maurice in check, and to coordinate the ground garrisons on the island to crush any native uprising. The only problem with this, however, is that both men have never been able to speak for more than one hour without one of them leaving the room: such a situation naturally makes running the Reichskommissariat greatly complicated.\n\nNow, war has broken out in Madagascar. And, for once, Milch is in a position to do something: along with a group of loyal soldiers, he plans to crush what he sees as unruly rebels, and to take control of the island with the aim of giving it back to Germania once and for all."
 POLITICS_WILLI_STOPH_DESC:0 "Willi Stoph is a man that, like many others, was sent to Madagascar because the other option would have been simply death; a veteran soldier from the Wehrmacht during World War 2, Willi was one of the soldiers under Rommel's guidance during the African Campaign, the comradeship and efficiency under his leadership would have come in high contrast to the decadent, nearly worthless structural command and values of the Wehrmacht once he returned and was thrown to the Russian Front during the West Russian War.\n\nThe coup attempt by the SS was the last straw in his mind, and many like other youth in the Wehrmacht, quickly joined the reformist factions, outraged by seeing his homeland and Hitler's vision so quickly eroded since his time in Africa.\n\nPerhaps, he also has to thank for his commander and friendships that he was simply "delegated" to the Madagascar Batallion, rather executed and done with, like many of his erstwhile companions in Germania.\n\nIn Madagascar, he quickly joined forces with Schoeps, taking realms of the Werhmatch battalions once Maurice made himself absent from the Reichskommissariat leadership, and once the OFN stepped in the shores, he was amongst the first to shake Moorer's hands.\n\nNow, he spearheads the Federal Republic of Madagascar. However, between the rumblings of Schoeps and his distaste for the democratic system, a repressed native movement, and the OFN own demands, one can wonder how this soldier turned president can truly keep this state together..."
 POLITICS_DIDIER_RATSIRAKA_DESC:0 "Despite having deep roots within the military, Didier Ratsiraka is tired of its strong grip over the fledgling new nation. Having been born to a French Colonial Administrator, his entire life he saw the boots of soldiers, loyal only to coin and favors, trample over their kin, an opinion, and weariness that he shared with his father, who protested the French in his own, small ways.\n\nAs the swastika rose upon his home, he took to the family honored tradition to protest against the foreigner's whims to his people's destiny, leading a small group of saboteurs to German Administration, the Association pour la Renaissance de Madagascar, however, unlike the Revolution Malgache, they lacked both the means, and the firepower to stand on its own, and as the civil war raged own, his organization was quickly conjoined to the native movement.\n\nHe knew by experience, however, that Gabriel's deal with Japan would be his downfall. The foreigners wouldn't want someone that has openly shown its colors as a nationalistic, and he wasn't idealistic enough to think the heads in Tokyo would have simply left them to their own business; so, as they kicked off the illegitimate mandate, and Milch's dogs off his home, has he received a fairly tempting offer, to spear-head the now "free" republic, once Gabriel was "convinced" to step down.\n\nHe's no fool, he knows he's a puppet dancing to the strings of the Rising Sun, but Didier was raised from the cradle to play the long game. Like Gabriel before him, he'll simply bide his time, show himself a perfect figurehead, win at the polls, until the time is right to cut his own strings off."
 POLITICS_JACQUES_RABEMANANJARA_DESC:0 "Amongst the many authoritarians, communists, and idealistic daydreamers in the Malagasy resistance, Jacques Rabemananjara was always a realist at best, a compromiser at worst, and a reactionary to the most radical elements. For decades strong military rulership has pressed his people down to the dirt, and even before that, the monarchy saw his kin separated not even by the color of their skin, but by ephemeral titles and fickle nobility. As Maurice fled the island, and the call for the resistance echoed along the land, Jacques was one of many that simply refused, either by coercion, or by exhaustion from what seemed to be another military dictatorship, this time simply by his own kin.\n\nAt the bare minimum, Jacques believed the OFN would bring a chance for democracy and the people's rule to finally blossom, and his patience was rewarded as the Mandate stabilized the nation and he received the invitation to be the first president of the Republic of Madagascar.\n\nThe revolutionaries call him a traitor, the native population calls him a sellout and the OFN Administration may call him a "valuable ally", but that is all worthless noise to him. Madagascar will one day be a proud democracy, tried and true, a shining example across all Africa, and Jacques will be the person to make sure the foundations will never let this dream collapse."
 POLITICS_THOMAS_MOORER_DESC:0 "Thomas H. Moorer's track record of service in the US Navy is perhaps one of the brightest in the institution's long history, doubly so after the failure of the US intervention in the Second World War; a veteran from the Dutch East Indies, his leadership and covert sea strikes heavily crippled the Kriegsmarine and Imperial Navy presence in the Indian ocean in the waning hours of the Second World War, with only the Pearl Harbor nuking and the surrender of the United States ending what could have been a campaign to permanently cripple their hold on the African Seas.\n\nHowever, the war experience gave him a downright encyclopedic knowledge of the Indian Sea, knowledge and experience giving him the position of Admiralship, and unofficial representation of the OFN in the region. It was this selfsame position that led him in contact with Maurice, and the start of a year-long planning and coordination to hand over the Island to the OFN on a silver platter.\n\nOf course, it didn't go as planned. Cautiously aware of the native subversion, and finding no ally in the civilians of the island the OFN could trust, Moorer was handed the "keys" to rebuild Madagascar into a worthwhile OFN ally. While to the outsider this seems like a promotion of the highest degree, for Moorer it could be nothing more than a stab in the back.\n\nThe population lays discontent, under the whims of another distant country. Diseases ravage the land, affecting both natives, and personnel alike, and the duties of nation building on the land fall squarely on the lap of a man of the sea.\n\nIf Thomas will rise up to the challenge up until the OFN trusts the nation with proper elections, or if the Mandate is doomed to be another unstable authoritarian government in the island, only time will tell."
 POLITICS_UNITED_COALITION_GOVERNMENT_DESC:0 "Many expected that Madagaskar would be the land Maurice would have breathe his last, cast down either by the German garrisons tired of his complacency, or a native population exhausted of his apathy and callousness towards their plight. However, justice for both was denied, as Maurice fled to the Americas, the OFN quickly took realms of the government, unilateraly abolishing the Reichskommissariat government for a new proposal, similar to the model in Iceland: a Mandate, spearheaded by the local OFN forces.\n\nHowever, it was not met without resistance. As the forces loyal to Germania flee west, communications up north become complete silent, and more and more of the "properly pacified" native military command of Madagascar become MIA, any plans for the Mandate have become delayed to weather the storm that is to come.\n\nWhatever plans they have, can only be seen to fruition if they survive in the first place."
 POLITICS_HANS_JOACHIM_SCHOEPS_OFN_DESC:0 "Hans-Joachim Schoeps is a man that was once passionate about his homeland, once humiliated in the First World War, rising from the ashes of a failing republic, to find pride in its identity as a German, and like many who once saw Hitler's passionate speeches in the 30s, became passionate with the Nazi ideal, even spearheading the "German Vanguard". If Hans was like any other passionate historian in Germany, certainly his career would be one of rise through the bureaucracy and society of the NSDAP.\n\nHowever, Hans, his family, and his vanguard were Jews. For all his praise and work for Hitler's budding party, his reward was exile to Sweden in 1938, his family and allies sent swiftly to deportation camps through the ages; yet he held steadfast to his beliefs, writing under pen names, praising the Germany and National Socialist values under Sweden and German-sympathetic magazines, until tracked in the 1950. Yet, to his surprise it was not a bullet or a ticket to a concentration camp that came to him, but an offer: a position in the newly instituted Reichskommissariat Madagaskar.\n\nHe knew it wasn't an offer, as much as a threat. Yet, the chance to once again be in good graces with Germany, and with nothing to lose anymore, he set to the distant island, where he would gaze upon, for ten years, malaria-ridden villages, the degradation of the German Ideal to irrationality and corruption, inner bickering and cliques over what was, by all means, a failed colony of a corroded institution.\n\nThe Reich failed Germany, an opinion that Schoeps kept to his chest, and perhaps that's what both saved him once the OFN stepped in, and put him in charge of a newly borne Republic of Malagasy. Schoeps has no love for democratic institutions, and neither the OFN itself, but here in Malagasy, he can put in practice the values he once saw as the cornerstone of a true Germany.\n\nGermania may regret the choice of sparing him for Malagasy is now his theoretical experiment, to shape a Germany from seemingly nothing."

 MAD_the_red_island:0 "붉은 섬"
 MAD_the_red_island_desc:0 "Madagaskar would to many seem to be the strangest place in the Reich, at least if anyone in the Reich paid attention to it. Reichskommissar Maurice is a man sitting in a very precarious position, between allegiance to Germany, and allegiance to the CIA. Meanwhile, the Generalbüro für Madagassische Angelegenheiten is in actuality the organ that manages the Island, with very, very little to no oversight from the Reichskommissar.\n\nAt the same time, Malagasy rebels are giving both the garrison and the GMA constant headaches with crimes done with weapons they shouldn't have. The significant minority of Jews in the north, which the Reichskommissariat was constructed to contain, have also been a major issue, as they continue strikes on the central government. The garrison itself is a militarist hive of men who believe the Reichskommissar is corrupt.\n\nThe Red Island is unstable, but for now, we should be able to keep it under control, unless something throws a wrench in the proceedings."

Food has been heavily rationed, and more and more unrest grew as we simply couldn't do anything to stop the rebels.\n\nNow the blockade has been lifted, we can at last be free of the limitations put upon us. We have the opportunity to cancel rationing, to work on our extensive infrastructure projects, to build unbelievable things! However, rumours have been travelling that it's Reichskommissar Maurice's supposed connections to the CIA that has caused the blockade to be brought down.

Giant buildings to mark that the Reich can bring light to the darkest corners of the Earth! Bridges, railways, oh my! However, as the blockade came up and the materials reduced, the plans became less and less ambitious.\n\nNow that the blockade is down, we have plans to build some relatively small buildings in Toliara, as well as a single rail line connecting Toliara and Antananarivo. The Toliara Projects are not what they used to be, to be sure, but they certainly make clear the nature of the reich.

Everything from fishing zones to infrastructure reform is under the purview of the GMA, rather than the reichskommissar.\n\nThe Reichskommissar as of late has been talking to the American government, something that the GMA picked up on very quickly. While the GMA is in a stable position, if the secret gets out beyond basic rumours the GMA is going to be in serious trouble, as will the island of Madagascar itself.

The central issue surrounding this is that the garrison is already limited and overstretched, and now that the blockade has fallen, we must do everything we can to protect our infrastructure projects. So one by one.\n\nFirst, the Jews. The grand "Madagascar Plan" was created by Franz Rademacher, the minister for Jewish affairs in the foreign policy office in 1940. The plan was simple. Ship Jews to Madagascar, and see them suffer and die of starvation and disease from the strange flora and fauna of the island. But strangely, they prospered in the new climate, and have been haunting the Madagaskar garrison and government ever since.\n\nThen, the Malagasy. To claim that the GMA wasn't expecting resistance from the natives of the island would be an understatement. Everything has been tried, and everything has failed. Infiltrators, assaults on bases, daily patrols. We don't even know where they get their weapons.\n\nWe will do what we can to handle both of these threats. We can only hope something won't go wrong."

While many have doubts that this shall make the government more effective in handling threats, many are supportive of this idea, thinking that at the very least Milch would stop opposing Maurice at every step of the way."

No matter how much he tries to serve the Reich, it has never dealt him a good hand, and time after time he has fallen in stature and grace.\n\nHowever, he leads the garrison on Madagaskar, and thus, we must work with him in order to get some damn stability on this godforsaken island. He'll be talking to us, and to the Reichskommissar on the subject of military strategies.

But the truth is if they are contaminated, so too would the soldiers be, then their families and friends, then their communities, and so on.

Cutting the rat population on our isle to near extinction would do wonders for limiting the spread of the plague, however many have called this plan crude in its conception and brutal in its goal.

While some have again raised issue with the brutality of this plan and the destruction it could invoke on the very land we govern, most view it as a necessary sacrifice to prevent the spread of plague.

 MADAGASKAR.2.t:0 "The United States lifts the blockade"
 MADAGASKAR.2.desc:0 "A most unusual order had come in to the American fleet blockading Madagascar. Specifically, their order was to stop blockading Madagascar. There was much speculation among the crews in the following days about the sudden shift in policy. One popular theory was that rising tensions in mainland Africa were the culprit, either causing the American government to back down or to consolidate strength elsewhere. Others suggested that they were just too expensive. A few even had wild theories about secret deals between the Reichskommissar and the United States. The only thing they all agreed on was that Madagascar would be changing quite a lot, and soon."
 MADAGASKAR.2.a:0 "A new era?"

 MADAGASKAR.3.t:0 "New Dawn"
 MADAGASKAR.3.desc:0 ""It's over for the Reichskommissar. He's days away from pulling out entirely. The Americans... they're ready to evacuate him at any second. The fucking Americans. Pulling out a fullblown Nazi. You know that he used to drive Hitler's motorcade around?"\n\n"That'll be enough. You'll be off our payroll after your final payment comes through. You're free to go."\n\nGabriel thought to the tune of clacking boots walking out of the small, makeshift office. The idea of the CIA interfering was frightening, but it shouldn't affect the situation too much. As he gazed through his office window, the city was already bare of inhabitants. Even if the US interfered, they would not find much to interfere with.\n\n"You couldn't make this shit up." Gabriel thought but did not say.\n\nInstead, he pulled the phone out and talked to his secretary, asking for one of the officers in his soon to be army. Of course, they were not officially enlisted, but the German occupation wasn't official in his eyes as well. The whole world would be privy to that thought soon enough, thought Gabriel.\n\n"You called for me sir?"\n\n"Have our soldiers march north. Our succession will be stable enough if we do it at the right time, and the right time is now. Tell them to keep the uniforms, I want to have them burning when I declare our succession. Be quick about it, time is money."\n\nThe soldier said not a word, but his dumb grin that was etiched from cheekbone to cheekbone said all Gabriel needed to know. The soldier left, leaving Gabriel to the silence of his office once more. It was good to put things in motion now. It wouldn't be long until everything else fell into place.\n\nGabriel eyed up the printed telegram sent from the Kenpeitai headquarters in Tokyo. It read of Japan's firm commitment to independence in not just Madagascar, but across Africa and the Indian Ocean as well. It reeked of hypocrisy, especially with the context Gabriel was intelligent enough to pick up on. But with the Germans choosing one side and the Americans the other, what other option did they have?"

 MADAGASKAR.4.t:0 "Outbreak"
 MADAGASKAR.4.desc:0 "Following the flood of cases that Toliara Hospital received, a quick investigation was launched into the exact scale and impact of the apparently plague outbreak. Teams were sent into the countryside, hopeful that they would find all to be mostly well and could report back that the issue was practically already solved.\n\nThis is not what they found. Instead, they found entire villages had come down with the plague, and those few that were not yet contaminated were attempting to isolate themselves and often tried to turn away the investigative teams for fear of infection, sometimes violently. It was not clear how far, exactly, the plague had spread on the island. What was clear was that where it had spread, it had spread quickly and completely, devastating local communities. This was much, much worse than they had feared."
 MADAGASKAR.4.a:0 "This could be bad."

 MADAGASKAR.5.desc:0 "Moorer watched as the last of the essential personnel and Malagasy refugees loaded into the last feries, planes and helicopters destined for the US Navy detachment resting a few miles off the shore of America's last toehold in Madagascar. While he volunteered to take the last helicopter out from the port, he knew that little act of bravery would do little to soothe his superiors once he returned to America.\n\n"We tried, didn't we?"\n\n"Sorry sir?"\n\nMoore glanced at the officer standing next to him. He looked as weary as he did. "We tried to free these people, didn't we? Now they'll be left to whatever the Germans have in store for them."\n\n"The native government can still pull through."\n\n"I hope so. They deserve better than what I fear will come to pass."\n\nThe officer didn't have a remark to that, and Moorer didn't need him to have one. He was busy enough pondering what was to be done with America's failed governor. Demotion would be a light sentence, he thought. How did he fail? What did he do wrong?\n\nMoore almost didn't step onto that last little helicopter, only urged on by the officer by his side. It was all he could do to not cry as the aircraft shuttled him away from Madagascar."

Most said little of anything as they were helped onto the thin strip of metal that made up the top of the submarines, and silently filed in through the unsubmerged ladders.\n\nThe last of the dinghies came through as the submarines at the front of the fleet re-submerged, the only trace of their existence being the few bubbles that had been kicked up by their departure.\n\n"Commander!"\n\nIt was the Akagi, the submarine next to his. One of his captains was waving him over, forming a phone symbol with his hands. Kane allowed the sailors of his vessel to finish off with the boarding, and made his way back inside, finding the radio operator's quarters. He was phoned into Captain Hiroto's ship, and spoke into the speaker.\n\n"Did you find the ranking officer, Hiroto?"\n\n"I did. The commander of the unit, Commander Kane, answered most of the questions you dolled out. The archives have been fried, and he mentioned that the... the collaborators are sure to not sell us out. He asked us not to inquire further about that, and that he would rather talk of that whole affair to an army official."\n\nCommander Kane, the navy officer, allowed the radio operator to finish off the call, and made for the rooms allocated for the soldiers. They talked in hushed whispers,  and almost didn't respond to verbal addresses. Kane knelt in front of one of the soldiers, lightly touching his right shoulder.\n\n"Your unit was tasked with eradicating any evidence of our involvement with the native government. Can you tell me something about the operation? I would especially like to know about any personnel involved in the affair."\n\nThe soldier's blank expression was off putting to Kane, but told him everything he needed to know. The man began to open his mouth, even forming his first word, but Kane shut him down.\n\n"Nevermind, I think I can extrapolate. You did good work. Japan is in your debt.""

The commander of what remained of the German garrison forces was a sorry sight indeed; he was drenched in sweat and wearing a dirty, poorly-kept officer's uniform that had clearly not been made with jungle warfare in mind.\n\nMilch finally stopped in his tracks. "What's the situation with Hirschfeld's unit? Have they broken through?" A silence overtook the officers standing before Milch. They were all too aware that whoever spoke first would become the target of the field marshal's rage. "Have you all gone deaf?! Speak, damn you!"\n\nGeneral Werner Goldberg was first to muster his courage. "Hirschfeld could not comply with your orders, sir. He has requested permission to withdraw from his position before he is overrun."\n\nMilch responded to Goldberg's statement by hurling an empty coffee cup at him. "This is what you have to tell me?! What has the German army come to, shitting their trousers like meek women when faced with a force of uncivilized apes?!" Milch's face turned red as a beet as he descended into fury. "I want Hirschfeld to get his ass over here, so I can shoot that weasel myself!"\n\nThe field marshal's mad rant came to a halt as Goldberg stepped forward, coming face-to-face with his superior. "Do you have a fucking death wish, Goldberg?! Get out of my-" Without warning, Goldberg drew his service pistol and planted five shots into Milch's chest. The old general cried out in pain as he fell to the floor clutching his wounds. Goldberg took a few more steps, looking down at the wounded Milch with little remorse. Milch opened his mouth in an attempt to formulate words, but only pained gurgling came out. After one final shot brought Milch's life to an end, Goldberg turned to his comrades."

The fires were out now, but the scar would show even after the area was rebuilt. If it even was rebuilt, with how strained the GMA was.\n\nHe didn't understand. He'd thought that the GMA's efforts had weakened the resistance. Nearly destroyed it, even. They'd been working for years to hunt down cells, isolate people who were suspected of having connections, and stamp out resistance at any point. They'd been fighting rebels for as long as he'd been part of the garrison, and they'd been fighting hard. Somehow, it had done nothing. If anything, this only proved the rebels were stronger than ever. Brecher had put years of his life into trying to cement German rule here. And now, it felt like they were back to square one."

He struck that light and brought it to the end of cigars, pulling smoke down his throat and into his lungs. He didn't know if his eyes were watering from the smoke, or the landscape that he was currently viewing. All along the ridgeline was a desolate forest. Some of the trees smouldered away, blackened husks of a torched land, some merely had scorch marks across their trunks, almost devoid of the smaller branches. He couldn't see a patch of green in the entirety of the forest, nor the villages that had dwelt by the base of the forest. Those houses had the same treatment, only somehow worse.\n\nMoore knew he had played his role in this devastation. He had caused the war in this country to go from bad to worse. His nation fought the native government. The natives. What justice was there in that? A grim faced officer approached Moorer from the stream of trucks descending the dirt road, flowing through the ashen village like a river. "Admiral Moorer, Commander Alfred is on the line for you."\n\nThe admiral followed his junior officer away from the village, leaving his thoughts behind. They didn't do him any good now; he could leave those for his journal, or perhaps a memoir of some sort. The man led him through the barracks, mostly abandoned aside from the medical station. The men who defended this area had all packed up in the trucks that had departed moments ago, but that medical bay would still be in action for a long time. As he walked by the bay, he caught a glimpse of a child, no older than eight, his forearm covered in a bandage, soaked through with blood. He clung to the doctor in front of him, sobbing into his arm.\n\nIt didn't matter what circumstances led to this moment. "Let bygones be bygones." Moorer thought. "This is real." He would do whatever it took to mend this shitty situation, no matter how slow or miniscule his efforts might be."

Even as remnants of their foes took refuge in remote countryside or fled across the sea, cinders of villages struggled to rebuild and weary men returned from the war to cities under repair, the people were happy and free. The plaza at the center of the capital was no exception. A festival had overtaken the square and the people rejoiced there, despite much of the city's historic skyline being broken up by the buildings that still bore the scars of war.\n\nA group of Japanese officials, military, government and business alike, gathered in a building overlooking the festivities, backs lit up by the city's joyous lights filtering in through the window into the dim room wherein they discussed what to do next. As his colleagues spoke, a general absentmindedly swirled his drink in its glass, looking down at the excited and thankful masses. Japanese flags were about as common as Madagascaran ones, and he couldn't help but roll in the praise. One of the politicians startled him, "I don't like this." He said, approaching his side as his gaze shifted down toward the crowd.\n\nThe general glanced over with a raised eyebrow, "What do you mean? We've won! Look at them, they love us, they celebrate their freedom!" He said, struggling to conceal the slur in his voice.\n\n"That's the issue. If you'd been listening, I've been speaking with our colleagues about the new government they've arranged. It... does not align with our interests."\n\n"Damn shame. I doubt they'll survive on their own."\n\n"I think you misunderstood why I brought this up. We need to make sure they align with us, and that may take some desperate measures.

He had won, yes; but now what? Germania wasn't answering his calls, which meant that he was stuck on this godforsaken island for the time being, left to twiddle his thumbs, reflect, and eventually drink himself to death. Such a situation, he thought, would probably only end when Germania would become sane again; but he truly had no idea whether it would take a day or a decade before he could finally come home.\n\nIf the only way out was apathy, then he might as well give up entirely, he brooded as he poured himself a glass of whiskey.

What do you suggest we do?"\n\nOr maybe not, Milch thought with a renewed anger. No more indifference, and no more letting himself go. He wasn't gonna be another Maurice, another empty shell of a man who was content with crying himself to sleep every night and letting the oh-so-numerous problems grow in size eternally. He was gonna be the man Germania had sent him here to be, for the time of apathy was over.\n\n"I don't mind you interrupting me for such important news," answered Milch with an uncharacteristic pleasantness.

The two men talked of war, battles, skirmishes, industry, weapons and guns. Destruction was all Kane's world was, but even he took a liking to Gabriel. It almost brought Kane to tears when he received the report.\n\nIt had come to him deep into the night, with a bright red marker reading "CLASSIFIED" plastered on the front of it. Gabriel had been assassinated by Japanese secret agents, but that was never to be made public. Anywhere, under the penalty of death. News broke quickly enough. The US imperialists couldn't abide by the oppressed succeeding, establishing their own nation, so they made one final blow against the infant Malagasy Republic. Gabriel had more use as a martyr than a ruler, it seemed.\n\nIt was almost too much for Kane to step back into what had been Gabriel's office. The room had been completely refurbished for Didier Ratsiraka, the new president of Madagascar, elected in following the discontent of Gabriel's passing. He wanted a report on most activities that he and Gabriel had in store until his untimely death, but Kane knew better than that. He was being tested. "I'm told that you and Gabriel had quite the relationship over your months spent together. Have no fear, the operative used to assassinate him has been put to justice." Didier relaxed into his chair, a sly little slim spread across his face.\n\nKane gave the Malagasy president his report as quickly as possible. It wouldn't do for Didier's first impression of Kane to be a soldier with a soft heart. He stepped into the army jeep, telling the driver to make for the army barracks, thinking to himself as the vehicle sped through the city. Madagascar was firmly implanted in the Sphere, and Gabriel's death would do nothing but reinforce this fact."

Just what were we thinking, establishing a Reichskommissariat in Madagaskar? There's nothing there but spiders and tropical diseases!" Speer sighed as he slouched into his chair. "This damned island. We need to fix this."\n\nKiesinger leaned forward in his seat. "I'll be blunt, my Führer, Afrika has been a disaster for the Reich no matter which way you look at it. If you ask me, it would be for the best to just ignore Madagaskar all together and pretend it never happened. We have enough to worry about here in Germany, after all."\n\n"Madagaskar is ours by right, and you know I'd never hear the end of it if I abandoned German territory, no matter how distant or useless it is. Perhaps we should give that hardhead Milch a call." Speer scratched his chin. That old bastard certainly wouldn't be easy to deal with.\n\nThe Deputy Führer raised an eyebrow. "Erhard Milch? You do realize he is loyal to Göring, not you? It would be wise to throw our weight behind him. I don't believe entangling ourselves on Madagaskar is wise, but if you truly wish to do so, we need to take Milch out of the picture."\n\nSpeer didn't want to admit it, but Kiesinger's words held a great deal of merit. Africa had proven time and time again to be a poor investment, and yet, what would the rest of the party think if their Führer began to let go of the Fatherland's rightful conquests?

He had read the reports; Erhard Milch was many things, but he had never struck Schoeps as being particularly suicidal, and certainly not the type to shoot himself three times in the back and fling himself out a window. The general's connections to Speer's political enemies was well-known, and therefore it wouldn't be out of the question that his "suicide" was anything but.\n\nOn the other hand, Schoeps began to realize that this could be a golden opportunity.

The compound stank, courtesy of the gunpowder used to shoot suspected plague victims at the nearby field hospital, a smell complimented only by that of burning paper - the colony's classified documents - but Maurice could hardly take note of the stench.\n\nAmidst all this, the Reichskommissar was chiefly concerned with finding the telephone landline which military maps indicated was somewhere nearby. He had made sure that Stoph was engaged in the futile task of reorganizing the irredeemably stupid who refused to desert into a force capable of delaying the enemy. With the chief engineer of the colony - an SS sergeant - none the wiser to his objectives, Maurice ordered him to hook up the telephone he had hurriedly salvaged from his Toamasina office, and then dismissed the man. Once he was gone, the man who had once been Adolf Hitler's best friend pulled out the brown folio given to him by Admiral Moorer. Hastily skimming through the files to the tune of a not so far off shooting of a plague victim, Maurice finds the number for the Americans intermediary in Madagascar. While the faint thunder of artillery begins to creep into the Reichskommissar's audible range, Maurice inputs the numbers into the rotary telephone. His call is answered by a man who confirms his role as Moorer's middleman after a password is exchanged.\n\n"Tell Admiral Moorer I..."

Huey Lundstrom, in spite of legitimately being unaware of the answer to the question, was ready to pull the trigger on his M-14 regardless. In front of him, a scrawny man with grey hair stood out, desperate not to get shot, but not so much as to raise his hands, for he knew that he would live.\n\n"Calm down you moron, we are here for him." Lundstrom's superior officer, much to his own disappointment, had to stop any notion of shooting the man with the swastika armband and SS uniform. "Mr. uh - Maurice? It's time to go now." For the first time in years, Maurice was giddy with excitement, as he gleefully helped himself to the American's PT boat, which took him to the battleship USS Iowa, anchored just a few miles away.\n\nAs the Iowa sailed back to the OFN base at Cocos Island, Lundstrom was put on guard duty at the signals compartment. Soon after he got there, the sailor in charge of the decryptor handed him over a piece of paper, "get it to Captain Becton, will you." Having nothing better to do, Lundstrom got on his merry way, stopping along the junction between the officers mess hall and the bridge.

After all, when would they have the chance to see history again? When would there be something this fantastic again coming out of Australia?\n\n"Emil Maurice," the television sputtered. Sonny leaned forward, his eyes fixed on a man cloaked in dark robes and static. On either side of him were symbols of justice and authority-the emblem of the OFN, flags of its member countries. The flag of the United States loomed largest. "For your role in Madagascar, Military Tribunal I has found and adjudged you guilty of War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity, membership in an organization declared criminal..."\n\nThe charges went on as Sonny clapped his hands together and cheered, startling his children. He watched as the camera switched perspective to a pathetic man in grey prisoner's robes. He watched as the camera focused on his hollow, gaunt face. He watched as the man choked back tears and began to mouth something made almost indecipherable by the poor signal. "You promised," said the man, repeating a lie that had become all too familiar over the course of the trial. "I did everything I was supposed to. They said if I helped..."\n\nBut the judges showed no sign of caring, just as they had in the weeks of testimony that preceded. The court had wheeled out witness after witness describing the Nazi's sins, how he had sought out his position in Madagascar and orchestrated every atrocity. The prosecution had even shown lurid pictures of the man and Hitler together, pictures that inspired jeering and disgust from the trial's supposedly impartial overseers. Not that it mattered to Sonny whether the trial was fair or not. He was just glad to see America fighting the brownshirts.\n\nWith all exhaustion now gone, the Daniels family now watched as the lead judge looked down at the quivering defendant.

Although they saluted him, the mismaching uniforms and probably dysfunctional guns they showed off while guarding the two columns on the entrance to the building made them almost a parody of military discipline. It was only after he went in that he realized one of them had a French Adrian helmet instead of a German model. Stoph shook his head. "Can't get any worse than this."\n\nHowever, Stoph soon found out he was wrong. Walking into the meeting, he found the GMA council in an absolute panic. "Wilhem, where the fuck have you been?" Horst von Oppenfeld's voice traveled across the room and hit Stoph quite suddenly. After composing himself, Stoph responded with the obvious, "Maurice sent me to organize the army, Horst. Didn't he tell you?" The assembled leadership of the colony looked at him as if he'd claimed martian ancestry. "Maurice is gone, he's vanished." A cold sweat struck Stoph at that moment. If they couldn't offer the Reichskommissar's head to the rebels, their ass would be on the line.\n\nNo sooner had Stoph joined the bickering GMA colleagues in discussion what to do, than the conscript with the Adrian helmet rushed in, handed over a note, and left. Von Oppenfeld had to read it outloud to believe it.\n\n"This is Admiral Moorer of the OFN's Indian Ocean Command. Reichskommissar Maurice is under our protection.

The city he lived and fought for had seemingly rebounded from the days of the ancient Bubonic Plague, and life had finally begun to return to the streets of the city. This was his home now, not Germany. He had been labelled a traitor and sent away to the far side of the world, but all that didn't matter now.\n\nHe could walk the streets without noticing the fear the population had of his dark grey uniform, how they silently slunk away from his gaze, never even making eye contact. The few words they said were quick, filled with stutters and full of apologies for any perceived minor misdemeanor. Now, he could talk and laugh and joke with the people he now, finally, represented. He could sit amongst them in restaurants and bars, sit beside them in cars and planes. It was all and more than he wished for all those years ago when he was first flown down into Madagascar.\n\n"And it was only just the beginning."

The OFN managers hadn't wanted it to be called a camp, but the name caught on quickly enough by Andry's fellow citizens that it didn't matter.

What was their reward for their unwavering commitment to the German cause? They got discarded off and shunned into exile away in the decrepit isle of Madagascar. In that very isle, he saw corruption fester in every crease, and mismanagement rots all sense of development in the colony; any remaining shred of belief in the NSDAP had been shattered.\n\nSchoeps left his chair and walked towards the open window. Peace may have been brought to Madagascar but it still remained far from tranquil. The fading screams of those inflicted by that insidious plague could still be heard from a distance, corruption continued to rot the heart of the republic, and many parts of the republic continue to lack any formal sense of authority. However, all of that would change, the Americans gave him the job and he would gladly take it, even if it was under their false pretences of "democracy", an utterly foolish concept rooted in ignorance and populism.
