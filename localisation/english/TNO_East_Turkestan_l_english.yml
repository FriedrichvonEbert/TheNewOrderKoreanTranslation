 ### Events ###

 etr.1.t:0 "The Black Wolf"
 etr.1.d:0 "Despite his age, Muhammad Amin Bughra has not lost his fire. The old man raised the flag of the First Uprising up high on the mosques of Kashgar, preaching to the masses that Allah willed the Turks to unite again under one banner, that all of Central Asia was to be, one day, dominated by the Turks once again. He told the story of the glory of the First Uprising and the tales told to Turkic children across the world, reigniting the fires of Pan-Turkism within the populace. No longer, he said, would the Turkic peoples be oppressed under their overlords.\n\nIt was time to take action, to take back the homeland."
 etr.1.a:0 "Mashallah!"

 etr.2.t:0 "The Second East Turkestan Republic"
 etr.2.d:0 "It has been over a decade since the Second East Turkestan Republic was created. In a revolution dubbed Liberation Day in 1946, Isa Yusuf Alptekin and a number of influential revolutionaries declared independence in Kashgar.\n\nNow, after many years, the ETR is stuck in a perpetual war with the Chinese province of Xinjiang, with frequent skirmishes and battles. Zhang Zhizhong cannot hold out forever, and he is growing old, as well as the leaders of the ETR. One day, one faction will eventually win and declare a new age for Xinjiang, and that day is coming soon..."
 etr.2.a:0 "Inshallah!"

 etr.3.t:0 "The Raid of Aksu"
 etr.3.d:0 "Another day, another raid. This time, a devastating one. Our forces have struck the Chinese garrison of Aksu City once again, almost forcing down their defenses. A sandstorm, however, and the arrival of reinforcements from the East, have forced us to retreat."
 etr.3.a:0 "We'll come again..."

 etr.4.t:0 "Muhammad Amin Bughra Speaks"
 etr.4.d:0 "The old Pan-Turkic Jadidist Muhammad Amin Bughra, a veteran of the first uprising and held in high regards by the current government, has spoken in front of a large crowd in Kashgar. He has endorsed the movement of the new ETR, and calls for a unification of all the Turks, from Eastern Europe to Central Asia. His rousing speech inspired many, and his message of Pan-Turkism reached ears all across Kashgar and Khotan."
 etr.4.a:0 "Inspiring!"
