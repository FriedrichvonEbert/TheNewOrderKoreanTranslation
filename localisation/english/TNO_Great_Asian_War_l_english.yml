 gaw.200.d:0 "The war ended where it began. Deep inside a Manchurian forest, a shot rang out. A Japanese man lay dead. And then all was silent.\n\nA few young lives were lost, of course, to the bullet. So many more were lost to the consequences of the bullet. The looting, the rape, the disease. It was as if a great monsoon had swept over the whole of Asia, and then left as soon as it appeared. The roads were in disrepair, the cities in ruin. Families could do nothing but lick their wounds and mourn the dead. The government could do little more. The war was over, at least.\n\nThe scars would remain. The Chinese marched through the streets of the north. They hid the blood. They were victorious, after all! What was there to hide?\n\nThe Japanese could not even afford this luxury. The cities had been bombed to rubble. The empire they once held was dead. In Tokyo, words of revolution rumble, but they are hollow. There is nothing to revolt against. Japan, or the Japan the world knew, is dead."

 gaw.201.d:0 "Most were reluctant to leave. They were Japanese immigrants to the region, but they may as well have been natives. About half had been born there to Japanese parents. The other half moved in during the emigration pushes after the Second World War. Beauracracies shifted, but they were still as slow as ever. It all culminated in the raising of a new flag. The Chinese occupation had begun. Surprisingly, the populace was quiet. In the end, the Japanese were not popular. They only catered to the rich businessmen and those who could keep feeding the government cash."

 gaw.303.d:0 "A great parade had marched into Shanghai, and they brought rejoice with them. As the soldiers waltzed in, they were met with young women dashing out their doors to flirt with the handsome privates and officers. Aging veterans from the old war walked out to greet the army men in their old Communist and Kuomintang uniforms. Once the Chinese had gotten close enough, the Japanese just left. By boat and foot, they fled because they couldn't win the battle. Not with popular support, already dismal, quckly turning violent. Not with well-trained troops willing to die for Zhongguo rushing in. And so the Chinese were not met with bombs and guns, but with the happiness of a population long oppressed now freed.\n\nBut all was not well in the jewel of the Yellow Sea. From the top of the skyscrapers they once owned, businessmen plummeted with abandon. To onlookers below, it looked as if it was raining the corpses of their former overlords."

 gaw.304.d:0 "The rain picked up, and for the first time in a thousand nights, the clubs of Shanghai went silent. A tense atmosphere rose over the city, and the specter of war seemed to grip it. Thousands simply packed up their bags and left. By the end of the day, all that could be heard was the pounding of the rain, like artillery on a trench, the sound of bullets hitting dirt. Cafes in the French Concession closed and the Zaibatsus shut their doors. Gangsters formed truces and treaties, and beggars castrated themselves to the returning occupiers.\n\nNobody was safe. In every quarter of the city, doors came slamming down and soldiers rushed in, eager for a cut. Women were raped with abandon, and any protesting were shot. As the grand looting commenced, word quickly got around the endless slums, through messengers no more than teenagers."
