 #desert_plateau_desc: "§F--------------§!\n§L"데스 밸리"는 부정확한 명칭입니다. 실제 미 서남부는 다양한 생물이 살고 있으며 복잡한 생태계가 구축되어 있습니다. 진정한 "데스 밸리", 죽음의 고원이라고 하면 아타카마 사막이 그 이름을 가질 수 있을 것입니다.\n\nAmong the the hottest places on Earth in the day, and among the coldest at night, the Atacama is one of the most unlivable ecosystems on Earth; south of the town of María Elena, it is supposed by modern science that there is literally zero non-human life. However, despite the aridity, despite the temperature flux, despite the thin air from the elevation, the Atacama is one of the most starkly beautiful places on the planet. It is trite to compare it to an alien world, and yet, there is no better comparison to make. It is not a place meant for human life, and to gaze upon the endless badlands is to gaze upon the forbidden face of God.§!"
