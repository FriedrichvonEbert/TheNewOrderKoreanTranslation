General John Lavelle opened the conference to all the representatives present, emphasizing his wish for a peaceful withdrawal of troops across the Mandate, along with the return of all American prisoners. His speech, short and simple, gathered applause from all present.\n\nFirst to speak was Jorge Sangumba, arguing for his group of freedom fighters to establish a transitional government led by UNITA before elections began to rebuild the most damaged and uncontrolled regions of the country. Next was Iko Carreira, whose MPLA clique promised to provide a more leftist government for the Angolan people, whose lives and wealth had been squandered by prior regimes. When Iko finished his declaration, a UNITA leader questioned the legitimacy of immediate post-independence elections, when there was much work to be done outside of Luanda's political circles.\n\nThe days wore on as more groups took to the podium to offer their answers to the future of the Mandate, and blocs began to form around the two major parties.

While a far more risky option than either of the two main blocs, the general could choose one of the smaller and more flexible leaders, though such a decision could lead to nothing short of an escalation of conflict. Had Angola not seen enough bloodshed?\n\nRetiring to his quarters, the general heard the representatives squabbling among themselves, unaware the burden of their future lay on his shoulders, not theirs!\n\nDawn came, and as Lavelle stepped up to the podium, he took a deep breath.\n\n\"In the interests of the OFN Mandate of Angola, I will support the transitional government of...\""

While the territory fell under Muller's tyranny, it had been considered part of Portuguese Angola for much time before, and would be a boon to the soon-to-be country's economy.\n\nThe issue lay in that while plans were already in motion to make a free, American-friendly Cabinda to get cheap oil, both the MPLA and UNITA desired to incorporate both the region and its oil, a move Washington would most likely ignore or contend with. General Lavelle mulled over the maps sprawled before him, hoping some answer would come forth to him.\n\nHe heard a sharp rap on the door.

The Angolans seemed happy enough - no more tanks and bombers in their towns. He'd taken a bullet in his knee from some sniper, God knows which side. Was it for nothing? Was having to go home to Akron with a cane like some retiree all he got from months of wading through forests and villages with twenty different rebel factions aiming to kill?\n\nHe climbed aboard the transport plane, and peered out from a window to see a small truck carrying at least a dozen young boys, chanting and flying their flag. They stopped and drove circles, hoisting the banner up as it was consumed in a cloud of dust. Maybe, he mused, the reward was that they wouldn't have to take a bullet."

Eventually, this contest erupted into all out armed conflict across the region (See attached documents 2b and 5c for relevant information). Attempts to broker a longer term ceasefire on the part of General Lavelle with UNITA's Jonas Savimbi and Agostinho Neto on behalf of the MPLA fell flat almost immediately. Both sides made clear to the general that they were no longer interested in keeping the peace (General Lavelle's debrief of this meeting is attached; document 2F).\n\nFollowing this meeting, the general ordered all OFN forces to avoid hostilities with either faction, and even ordered elements stationed in the Rundu and Lunda regions to return to Luanda (General Lavelle's directive attached; document 1E). Unfortunately, this seems to have only bought us a small break; within a week UNITA and MPLA guerrillas were ambushing our convoys and assaulting villages we had announced as under our protection. A rapid deterioration of our control in the region then followed, with numerous outposts across Angola falling under determined attacks that were successful in forcing OFN forces to fall back.\n\nAfter a few days of this, General Lavelle exercised his judgement and ordered a complete pull out of Angola. The Mandate was finished, and Lavelle was not willing to sacrifice the lives of his men for a lost cause."

We can't let our casualty numbers begin leaking out of the confines of our mandate, nor can we be seen spitting on the all-glorious legacy of American foreign intervention. We've gotta save face and there's only one man for the job. Decolonization of the Congo begins now, whether the brass back home like it or not.\n\nGeneral Abrams stood dour in the morning heat of Léopoldville square, where a meeting between him, his OFN advisors and whichever native representatives showed up would begin. The motorcade which had brought him here watched the street-corners eagle-eyed, snipers dotting the roofs of local buildings. Abrams' foot tapped against the soup-like air, waiting for just about anyone to show themselves. Looking downwards, Abrams' wondered if he was fucked beyond recognition. Only time would reveal this fact. Surely... surely, someone would come, right?\n\nIn the dry, boiling and still air, Abrams could make out a sharp thumping. A dash of shrieks, a sprinkle of explosions. Something... something terrible was on the horizon. Pacing anxiously now, Abrams prayed for anyone, ANYONE, to show themselves."

The grass dried in the still air, and shiny, black leather shoes slid along the boiling concrete below. Abrams' eyes glanced around, blotches of sweat breaking through the beige field jacket he had thrown on earlier in the morning. To the casual observer, he would more resemble an overweight gymnasium teacher than the overseer of a global alliance's mandate. Teetering anxiously in place, Abrams began to recite his good ol' stress cleanser, a traditional American speech, to those waiting around him. \"Y'know, there is something to be said for the American spirit, to stomach the goddamned horrors of the 'Dark Continent' all in the name of some vague and hazy war of ideology, war of superpowers over some dirt, stones and liquid gold. And to not only stomach that, but to stomach caring for these bone-broken birds we call African peoples and tribes, even when they bite us for the freedom we grant 'em.\"\n\nAs Abrams' flabby jaw yapped on, and a crowd of locals formed around Abrams to witness their 'savior' in person, the motorcades of who were to come finally got to showing themselves. First was that quiet, slim but tall fella, Jacques Opangault, representing the uh... Parti Démocratique Orungu, was it? Them traditionalist-types, French bootlickers as some would say. \"As me and my fellows say back home, these are times of judgement, but I can't see a damn thing I've done wrong! Look at this one, Oh-pung-nut, huh? This. This is what the next generation of African patriots is gonna look like. Ain't you dedicated, son?\" On trudged Alphonse Massamba-Débat, representative of the Brazzavillian National Unity Party. Average-looking fella I suppose, but Abrams knew he had that communist, 'anti-imperialist' bite lurking behind his soft smile. Then came Justin Marie Bomboko, of Mouvement National Congolais fame, Lumumba's party. Abrams knew as soon as he saw the lil', scrunched-up fella, he was just Lumumba's pack mule.\n\n\"But let me assure you all.\" Abrams wagged about a pork sausage finger. \"We got honor, and it is our duty to see everyone-a ya get REAL freedom, the type you can feel rumblin' in your gullet, or in your prayers.\" Out from the now-heavier crowd slithered forth Jean Schramme. A white man taking part in Africa's negotiations. All for the sake of plantations, managed by Belgian colonial remnants. Needless to say, the other representatives, Massamba-Débat especially, were giving him the stink-eye every movement he propelled towards. \"Now, let's get this shitshow over with...\" Abrams remarked, as he led the way towards a courthouse turned dealing-room."

It was orderly and all for a little while, even whenever Schramme was around... somehow. They took their seats, talked all nice and fulfilled whatever acts o' diplomacy were asked of them. Great, whatever. What matters is the meat and po-tatas, policy talk, and first to come up was the status of those Brazzavillians in Gabon, or, Orungu as those natives were callin' it now. The chuckle-worthy part of this all was how the situation on the ground wasn't even on the brink of disaster, like the rest of the Congo. The Brazzavillians got along with their neighbors, and why wouldn't they? But, as always, there's politics in those fellows' races.\n\nThe Orungun fellows, the PDO, despite ass-kissing the OFN and OFN proxies all they could, got no restraint from those at the conference. French bootlickers, the other representatives called them, orangutans, as Abrams either mistakenly or very purposefully referred to them. With a still, but intelligent apprehension, the PDO moved for all of Orungu to be united, no matter the racial differences of the peoples therein. As far as Abrams could tell, there wasn't any real differences between them. \"Africans cling to their tribes, that's sure as hell.\" Abrams remarked. Following the PDO's statement, Massamba-Débat of the BNUP spoke up for the freedom of those Brazzavillians on the ground against the repeated colonial tyranny of the PDO. What's the difference between a Frenchie exploiting you, or an Orungun pretending to be a Frenchie? Abrams managed to follow their logic.\n\nWatching with his advisors the PDO and BNUP slug shit at each other through more and more verbal vomit, Abrams got to the real decision-making. Sure... we could grant those Brazzavillians independence, but do we really wanna weaken our lil' collaborators in the PDO? American interests take precedent over these bastards' sob stories, Abrams thought. Though, he didn't like the thought of yet another Congolese race war on his hands.

He arrived to a maelstrom of applause, of frightful joy and respect. Fashionably late, he had sent his toady Justin Marie Bomboko in his stead. But he was here now, and he was going to face the judgement of General Abrams head on. To the populace, he was a rockstar of Congolese liberation, to his political allies, he was a Pan-African firebrand. To Abrams and the OFN advisors who surrounded him, he was the greatest obstacle to America's vision for the Congo. Patrice Lumumba, and the MNC which had organized around Lumumba's words, prepared to fight for Africa's freedom despite the opposition of their 'liberators.'\n\nIndeed, he spoke with fire. Extolling a socialist, anti-colonial and Pan-African dream, Lumumba cried out for the present representatives to share his vision, to fight with him. In the dim lights of the courthouse, Lumumba's eyes could not be seen behind his glasses. The heat broke him into a heavy sweat, but though his suit and bowtie bent down with his dampening, Lumumba stood tall. This was his chance to turn the present representatives against their REAL enemy, to make them see who wanted to undermine their dreams of freedom to fulfill their capitalist greed. This enemy he spoke of was sitting off to the side of the courthouse, brow furrowed, wondering who was going to replace Lumumba as leader of the Congo. There was no doubt in Abrams' head, Lumumba had to go.\n\nOne of the OFN's advisors whispered in Abrams' ear of Joseph Kasa-Vubu. A man America could trust. A strongman. Patriot. \"But-\" came from the other advisors, \"there are rumors, not yet substantiated. Kasa-Vubu may have worked with Zentralafrika, perhaps even Müller himself.\" While normally not an issue, the Congolese citizenry would hate a collaborator on top, and the public back in the US even more so. Another, Joseph Iléo, was whispered of. Popular amongst the citizenry. Though, such a man could never have the same connections with the Congolese army Kasa-Vubu did.

The map, in comparison to those of earlier decades, was a story. Cities, nations, cultures and identities gone or clinging to the edge of the Congo Lake. Abrams recalled Africa from when he was but a child, and there was no hole in it. What those Nazi fuckers had done was an affront to God, to nature. Disgusting. The representatives in the courtroom circled around the just-placed map, which seemed to shimmer in the sunlight bleeding through the otherwise dim courtroom. The bony, elongated and clammy fingers of Abrams' OFN advisors stuck themselves to the entrance of the Congo Basin, around which was the Congo Dam. A dynamo of economic activity, of trade and hydroelectric power. The water pouring and roaring through its flood gates could kill armies and power nations. Of course, the instinct of Abrams and his advisors was to \"protect\" the dam with US forces, so as to keep it safe from \"rebels\" and anyone who might dare to challenge the economic opportunities the dam represented.\n\nJustin Marie Bomboko, who had stuck around even after Lumumba was rushed out, had a somewhat different instinct. Surely, he stated, if this new Congolese Republic was going to be a strong and influential ally of the US in the region, it needed control over the Congo Dam to keep its economy afloat in the oncoming hard times. The OFN advisors sneered but Abrams saw where Marie Bomboko was coming from. Sometimes, after all, it's just better to let go.\n\nCollapsing back into the chairs bordering the courtroom, Abrams' body tensed up in response to the hard rails along the chair's back. Forced into a compromising attitude, Abrams thought of a clever solution both the Africans and the boys back home could appreciate. Say, both OFN troops and the Congolese guarded the dam, split the profits and the hydroelectricity, we could all sing \"Kumbaya!\" The men around the courtroom were less enthused. A logistical nightmare is what it sounded like. The Orunguns too were eyeing the project, and could only be galvanized by a split defense force.

Night had fallen and the inferno of politics and deal-making was almost... almost finished. Abrams' advisors and those most able of the representatives were putting together a comprehensive group of treatises meant to break up the Congo into its constituent nations, once and for all. Though, something bothered Abrams as he watched his advisors grouped together, pouring into documents upon documents. A prominent and influential political figure who, despite showing up, had not yet presented their case. So, Abrams thought, their demands must be worth the wait. Abrams leaned his head over and gestured him forward. Jean Schramme, representative of the Belgian plantation owners reigning over Katanga, slithered forward. Pulling out a cigar to earmark the end of this ordeal, Abrams demanded \"Spit it out Sch-ram, I know you've got something to say.\"\n\nIn choppy, heavily-accented English, Schramme responded \"Katanga. Katanga is all.\"\n\n\"That's it, huh? A \"free\" Katanga, for you and your lil' Belgian buddies. You notice it, Sch-ram? A white man in a crowd of blacks, whole African stock. Whose leg do you think you're pulling? A lot of Nazi collab-or-a-tors is what you are. But... well, how much money are you and your friends gonna be providing your close 'allies' in the OFN?\"\n\nSchramme, somewhat dazed at the near-vomitous output of American-accented english, gathered his thoughts and stated \"...Money?\" before leaning in and whispering into Abrams' ear \"Much, much, much more than those Congo monkeys.\" Pulling outwards, Schramme flashed Abrams a glance of understanding before leaving the courtroom. It didn't take a genius to tell American interests were at stake. Abrams, leaning even further back for a suck on his cigar, pondered how his decisions would reshape the Congo for centuries to come."

The concrete of the courtyard shimmered under the all-encapsulating starry night, which hung above the heads of all those exhaustingly walking out from the courtroom. Pressed against the cameras and notepads of a few local journalists, Abrams told them the end of his mandate was upon them, and that they should spread his news. The journalists scattered to their bicycles, taking a few pictures of Abrams standing triumphantly in the glare of streetlights before leaving for the presses. Representatives took copies of the treatises with them, to be looked at with either satisfaction or scorn by the groups they represented. Usually scorn. Shoddily-printed copies would be attached to walls everywhere, to boards across the Congo for the groping eyes of the peasantry to stare at in joy but also confusion. In a single day and night the Congo was restructured totally, all under the guidance of a single man who, if historical sources are being honest, did not care as much as most people in such a position would.\n\nTaken in by the cold, black leather seats of his motorcade, Abrams breathed easy for the first time since he was appointed head administrator of the Congo. He breathed easy for a few seconds before breaking into a fit of deep and violent coughs. There was a gnawing pain in his chest. It had been a minor nuisance for a while but it had gotten desperately terrible as of late. Staring at his pack of cigars, Abrams clutched at his chest with a pained expression, praying for the dread to dissipate. How much longer did our self-styled nation-builder have? Abrams was beginning to wonder.\n\nAcross the Congo, in what would be the first and last time for centuries to come, every person from Orungun agricultural-workers, Congolese politicians to Belgian plantation owners, celebrated their independence day.

Throughout the room in which they had chosen to gather, dozens of voices shouted and spoke over one another. They needed to come to a consensus soon. The Congolese Republic, led by Patrice Lumumba, had laid claim to the lands that made up the former Central African Mandate. The CNP's newly established nation, the Federal Republic of the Congo, had done the very same. Now, as conflict seemed on the horizon, they needed a leader.\n\nThey had promised to select a leader that day. Joseph Kasa-Vubu had been their choice. A popular, energetic man, Kasa-Vubu had been one of the strongest advocates for total Congolese independence. Only hours before they were set to announce this, however, they had received striking news: Kasa-Vubu had defected, joining Lumumba's rival state. That was what had brought the CNP to this state of panic: The Americans were gone, the Republic seemed ready to invade any day, and their own leader had betrayed them. As the assembly struggled to find a new candidate, two possible leaders came to light.\n\nCyrille Adoula was one of the most prominent members of the Congolese National Party, and one of its strongest voices for change. A known supporter of trade unions and liberal democracy, Adoula is a candidate who will likely strive towards the vision America had tried to achieve with their mandate, before abandoning us. Not all agree with Adoula, however, and it is rumored disagreements with him caused Kasa-Vubu's defection.\n\nAnother, perhaps safer alternative, is Joseph Iléo. A conservative, Iléo is likely to be more in line with the Christian values of the Congolese. He furthermore is much more anti-colonialist, denouncing the American mandates as another attempt to enslave and colonize the free peoples of the Congo by uncaring powers a world away.

The forces at Quelimane were able to take an open road across the South African border where they were then able to regroup.\n\nBased on General Westmoreland's figures, the pullback operation went smoothly overall. Casualties were kept relatively low and most of our military equipment was pulled out or at least destroyed when that was impossible. The situation is still all together very unfortunate however and STRICOM stands ready to carry out your next orders.\nColonel Arthur Cayne,\nSTRICOM, African Department"

 OFN_AFR_DECOL_CAR.0.desc:0 "For the first time since the crucible of the Second World War, the United States of America entered into war. This was not a war for greed, or for power, or for hatred, we have all seen too much of those types of wars in recent years. No, this was quite a different kind of war altogether. It was a war to protect the innocent, and one to liberate the oppressed. I tell you that no more just war was ever fought on this planet than the one we fought in Africa. That was the reason that, once the dust had finally settled and we by God's grace emerged victorious, we had more than just the normal responsibility to clean up the debris of our fight. We had a mandate if you will, to undo the evils of Nazism in that continent, to prepare the people there to govern themselves just as our founders prepared us Americans to take control of our own destinies.\n\nIt is my pleasure to announce to the world that this mission has come to its successful conclusion. Thanks to the efforts of the OFN and local leaders across the continent, the All-African Summit has been a diplomatic success unparalleled in mankind's history. Never before have so many countries been granted their independence at one time, with such massive reverberations across the globe. We have rolled back the mistake of the Berlin Conference and furthered the aim of freedom around the world. I know many of you know me first and foremost as a warrior, but I am more proud of myself than I have ever been before when I consider that my name will be attached in history to such a monumental project of peace.\"\n\nAnd with that final flourish, Westmoreland's speech was finished. To say that the applause of the crowd covering the National Mall's grassy expanse was deafening would be an understatement. Hell, Westmoreland thought to himself, they could probably hear it in Germania. Taking a deep breath, the general moved to retake his seat, passing an assortment of fellow officers and politicians, the president included, as he did so. He noticed that they did not seem altogether happy. Disappointment was to be expected, he supposed. They had hoped for more return from their African investment no doubt. Still, profit or not, the African continent would hopefully know some semblance of peace and freedom. And wasn't that enough for them in Washington?"

 OFN_AFR_DECOL_CAR.1.desc:0 "EMERGENCY REPORT TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF\nFROM GENERAL WILLIAM WESTMORELAND\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThe situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) is rapidly deteriorating. Had this report been drafted only a day ago, it would have recommended immediate reinforcements to the African continent. As things now stand however, I can only give my recommendation for a total withdrawal of all OFN forces north of the South African border. All of my attempts at mediation and negotiation with the various factions and movements within my jurisdiction fell flat. Every instance in which compromise seemed close, another group would jump in with competing demands and claims to complicate matters. Eventually, the entire continent seemed to ignore our authority.\n\nI gave the Africans every possible chance to gain their independence and to benefit from American friendship but they all refused to cooperate. Now things have gone beyond a point of no return. Yesterday night I was informed of fighting in the Ugandan and Zambian regions. Before I could effectively respond, there were reports of uprisings across the continent directed at Americans and remaining Europeans from the Reichskommissariat era. Our forces were now outnumbered massively, and I made the call to evacuate. This report will probably reach you as we begin the operations on the eastern coast at Dar es Salaam and Nampula. Once those men are safely out the western half of my troops will pull out from Pointe-Noire, Libreville, and Luanda. This was not an easy choice to make but I am confident that it was the right one to save the lives of our people from a fight we could not presently win. I realize that this was done without prior approval however, and am willing to receive whatever disciplinary measures that I am given.\nEMERGENCY REPORT END"

 OFN_AFR_DECOL_CAR.2.desc:0 "EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION\nCONFIDENTIAL\nI can't put this in any simpler terms: things in the Central African Republic have gone from bad to irrevocably broken. We knew the project was never going to last indefinitely, it was never meant to anyways. The problem was - is Westmoreland. Westmoreland. What happened to the man? We still don't fully know, might never know, the whole truth at this point. Still, it seems clear that he's had some sort of psychotic break or some other sort of mental trauma. Nothing else we've modeled so far could explain his incredibly wild and erratic actions as the CAR collapsed around him.\n\nThe facts we do know are this: when the reports of the collapse started filtering into General Westmoreland's headquarters, instead of ordering a full scale fall back in preparation for extraction, the general ordered all forces to hold their positions and reassert order by any means necessary. An impossible order, an insane order. The response was to be expected: most on-the-ground commanders moved to the nearest ports and began to leave the continent. We estimate that 90% of our men left following the general's impossible demands.\n\nThe other 10% seemed willing to follow their lander through this madness however. With nine-tenths of his forces deserted, it was all the general could do to establish defensive perimeters around Léopoldville and Quelimane. As of this report, they are still holding out there, but each passing day costs them supplies, food, and manpower. We estimate that we don't have much longer. We could attempt to save them, but our earimations are not promising. Frankly, no one in the Pentagon is interested in bailing out a madman who dug his own grave.\n\nRecommendation: we cut our losses on this one."

 OFN_AFR_DECOL_CAR.3.desc:0 "Sweat pooled on top Westmoreland's thick, bushy eyebrows, which acted as floodgates while he was stationed in a boiling, wet and messy subterranean East African command center. Deep breaths, deep breaths. It had been a relentless, unremitting bombardment of conflicting intel, overlapping duties, frustrated and whiny troop commanders, misleading or lost orders, atrocious logistical and infrastructure reports, and bleeding-out stagnation on the fronts these past few months. And yet, here Westmoreland was, still on the African continent and victory only barely snatched from the all-encompassing maw of catastrophe. \"We did it. Fuckers, we did it...\" Westmoreland remarked, sliding back a greasy handful of greying hairs on top his forehead.\n\nA fresh-off-the-heels messenger, smilin' ear to ear on his still-pimpled babyface, gleefully bounced by the metallic walls of the command center, shouting \"We done it, sir! We done it! The insurgent, rebel, terrorist warlord-assholes all got the goddamn whip, sir!\" Westmoreland picked himself up from his grimy, leather-bound chair, sweat still dripping off his jungle-green jacket. The messenger, jumping around in orbit to Westmoreland, sang the praises of their victory \"Who knows what sorta' cannibal-cult, child soldier hellworld those monkeys woulda' dreamed up, huh sir?\" In response, Westmoreland shot the messenger a look of one who has just fully realized the naivete of a child. The messenger slowed his rounds as Westmoreland spoke up.\n\n\"Calm yourself, junior. We won't be stickin' around long.\"\n\n\"...What? You jocking' sir? We won, ain't we gonna get back to business?\"\n\n\"Son, I need you to realize where we are right now. We're set for evacuation, this whole goddamn continent is blowin' up on us. Sure, we shot down a few ringleaders, but now every goddamn person on this continent is only more pissed off at us. The civilians back home despise us, we've drained what few drops of political goodwill we had left. Now, the only thing left to do is escape this hellhole with whatever cash we can grab and whatever strongmen we can prop up. Son, against my wishes I assure you, this is a losing battle and America does not fight losing battles.\" As Westmoreland stormed out of the command center, the messenger was left stunned in his wake, hope escaping his visage."
