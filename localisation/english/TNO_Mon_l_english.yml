 POLITICS_NAI_SHWE_KYIN_DESC:0 "Shwe Kyin has long fought for the independence of the Mon people. From the days of British colonial rule to the violent war of independence to the turbulent times of the 1950s, he has attempted to negotiate on autonomy for the Mon nation in Burma. And one would expect that, with Ba Maw - himself a Mon - in control of Burma, things would end well for Kyin and the Mon.\n\nHowever, reality often defies expectations. Ba Maw, in his appalling lack of respect for his own people, refused negotiations outright, and left the Mon to their devices. Shwe Kyin walked out with no success, but he was not going to allow the Bamar to stick around and oppress the Mon. They would be free, at any cost.\n\nAs Shwe Kyin leads his armies for the freedom of the Mon, he recounts his time fighting for the freedom of his people. Bestowed upon them by an honourific, he has left Burma behind. Yesterday, he may have fought for Rangoon. However, today, he fights for Moulmein. Tomorrow, he can only hope that this trend continues."
