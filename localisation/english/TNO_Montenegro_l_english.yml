 mnt.1.t:0 "Protest in Cetinje!"
 mnt.1.d:0 "News has reached Rome that Cetinje, the capital city of Montenegro, has been engulfed in a riot! According to reports from the local government, a bar brawl involving a drunk MVSN officer and a few mutinous chetniks rapidly devolved into chaos, spurring massive and violent protests across the city. Bottles and rocks were thrown at the local police, and a few Italian and Serbian stores have been looted. Blackshirts stationed in the Montenegrin capital quickly moved to contain the riot and restored order, at least for now.\n\nThis is far from the first time Montenegro has caused us trouble, as its people have shown a persistent unwillingness to be integrated into our empire. Even worse, its mountainous and sparsely populated terrain remains a haven to partisans, bandits, and other dangerous terrorists. However, the local governor, Krsto Popović, has assured the Italian people and the government in Rome that everything is under control, and when the handful of interested politicians and newspapers deign to comment on the region, it is only to express confidence in his words and actions."
 mnt.1.a:0 "Part and parcel of having an empire"
 mnt.2.t:0 "A Carabiniere dead in Cetinje!"
 mnt.2.d:0 "Terrible news! It seems that there has been yet another riot in Cetinje, this time with casualties. Apparently, after the arrest of some arms dealers on the outskirts of the city, a few rabble rousers gathered a large mob and directed it towards the barracks of the local Carabinieri detachment, hoping to free the culprits. The mob accused the Italians of having arrested the dealers only because of their Montenegrin heritage, and the building was pelted with stones, sticks, and even the occasional Zhdanov cocktail before the rioters were dispersed. Even more worrisome, the MVSN troops in the vicinity took an alarmingly long time to deploy, perhaps deliberately.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, a gunshot exploded from the crowd, killing a Carabiniere officer. This new escalation attracted the attention of the Italian government and resulted in a long and difficult phone call between Ciano and governor Popović discussing the stability of Montenegro as well as the steps necessary for its improvement. However, there so far doesn't appear to be any concrete change in Italian strategy in the region."
 mnt.2.a:0 "Should we start to worry?"
 mnt.3.t:0 "Clashes in Cetinje!"
 mnt.3.d:0 "Another surge of violence has taken place in Cetinje, as an illegal protest denigrated into full-on urban warfare. Local authorities suspect that this time, the incident was the result of premeditated agitation by terrorist elements. Our SIM operatives in the region have reported that members of partisan organizations, ranging from leftists to dissident chetniks, have infiltrated Cetinje and distributed propaganda and weapons in order to spread their treasonous disorder.\n\nThe extent of this sedition became apparent today, as firefights broke out in the streets between the protestors and Italian law enforcement units. The Italians, mostly made up of Carabinieri and MVSN, attempted to clear the streets peacefully, but when the crowds refused to disperse, were forced to resort to necessary violence. To the officers surprise, this was met by gunfire from the crowd. The government's response was fragmented and inefficient, with blackshirts and Carabinieri arguing over command and units with conflicting authority deployed repeatedly to the same locales. The result was a long and brutal battle which cost the lives of several Italian soldiers and numerous Montenegrins. All Regio Esercito units in the region have been put on high alert, but for now the chaos seems to have been contained, and order restored."
 mnt.3.a:0 "We should definitely start to worry"
 mnt.4.t:0 "Montenegro in Flames"
 mnt.4.d:0 "Italy's empire is diverse, and what may seem like good news in one area, may backfire horribly in another. An unfortunate example of this is Montenegro, where the news of Libya's final full integration into the Homeland has been met with open rage - the people fear that Montenegro will be the next to lose what little autonomy it has. Partisan activity has spiked across the country - formerly loyal Chetnik bands are now directly raiding Italian convoys, partisans in the mountains are ambushing Italian patrols, and malcontents in the cities and villages alike are openly calling the people to revolt.\n\nA larger deployment of Italian troops and material has been ordered by the high command, and new Regio Esercito units equipped with tanks and APCs are starting to bolster MVSN and Carabinieri checkpoints and barracks in the region. Our SIM operatives still believe that the situation can be controlled, and governor Popović has sent a telegram ensuring the Grand Council that the Montenegrin situation is still salvageable without resorting to extreme means."
 mnt.4.a:0 "We should have started worrying earlier"
 mnt.5.t:0 "Disaster in Cetinje!"
 mnt.5.d:0 "The storm brewing in Montenegro has finally broke: the last week saw a riot on a scale hitherto unimaginable. Ordinary citizens responded to a noonday call to arms from churches, Mosques, meeting houses, and even schools, and poured into the streets with masks, flags, and homemade weapons. Terrorist infiltrators from a variety of groups darted through the mob, shooting at Italian police and civilians and urging the crowd to destroy and loot Italian shops and government buildings. Italian forces attempted to regain control of the city, but facing a heavy numerical disadvantage and cut off from communication and reinforcement, the fight turned into a brutal slog. After hours of horrific  house by house fighting across the whole city, our troops, including units from the Regio Esercito, the MVSN and the Carabinieri, are still flushing out the last remnants of the rebel groups from the slums and low places where they took refuge when the battle turned against them.\n\nThe news immediately spread to the Italian public, and predictably caused a strong reaction from the nation. Hardliners in the PNF are urging for a stronger crackdown to put a final end to disorder in Montenegro, but general Italian public opinion seems to favor conceding autonomy and perhaps even independence to Montenegro. Both nations wait with baited breath for the results of the emergency session of the Grand Council recently called by Duce Ciano."
 mnt.5.a:0 "Nothing to worry about. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT."
 mnt.6.t:0 "A Montenegrin Butchery"
 mnt.6.d:0 "The Grand Council's emergency session has been interrupted by more terrible news from Montenegro. It seems that during the most recent riot, Italian units, mostly MVSN, broke into a school building that, despite the violence elsewhere, had been occupied by peaceful protesters. The blackshirts arrested the occupiers and started to use the building as an impromptu prison and headquarters through the following hours. However, rumors began to circulate almost immediately about heinous acts of violence committed in the building by Italian operatives on Montenegrin captives, including torture and sexual abuse best left undescribed.\n\nReports and photographs of the \"Montenegrin butchery\" have leaked out in the aftermath of the riot, and has been rapidly spread by the underground network of partisans in the region. We will do everything we can to eliminate any chances of this reaching the ears of the Italian public, but numerous advisors close to Ciano have called for excluding the MVSN from any Montenegro anti-terrorist action, essentially putting the entire country in the sole jurisdiction of the Regio Esercito and the Carabinieri. However, this could easily enrage the bureaucrats and party members closer to the MVSN, of which the Grand Council is filled."
 mnt.6.a:0 "We can't risk touching the blackshirts"
 mnt.b.a:0 "Get them out immediately, put someone more competent in charge"
 mnt.7.t:0 "A Radical Proposal"
 mnt.7.d:0 "To any reasonable observer, the situation in Montenegro is completely unsustainable. Every day, bombs go off, partisans attack our troops, and riots sweep the city. Even worse, operatives in the SIM suggest a full scale national uprising is not far off. Our urban defences grow increasingly precarious, and our control over the countryside is limited at best. While our periodic sweeps and armament advantage has so far allowed us to repulse the numerous Cetinje uprisings and catch several notable terrorist leaders, the price for these victories has been the destruction of much of the nation's infrastructure and the loss of what little support we had among the populace.\n\nIt is obvious that a permanent solution is necessary, but none is easily apparent. This is partially due to the difficult conditions in Montenegro itself, and partially due to the fragility of the Italian Colonial Empire. Upon being called to Rome, the Montenegrin governor Krsto Popović has presented the Duce with a radical proposal: the independence of his nation.\n\nAccording to his plan, Montenegro will be placed under a completely autonomous administration, with its foreign affairs still controlled by the Italian government. A small Regio Esercito contingent would remain in the nation focused on training and logistical support, but the majority of Montenegro's security would be supplied by local forces. Obviously this would necessitate the withdrawal of all of the Alpini, Caribini, and MSVN units currently in the nation.  This will not sit well with the hardliner faction in the PNF, nor with the blackshirts deployed in Montenegro who have grown fond of their easy (and somewhat lucrative) posts. Still, this could be the only way to guarantee sustainable peace in Montenegro. Even if we reject this proposal, we have to find a solution -  soon."
 mnt.7.a:0 "We can't go on the way we are - accept the proposal."
 mnt.7.b:0 "We must keep the Italian Empire intact."
 mnt.8.t:0 "Uprising in Cetinje"
 mnt.8.d:0 "From the outside, Montenegro's capital is a shining jewel of the Italian empire, a place where Italian settlers peacefully coexist with native villagers, MSVN units cooperate with local constables, and the city streets are lined with a delightful medley of fascist brutalist architecture, old Italian-style buildings, and slavic relics. However, the city always had a darker side. Those buildings who so quaintly impressed rich Italian tourists were often inside abandoned and occupied by vagrants; the blackshirts, local police, and Chetniks seemingly compete over who could be the most brutal and corrupt; the countryside was divided between barbwire Italian compounds and crumbling slavic villages; and the nights filled with the sound of gunfire.\n\nUp until recently, demonstrations in Cetinje have consistently escalated in violence, but usually focused on the symptoms of the nation's problems, rather than their root causes. However, the recent refusal of the Italian government to accept Popović's proposal of autonomy, coupled with the violent repression of the recent riots, step too far for Montenegro's beleaguered citizens. Open rebellion broke out along the city's eastern slums, and quickly spread. Slavic factory and government workers have announced a general strike, crippling the city's infrastructure and economy. A surge of looting of Italian and Serbian owned shops has also been reported, often met with violent retribution.\n\nAs the fires rise, the official response has been confused. Italian law enforcement units have been massing in the city center, but have so far seemed content with only violently repelling any rioters who attempt to enter the cities more affluent districts - it seems like they have been forced to pull out from the suburbs, at least for now. There has been no word from the Italian government, and many of the more reluctant dissidents wait with baited breath for action from the Enemy across the water."
 mnt.8.a:0 "They can't keep getting away with this!"
 mnt.9.t:0 "Italian Counterattack in Cetinje"
 mnt.9.d:0 "Italian forces in Cetinje, which had been forced to retreat into the central quarters of the city finally counterattacked today, supported by Regio Esercito reinforcements from outside the city. Italian infantry, armored trucks and even tanks advanced through the streets inch by inch, gradually retaking the city even as the enemy slowed them with rooftop snipers and improvised bombs. Every window seems to hold a snipers nest, children throw rocks at Italian soldiers, and even old women on crutches act as spies and spit on the Italians when questioned.\n\n\n\nThe last partisan strongholds, mostly concentrated in the Roma slums on the cities southern side had to be reduced with helicopters and artillery. Whilst the day saw the Italians triumphant, many areas had been reduced to a smoking heap of ruins Italian casualties have been heavy, but Montenegran bodies, partisans and civilians alike, are everywhere. Emergency hospitals and displacement camps are being erected in the outskirts of Cetinje to, but are struggling to consist with the sheer number of wounded and refugees.. As Italian troops patrol the city and set up new checkpoints, many native Montenegrins watch from burnt out buildings, backs unbent and spirits unbroken, the fury in their eyes undimmed by defeat, staring coldly the tanks and APCs that crushed their insurrection in blood. It seems like Italy has finally regained control of the Montenegrin capital, but at what cost?"
 mnt.9.a:0 "This is for the best"
 mnt.9.b:0 "Have we gone too far?"
 mnt.10.t:0 "Montenegrin Factory Bombing!"
 mnt.10.d:0 "Another day, another attack. While Italy has regained control of the Montenegrin capital, the same cannot be said for the mountainous interior, where Chetniks and Leftists still travel freely through the rugged terrain. This time it was a small arms factory owned by Beretta, located not far from the capital that exploded without warning. Thankfully, the late-night attack caused no reported fatalities, but the building has been completely destroyed and looted of its stockpiles. Before setting off the bombs and disappearing into the night, the perpetrators left writings on the walls of nearby buildings, calling for an uprising to \"destroy the Italian invader\". SIM operatives are already on the case, but it seems inevitable that the trail will go cold in the harsh wilderness."
 mnt.10.a:0 "There's not much we can do"
 mnt.11.t:0 "Railways Destroyed in Montenegro!"
 mnt.11.d:0 "News have reached Rome about a series of coordinated attacks taking place all around the region of Montenegro. Elusive as always, partisans targeted vital junctions and other weak points, such as bridges, of our railway network in Montenegro. The Montenegrin held a significant part of our Balkan infrastructure, providing a vital connection between Albania and the Dalmatian territories, as well as offering links to our partners in Croatia and Serbia. The destruction of our infrastructure will take a long time to repair considering Montenegro's rough terrain, and will significantly damage our hold over the whole Balkans."
 mnt.11.a:0 "They strike where it hurts the most!"
 mnt.12.t:0 "A Fateful Attempt"
 mnt.12.d:0 "Any military commander can attest to the necessity of collaborators in controlling restive foreign politicians. Useful and willing native politicians and military leaders is often what makes the difference between a healthy imperial ally and a whirlwind of chaos and bloodshed. Unfortunately, Italy has always had a very short bench of allies among the restive Montenegran population. Those politicians that support Rome are usually vehemently unpopular, and often of dubious loyalty.\n\nBajo Stanistic is one of the few Montenegrin individuals who has been both a reliable and capable asset for the Italian-backed government. Ever since the Chetniks switched sides after the failed uprising in 1941, he has been a leading voice for peace, lawful authority, and Serb/Italian collaboration.   Naturally, these traits make him a prime target for the many terrorists who seek to undermine the new and just order we have worked so hard to build.\n\nThe first sign that something was wrong was a tree across a road. Stanišić's columns of Chetniks was forced to come to a halt amid dark trees and the growing twilight. An accident or coincidence? Perhaps to some, but the Chetniks are hard and experienced fighters, and quickly fanned out in a close defensive formation.\n\nWhen the ambush came, it was fast, hard, and from all directions. Grenades rained down upon the convoy, bullets whistled through the air, and the Chetniks could only return fire desperately upon ephemeral shadows who darted from tree to tree.\n\nBut they did not break, and before long the sound of helicopter blades signaled Italian reinforcements and a dramatic change in the balance of armaments. The partisans vanished into the forest from whence they came, and the historic tensions between the Italians and their Chetnik allies was forgotten as the brave soldiers hugged and celebrated with their rescuers.\n\nNonetheless, such a brazen attack upon so well-known collaborator signifies a concerning escalation in the Montenegrin unrest. If the traitors are able to target even the highest members of the official government, do we have any hope of bringing a quick end to their rebellion?"
 mnt.12.a:0 "At least he's safe."
 mnt.13.t:0 "Try Two"
 mnt.13.d:0 "King Popović has returned to Rome, begging Ciano to agree to grant Montenegrin autonomy. Popović warned of a Montenegro completely subsumed chaos if she is not granted freedom. The situation, according to the governor, is life and death, a question of whether or not we still want an Italian empire - either we must free Montenegro or the view from the summit of Lovćen mountain will show only blood and rebellion.\n\nStill, there is hesitation in the upper echelons of the Italian government. Scorza will undoubtedly seize upon the step backwards as a propaganda victory. We would be effectively abandoning the Italian position in Montenegro, and potentially weaken our hold on the entire Balkans. What's worse, if we free Montenegro, the numerous anti-Italian partisans in the Balkans might feel emboldened to gain the same freedom through lawlessness. But something must be done. This is the most bloodless course to solve the Montenegrin issue, and perhaps the only permanent solution."
 mnt.13.a:0 "We must end the bloodshed."
 mnt.13.b:0 "Our territorial integrity will not be compromised."
 mnt.14.t:0 "Martial Law Declared in Montenegro!"
 mnt.14.d:0 "As a result of the recent instability taking hold of the region, the Duce has signed an emergency order removing all power from the hands of the Montenegrin governor Krsto Popović and placing the whole region under the direct control of an Italian appointed military governor. As Montenegro loses what little autonomy it had managed to gain since World War Two, Italian forces in the region and at home are preparing to enact a final anti-partisan campaign.\n\nThe mountain passes connecting the region to the rest of the world are being heavily fortified, and helicopter patrols stalk the sky, seeking for any sign of movement below. Meanwhile, cities and towns are placed on lockdown across the region. Fortified checkpoints and regular armored patrols are again a common sight in the roads and streets of Montenegro, as grim faced Italian soldiers carefully inspect every vehicle for signs of malfeasance. Civilian rights have been curtailed in a flurry of emergency measures and provisions, with Italian soldiers and blackshirts regularly raiding homes for any signs of subversive activity. The partisans and chetniks in the country have been notably absent so far, but the SIM reports indicate that this might simply be the calm before the storm."
 mnt.14.a:0 "We have no other choice"
 mnt.15.t:0 "Counterattack in Montenegro"
 mnt.15.d:0 "As expected, the counterattack in Montenegro has arrived, and its breadth and ferocity has taken even the most pessimistic elements of our armed forces by surprise. Partisan units have launched guerilla attacks against Italian supply lines and convoys, targeting the occupying forces long logistical tail and causing chaos wherever they strike. The enemy has even sometimes succeeded completely cutting communication lines and essentially stranding entire Italian units in twisting forested valleys, attacking from wooded hills in nightfall and inflicting tremendous casualties before disappearing again into the wilderness. Expecting to quell a mere provincial revolt, Italian forces instead found a well organized and equipped militia that strikes with precision and coordination, and likely supported by our supposed allies, the chetniks.\n\n\n\nNumerous Italian soldiers have already lost their lives to partisan attacks, while more are wounded and missing. Despite the government's best efforts, evidence is reaching the public about the true extent of the nations involvement and losses. What many are starting to call \"yet another pointless war\" is bringing  open protest, and more and more voices within the PNF itself are starting to push for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, it seems that with governor Popović now firmly out of the political scene, and much of the Montenegrin population actively supporting the insurgency, the possibilities for a peaceful end to regional instability is next to non existent."
 mnt.15.a:0 "Italy is stronger than a few Slavic yokels!"
 mnt.16.t:0 "The Montenegrin Occupation"
 mnt.16.d:0 "In a move unprecedented since the Libyan Action in the 1920s, the Italian government has ordered its armed forces to occupy one of the nation's own territories and establish martial law. Such a deployment of troops in the region has not been seen since the Second World War, as Italian ships docked in Cattaro unload troops and tanks bound for Cetinje and the far reaches of Montenegro's mountains.\n\n\n\nReports from the country indicate that the new military authorities have begun to order search and destroy actions in the Montenegrin wilderness, with entire hamlets and villages being forcibly moved to strategic locations, and large wooded areas burned down or sprayed with herbicide to facilitate counterinsurgency operations. Harsh martial law has been enforced in cities and towns, with Cetinje itself for all intents and purposes appearing as a city under siege, as Italian tanks patrol the ruined streets and dissidents launch peaceful protests by day only to vanish in MSVN actions by night. A show of force to all members of the Italian sphere, the Montenegrin occupation should probably convince everyone that Italy is not willing to give an inch of its territories away to partisans and terrorists."
 mnt.16.a:0 "It's what has to be done"
 mnt.17.t:0 "Forever Scared Across Both Lands"
 mnt.17.d:0 "All across the occupied territory of Montenegro, Italian soldiers cluster around radios, excitedly hoping that theirs will be the next unit to withdraw. Some, those more knowledgeable about the poor job prospects that await them at home, and the deeply mixed public attitude about the war, are less anticipatory, and shake their heads resignedly at their fellows. Still others do not know of the withdrawal at all, being injured, dead, or insensate from the horrors they have witnessed and inflicted. It has to be mentioned that while the average italian soldier might be rather less healthy than when they entered the country, they're certainly not any poorer. The soldier's bags are stuffed full of loot, ranging from faded bits of bronze stolen from everyday homes, to gold chunks that look suspiciously like pieces of the chandelier that once hung in Montenegro's largest cathedral.\n\nIn the highest halls of Italy's military establishment, its generals tout that their soldiers went into Montenegro as boys, and left it as men. A more accurate observation for many would be that they entered the country whole, and left it broken. They remember what they did, they remember what they saw, and try as they might, they cannot forget. This is somewhat inconvenient for our government and national pride, as the un-valorous words of a few \"victimized\" veterans might quickly become a firestorm of public discontent.\n\nThus, the usual. Blacklists. Censorship. Propaganda. Pulled pensions for a few who can't keep their mouths shut as a warning to others, and a handful of mysterious disappearances. The war, the occupation, the soldiers suffering, it was all for Italy, and so shall be their silence."
 mnt.17.a:0 "It was all for the greater good. For Italy."
 mnt.18.t:0 "The Rebirth of a Country"
 mnt.18.d:0 "After long and heated negotiations, and despite threats of deadlocks coming from every side of the government, the Duce and the Montenegrin governor Krsto Popović have managed to reach a solution regarding Montenegro's status within the Italian empire. Pleasing the hardline members of government, preserving the integrity of the empire, satisfying the people of Montenegro and preventing a new round of violence seemed an impossible task, but against all odds peace has prevailed. This new agreement reverses the gradual annexation process begun since the war, and instead attempts to return to the solution proposed by the historical Green faction of Montenegro, of which Popović himself was a prominent member during the War.\n\n\n\nThe new agreement establishes Montenegro as an independent protectorate, with full autonomy in its internal affairs, but still dependent on Italy for its foreign policy and its defense. Most Italian troops in the region, including all the MVSN units, have been ordered to retreat from the country, leaving only a small contingent of Alpini and Carabinieri for counter-terrorist and border guard duties. This new autonomous Montenegro has been praised as a solution to the troublesome situation in the region, but numerous critics have expressed doubts regarding its actual anti-partisan capabilities. Chetniks that have been so far willing to work with Italy, most notably the vojvoda Pavle Đurišić, have already been asked to collaborate with the new government, hopefully using their militias to pacify the region."
 mnt.18.a:0 "Here's to peace!"
 mnt.19.t:0 "Drawing the Line"
 mnt.19.d:0 "If there's one thing that Italy's pesky reformists can all agree on is that the long sought spazio vitale needs \"more autonomy\" to \"prevent a catastrophic collapse of the nation as a viable regional power\". For some reason, the government has decided to listen to them, and devolve local decision making and authority to the Montenegrin government.\n\nWhat must be emphasized, however, is that this is not the end, or even the wide-scale reform of the Italian imperial project. You know how it is with these things. One moment you're granting the natives a few political rights, and the next day they're insisting on getting a \"fair share\" of their resources and tramping the embassy's rose bushes with their independence rallies.\n\nSo give them their rights, and see what they do with it. Most likely their little heads will just explode at all the big words in the new diplomatic charter, but just in case they actually manage to turn their pathetic principality into a state, we have to make sure they don't get any ideas."
 mnt.19.a:0 "It's a slippery slope!"
 mnt.20.t:0 "Freedom!"
 mnt.20.d:0 "Montenegro's modern existence as part of the Italian sphere has not been the most...stable of times. Cetinje is no stranger to riots and upheaval, and so when the crowds recently once again flooded the streets with torches, flags, and shouting, some of its lesser-informed residents closed their shutters and locked their doors, expecting yet another bout of anti Italian violence, and of course, the inevitable reprisals.\n\nHowever, this time the voices were raised in joyous revealing rather than rage. The people drunk on celebration rather than hate, and among the forest of Montenegrin flags, the occasional Italian tricolor could be spotted--signs of rare gratitude to the nation's long occupiers. For once, the Carabini did not attempt to quell the riot, but watched cheerfully from their posts, happy that their long tenure of animosity and paranoia could come to an end. A few even joined in the celebrations.\n\nOf course, not everything was perfect, it never is. MVSN units stared sullenly at the crowds from their guard posts, and a few clashes between overzealous demonstrators and some reticent blackshirts were reported. Still, it could not squash the feeling of ecstasy that swept through the country. Every bar offered free drinks, every park was packed with revelers, every building festooned with flags and banners. Chetniks embraced leftists, partisans embraced collaborationists, across the nation all was fevered joy and  even a subtle feeling of disbelief, as if such good news could only happen in a dream."

 mnt.43.t:0 "Border Raids"
 mnt.43.d:0 "The bandit Tito has crossed the border! Just before dawn this morning, armed Croation partisans attacked the police station in the town of Goransko, which lead to a three-hour shootout between Montenegrin police and army units and the invaders.. Several Croats got away, making off with some police vehicles and small arms looted from local arm depots.\n\nThis has already provoked a furious, but mixed, reaction throughout Montenegro. Some, especially the villagers in the North, want to further strengthen and deputize the Chetniks to fight against the Croats. Other villagers have already begun to arm themselves, forming \"self-defence\" units, which could potentially create the nexus for a new set of armed groups. We have to do something, and fast."
 mnt.43.a:0 "We won't let Tito get away with this!"
 mnt.21.t:0 "The Enemy from Without"
 mnt.21.d:0 "Just when it seemed like Montenegro was creating enough trouble on its own, it seems like the newly unified Croatia under the socialist bandit Josip Bronz Tito is every bit as \"Imperialist\" as the glorious nation that he constantly attacked. Every night brings reports of new raids by Tito's forces, burning border posts, ambushing patrols, and stealing guns and ammunitions from arms depots.\n\nWhile Croation regular units mass on the border, the violence so far seems to be aimed at probing and weakening Italian and Montenegrin forces and gathering local allies. In the latter goal at least, the invaders have seen success, as SIM reports that a number of offshoots from Montenegro's leftist partisans have declared for Tito and his dream of Socialist Balkan unity.\n\nAlpini, Caribini, Regio Escercito, and MSVN reinforcements have all been sent to the border region, and the local authorities have made announced firmly that the talian Empire will protect its citizens, even those of other nationalities, from the terrors of foreign bolshevism. How comforting this will be to the widows and orphans along the frontier remains to be seen."
 mnt.21.a:0 "Our condolences to the victims."
 mnt.22.t:0 "A New Threat"
 mnt.22.d:0 "Just when it seemed like things might be settling down in Montenegro, the Croatian bandit has begun launching vicious raids against our sovereign territory. His forces have engaged in savage butchery against innocent Montenegrans, sparing not even the children and elderly in their cruelty!\n\nWe have already reached out to our Italian \"allies\" but their help has been slow to arrive, and where present, seem more interested in extorting and brutalizing the citizens they're supposed to protect rather than repelling the terrorists. At the same time, numerous reports indicate that our Serbian \"citizens\" are avoiding, or even cooperating with the enemy. Despite our numerous complaints, the Italians still seem to see fit to rely on the Chetniks over our own forces.\n\nUntil something changes, it seems like we can expect Tito's accursed reign of terror and violence to continue, if not expand into a full invasion."
 mnt.22.a:0 "Damn them!"
 mnt.23.t:0 "Another Balkan Crisis."
 mnt.23.d:0 "It seems that despite our best efforts the situation in Montenegro has dipped back into crisis, as reports from SIM have reached Rome that Croatian motorized and infantry divisions today have launched a full scale invasion of our puppet regime.\n\nAlready weakened by the recent cross border raids, Italian defensive positions along the frontier have been further undercut by spontaneous pro-Croatian leftist partisan uprisings. Numerous units have been forced to withdraw to their operational bases, and are cut off from reinforcements by the enemy. Relief columns have been bogged down in the hills among heavy guerilla resistance and rumored treachery and desertion from Montenegrin auxiliaries.\n\nNonetheless, the situation is not all black. Elite MSVN forces have already mobilized and re-established lines of communication with some of the border posts. Whether these positions can be held remains to be seen, but it has been a significant morale boost to Italian forces.\n\nWhatever Tito's success as a folk-hero and partisan commander, he has now found himself engaged in a conventional war with the entirety of the Italian Empire. Armored divisions, aircraft, and naval support have all been sent to the region, and even the famously fickle Montenegran Chetniks have rallied to Italy's defense. Defeating demoralized native constables is is one thing, standing against a modern fully equipped and prepared army is quite another."
 mnt.23.a:0 "This is war."
 mnt.24.t:0 "A Curious Proposal"
 mnt.24.d:0 "Among the unhappy members of the Italian Empire, politics, at least, is usually rather simple. There are collaborators, and there are partisans. One might not be particularly better than the other, but at least most know where they stand between the two.\n\nThe Chetniks have always been somewhat hard to place on this scale. They at first sided with the Axis during World War 2, launched uprisings against them during the brief rays of hope for the allies, and ultimately solidified as some of their most loyal collaborators in the end. It seems that they will support any side which furthers their goal of pan-Serbian domination.\n\nPursuant to this objective, they have now requested greater representation within our Montenegrin puppet. Already augmenting our security forces in the region, agreeing to their proposal will no doubt go a long way to alleviating our manpower shortage. On the other hand, the Serbs are still a minority in Montenegro, and granting them such a disruptive degree of influence is likely to turn the population against us."
 mnt.24.a:0 "The Italian Empire Serves Those who Serve It. Let Them In."
 mnt.24.b:0 "We can not risk our positions. Not this time."
 mnt.25.t:0 "Extended Support"
 mnt.25.d:0 "Following our admittance of Chetniks into Montenegro, they have come out in great numbers for public support of their brothers within Serbia. Small parades, public prayer ceremonies, and lobbying efforts in Rome for greater support against the Communists have heightened in the following weeks, boisterous about the benefits of supporting the group. Despite the increased manpower from our new anti-Bolshevik friends however, their chauvinistic expressions within Montenegro have caused great annoyance to the growing voices of the Montenegrin nationalists."
 mnt.25.a:0 "Interesting."
 mnt.26.t:0 "A Successful Gamble"
 mnt.26.d:0 "After a long-fought struggle, the Chetniks have finally declared their triumph in the conflict for Serbia. With the Communist partisans routed, our sphere can breath with a little more ease. Despite the Pan-Serbian ambitions of the organization, our support of the group will hopefully ease the tensions. In the meantime, let us celebrate the defeat of Bolshevism upon our borders!"
 mnt.26.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 mnt.27.t:0 "Unification?"
 mnt.27.d:0 "As expected, the victorious Chetniks have begun their pursuit of Pan-Serbian ambitions, beginning with Montenegro, a territory directly under our control. Whilst Montenegro is an important region for movement, providing a gateway into South Balkan regions such as Greece and Albania,  it has been devastated by insurgency and proven not to be an easily controllable region, something advisors say would be alleviated by a unification with Serbia.\n\nAnother benefit to this deal is the projection of our influence upon Serbia, and the gateway it provides into the region. Shall we take the chance at strengthening our sphere of influence whilst quelling resistance, or continue our policy of direct rule?"
 mnt.27.a:0 "Our influence expands."
 mnt.27.b:0 "Our holdings will remain ours."
 mnt.28.t:0 "A Lost Bet"
 mnt.28.d:0 "The conflict within Serbia has ended, and the Chetniks have been defeated. As Communist partisans raise their banners high, the anti-communist fighters and assorted Serbian refugees have crossed the border into Montenegro, heightening the anger and resentment of the region's nationalists.\n\nIn addition to this unfolding refugee crisis, the issue of communists capable of striking our nation across the border has not gone unnoticed. We can only pray the multitude of culminating issues does not grow worse."
 mnt.28.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 mnt.29.t:0 "The First Step"
 mnt.29.d:0 "Following our victory against the Chetnik reactionaries, there has been a focus westward upon the Italian Empire, particularly the territory of Montenegro. It is crucial that we seize Montenegro from the Fascists, both for its importance as a staging ground for further expeditions, and to weaken Rome's hold over the region. For the good of the Balkans, we must liberate this oppressed nation from the fascists!"
 mnt.29.a:0 "May we be victorius."
 mnt.31.t:0 "Do Or Die"
 mnt.31.d:0 "Concerning news has once again been delivered from Montenegro, as reports of cross-border raids by Serbian Communists have been confirmed. Towns and villages near the border have suffered the attacks, and casualties have been reported. If the Montenegrin Garrison proves incapable of repelling these attackers, then a near-certain war with the new regime will soon find itself being waged. There will be no red spectre haunting the Balkan Peninsula!"
 mnt.31.a:0 "We will do what we must."
 mnt.32.t:0 "Attack In Montenegro"
 mnt.32.d:0 "Following our recent raids and pushes into Montenegro, and interrogations of local commanders, it has been revealed that Italy has been made aware of our push into the region. It is crucial that we cement our rule over Montenegro hastily, and prepare for war. We will not be humiliated by the Fascists again!"
 mnt.32.a:0 "Forwards!"
 mnt.33.t:0 "The Flaws"
 mnt.33.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Montenegrin Garrison has proven incapable of repelling the attacks by the Communists, and the region has been seized. Serbia has increased its military presence in the region after pacifying the largest resistance, and now is in position to strike further against both our sphere and nation itself. We must go on the offensive against the Reds, lest their carnage continues."
 mnt.33.a:0 "They will pay."
 mnt.34.t:0 "Victory In Montenegro"
 mnt.34.d:0 "Much to our relief, the Montenegrin Garrison has repelled the Serbians from the region, and they have been sent running back to their hovels. Though this is a victory for our nation and served as a great test of the Garrison's capabilities, it has also shown the true intentions of the new Serbian regime. A military buildup in the region would serve well to put them in their place, and war may be a necessity if these raids resume."
 mnt.34.a:0 "A fortunate turn of events."
 mnt.35.t:0 "Victory In Montenegro"
 mnt.35.d:0 "In the wake of Serbia's failure to overwhelm our garrison, the border raids have ceased, likely in an attempt to not invoke our full wrath. Despite an end to the carnage, the possibility remains that a future attack is in the planning, and that turning a blind eye may prove fatal."
 mnt.35.a:0 "One must always be watchful in times like these."
 mnt.38.t:0 "Our Success"
 mnt.38.d:0 "It seems that Rome has finally been made aware of our successful liberation campaign, confirmed by Partisans reporting increased transportation of military assets near Montenegro. It is likely that, in an attempt not to be portrayed as weaklings, they will attack us in the coming weeks. We must prepare as greatly as we can for the future onslaught of the Italians, and defend our hard-fought revolution. Not one inch will be surrendered without great bloodshed! For one Serb will come one-hundred Italians!"
 mnt.38.a:0 "May we prevail once again against Fascism!"
 mnt.39.t:0 "A Deal Withe The Devil"
 mnt.39.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, we have recently been approached by the Serbian government with a deal: to hand over the territory of Montenegro to them, in exchange for their entry into our sphere as protection against Germany.\n\nThough this proposal was sudden and shocking, it may prove to be greatly beneficial, allowing for another ally against the Reich, and handing over the Montenegrin territory, rife with chetnik and partisan insurgency, without loss of power. It may prove to be a very useful long-term agreement."
 mnt.39.a:0 "Deal."
 mnt.39.b:0 "No deal."
 mnt.40.t:0 "The Failings"
 mnt.40.d:0 "Despite the best efforts to keep the situation from devolving into chaos, the government has been incapable of quelling the Montenegrin issue. Communist partisans and chetnik bands have begun engaging in open confrontations against one another and against government forces in the region, as troops loyal to Cetinje are either defecting or forced to retreat away from the valleys and mountainous regions of the countryside.\n\nWith Popović's government struggling to keep the country under control, plans are being drafted up for yet another intervention of Italian forces in the country, to either prop up the failing Montenegrin administration or perhaps even reintegrate the region into Italy proper."
 mnt.40.a:0 "This isn't good."
 mnt.41.t:0 "Declining Stability"
 mnt.41.d:0 "It seems as if all hope has fled both the people and the government of Montenegro in regard to peace, as the nation accelerates fully into a state of anarchy. The culminating brawls and exchanges have escalated into full-on combat, as Chetniks, Partisans and Nationalists all engage in violence against one another, with gunfire exchanges being reported, and innocents being caught in their crossfire.\n\nTo make matters worse, one of the only hopes of autonomy and the face of Italian faith in Montenegro, Krsto Popović, has had a stroke. Seeing his nation being destroyed, people dying in the streets, and being unable to do anything about, his ailing health has descended into a stroke, and he is now incapable of serving the post as head of the Montenegrin state. With a headless government and a state of civil insurrection underway, the long-fought struggle for autonomy may soon come to an end."
 mnt.41.a:0 "Is this the end?"
 mnt.42.t:0 "The Death of a Nation"
 mnt.42.d:0 "Italian troops paraded in Cetinje in a grand re-annexation ceremony this morning, culminating in the raising of the Italian flag in front of the Government Building. The few native residents who turned out for the ceremony watched sullenly as free Montenegro was put to rest. The Regio Esercito has already began preparing to stamp out the last rebels in the mountains, and completely pacify Montenegro under the benevolent rule of the Italian Empire.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the nation's fragile peace has come to an end. In Cetinje's suburbs, youths tossed petrol bombs at the newly deployed Italian auxiliaries, while guerillas set up barriers and engaged the Italian troops streaming into the countryside. Across Montenegro's smorgasbord of re-arming rebel groups, calls for unity against the new invasion reign supreme, though actual commitments to this unity are rather lacking, and clashes between the partisan groups are almost as common as those against the occupiers. As the nation descends back into violence, it seems as if nothing has changed."
 mnt.42.a:0 "A noble, but failed, experiment."
