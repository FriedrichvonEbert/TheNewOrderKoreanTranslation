 OMO_far_east_development_category: "Blessed the Giver's Hand Is"
 OMO_far_east_development_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\n§W"He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed."§! §Y- Psalm 107:29§!\n\nFor far too long, the §mPort of Magadan§! has been a den of vipers. The last safe harbor in Russia was at the service of brutes possessed by Mammon without a sole concern for the plight of their captive populace. Though we were written off as nothing but an ill-equipped peasant militia by the enemies of Christ, our faith became our shield. Thousands rallied to the word of the Lord, and at the end of the day we proved that the light of God still shines in Russia.\n\nThe task that lies ahead will not be an easy one, however. If we are to spread the light of God westwards and free Russia from this dark age, we must use this opportunity to turn this port into our window to the outside world. Peasants, priests and §WFather Men§! himself see this opportunity for what it is - a chance to feed the hungry of our lands, a chance to invite pilgrims from abroad to join our flock and a chance to improve the state of our Fraternal Militia. For while the §WFather§! preaches peace, the soldiers of Christ cannot simply stand idle while the warlords in the west prepare for war. Certain §xsinners§! in our midst also wish to go further and to allow the port to return to some of its prior uses - all in the name of serving the greater good, of course."
 
 ## Divine Mandate decisions
 
 # phase 1
 
 OMO_international_charity_mission: "International Charity Mission"
 OMO_international_charity_mission_desc: "§W"Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed."§! §Y- Proverbs 19:17§!\n\nWe shall appeal to the kindness of Christians abroad to aid in the upkeep of our Christian communes."
 
 OMO_seek_humanitarian_aid: "Seek Humanitarian Aid"
 OMO_seek_humanitarian_aid_desc: "§W"Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything."§! §Y- Genesis 9:3§!\n\nA humanitarian aid mission shall be established in the port of Magadan, bringing in food from abroad to feed the hungry in our Christian community."
 
 OMO_expand_port_of_magadan: "Expand the Port of Magadan"
 OMO_expand_port_of_magadan_desc: "§W"Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters."§! §Y- Psalm 107:23§!\n\nThe carpenters and laborers in our flock will toil day and night to expand the port of Magadan, turning this humble port into a fully fledged harbor."
 
 OMO_golden_domes_of_blagoveshchensk: "Golden Domes of Blagoveshchensk"
 OMO_golden_domes_of_blagoveshchensk_desc: "§W"Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold."§! §Y- Genesis 13:2§!\n\nThe region of Amur holds some of the greatest deposits of gold in Russia. By having our followers procure and produce the necessary equipment to properly mine these riches, we shall use them not for avarice, but to decorate the churches and cathedrals to our Lord."
 
 # phase 2
 
 OMO_expand_the_aid_mission: "Expand the Aid Mission"
 OMO_expand_the_aid_mission_desc: "§W"Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor."§! §Y- Proverbs 22:9§!\n\nWith the port expanded, we'll invite various aid organizations to set up a permanent presence at the port to help us distribute the international charity among the hungry and impoverished in Siberia."
 
 OMO_holy_icons: "Holy Icons"
 OMO_holy_icons_desc: "§W"A greedy man stirs up strife, but the one who trusts in the Lord will be enriched."§! §Y- Proverbs 28:25§!\n\nWith the riches of the earth at our disposal, we shall spread the word of Jesus Christ through our icons. Made by hardy craftsmen of Siberia, exporting these will fill the Church's coffers at home, and send a message of Christian love to the world."
 
 OMO_steel_for_the_forges: "Steel For The Forges"
 OMO_steel_for_the_forges_desc: "§W"To equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,"§! §Y- Ephesians 4:12§!\n\nThere exists a treasure trove of metals under the earth of Siberia. These metals can be used for a lot of things. Tools for our craftsmen, homes for our people, and swords for the warriors of Christ."
 
 OMO_magadans_old_tricks: "Magadan's Old Tricks"
 OMO_magadans_old_tricks_desc: "§W"Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."§! §Y- 1 Peter 5:8§!\n\nAll men do not have a wholly Christian motive, but rather one dressed up as "earthly pragmatism". Sudoplatov wishes to have the port of Magadan resume some of its previous operations. Allowing this would be profitable, but one should be careful not to invite the Devil into one's humble abode..."
 
 OMO_a_harbor_worthy_of_the_lord: "A Harbor Worthy of the Lord"
 OMO_a_harbor_worthy_of_the_lord_desc: "§W"You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them."§! §Y- Psalm 89:9§!\n\nFrom humble beginnings, the port of Magadan shall be part harbor, part temple of Christ. It shall be Christ's lighthouse that guides wayward souls at sea to the mercy of the Lord and Domes worthy of a cathedral shall greet everyone who enters it. Truly, we shall turn this into a harbor worthy of the Lord Himself."
 
 OMO_a_safe_haven: "A Safe Haven"
 OMO_a_safe_haven_desc: "§W"Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."§! §Y- Hebrews 13:1-2§!\n\nNow that we're standing on our two feet, we must in turn show Christian hospitality to the rest of the world. Carpenters will toil to build homes for the poor, and farmers shall till their soil to provide, and we'll open the port of Magadan to all who need a sanctuary. May the light of the Lord act as a beacon of hope in these dark times."
 
 OMO_expand_fraternal_militias: "Expand Fraternal Militias"
 OMO_expand_fraternal_militias_desc: "§W"The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is His name."§! §Y- Exodus 15:3§!\n\nWe'll put out the call for Christians of all lands to come to Magadan to protect our Christian community! Lodging shall be provided in exchange for service as a soldier of Christ in our Fraternal Militias."
 
 OMO_gods_light_from_irkutsk: "God's Light From Irkutsk"
 OMO_gods_light_from_irkutsk_desc: "§W"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."§! §Y- John 1:5§!\n\nThe power plant of Irkutsk is a feat of earthly engineering with few peers in Russia. With better access to equipment and material through Christian communities abroad, we can improve the output of the dam, and have our craftsmen turn this bastion of atheistic, Godless engineering into a shrine to Christ that shall bring electrical light as far away as Kamchatka."
 
 OMO_expand_sudoplatovs_private_army: "Expand Sudoplatov's Private Army"
 OMO_expand_sudoplatovs_private_army_desc: "§e"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."§! §Y- Matthew 10:34§!\n\nAs we've agreed to continue working with Sudoplatov's men despite their disregard for Christian virtues, Sudoplatov is asking that we provide him with the resources to establish several new units. While he claims that these men will be raised locally and will not repeat the ill deeds of his former NKVD followers, some suspect that he may be doing what Magadan's former owners did and bring in foreign mercenaries to our soil..."
 
 OMO_unrestricted_trade: "Unrestricted Trade"
 OMO_unrestricted_trade_desc: "§e"He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity."§! §Y- Ecclesiastes 5:10§!\n\nWith Sudoplatov being allowed to enforce laws as he sees fit, the state of Christian anarchy and a lack of central body would allow him to get away with making his own rules as well. Magadan will thus become a trading port with almost no restrictions - a place where anything may enter and leave, supervised solely by Sudoplatov and his men. Sudoplatov assures us that no products of vice will enter our domain on his watch, however."
 
 OMO_industrial_contacts: "Industrial Contacts"
 OMO_industrial_contacts_desc: "§e"Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them."§! §Y- Psalm 62:10§!\n\nAmong Sudoplatov's contacts weren't just ones in the army and intelligence services, but through friends of friends they seem to reach into the industrialists in Yagoda's old administration. Given free reign, these men promise to bring industrial prosperity to our communes. Few doubt, however, that a substantial amount of that wealth would not end up in our community coffers, but would instead end up in the deepening pockets of those who run the factories."
 
 OMO_the_spires_of_tomsk: "The Spires of Tomsk"
 OMO_the_spires_of_tomsk_desc: "§W"Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood."§! §Y- Acts 20:28§!\n\nDuring the Soviet years, our Christian brothers and sisters were persecuted across Russia by the atheist government of Bukharin. The Epiphany Cathedral in Tomsk is one of the cathedrals to our Lord that were spared from ruin during these dark years. Once we've brought all of Siberia under the light of God, we shall turn Tomsk into a bastion of Christian charity and learning."
 
 OMO_christian_tourism: "Christian Tourism"
 OMO_christian_tourism_desc: "§W"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."§! §Y- Psalm 119:105§!\n\nWord of our Divine communes has reached the outside world. Our humble community has raised quite a few eyebrows, and more than a handful of people wish to see our Christian communes for themselves. While we keep our doors open to all, perhaps it would be prudent to organize efforts to help these souls see our community for themselves."
 
 OMO_teach_christian_values: "Teach Christian Values"
 OMO_teach_christian_values_desc: "§W"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."§! §Y- John 13:17§!\n\nThe city of Tomsk is a bastion for learning. The Salons, for all their faults, maintained a tradition of learning and culture. Rather than letting their potential go to waste, we should use the libraries, schools and teachers of Tomsk to educate the masses of Siberia. An exercise in Christian charity and education, we'll make sure that every child in Siberia can at the very least manage to read and study the Bible."
