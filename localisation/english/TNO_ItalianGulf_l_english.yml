Settled comfortably along the natural path of ships heading out of the Mediterranean and through the Persian Gulf to more exotic ports, Dubai could well become the greatest trade hub in the Italian Empire if supported properly.\n\nA \"Marketplace of the Middle East\" is what Mattei envisions, and what a marketplace he has planned out indeed. Towers that brush the sky for the companies and moguls, hotels and mansions for the tourists, dockyards as far as the eye can see, roads for goods to be directed across the colonies, all will be built for the Governor's vision to take form."

While he is the Governor, Mattei is also the Chairman of ENI, and some wonder which of the two titles he will prioritize. Mattei himself seems to feel confident in his ability to juggle the responsibilities while also arguing that his status as Chairman will give him greater freedom in fulfilling his goals as Governor. What is certain is that the Governorate is about to have much more in the way of funding, albeit private. A hybrid business empire and governmental administration isn't unheard of, but other attempts have had... less than successful results. Mattei remains convinced however, that his approach will be proven correct, and with his success record, perhaps he is right."

While relying on Italian support will be important, building a strong working relationship with the local officials will be highly beneficial in the long term development of the colony. Besides, if Mattei found himself in a position where following Italy's lead could prove... inadvisable, local allies would be indispensable.\n\nMattei has begun scheduling meetings with the Emirs where he will provide them with proof of the sincerity of Italy's plans to support the Gulf Region. Failing that, Mattei has also made provisions for large sums of money to be transferred to certain offshore accounts. Whatever the Emirs might require to guarantee their support, Mattei will provide."

While the major cities may have a high level of electrical coverage, the distribution is far from uniform across the region. To keep such a blemish from marring the record of his would-be otherwise perfect plans for developing the Governorate, Mattei will use his extensive government and private sector contacts to secure contracts with the premier Italian energy group, Enel.\n\nThe Governor will personally take charge in the negotiations to craft a program that will not only bring the people of the Gulf into the prosperity of the Empire but also maximize the use of resources expended. The Governor is betting on his skills as a businessman to further his goals as an administrator."

While others in the Italian government might see the media as little more than something to be used to tow a party line, Mattei has seen a vehicle for business and information. The ENI has an Arabic language newspaper under its media wing, Al-Yawm, The Day, that may be just what the Governor is looking for.\n\nA more local publication, that speaks the language of the native people will be much more equipped to bring the people to the Italians' side than any government bulletin from on high could hope to be. Experts have also suggested that investing more heavily into Al-Yawm could further increase efficiency in communication regarding the programs currently being implemented, and if there is one thing Mattei likes to see, it's efficiency.

These dockyards must be able to construct more lines in parallel and handle larger hull types than previous designs. For further details on specifications, see Attachment A. Land appropriation forms must be satisfactorily completed and compensation must be given if appropriate. As these dockyards will cement our place as a bastion for the Regia Marina and private contractors, the importance of this project cannot be understated. Working with native construction groups is advised if practicable, see Attachment D for dealing with non-Government contractors... "

They make the pumps we use, the compressors, the turbines, a hundred other small pieces that are essential for the art of oil extraction. Luckily for us, they are the best of the best, they are Italian.\n\nStill, quality or not, our growing presence in the Gulf has created a very real problem regarding our sister company. The arrival of new machinery is simply taking too long per delivery for Mattei's ambitious plans. This could be remedied quite easily though, it would only take one visit to the Nuovo Pignone head offices by the Governor of the Gulf, the Oil-King himself, to convince them to set up local factories in Dubai. Once they see how profitable business in the Gulf can be, they will never want to leave!"

The Governor has set aside as sizable dispensation for the funding of several new technical schools throughout the Governorate. Further, in his role as Chairman of ENI, Mattei has promised private funds will be donated to this project, ENI is always interested in promoting the public good after all.\n\nNeedless to say, these schools will act as pipelines for ENI exclusively, but that goes without saying. Mattei is dedicating both civil and private funds for this endeavor; this is not some act of charity, it is an investment in the future of ENI's competency, and investment promises to bear great fruit further down the line."

Mattei did not become Chairman of ENI, nor Governor of the Gulf, by resting on his laurels. Positions are filled? Good. Create more positions. India, that land of inexhaustible population, now there could be an untapped goldmine for labor. The Governor has never been one to rest on his laurels. We should begin an immigration promotion drive right away, those who step up to our call will not have cause to regret their decision. As the Governor is fond of saying, the Empire is like a family, and a family looks out for all of its members, that is the Italian way. Our friends from India will be welcomed as if they had come from Naples, Rome, or Dubai."

Such a move would certainly cause other major companies to see the Gulf cities as legitimate places of business, and the direction of operations would also benefit from the shorter communication distance. Mattei believes the move to be an obvious one. After all, if the beating heart of ENI is in the emirates, should not the nervous system follow suit?"

The average income of native Arabs has nearly doubled, and studies are showing that the general quality of life is also on the rise. It is the birth of a new concept in the Gulf: an Arab middle class. The Governor says we should view this as a sign of the wisdom of our policies thus far.\n\nWith more and more Arabs having disposable incomes, it may be time to begin investing in more entertainment and similar luxury services. They have this new windfall thanks to the benevolence of ENI and the Empire after all. Is it too much to ask that they put some of that surplus back into those who have helped them in so many ways?"

We ought to expand our international tanker fleet as soon as possible. The more tankers we have, the more oil we ship, the more profit we will turn. Oil transport is our business after all, and the Chairman expects that business will be booming.\n\nThe Regia Marina will likely be our main source for additional tankers, although most of them will likely have been commissioned from Italian companies rather than being developed by the navy itself. That being said, there is nothing stopping us from expanding our search for foreign vessels or perhaps even whole designs that could be advantageous to possess. The Governor's insistence on dockyard production will now pay itself back in full."

Without the hard work of native Arabs, no profit could be turned at all. We shall not be like the German slave masters, when a man proves valuable to ENI he shall be justly compensated, Mattei is adamant on this point.\n\nThe Chairman has given permission for a company affiliated union group, the CASL, to be established to provide representation for the native workers. Union members will be able to find camaraderie with their fellows, settle any disagreements with the company to the satisfaction of both parties, and model a successful employee-employer relationship to the world.

Planes are the transportation method of the future, and Chairman Mattei is a man who always bets on the future. Investing in this method now will give ENI a global edge.\n\nComing up with new models of survey planes should also be prioritized, several prominent Italian aircraft designers, including Cessna and Fiat, have already offered proposals to Mattei personally. These companies would be sure to provide their designs for reasonable prices, especially if they were offered a \"closer\" relationship with ENI going forward.\n\nThese deals would of course need to be done in the usual opulent comforts of the elite class. Perhaps Mattei should ask those companies if they would also be willing to sell any private transport models to ENI, as deals are best done in comfort after all."
 gul_raise_the_gulf_scouts:0 "Raise The Gulf Scouts"
 gul_raise_the_gulf_scouts_desc:0 "While the ENI and the Empire have provided adequate security and military forces for the Governorate up until now, Mattei is actively looking at ways to involve the locals in their own defense and policing. In the long-term, the Governor knows that involving natives in positions of colonial authority will likely produce better results than relying solely on resented and often culturally ignorant European soldiers.\n\nThese Gulf Scouts, as Mattei has called them in his proposals, will be better acquainted with the terrain and better able to solve local issues than any foreigner could be. For their service, these volunteers will be well-compensated, Mattei has read his history, he will not repeat the mistakes of the EIC's Sepoy policies."

Further, and in a move that caught some in Rome by surprise, Mattei included in the order provisions that would expand healthcare coverage to both the families of employees and former employees in the Gulf. While some critics have blasted the measure as a massive waste of resources, Mattei has maintained that the move is both morally justified as well as financially viable given the increase in revenue from ENI and other companies active in the region. Still, experts have warned that Mattei's critics are not likely to give up, and given the fact that many are members of the central Italian government in Rome, Mattei may have put his career at threat of crashing."

At times like this, when he enjoyed an evening constitutional within one of the lovely Dubai parks, recently developed as part of his pet project, Enrico Mattei could forget that he was the Chairman of ENI and forget that he was the Governor of a colony of people who depended on his actions. Or at least he had intended to.\n\nAlong the path of the park's trail sat a beggar in tattered clothes. Mattei walked over to the poor vagabond and asked him for his story, tossing a lira into the beggar's tin. The man explained that due to the monopoly of Italian companies in the Gulf, his shop had been forced out of business by one that was ENI affiliated. Mattei felt a pang of guilt for the man, his actions had caused this. He couldn't change the past, but no one else would have to suffer in the name of Italian interests if he could help it."

We have the businesses, the providers of goods and services. We have the government, the levier of taxes and bringer of subsidies. Do we have the people? Therein lies the concern. Everything that Mattei has built could collapse if no one is buying anything. The solution is promotion, promotion, promotion. People need to see how these products will improve their lives, they need to know how happy they will be if they buy just one more. Of course, this approach could lead to abuse from liars, but Mattei wouldn't let it get that far..."

Of course, any sizable population center will require restaurants, theaters, club halls, shops, and bars, lots of bars as it turns out. Mattei has searched for examples from history and has several clear models to pick from, in particular, he has examined the coal towns in the 20th Century US.\n\nSo decided, so begun. The power of ENI is practically limitless here. Towns will be raised out of the sandy dunes as if by magic, roads laid overnight. The company man will leave his company house in the morning, work in his company post during the day, and enjoy his evening at the company bar. All will see that ENI provides for its people."

Mattei understood such concerns, he had even agreed to accept the demands of forbidding independent union groups... though what he had not voiced was his resolve that this would not be a permanent system. The opportunity has come for the restrictions to be lifted. The workers were always deserving of unions to the Chairman, but with the latest numbers coming in from Rome showing ENI profits through the roof, no one can openly challenge him without appearing like some rapacious German slavemaster. Just as as Mattei foresaw. All workers within the Gulf, directly working for ENI or not, will be allowed to unionize as they wish, so long as they keep their activities peaceful and within reason of course."

That being said, it will no longer suffice for the bringing about of the Governor's new vision.\n\nIn a secret memo to high level ENI executives, Governorate administrators, and Gulf military officers, Mattei outlined his plan to further merge the workings of the company and the colony together to ensure maximum efficiency. The Emirs would have to be subdued, dissent nipped in the bud, the people reassured, and the armed forces reviewed.

To Mattei, every new tower erected represents a step closer to his dream of ushering in a golden age of prosperity for the company, the people, and the land he has been charged with watching overseeing. In his office in the Governor's mansion that overlooks the construction of a new and beautiful Abu Dhabi skyline, Mattei pulls a small and well-worn book of poetry from his bookshelf.

Despite the name, the emirs have also opened discussions with the Sheiks of Bahrain and Kuwait with the object of convincing all Arab leaders in the Gulf to come out in factor of the proposal.\n\nWhile some might see disaster, and some have, as is the nature of things, Mattei sees opportunity. Empires cannot last forever, but partnerships based on mutual understanding, friendship, and profit can last indefinitely. Of course, to create such a situation where an independent Gulf would remain a trusted partner of Italy, Mattei will need to work quickly to show his goodwill, and to remove any obstacles to painless transition."

The ones we judge to be pliable will merely be put into a mild form of house arrest, just because they seem docile doesn't mean we won't prevent anything from happening behind our backs. Those Emirs deemed to be active agitators against our policies will be stripped of all authority, they will be denounced in the press and if they so much as sneeze, our intelligence apparatus will make sure we know.

The glass had been made in 1898 in Vienna; the wine in Romagna, 1905. Both were part of his private collection, carefully transported to the Gulf with great care by no less than six private planes. It was not the glass that could have stood proudly in any Italian museum or the wine that no doubt cost more than some small houses back home that currently captured the attention of this man, the newly minted governor of the Empire's Gulf possessions however, but the city from which he would oversee his charge. Dubai, the shining jewel of the Imperial colonial holdings that was quickly becoming the new Timbuktu of its age. When he had been appointed as Governor, it was implicitly understood that he was expected to bring his substantial experience in fortune building to this diamond in the sands.\n\nYears before he had ever stepped foot in the place, Rome had naturally set its eyes on the potential that could be harvested from the city, and the Dubai Project had been initiated with a good deal of capital being forwarded by Mattei himself and ENI. More pressing recent events had somewhat slowed the project down, it was true, but as he looked out into the city, he felt confident in his ability to not only bring the development back up to speed, but to improve efficiency and profits as he always had been able to. With Italy's victory against Turkey perhaps funding would even be increased, but regardless of that decision Mattei felt the confidence of a man in his twenties.\n\nOnly a few blocks from where he currently stood overlooking the city blanketed in night, the skeletal frames of skyscrapers were beginning to take shape like metal Towers of Babylon destined to reach the very ceiling of the world. Only this time God would not strike the humans down, for no God Mattei could imagine would oppose such growth. Further back were the offices at the outskirts of the city where the new districts were being drawn up and logistics were crunched by Italian clerks. The wine tasted good, Mattei thought as he placed the finished glass down on a nearby table, but the future, now that would be delicious to behold."

Gifts, generous agreements, even the occasional overlook of impropriety, none of it seemed to be having an impact on their behavior. If this kept up for any longer...\n\n\"Frederico\", Mattei fixed his aide with a stare that was more severe than any the young man had ever seen his boss wear in all his years at ENI, \"Call the regional ENI administrators.

He had proven difficult to convince to attend this meeting and was generally unhelpful in dealings with either the Empire or ENI. His brother Zayed, who flanked the emir silently like a shadow, now he seemed to be far more amicable with Mattei and the Italians generally. Eventually, Mattei ruminated, he would have to deal with the pair in some fashion, but that was still in the uncertain future. He had to focus on the present, the first meeting of the Council of Emirs he had established to act as an advisory body to the office of the governor was about to convene.

No, the time for trepidation and caution was truly over with the emirs having been scattered to the wind, civil unrest in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Emirates put down, and the ever-meddlesome Oriana's powerbase pacified.\n\nThings had never looked brighter for the Empire's profit margin in the Gulf, and that meant that once again Enrico Mattei had proven his worth to his country and the world. True, it was not exactly as peaceful a process as he might have hoped, but veteran businessman that he was, Mattei understood all too well that negotiations never go as smoothly as the negotiators would hope. And yet, despite his understanding of the cold realities of politics and government, and despite the sense of triumph he ought to have felt for all that he had accomplished, the aging magnate felt a gnawing, quiet sadness that made him doubt himself.

In the darkness an example of what could be now shown as a bright light to all who hoped to see the dreams of conquered peoples fulfilled. Of course, some were less than enthused. The Greater German Reich and Japanese Empire, likely fearful of their own subjects being stirred to action heavily suppressed the news and in rare cases where they did publicly acknowledge it, were openly scornful.\n\nIn Italy however, the news was greeted with a good deal of positivity from most quarters, with both FD and DC hailing Mattei as a great statesman who secured the best deal possible for both the Gulf and the Motherland. BN's response was overall less than enthused but this was tempered by the feelings of some party leaders that this action would in the long run prevent a waste of resources in putting down uprisings and strife. Even former Duce Ciano was quoted in the papers expressing support for the newly created United Emirates and hoping for a \"long lasting and fruitful friendship between the two nations and peoples.\"\n\nThe seeds for that friendship seem to have already been planted in fact, with many deals remaining in place to allow Italy access to the Gulf's resources while providing protection for the UAE against its neighbors. Pledging to repay the generosity shown to it by its former suzerain, the UAE has bestowed to former Governor and current ENI chairman Mattei its highest honors as the beginning of its show of gratitude.\""

He had sat here on many occasions both during his forebears term and in the years since his own ascension, but he had never felt such anger as he did now during any of those times of crisis. His face was tinged pink with suppressed rage and the veins on his bald head were quite visible.\n\nHe turned to the SIM officer who sat to his left, taking a moment to compose himself before speaking, \"And so you still can't establish contact with ENI's gulf office?\"\n\nThe spook looked nervous, his eyes darting around the room at the others waiting on the answer as if he expected one of them to come to his rescue. Finally, sensing the futility of the act, he turned to his Duce and with a professional yet uncertain voice responded, \"No, Duce Scorza, contact has not been reestablished since its termination seven hours ago. Our last report was that Governor Mattei's plane had gone down, and that he was presumed dead. They were in chaos sir, and the small task force that was deployed to establish the situation informed us that a new authority, calling itself the National Union Committee is in control there now.\"\n\nIt was all Scorza could do to keep from slamming his fist into the table. Damn that bastard Mattei, if only he hadn't gone and flown in that rinky-dink little toy plane. A major colony had gone dark and might be forever lost due to one man's stupidity. If Mattei were here now, he mused to himself, he would be dead all over again."

Should they attempt to do so in the Gulf, they will know be faced with the steely gaze and iron resolve of\n\nRome expects results from their new man in the Gulf, and the Admiral is determined to deliver, regardless of his own personal misgivings about his new assignment.

It was heavily supported by both the ruling class of the Gulf, particularly the Emir of Abu Dhabi, and the ENI corporation. Unfortunately, it has proven to be a massive boondoggle that is horrendously over-budget and behind schedule. A spectacular failure to match its ambitions it would seem.\n\nGovernor Oriana is not the kind of man to sit idly by and watch such a wreck accumulate with graft and debt that falls onto the poor and the workers while those who caused the failure are never held accountable. The military has instilled in him the virtues of responsibility and frugality. He will soon send out a memo outlining the discontinuation of the project."

The forces of his Fourth Naval Division stand ready to defend the Gulf and can never have enough funding to support their task if Oriana is to be believed.

He of course does have this in mind, and that means that sooner or later, he will have to handle these troublesome relics of a past time. While he is accustomed to firing a gun more than negotiating conditions, Oriana is willing to respect their status at least for the purpose of preventing civil unrest and native resentment. He has already scheduled meetings with the various emirs and sheiks in which he will establish his supreme authority, but will promise not to interfere much in their private affairs.

In his capacity as Admiral, Oriana often worked with and grew to greatly respect this renowned regiment that has served the Empire across the globe defending her colonies. For this reason, the Governor has formally requested that the Lagunari be transferred to his Fourth Naval Division within the Gulf to bolster its defensive capabilities against internal and external threats. The Lagunari's flexible tactical abilities provide the Gulf a new wild card to play against regional threats.

ENI and the emirs have issued predictable protests, claiming that the military is well stocked and these resources could be put to better use, but Oriana is as uninterested in their whining as always.

Native groups that wish to merge with the Commissariati are free to do so, but any groups that refuse and continue to carry out policing actions will be considered vigilante groups and will be dealt with harshly.

Whether this is through government positions, privileges, favors, even a few back-room deals, Oriana will bite his tongue and even embarrass himself in his attempt to keep his position unassailable from within.

This gives them quite a bit of leverage in policy making, and right now they are asking the governor to increase immigration. The reason is obvious, they need more bodies to work their oil rigs, their company stores, the million little positions that need filling. The Governor, having little cause to oppose them in this, has agreed to allow an increase in immigration, especially from India, but he has not gone quite as far as they would have liked. Agreeing to all of ENI's demands would allow them to exploit the migrants who would be coming in, and Oriana considers himself a man of principle. He is the government, not ENI."

It was good that Oriana insisted upon Italian police structures being imported to the Gulf. It turns out the emirs won't be needed much in this case, and all the better in the Governor's opinion.

As of right now, the majority of the workers employed in this task are either professionals from Italy or natives from the Gulf while a sizable minority are migrant workers from abroad, usually India. The problem is that even the lowest paid among these still require some payment, especially thanks to ENI Chairman Mattei's increase in general wages. Eventually, our plans to increase production will be limited by our ability to pay, and we just can't afford a profit fall off. That is why we jumped at the new proposal by the Minister of Justice back in Rome. The creation of dedicated worker penal colonies out in the desert will provide us with a significant boost to our human resources while keeping expenses about the same."

While nominally a friend and acceptor of Italian hegemony, it is quite apparent to Governor Oriana that the oil rich kings to his west are not to be trusted under any circumstances. He is of the opinion that they would seize any opportunity presented to attempt to secure the hidden treasures of the Gulf for their own pockets. Never one to allow the enemy to catch him unawares, Oriana has made his hawkish stance clear with a new directive to increase border security and defenses.

Of course, there is an equally expanding underclass within these cities that is there to maintain this system, and we cannot ignore them either.

Our efforts must always be increasing, our tools ever improving if we wish to keep Italy as the world's fourth superpower. Buying off the rights to oil-rich patches of sand from their native owners is now a major function of the Governorate, with an entire division of staffers, clerks, and lawyers handling acquisition.

After conferring with his advisors and ENI officials for some time, Oriana proposed a somewhat modified approach. While new districts would need to be planned and constructed, they will be built by migrants being paid good money, and will be built to match the average standard of living back home.

No, Governor Oriana has always been committed to providing just recompense for labor, including mandated fair pay and benefits standards, if only to prevent revolts by the masses.\n\nSo far pilot programs meant to test the efficiency of such a policy have produced excellent results where the loss of net income from increased payments is matched or exceeded by an increase in productivity."

We had already planned to offer them government stipends and legal immunity from most prosecution but they are planning to demand even more concessions! They now want our government to subsidize their travel and their retinues.

While the old admiral has never cared for Shakbut in particular of all the emirs, the man's wealth and influence combined with his ties to the Saudis make him one to be wary of at all times. In this new climate where the emirs dominate the scene, indulging him seems to be Oriana's only possible option for the time being.

His eyes darted across his desk to the flask he occasionally would take a pull or two from after a hard day's work. He emptied it with an almost ferocious intensity. The flask spent, it too was dropped to the floor alongside the message that had roused such a reaction from the normally taciturn admiral.\n\nHe felt sick to his stomach, and the world seemed to sway as if the ship was in the middle of a violent storm rather than at its moorings in port. He had never asked for it, never even expressed an interest in the role, and yet they had forced it upon him anyway. He briefly wondered how long they had been planning this move; his mind ranged from the end of the Italo-Turkish war all the way back to when he had been first assigned to the Guld. He tried to remember any clues within his memories but the combination of the alcohol and his own nerves made such thought almost impossible.\n\nApparently the noise of his collapse into the chair or the sound of his flask hitting the ground must have been heard because at that moment a junior officer entered the room, \"Sir, are you all right sir?\"\n\nWith weary eyes the admiral surveyed the young man, and with a voice that was almost a croak he blurted out:"

Henceforth, the resources that were allocated to this unfortunate boondoggle will be reappropriated and distributed to more efficient and important uses. These uses shall include but are not limited to greater fleet funding, the development of industry in the Governorate, and programs that will more directly help all of the Empire's citizens in the Gulf, not just a single tourist trap of a city.\n\nA wish for this act to be representative of how I plan to execute my role here as governor in that I will prioritize the citizens and the nation above all else.

He did have a point about the riots of course, but to Oriana, the man's presence would be required to help quell the anger that had caused them. For that reason and for no other, Oriana kept his cool.\n\n\"I am sorry for any inconvenience that I may have caused your excellency, but, if I may be so bold, I wish to discuss with you my new plan for administering the Governorate.\" That at least got Shakbut's attention. Seeing that his bait had been taken, Oriana pressed it, \"I think it is high time I involve you and your peers more in the running of the region. After all, you are the rightful magistrates of the land and the people, no?\"\n\nFlattery was always a sure bet with the haughty emir of Abu Dhabi, and Oriana watched as the nobleman nodded his head slowly, processing the out of character request. After a few moments of silence, Shakbut took his seat, the beginning of a smile that Oriana did not at all like creeping onto his face.\n\nOriana knew that he was doing what had to be done to exact his duty as leader of the Governorate but his heart sank in his chest when Shakbut began to gleefully demand concessions from him in order to secure cooperation.

Several of his fellow security officers were of course present, but they seemed to be dwarfed both figuratively and physically by the senior officers of Oriana's own Fourth Naval Division. While the company security forces stood with a meek deference the professional military men moved about planning and issuing commands with a disciplined stiffness that made the officer glad that they were in charge.\n\nA few aides, couriers, and communication officers rounded out the room's complement overseeing the riot control effort. Lately riots had been appearing with greater frequency and furor over reasons that ranged from ENI policies to the excesses of the ruling emirs. The security officer himself had been on hand for at least half a dozen of them that he could call to mind.\n\nFor a moment, he thought that the Governor was not present, and turned to go find the man, but it was then that he noticed that he had been in the room the whole time, slumped deep into his chair, eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep no doubt. Despite the signs of mental and physical fatigue, the old soldier was in the middle of an animated discussion.\n\n\"This is the last time I will allow the emirs to disappoint the Empire, do you understand me? Not only have they played a part in the cause of these riots but their token efforts and putting them down have proven pathetic at best! From now on, it will be the policy of the governorate to limit their power whenever possible. Now leave me, I have a headache coming on...\""

The exhaustion that gripped him was such that he found himself falling right into his bed with his work clothes still on. It was hard to believe that only a few minutes earlier he had spoken to a crowd of thousands as a riot burned around them. He hadn't intended to do anything of the sort when he joined a mostly-peaceful demonstration along with many of his fellow Indian migrant workers. True, he had developed an interest in politics back home but he had to work for a living, and politics sure wouldn't put food on the table, so he had made the decision to travel to the job-saturated Governorate of the Gulf.\n\nStill, when one of his coworkers asked if anyone had any words for the crowd, Dasgupta, quite to his own surprise, found himself mustering his courage and energy. The speech he delivered wasn't particularly novel, and in fact most of it had been cribbed from the various sociliast theorists he had been reading in his downtime, but it proved to be a pleaser nonetheless. The idea of a worker-run state proved to be, unsurprisingly in hindsight, appealing to the mostly Arab and Indian workforce that made up the group.\n\nHe had never seen himself as any type of leader, political or otherwise, despite his interests before tonight, but now? Well, if he could do something to help his fellow brothers and sisters struggling to survive in this harsh land of sand, perhaps that wouldn't be such a bad thing."

The Governor could be fed a yarn about them being for the emir's personal security force. Shakbut doubted that Oriana would even bother to check the story, the man was quickly becoming a drunken mess.\n\n\"Please, make it so.

When the Italian Empire dispatched seasoned admiral Giuseppe Oriana to act as Governor over its most profitable colony, experts had predicted that his term would be marked with a strengthening of state authority over the region and a possible increase in tensions with the Saudi Kingdom, which also has its eyes on the oil-saturated coast. While that prophecy proved true for a time, recent developments suggest that Admiral Oriana was perhaps not as ideal a choice as first appeared.\n\nOur sources have told us that the Ministry of Imperial Possessions was first alerted to the situation occurring in the Gulf when it was too late to act. By that time, we are told, Governor Oriana had already been forced to abandon the colony with all of his forces in tow. While there has been no violence reported it was clear that our forces were threatened with attack had they remained in the region.\n\nAt this time we are told that the government is closely monitoring the developing situation and is also keeping a close eye on the Saudi response."

It hadn't been a smooth journey of course, the entrenched powers in the Gulf, the emirs and ENI alike had been troublesome but by elevating the people and the ever-loyal Italian military to more prominent positions of power, he could curb and then crush the outdated noble authority the emirs still clung to.\n\nThat was all in the past however, and as good as it was to remember the success he had found, Oriana understood that looking ever forward was the best way to prevent stagnation and rot. He would not become complacent, he thought to himself as he enjoyed a small tug from his flask. Even now, there were those who could still prove a threat to Italian control in the Gulf, both within and without. He would never permit agitators or the likes of the Saudis to steal all that he had helped build personally. The flask empty, he tossed it off the balcony and into the water."

He had been led to believe that it was merely a few scattered demonstrations by laborers, most of whom worked for ENI's Gulf operations and were largely either native Arabs or Indians who had come to seek good-paying jobs. The admiral-turned-governor assumed that the local state peace officers would be able to put down the protests, after all, they seemed to be far smaller in scope than previous riots. So Oriana waited, expecting reports of successful operations in all areas. Instead, he was told that the rioters had swelled in massive numbers, almost half of the population by some estimates, and had taken over multiple cities.\n\nOriana was never able to understand, at least in the short time he had left as governor, the reason behind the uprising. Hadn't he done his best to provide for the people of the Gulf, Italian, Arab, and Indian alike? Hadn't he broken the power of the autocratic and arbitrary emirs? Hadn't he reestablished law and order during the previous riots? He had done all of this in fact, but he had not realized the full implications of his actions. Through his welfare programs, he had taught the people of the Gulf to understand the benefits of state support; through his destruction of the emirs, he had taught the people that autocrats could be toppled; through his repression of dissent, he had marked himself an enemy of those in the Gulf eager for self-determination and freedom.\n\nThe apparent leader of the uprising, Gurudas Dashgupta, had not proclaimed himself as such, but through his own charisma and skill and organization and management had made himself the man for the job. He announced an end to the Governorate of the Gulf as Oriana's Fourth Naval Division evacuated from the port at Dubai, declaring that the new worker's state of the Gulf would stand as a beacon of decolonization and the spirit of the Revolution."

He was quite pleased in fact, as to him, the extreme decadence was a sign of the Saudi's desire to gain the Gulf on their side. Of course thought the emir, he needed the Saudis as much if not more than they needed him. Weakened as they may have been in recent years, the Italian Empire was nothing to scoff at, and that meant the Gulf would need a new patron in order to survive.\n\nAs if summoned by the thought, there stood King Suad bin Abdulraziz al Suad himself in all his kingly majesty, with a robe that must have been worth more than a small house at least by the estimation of Shakbut.\n\n\"Welcome my honored guest, I hope the journey treated you well?

From his court in Riyadh the lord of the wandering desserts and keeper of the Holy Cities plotted how he could best achieve his dreams of an Arab world under one banner, his banner. When Admiral Giuseppe Oriana, a known hawk, was given governorship, the king feared that his wait would never end, but it turned out that the old warrior would deliver the Gulf directly into Saudi hands.\n\nWhen riots erupted in multiple cities across the Gulf, Saudi money was discretely laundered to support them, when Emir Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi was given greater responsibility in the running of the colony, the flattery was non-ceasing, and when at last the Emirs pushed off the Italian yoke, it was the Kingdom that moved to guarantee their independence. The long chess game for control of the Gulf had finally come to a close, and King Abdulraziz was the victor. He did not waste the opportunity, and within weeks of the Gulf's independence, he had enticed Shakbut to enter into the Arab League that would be the vehicle for Saudi hegemony over the Arab world."
