 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_2:0 "추가 방위군 지원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "불가리아는 인력이 매우 부족합니다. 우리가 주둔해 있는 주둔군의 병력을 늘리기 위해 추가 방위군을 파병하면 그 지역에서 우리의 영향력이 높아질 것입니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "조국전선은 한 번에 사라져야 합니다. 불가리아의 일반인들이 이 반역자 도당에 대해 아무 생각도 없다면 한 번에 밟아버릴 수 없습니다. 나라 내에 긴장을 좀 일으켜야 합니다. 우리는 지방에서 소동을 좀 일으킨 뒤에 그 선동꾼 폭도들 탓으로 돌릴 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_1:0 "전선 단원들을 위한 가짜 신분증"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "지하 조직 조국전선 중 많은 이들은 블랙리스트에 등재되어 있기에 지하에 숨을 수 밖에 없습니다. 새로운 신분증과 출생 증명서를 만들어줘서 새 동맹을 도울 수 있습니다. 불가리아는 낙후된 것으로 악명 높은 곳입니다. 우리는 그 점을 이용할겁니다!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2:0 "조국전선에게 공격 누명 씌우기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "불가리아 내 우리 영향력에게 가장 큰 위협이 되는게 뭘까요. 당연히 조국전선입니다. 이 유격대가 우리에게 계속 골칫거리가 되었다고요? 우리가 놈들을 산적떼로 만들어 사람들이 등을 돌리게 만든다면 이 지역 내 우리 인기를 늘릴 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2:0 "전선으로 군복 밀수"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "우리 동맹을 잘만 꾸민다면, 불가리아군 하급 부대에 조국전선 단원들을 심어놓을 수 있는 가능성이 큽니다. 이들의 점호는 엉망입니다. 적절한 장비를 가진 채 재빨리 \"재배치 명령\"을 위조한 소수라면 군대에 빠르게 잠입할 수 있을 것입니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_3:0 "불 붙이기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "대중에게 공포를 심어주려면 소피아의 주요 정부청사가 완벽한 목표일겁니다. 이미 이런 건물 중 많은 수가 우리 병사들의 보호를 받고 있습니다. 우리 손으로 불을 지른 뒤에 조국전선 도적 놈들이 벌인 일이라고 하는 일은 쉬울 것입니다..."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_3:0 "불가리아 참모 교란"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "괴로운 사실이지만, 불가리아인들은 자국 군대를 유심히 보고 있습니다. 이는 전선 내 우리 아군이 불가리아군에 침투하기 힘들게 만듭니다. 알바니아에서 일련의 소규모 전쟁연습을 벌여 불가리아 참모부를 교란할 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_4:0 "주둔군 동원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "불가리아는 아직 비상 사태를 선언하지 않았습니다. 우리 병사들을 동원하면 불가리아 정부가 겁에 질려 우리에게 필요한 다음 단계를 밟을 가능성이 큽니다. 불가리아와의 관계가 악화되겠지만요."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_4:0 "사면 로비"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_2_decision_4_desc:0 "불가리아인들이 잠시 동안 국내 안보를 보지 못하도록 이탈리아 대표단을 보낼 수도 있습니다. 조국전선을 구성하는 다양한 정당의 합법화와 전선 다원 전부의 사면을 요구하는거죠. 물론 불가리아는 받아들이지 않을겁니다. 이런 요구는 완전 용납할 수 없게 보일겁니다. 하지만 우리 친구들이 군대로 침투하는데 필요한 위장은 되어줄겁니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "분견대 무장"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "전선이 점점 문제가 되고 있습니다. 불가리아 현장에 있는 경비 인원들은 소총 한 정씩을 들게 될겁니다. 우리가 더 많은 총을 보내면 불가리아는 다시 한 번 우리에게 감사할겁니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_1:0 "정부와의 연락망 동원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "차르 시메온과 직접 연락을 취해야 합니다. 지역 연락망을 동원해 독일놈들과 그 개들을 우회할 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2:0 "선전작전 개시"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "차르에 대한 지지도가 계속 줄어들고 있습니다. 대중의 인식을 바꿔야 합니다. 차르를 국가에 필요한 아버지상으로 묘사해야 합니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_2:0 "반독성향 관료 식별"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "정부에 있는 불가리아인 전부가 나치 꼭두각시는 아닙니다. 차르에게 충성스러운 자들을 찾아내야 합니다."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "차르와 연락하기 힘든 이유 중 하나로는 차르가 독일인들과 그 부역자들로 둘러싸여 있어서도 있습니다. 충성파에게 군 보급품을 지원해준다면 우리 친구들이 차르에게 더 가까이 가도록 할 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4:0 "항공 정찰"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "우리의 적은 시골 깊숙한 곳에 숨어 있습니다. 쥐를 잡으려면 쥐를 찾아야 합니다. 다행히 루프트바페는 이런 일을 잘 합니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "시메온 가택연금"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "정보요원들이 알려오길 이탈리아인들이 차르 시메온과 직접 연락하려는 시도를 한답니다. 그렇게 둘 순 없습니다. 주둔군 한 연대를 시메온의 거처로 보내 경비를 서게할겁니다. 불가리아인들이 좋아하건 싫어하건 상관 없습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_1:0 "조국전선 무장"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "불가리아 국민들이 자유를 위해 싸울 때입니다! 나치 헤게모니에 맞서 싸울 의지가 있다면 소총 한 정을 받을 것입니다!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "반대파 협박"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "이 정치적 소란이 벌어지는 동안 차르의 자문 몇몇이 자신들의 \"걱정\"을 말하고자 튀어나왔습니다. 우리는 속지 않습니다. 행정부는 눈치를 보며 지지자를 모으려합니다. 용납할 수 없습니다. 놈들을 원래 자리로 돌려보내야 합니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2:0 "소문 퍼뜨리기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "SS가 차르를 독살했다! 히틀러가 반대파를 납치해 죽음의 수용소로 보낸다! 독일 주둔군이 정부에게 총을 겨누고 협박한다! 사실이던 아니던 별 상관 없습니다. 우린 민중이 분노해 라이히에 맞서 일어나기만을 바랍니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "불가리아군 지원 획득"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "불가리아군에 우리 친구가 좀 있습니다. 거기 있는 아군에게 부탁을 해 승인을 받을 때입니다. 불가리아군의 지원은 이후에 결정적일 수도 있습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3:0 "시위자 격려"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "국민의 의지는 알려져야만 합니다! 독일에 맞서는건 차르만이 아닙니다. 국민들도 독일 점령군에게 분노를 품고 있습니다. 시민들에게 거리에 모이라고 격려한다면 독일인들도 자신들이 불가리아에서 환영받지 못한다는걸 알겁니다!"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "중립파 관료에게 뇌물 먹이기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "불가리아 정부에 말하자면 중립인 관료 몇 명이 있습니다. 우리 영향력에 완전 적대적이지는 않지만 우리는 저들이 우호적이라고도 여기지 않습니다. 이들의 노고에 대한 감사의 뜻으로 현금을 준다면 이 중립파 약간을 우리의 뜻으로 설득시킬 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4:0 "독일 초소 공격"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "우리 아군들은 아직 독일 시설을 직접 공격할 수단이 없습니다. 소규모 이탈리아 특수요원들을 불가리아로 파견해 독일 요새를 타격하고 오만한 적들의 사기를 뒤흔들 수 있습니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "주둔군 배치"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "소피아에서 많은 수의 시위꾼과 반역자들이 폭동을 일으켰습니다! 빠르게 막지 않는다면 우리의 불가리아 지배를 위협할 수 있습니다. 당장 멈춰야합니다. 주둔군을 배치하십시오!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1:0 "봉기 조직 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "조국전선이 수도를 탈환할 준비를 거의 마쳤습니다! 하지만 떼지어서 거리로 나가는 것 외에는 제대로 된 계획이 없습니다. 그럴 일은 없을겁니다. 우리가 전문적인 참모장교 일부를 보내 봉기 계획을 도와줄 것입니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "알려진 지도자 체포"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "불가리아 정부는 모르는 일이지만, 우리 정보요원들에겐 알려진 조국전선 단원들의 목록이 있습니다. 놈들의 주최자와 지도자를 체포하면 이 \"봉기\"를 혼란에 빠트릴 수 있습니다.."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2:0 "독일 주둔군 교란"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "봉기의 가장 큰 장애물은 소피아에 있는 강화도니 독일 주둔군입니다. 우리 병사들을 보내 사복으로 위장한 채 독일 보급망을 타격하게 한다면 많은 수의 주둔군을 도시에서 빼낼 수 있습니다. 놈들은 시골에서 무위로 돌아갈 추격전을 벌이겠죠."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "차르를 소피아에서 빼내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "차르는 문제가 됩니다. 불가리아 내 독일 영향력에 호의적이지 않으며 차르가 이 반란에 보내는 지지는 처참한 결과를 불러올 수 있습니다. 차르의 \"신변\"과 \"안전\"을 위해 잠시 도시에서 빼낼 수 있습니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3:0 "대중 무장시키기"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "놀라운 일도 아니지만 소피아 민중 중 많은 이들이 불가리아 내에서 날뛰는 독일 권세에 싫증이 났습니다. 이들을 무장시키면 반란의 성공률이 크게 증가할겁니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "무장한 시위꾼에게 사격"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "무장한 군중이 거리로 나왔습니다. 긴박한 상황이지만 아직 시가전이 벌어지지는 않았습니다. ...아직은요. 이렇게 공개적으로 반항하는 꼴을 봐줄 수 없습니다. 화기를 든 시민이 우리 장병들의 눈에 띈다면 총에 맞을겁니다!"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4:0 "할 수 있는 모든 부탁"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_4_desc:0 "불가리아 전역의 정부 요인들은 우리에게 빚을 졌습니다. 경찰서장, 군 장교, 관료들, 기타 등등. 지금만큼 그 빚을 되돌려받기 좋은 시간은 없습니다."
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "증원군 요청"
 GreatGame_GER_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "명확한 사실입니다. 이 반란을 억제할 만큼의 독일군이 현장에 없습니다. 소피아를 계속 통제하려면 더 많은 병력을 현장에 보내야합니다."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5:0 "군 내 점조직 활동 개시"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_1_turn_5_decision_5_desc:0 "지난 두 달 동안 많은 양의 조국전선 요원을 불가리아군에 잠입시켰습니다. 이제 이 요원들로 병력 내에 혼란을 일으킬 때입니다. 이는 군의 대응 속도를 늦추고 봉기 성공률을 높여줄겁니다."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "Though our relationship with Hungary has soured over the decade, we still have a number of friends in high places from the glory days of the Reich. Reconnecting with them would be a good first step towards mending our relationship with them."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1:0 "이탈리아 대표단 파견"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_1_desc:0 "It has been nearly a decade since an Italian delegation has been sent to Hungary. If we want to repair our damaged relations with them, we need to send some of our higher ranker officials to show that we're serious, and want to work with them."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "화살십자당 후원"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "During the Second World War, the best of all the Hungarians were part of the Arrow Cross party. Ferociously nationalistic and aware of the danger of the Eternal Jew, the Arrow Cross is the Hungarian equivalent of the Nazi party. They are our natural allies, and are worthy of our funding. Their gratitude will be well worth the cost."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2:0 "헝가리 대사관 재개장"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_2_desc:0 "Ever since our relations with Germany collapsed in the 50s, the Hungarian embassy has been closed due to their alignment with Germany. Times have changed, however. Reopening the embassy would be a good first step to establishing our ties with the Hungarian government."
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "준군사조직 훈련"
 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Paramilitaries in Hungary are almost exclusively nationalistic patriots aghast at Hungary's embarrassing defeats in the 50s. These men would be thrilled and indebted to us if we help train these zealous patriots."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3:0 "좋은 무역협정 제안"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "Trade between the Italian and Hungarian markets is almost non-existent at the moment. We can change this by offering the Hungarian government favorable import and export rates to encourage more trade."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4:0 "독일의 제한 무시"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_2_turn_1_decision_4_desc:0 "Technically, the Reich has a plethora of trade and diplomatic restrictions in place that any foreign countries need to deal with when trying to establish relations with a member of their so called \"Pakt\". In reality, these restrictions are nothing more than formalities. We can safely ignore them at the expense of our already deteriorating relations with the Reich."

 GreatGame_GER_game_2_turn_2_decision_1:0 "요원 배치"

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The French Airforce is almost non-existent. This actually works out in our favor; it keeps the French dependent on us for protection. That said, they should have something in the event that air power is needed on short notice. It certainly wouldn't hurt to give the French a small number of our spare interceptors."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3:0 "소규모 워게임 주최"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The Italian and French armies haven't really worked together since the 20s. As a show of goodwill and trust, we should host some small scale wargames so both their and our men can interact with each other and forge new bonds and a sense of comradery."
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "해군 훈련 주최"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The French aren't only focusing on their land forces; they have for years supported a small but efficient coast guard. Hosting some naval exercise costs us little and increases our cohesion and relations with the French."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4:0 "국경 개방"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "Since our falling out with the Reich, the French-Italian border has been closed off, and only a chosen few are able to cross it.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5:0 "육군을 위한 화포"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "The French army lacks heavy guns even more than they do for small arms. Regular French divisions pack nearly no punch as a result, and as it stands would be smashed in any conventional confrontation.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6:0 "지원장비 보내기"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_3_decision_6_desc:0 "It's as if the French army has produced nothing for their men for two decades! Even the most basic equipment, like radios, is absent from their stockpiles. How their army even functions is beyond our understanding. Some basic support equipment would be put to good use by the French."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "라이히에서 프랑스인 노예 해방"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Italians are making a strong bid to win over the French. We can not be outdone by them; releasing French slaves that work in the Reich will counter Italian influence and help us repair our relations with France."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1:0 "프랑스 시민들에게 배상"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "Many French natives within the Italian Empire have suffered injustice under our administration.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2:0 "부르군트 노예 구매"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "One of our dirtier secrets is the goings on in Burgundy. Life even for Aryans is harsh; the SS squeeze all the value out of all life in that blasted hell hole. There are slaves that are too ill or weak for work that the Ordensstaat does not care about; we can purchase these folks and set them free, returning them to France."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Much preparation needs to be made before the expected wave of French immigrants arrive in France proper. We can send some engineers to France to assist in building temporary encampments for the newcomers."

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands of French soldiers who fought against us in the Second World War are still rotting away in prison camps. Old, demoralized, and quite frankly a drain on resources, these men are literally good for nothing. Their final use can be propaganda; we can parole all of the survivors and send them back to France as a show of \"goodwill\"."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3:0 "프랑스계 코르시카인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "For over a decade, French citizens living on Corsica have chaffed under Italian administration.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "프랑스인 노예 \"배상\""
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Some of our recently freed slaves have worked for as long as two decades with little to no pay under brutal working conditions. We should offer them some token compensation to assuage their pain and to \"right wrongs\". Or rather, make the French State think we care. Same thing."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4:0 "프랑스계 알제리인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "French Algeria has always been a harsh colony to survive in, and the change in administration has not been kind for the French community there.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5:0 "프랑스계 시리아인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "The French community in Syria has always been small. Comparatively privileged compared to other settlers, the French here has still lost many of the boons they once had when the Italian administration moved in. A good portion of them would be more than willing to make the return trip home to France if given the opportunity."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6:0 "본토 프랑스인에게 이주 기회 제안"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_6_desc:0 "Although their living conditions are heads and shoulders above their compatriots in the colonies, many French citizens in our mainland European conquests have nonetheless not been thrilled to live under what they see as a foreign occupation. We know many are willing to leave for what remains of France; we only need to allow them to leave."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7:0 "동아프리카 프랑스인 재정착 지원"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_4_decision_7_desc:0 "Compared to their fellow countrymen in the other colonies, the few French living in East Africa have more or less continued to live a hard life in the harsh environment around the horn of Africa. Most of these settlers are poor and always have been. An opportunity to move to France, sponsored by the government no less will have many men jumping at the opportunity to finally leave the poor poverty stricken colony."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1:0 "프랑스 경제 투자"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_1_desc:0 "The French economy has been stagnant for over fifty years.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "프랑스 해안에서 해군 훈련"
 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Something France totally lacks is a navy. They can not project any power past their coasts; they simply don't have the ships to protect any of their shipping in any waters they operate in.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2:0 "전차 선물"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "German stipulations stipulated that the French could not operate their own armored formations. As a result, development of tanks in France has ground to a halt for two decades.

 GreatGame_GER_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "Sometimes, blunt words face to face is the simplest way to convey a message. Our message will be short; leave the Pakt and throw your lot in with the traitorous Italians, and there will be dire consequences."
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3:0 "서해안 항구 개발"
 GreatGame_ITA_game_4_turn_5_decision_3_desc:0 "French docks have been seriously neglected. To make matters worse for them, their largest one in the north have been taken from them. Luckily, there are plenty of perfect locations on their west coast for potential, large dockyards."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_1_decision_3_desc:0 "It's hard to really blame our men in Serbia for not wiping out the various partisans fighting us since many of the garrisons have a critical lack of heavy guns. Considering that most of the rebel encampments are hidden deep in fortified mountain and forest strongholds, it's suicidal to just assault them without heavy firepower.

Many would like to leave to start anew in Serbia, but don't have the funds or aren't able to cross the border without express permission. We can offer a one time deal to help them make the journey at our expense."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_1_desc:0 "Thousands of Serbians sit idle in despair, sucking up resources and not contributing to society. These people are basically unexploited resources, hungering for the chance to do some honest work for a little pay and food.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "The refugee camps are simply overcrowded and not optimized for large scale work projects.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_2_decision_2_desc:0 "There is a serious bottleneck on the poorly maintained Serbian roads; the antique vehicles that are currently being used by the various humanitarian agencies at work frequently break down, and to top it off can carry very little cargo.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_2_decision_3_desc:0 "Thousands still stand jobless and stuck in the refugee camps. Why not put them to work ourselves?

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_1_desc:0 "It is well known that there is much resentment towards the German occupation in the Serbian collaboration government.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2:0 "민간 경제 투자"
 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_2_desc:0 "Foreign investments in Serbia have been nearly non-existent for over a decade.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_3_decision_3_desc:0 "The bulk of the Serbian resistance hides out in the vast, rugged countryside of Serbia.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_4_desc:0 "The deal needs to be altered. Trade between us and Serbia is simply not profitable for either country; barely any goods flow between our two nations. We can change stipulations to get more German goods on their market, and in exchange we can buy raw materials like iron and coal for cheap. The Serbians will not be pleased to be forced into a trade treaty with no say, but it must be done."

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_3_decision_5_desc:0 "Serbia has no domestic arms industry, so to speak. This is a shame, since there is much money to be made selling armaments. We could sell arms licenses to our allies, who could then use said license to turn a pretty penny in sales."

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_1_desc:0 "The Resistance in Serbia, on further analysis, is in a pitiful state. Only the most hardened and seasoned men have serviceable equipment; way too many of these \"freedom fighters\" are no more than men with sticks.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_2_desc:0 "Although there are a few partisans who have been fighting the Germans for over two decades, many of the fighters here are young, green, and haven't seen any fighting apart from taking pot-shots from the woods.

 GreatGame_ITA_game_5_turn_4_decision_3_desc:0 "The Germans operate armored cars throughout the region as mobile patrol units.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_4_desc:0 "Ever since we've started our occupation of Serbia, the garrison has always lacked the necessary manpower to properly garrison the small country.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_4_decision_5_desc:0 "One of our key advantages we have over any partisan group that resists the Reich is total air superiority.

 GreatGame_GER_game_5_turn_5_decision_2_desc:0 "Many of the refugees are becoming restless. This isn't a huge concern, but it still makes our administration look bad. We could temporarily placate them by giving most upset refugees some extra supplies, and maybe even a few luxuries."
