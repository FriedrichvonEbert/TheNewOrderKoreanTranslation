 IBR_Antonio_Salazar:0 "안토니우 드 올리베이라 살라자르"
 IBR_Antonio_Salazar_dep_desc:0 "§Y이베리아의 카우디요\n전제주의§!"
 POLITICS_ANTONIO_DE_OLIVEIRA_SALAZAR_IBERIA_DESC:0 "1932년부터 포르투갈의 지도자인 안토니우 드 올리베이라 살라자르를 단순히 기계적인 관료라고 치부하는 것은 상당히 부당한 평가입니다. 프랑코가 스페인을 장악하기 수 년 전 포르투갈의 권력을 잡은 살라자르는 정당한 자격으로 정치 권력자가 되었습니다. 독일군이 앙골라와 모잠비크를 점령하며 압박하는 가운데 살라자르는 악마와의 거래를 받아들이기로 결심했습니다. 프랑코가 살라자르에게 접근하여 방위조약으로 모인 국가을 세우자고 제안하자, 살라자르는 이를 받아들어 포르투갈과 비슷한 우파 국가인 스페인과 합병했습니다. 이베리아 연합으로 합쳐진 두 국가는 화합하여 협력할 것이었습니다... 이론상으론 말이죠.\n\n하지만 실제로는 이론이 사실과 매우 멀었습니다. 살라자르는 포르투갈의 복지막큼이나 연합의 복지에 대해서도 별 관심이 없었습니다. 한편으로 살라자르는 국가를 해칠 수 있는 그 어떤것으로부터라도 조국을 수호하겠다는 열망으로 모든 안건에 대하여 거의 병적으로 거부권을 남발하며 연합을 완전히 굳혀버리면서 의회 내에서는 살라자르가 꽉 막힌 사람이라는 말을 듣게 되었습니다. "스페인의 포르투갈 탄압"이라는 살라자르의 편집증은 프랑코와 수많은 대립으로 이어졌고, 프랑코는 이베리아가 붕괴되는 수많은 이유 중 하나가 살라자르 때문이라고 생각하고 있습니다. 프랑코가 카우디요가 죽고 나서는 군주정으로 복고되어 스페인이 포르투갈을 완전히 흡수해버린다는 내용의 이른바 "계승법"을 통과시키러 하자 둘 사이 관계는 완전히 어긋났습니다. 심지어 살라자르가 복고주의자인 팔랑헤당들을 제거했음에도 불구하고 연합에 대항해 쿠데타를 일으키러 시도하기도 했습니다."

 IBR_Carlos_Asensio_Cabanillas:0 "카를로스 아센시오 카바니야스"
 
 IBR_Agustin_Munoz_Grandes:0 "아구스틴 무뇨스 그란데스"
 IBR_Agustin_Munoz_Grandes_desc:0 "아구스틴 무뇨스 그란데스만큼 이베리아에서 두려운 자는 없을 것입니다. 1896년 작은 농촌 마을에서 태어난 그는 리프 전쟁에서 자신이 지휘하는 군대가 행진하는 도시들마다 반란을 모조리 진압하면서 공로와 함께 잔인한 사람이라는 평판을 얻게 되었습니다. 1937년 그는 공화국 민병대의 학살을 가까스로 모면하고선 반군에 가담했고 1년 후에는 프랑코군의 사단장으로 진급했습니다. 아라곤과 카탈루냐에서 보인 훌륭한 전공으로 준장으로까지 진급했습니다.\n\n프랑코에게 눈에 띈 무뇨스 그란데스는 경험이 미숙하고 급직적인 우익 사상을 보여주었음에도 당서기로 임명되었습니다. 열렬한 히틀러의 지지자였던 그는 제2차 세계 대전 시기 동부전선에 자원하는 청색사단의 지휘관이 되어 매우 기뻐했고, 스페인 극우세력의 존경받는 영웅 취급을 받으며 레닌그라드로 진군했습니다.\n\n히틀러의 승리로 수립된 신질서에서 프랑코는 현실적으로 "히틀러가 제일 좋아하는 스페인 사람"을 버릴 순 없었지만, 자신보다 더 노골적으로 친나치적인 스페인 독재정권을 수립하러는 모습을 보이는 그란데스에게 두려움을 느끼고 있었습니다. 사실 프랑코가 살라자르와 함께 이베리아 연합으로 힘을 합치러던 것도 무뇨스 그란데스의 영향력이 더욱 커질 것을 두려워했기 때문입니다.\n\n종전 이후 독일과 나치즘에 대해서 다소 시들한 모습을 보이긴 헀지만 무뇨스 그란데스는 카우디요의 측근 중 가장 반동적인 세력입니다. 그는 현재 포르투갈이 스페인 문제에 가지고 있는 엄청난 영향력에게 불만을 가지고 있으며 많은 이들은 그는 프랑코가 유일한 카우디요였으면 좋을 것이라 생각한다고 여깁니다. 이 소문의 사실여하와 관계없이, 그란데스는 모든 이를 분쇄할 수 있는 강력하고도 권위적인 이베리아 정부가 들어서길 바라는 것이 분명합니다."

 IBR_Francisco_Coloma_Gallegos:0 "프란시스코 콜로마 가예고스"

 IBR_Mohammed_Mezziane:0 "모함메드 벤 미시안"
 IBR_Mohammed_Mezziane_desc:0 "변변찮은 부족장의 아들로 태어나, 무슬림인 타리피트인으로 자라난 모함메드 벤 미시안이 이베리아 최고의 장군 중 한 명으로 올라서기까지의 이야기는 매우 희귀한 일입니다. 미시안이 스페인어를 배우기 위해 식민지 학교에 재학했을 때, 스페인 국왕 알폰소 13세가 우연히 학교를 방문할 때 잠깐동안 만날 수 있는 기회가 생겼습니다. Impressing the king with his knowledge of European Geography and his ambition to join the Spanish military, when Mohamed's father was murdered the following year, the King himself paid for the boy to be educated at the Toledo Infantry Academy, overturning a rule that prohibited Muslims from receiving officer training.\n\nDuring the Rif war, Meziane served as a low ranking officer. When an ambush caught the Spanish camp by complete surprise, Meziane shot a rebel that had pointed a pistol at a little known lieutenant colonel.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Francisco Franco.\n\nThe two men became close friends on the campaign. Grateful that he had saved his life, after Franco rose to become General of the Army of Africa, he ensured that Meziane would be brought along to the top with him, with the newly appointed Caudillo naming him Commander General of Ceuta after the Civil War. Shortly after the establishment of the Iberian Union, he was promoted to Army General, and commanded the Iberian seizure of Morocco.\n\nMeziane is widely regarded in Rif and Morocco, as a man who practices Islam and is sympathetic to the concerns of the people in the Northwest African colonies. In recent years he has aided Prince Hassan in his efforts to maintain the peace in the face of rising anti-colonial sentiment. He maintains close personal friendships with both Caudillo Franco and the Moroccan Prince, and though Franco may trust him implicitly, others suspect he may be more loyal to the Kingdom of Morocco than the Iberian Union."

 IBR_Alfonso_Armada:0 "알폰소 아르마다"
 IBR_Alfonso_Armada_desc:0 "Alfonso Armada is among the youngest of Iberia's generals. Only a teenager when he served in the Civil War and only 22 when he marched into Leningrad with the Blue Division, his rise to prominence had little to do with his actual military talent. Rather, it was his connections to the royal family.\n\nAlfonso's father Luis was a Gentleman of the Chamber and close friend of King Alfonso XIII, such that Alfonso's own godmother was none other than the King's mother. He was among the men selected to groom Prince Juan Carlos for an eventual military career, tutoring the Prince throughout his childhood. They maintain a friendly relationship to this day.\n\nIn the reshuffling of the army command structure when the Iberian Union was established, Armada was promoted to Lieutenant General. Today he serves in some ways as a liaison between the Caudillos and the former Spanish royal family, serving as a conduit through which the Caudillos hope to ensure that Juan Carlos remains loyal to and supportive of the Iberian Union and its government."

 IBR_Antonio_Spinola:0 "안토니우 드 스피놀라"
 IBR_Antonio_Spinola_desc:0 "António de Spínola is a relative newcomer to the Iberian military command. Born in 1910, he became a cavalry officer in the Portuguese Army in 1928, a position which he would hold for more than twenty years. When Südwestafrika began massing troops on Portuguese West Africa's southern border, he volunteered to lead a cavalry battalion, and held the strategically important border town of Namacunde for several days. His bold defense gave Portuguese nationals precious time to evacuate the colony before its complete takeover by the SS.\n\nHis strategic victory at Namacunde greatly increased his recognition in military circles, positioning him to become a brigadier general in the newly formed Iberian Army. Shortly thereafter he was deployed to Equatorial Guinea for the Congo Expedition. Following the death of his commanding officer from malaria, Spínola became a Divisional General in charge of all Portuguese forces in Equatorial Africa, and under his command the army secured all Cameroonian lands south of the Sanaga River more than a week prior to the expected completion date.\n\nHaving achieved two great military accomplishments in the colonies, Spínola has only become more prominent and is now well acquainted with the Caudillos, as well as other top-ranking military members. An orthodox conservative, he is supportive of the Union and its present leadership, and is not especially drawn to partisan politics. Perhaps the one political issue he is truly passionate about is the reclamation of the stolen colonies of Portuguese West Africa and Moçambique. Though he recognizes that such a reconquest is likely impossible, should an opportunity emerge to fight in Africa once more there is little doubt Spínola will want to serve on the frontlines."

 IBR_Francisco_Costa_Gomes:0 "프란시스쿠 다 코스타 고므스"
 IBR_Francisco_Costa_Gomes_desc:0 "Francisco da Costa Gomes did not wish to join the army, but when his father died while he was eight years old, his mother lacked the means to care for him, so she sent him to the Lisbon Military Academy in the hopes that he may earn himself a better future. Francisco despised his time at the academy, but he soon graduated and spent his young adulthood in low-ranking officer positions. Assigned to the defense of Portuguese West Africa against Südwestafrikan aggression as Cavalry Captain, da Costa Gomes distinguished himself as his company prevented German efforts to cut the supply chain to Namacunde for two days.\n\nCosta Gomes had been promoted to Colonel when he was sent to Cameroon, finding that he had coincidentally been assigned to the same division as his former commander in Namacunde-António de Spínola. The two men developed a fondness for each other, and their successful drive to the Sanaga River saw da Costa Gomes promoted to Brigadier General.\n\nAs a bright commander and fast-learner, da Costa Gomes was invited into the Iberian General Staff on recommendation of Spínola in 1951. He has remained a prominent figure in both political and military matters ever since. Da Costa Gomes maintains a strong friendship with General Spinola and is noted for his unusual interest in and sympathy towards the United States of America and its culture."

 IBR_Luis_Carrero_Blanco_desc:0 "Luis Carrero Blanco lived an unassuming life before the Civil War, briefly serving as a naval lieutenant in the 1920s and teaching Submarine Tactics at the Naval Warfare College after that. After his father and brother were killed by communist militiamen in The Red Terror, Blanco escaped to Mexico, then returned to Spain to join the rebellion and avenge his family.\n\nAs one of the few experienced naval commanders in the rebel camp, Blanco quickly rose through the ranks, with Franco appointing him as Chief of the Navy General Staff in 1939 just after the war ended. He gained Franco's friendship and trust shortly thereafter, convincing him to maintain Spanish neutrality in the Second World War and urging closer relations between Franco's government and that of Salazar. As one of the architects of unification, he is highly respected by his fellow military and political men alike, both Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nBlanco has not seen naval combat since the Spanish Civil War, and with Américo Tomás becoming the dominant figure in the Iberian Navy, he is increasingly regarded as primarily a political figure rather than a military one. A man prone to conspiratorial thinking, Blanco sees Jewish and Masonic plots hiding behind every corner, and believes that separatists, anti-colonialists, and democratic reformists, seek to destroy Christian Civilization itself. At the same time, he is opposed to Autarky espoused by the Falange, and is supportive of technocrats' efforts to promote free trade and market competition."

 IBR_Americo_Tomas:0 "아메리쿠 토마스"
 IBR_Americo_Tomas_desc:0 "If there was ever a man that symbolized the Portuguese Old Guard, it is Américo Tomás. In the First World War, Tomás served on the deck of the Vasco da Gama, Portugal's only battleship, and by the end of the war had been promoted to lieutenant. Shortly after war he joined the crew of a research corvette which sought to measure the depth of the waters off the Portuguese coast, becoming the ship's captain in 1924. For the following twelve years he extensively surveyed the seas, for which he gained considerable recognition within the navy. He became acting head of the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute in 1931, a title he wore proudly for five years.\n\nIn recognition of his expert ability to organize sailors and crew members at sea, in addition to his advanced understanding of hydrology and shipping logistics, Salazar appointed Tomás as Navy Chief of Staff in 1936. His duties continuously expanded as he consistently outperformed other naval staff, eventually mastering ichthyology, naval aviation, and most importantly: naval warfare. It was only natural that he became Portuguese Navy Minister in 1944.\n\nIn the Südwestafrikan War, Tomás commanded Portugal's largest warship, the Afonso de Albuquerque, and was the admiral tasked with the evacuation of thousands of Portuguese settlers and administrators. His success turned him into a national hero in Portugal, and guaranteed his selection for Naval Minister in the newly formed Iberian Union. In this role he has worked extensively to modernize Iberia's navy, and in particular expand its merchant marine.\n\nThough widely admired by the public and understood by all to be one of the finest navy men of the modern age, Tomás is a socially awkward man and has rather little influence in political matters besides those directly concerning the Navy. He rarely feels obliged to debate in political matters, being largely supportive of both the Union and its Caudillos, but as a conservative old enough to remember the chaos of the First Portuguese Republic, he has grown increasingly concerned by the recent rise of liberal agitation."

 POLITICS_MANUEL_FRAGA_DESC:0 "To some, Manuel Fraga Iribarne is the champion of the new democratic Iberia, a firm and fair leader who can keep the country from falling apart in the aftermath of the transition to democracy. To others, Fraga is just another Falangist, a holdover from the old regime whose project is to retain the economic and political legacy of the dictatorship while giving the same old authoritarianism a new, modern sheen. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nA lawyer by trade, Fraga's involvement in politics goes back to the 1950's, when he held various minor posts in the regime of the Caudillos. His big break came when he was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism, where he earned a name for himself by revitalizing the Iberian tourism industry, leading a campaign under the slogan "Iberia is different!" In the 60's Fraga also earned an unsavory reputation for his role as a propagandist for the regime, publicly justifying the execution of political prisoners such as Julian Grimau. Despite his complicity in the worst abuses of the Caudillos, Fraga became a part of a reformist faction within the regime, seeking to move Iberia in the direction of democracy. When the rule of the Caudillos ended, he formed the Alianza Popular, an alliance of various smaller parties led by former reformist ministers in the old regime.\n\nElected to a majority in Iberia's first democratic elections, Fraga and the Alianza Popular now seek to strike a balance between reform and order, bringing Iberia into the 20th century and doing away with the old institutions while also keeping the country together against the forces of political extremism and separatism."

With President Valcárcel's failed attempt to destroy the Iberian Council and re-establish a dictatorial regime, Fraga was forced to band together with the other democratic parties in what is now known as the Democratic Salvation Coalition.

 POLITICS_ALBERTO_ULLASTRES_DESC:0 "Ullastres Calvo was born on the eve of only the first of the many unfathomable catastrophes that seized the reins of the 20th century. He dedicated his early years in Madrid to attaining a strong education, graduating first in Law and Commerce and later obtaining his doctorate. Initially working as professor for Political Economy he soon found his way into serving for the newly established Iberian administration. His economic knowledge was greatly needed as the Union took a harsh economic hit from the 1950s German Financial Crash and the animosity between the Einheitspakt and the Triumvirate.\n\nQuickly working his way up the civil service ladder he was soon screened for ministerial positions. Reservations about his revealed close connections to the highly religious order Opus Dei remained but Ullastres managed to finally serve as trade minister for the Union. The longer he served however the more disillusioned he became with the current direction of the Union, especially its economic policy. So when Iberia's democratisation succeeded he finally decided to act. Along with fellow business reform minded people within the administration and private organizations, amongst them notably Opus Dei, he formed the Partido Renovador Democrático. The party advocated for cutting more government restrictions in the economy and generally scaling back the size of the state. These they argued would bring greater prosperity to the people of Iberia and ensure the capacity of the Union to withstand modern challenges. With lofty promises and great propaganda Ullastres and the party were able to seize the reins of control. They could now begin to shape the future."

Proceeding to make use of his education he started work as a law professor at the University of Oviedo. His connections to the Francoist regime would however not be limited to the civil conflict. Apparently picked by Franco himself, Fernández-Miranda was chosen to serve in the education department of the new Iberian state. He was reported to be an effective civil servant yet questioned on his political beliefs at times.\n\nOnly when he was able to rise higher in the state apparatus did he choose to disclose some of his leanings. Believing that the Union desperately required a democratic transition to continue thriving and not falling to the traps of ethnic tensions and representation. He soon became a solid part of the reformist faction of the government. Watching as inactivity and caution however reined in men like Fraga and other conservatives he realized the path for the Union required a different path. Creating a new faction around him he was able to garner the support of those with more radical views on democratization and social issues. He now steers towards providing a better and more fair future for the Iberian peninsula."

 POLITICS_ALEJANDRO_VALCARCEL_DESC:0 "Alejandro Rodriguez de Valcárcel is a man from another era.\n\nBorn in 1917 in the closing hours of World War I, the man had little of note occur to him until the Spanish Civil War. A dedicated Falangist, Valcárcel served in a Falangist militia during the civil war. A student of law, Valcárcel was unable to finish his studies until after the war had concluded.\n\nThe man led an uneventful life for much of the 50's and some of the 60's, serving as a medium-level provincial governor. He slowly worked up the ranks of Iberia, and by the middle of the 1960's he held high government offices in service to the state. He was noted by Franco for his apathy towards reforms, as he did not like them, but did little to stop them.\n\nOnce Iberia democratized, he saw that his livelihood was being put in dire risk, as with the rest of the politicians of his sort. He later took the role of their leader, rallying all the old guard politicians behind him to create the new Unión Nacional, a party made from the merger of the União Nacional and the Falange.\n\nValcárcel may have won the election, but he has not won the war. Now that he is in power, it falls to him to bring back the Iberia of old, where the Falange reigned supreme. Valcárcel is a man from another era, and if he has his way, then Iberia shall return to it."
 
 POLITICS_ALFONSO_ARMADA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Armada Comyn has found himself reliving his glory days.\n\nBorn in 1920 to a family with a history of fighting and warfare, he was quick to pick up the tradition for himself. Deeply religious, it is easy to say that the apple didn't fall far from the tree. At the young age of 16, he opted to carry on his family's legacy in the best way possible - saving Spain from Bolshevism. After fighting through all of Spain, he later joined the Blue Division and participated in the Fall of Leningrad, aiming to help save a second country from Bolshevism.\n\nBy the late 1940's, Alfonso had become a military instructor in several different academies. He was a natural choice for promotion, from a mixture of genuine talent and political compatibility.\n\nDemocracy treated the man very poorly. He hated every facet, every moment of the system, but for the sake of his job he bit his tongue. He learned greatly from his comrades, who lost their positions for their protests. When the new democracy began to tear down Franco's legacy, he reached his limit. He secretly organized a coup, so that he may save Iberia from Bolshevism once more.\n\nAlfonso Armada shall see himself Caudillo, and he will ensure that Iberia's new state does not repeat the mistakes that made the old Caudillos weak."
 
 POLITICS_ANTONIO_SPINOLA_DESC:0 "António de Spínola was born in 1910 in Estremoz, in what was formerly Portugal. He had a very uneventful childhood, and his path to leadership began in 1920, when he entered the Military School of Lisbon. He learned there for eight more years, and his education paid off when he was made commander of the National Republican Guard. Come 1940, he was sent to Germany to observe their troops operate during Barbarossa.\n\nAntónio was never one for political involvement, finding that politics got in the way of his duties as commander. Even so, he always leaned towards the conservative side of things - though how much this truly showed itself is debatable. This effort clearly worked, since Spinola kept being granted promotion after promotion. It was joked that he would be a Caudillo before 1970, with how fast he was promoted.\n\nWhen Franco died, the Council could not find anyone else to replace his spot as President, and it increasingly seemed like Iberia would have to make do with only Caetano. That is, before Spinola intervened. Through some "surprise politics", he was found Franco's successor.\n\nHe may not have been a Caudillo by 1970, but he still came exceptionally close. Now, with politics as the forefront of his duty, Spinola has set to ensuring that Iberia stays content within its status quo, by any means necessary."
 
 POLITICS_MANUEL_MELLADO_DESC:0 "Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado was born in 1912, in Madrid. Orphaned at a very young age, he relied on his uncle to provide him with what he needed in order to continue studies. He entered the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1929, which was then headed by Francisco Franco. Under Franco's tutelage, he also joined the Falange in 1935. During the civil war, he was quick to distinguish himself and rapidly rose through the ranks, assisting in the operations of the secret police. When World War II broke out, he joined the Blue Division as one of its high commanders, overseeing their operations from Berlin.\n\nAfter the war, Mellado continued to obtain promotions. He was seen by his peers as a righteous man, and despite his lack of political commitment, his strong moral compass often landed him as a reformist. He had no particular attachment to them, but their proposals often found a champion in him.\n\nWhen the Iberian Council lost its grip on the country, they began to take drastic measures to keep their grip. The Council's desperate flailing came to a head when Mellado was ordered to fire upon protestors. Enough was enough.\n\nNow, Mellado has been appointed the provisional President of Iberia. Now, he must create a democracy from a state that did its hardest to stop it. Manuel Mellado wants the best for the Iberian people, but can he achieve this before the infighting consumes Iberia?"
 
 POLITICS_IBERIAN_COUNCIL_PRE68:0 "Every country needs a leader, and Iberia is no exception. However, how do you determine the sole, singular leader of a state when it has two equal leaders? The influence of both Caudillos wane and wax as time progresses, and one takes a greater role in the Union depending on just how much influence they could muster.\n\nSometimes, neither Caudillo can take precedence over one another. When both Caudillos are equal, then neither can honestly be called the greatest leader of Iberia. Therefore, a third party must take their place - the Council."

No other program has ever had such a spotless record, full of bureaucrats who seem to truly care for their special blend of paperwork.\n\nEven though it processes everything such a program could desire - healthcare and pensions, among many more - it is flawed. The Seguridad Social program has fallen behind in recent years, due to its relative non-importance towards other factors. Some of the legislation dates back to the 1940's, with only minor corrections performed. We must update it for the 60's, so that it may fit the needs of a modern-day society. "

If a parent is an Iberian citizen, then the child will be an Iberian citizen. The location does not matter, nor the parent - only that one is really a citizen. A new question has come up recently as to a potential addendum to this rule:\n\nNatives from our African holdings do not count as citizens. Therefore, they have limited rights and are not eligible for many privileges that a regular citizen would have. A political movement around this has grown, as a few politicians argue that the natives should be granted citizenship. They find that, since they live in part of Iberia, they should be treated as Iberians, or at least given some form of limited citizenship. We must consider this question carefully."

The best way to discourage the idea is to enshrine the opposite in the constitution.\n\nWe must explicitly denounce class struggle for what it is - pointless division and conflict.

Regional courts can overrule one another, leading to entire cases and trials disrupted because of some petty grievance between judges. Even worse, the federal courts have been rendered toothless, meaning that they cannot stop or even rein in the madness.\n\nWhat kind of system is this? It was created by the Caudillos, sure, but there is no way this is what they intended. Justice and the rule of law are the most important things for a functioning state, and we have neither.

We have deemed the groups the "families" of the state, and there are many - the party itself, the army, church, and so on.\n\nEvery group has their own power and influence, and while they are all ultimately subservient to the Caudillos they can still cause incidents in the government. Even though they are non-official, it would do some good to interfere with them, ever-so-slightly.

A lack of adequately clear provisions, as well as some uncertain edge cases, have turned the administrative system into a hydra that is more inclined to smack its heads together; a distinct lack of the harmony required to run a Union like ours.

For everyone's sakes, we cannot be either.\n\nWe are, however, the latter. When the Union was first created - the root of all evil, it seems - the compromises made led to what we have now, a bloated monstrosity that chokes the life out of everything it touches.

The amalgamation has been slain. In its place, a true government rises.\n\nThe compromises that created the old state are no longer.

As a result of Portugal's more restrictive form of governing, the INI has never allowed for the expansion of some industries within Portugal. As the Iberian Union grows closer and closer, however, it may be high time to remove this troublesome caveat and allow for the INI to support public businesses across Iberia.\n\nWhile this decision will inherently be unpopular with some within Portugal, they will soon come to know the benefits in keeping a leash on the people's ambitions."

With this grand responsibility, SENPA has also regulated the prices of these products, though this organization has fallen from grace since the Iberian Union has begun trading with other nations once again. This has made it harder and harder for SENPA to manage the prices of these products, as price and production have returned to obeying natural demand. The question, then, is how do we tackle the question of SENPA?\n\nOne potential solution would be to totally reorganize SENPA and to shed the notion of total control over the agrarian market of Iberia. The Iberian Union is changing. It's high time that SENPA change with it.

The closing segment depicted two men in white masks in front of an Ikurriña flag reading a statement: "The ruling classes refused to socialize their power and wealth and because of their avarice and short-sightedness, the ETA is beholden to socialize suffering".\n\nOn the next day vigils honoring the dead children were spontaneously made throughout our whole Union, even in the Basque neighborhoods, and many mourners chanting "¡Asesinos! ¡Asesinos!". A photograph taken by El Correo of a Guardia Civil hugging a wounded schoolgirl touched the world and was even nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nWith this operation we scored our first major propaganda coup against the terrorists.

The viejitos enjoy the warm weather, sitting placidly about park benches watching the birds sing, and no longer think about Barcelona. And above them all, perched on every lamppost, the roaming eyes of the AAS watch them, ready to call upon the gentle hand of the Guardia Civil at the first sign of trouble.\n\nThe events in Barcelona have put fear into the hearts of many Iberians.

 IBR_death_of_salazar_desc:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar, Caudillo of Iberia, ruler of Portugal, economist and military man, has died. His death signifies the ever-changing times Iberia finds itself in. It serves as a reminder of our own mortality that a figure such as Salazar must also answer to the call of death. He will be remembered as a brave man, who staved off the communist threat and who helped guide Iberia down some troubling times. He may never be forgotten.\n\nAfter his passing, we've got to make sure Salazar's death doesn't cause any undue instability. If his passing ends up causing harm here in the living, his memory will surely be sullied. There shall be a parade in his honor, and then finally we will ensure this all goes ahead as a smooth transition. The Caudillo must be given his due, and that begins with a worthy funeral."

 IBR_worthy_successor_desc:0 "It is only fair, right and proper that the highest being in Iberian political society be given the important responsibility of choosing a new successor. And how thankful are we that this being is none other than General Franco himself. The Portuguese people shall be ever so grateful that a man such as Franco is picking their new representative.\n\nThere may be a few concerns that Spain's own Caudillo Franco is to pick the successor rather than some shambled together committee of various bureaucrats from Portugal, but there shouldn't be any reason to fear. This is a union of equals and Franco knows this all too well. He has Portugal's best interest at heart, much more so than any pencil pusher. Rest assured, a worthy successor shall be chosen."

A career politician who has long since held various forms of power under Salazar, he is seen by Iberian political society as a mild reformer. This may raise a few eyebrows amongst some hardliners, after all a reformer's a reformer, but this has been offset by his service to Iberia. He appears to truly believe in Iberia and wishes for nothing more than its longevity and success. We will likely know what to expect of him in this respect and may be able to outflank him if need be. He seems to be a safe choice, first and foremost. Or at least that's how he appears for the moment. It will always be important for us to remain vigilant in today's times."

Unlike Caetano though he is much more ruthless in his endeavors. He would certainly be an effective force, but if we ever found ourselves needing to outflank him then we could face some difficulty. He may also have greater ambitions than that of Caetano, but reform is simply not in his playbook.

Great changes are beginning to occur here in Iberia, and these new times we find ourselves in do not need useless careerists such as these flunkeys. Franco has a grasp on a great political broom with which he is sweeping up any incompetence from the old stooges of Salazar. The next phase of the political process does not need these men nor does it particularly want them.

The public can expect to see all the regular displays of Iberian prowess, unveiled for the entire nation to bare witness to and hold dearly in their minds. It shan't be a day that is forgotten about for quite some time. An illustrious affair is deeply needed, even if it's just to hammer home the greatness of this landmark decision.

He could not afford to, once again, put the fate of his glorious homeland in the hands of another man. To put it in the grasps of an outsider, an opportunist and an obstacle would be an act of treason. It would doom the nation to another age of bureaucratic infighting, stagnation and instability. No, he will go it alone. Just as he had done once before, Franco shall take the reigns as the singular head of state. It is truly for the best, yet for the time being he must keep his cards close to his chest. God knows what the hidden fifth column would be up to if he disclosed everything to everyone all of a sudden. Franco would bide his time but let there be no doubt of his intentions.

They were once a disgruntled bunch but who could really blame them, as they were left to stew in irrelevancy with Salazar's cronies gaining prominence. Their disgruntlement made them desperate and dangerous which had led to some unfortunate incidents in the past. But this is now the present, and in this present Franco is ready to reassert himself and the Falange along with him. The frets, worries and anger of the old guard is to come to an end. In its place, will arise a rejuvenation of the fledgling movement. Franco will not forget what the old guard will do for him now in these key stages and he has no intention of letting them down."

Some in Portugal see how we do things in Spain with glowing enthusiasm. These officials look to Franco and his message wholeheartedly and are amongst the most loyal of the various officials in Iberia. They shall be rewarded for their loyalty with the empowerment of their offices. Promotions are in order and some reshuffles are certain.

They must be reminded of him standing up the German threat, against all odds of the all-powerful Nazi war machine. It is intrinsic that all learn what Franco has done for them and how he has impacted their everyday life.\n\nTo do so, we shall give the important job to our greatest propagandists capable of spreading this message far and wide. Every man, woman and child is to be bombarded with appraisals of the Generalissimo, if they are to truly place their trust in him. And trust in Franco is trust in the nation, so this thought process will be an important task to accomplish for everyone. We're sure the vast majority of Iberians aren't traitors, and thus they will humour us in agreeing that Franco is representative of the nation. They needn't worry though, it'll become all too clear for everyone soon enough."

 IBR_francos_speech_desc:0 "It's time to let the masses know what is truly occurring behind the scenes and what better way to do so than a glorious speech. Franco shall use his ever-broadening platform to disseminate his new plans for the Iberian political process. The reaction may at first be mixed and some may be confused, even angry, but we're sure tempers will reside once minds become clear. Franco is the best option for all of Iberia future and the masses will come to know of that son enough. We're sure a bit of persuasion from the charming Franco and our propaganda services will soon put the minds of the people at a calming ease. Anyway, it will soon become apparent to us all what the reactions will be as Franco's speech starts and officially makes history."

 IBR_caetano_first_day_desc:0 "Caetano will soon begin his first day as Portugal's new Caudillo. It will more than likely be mostly a formal affair, greeting his new staff and winning hearts and minds, but it will be something Caetano will need to get used to. We're sure he'll excel in the role, and will get a good feel for what needs to be done in his new office. It's his first day so it's likely we won't be seeing any dramatic moves but an eye is still best kept on the new Caudillo. Vigilance is key in these difficult times and we can't rest easy for no-one these days. It's for the best though, that Caetano feels warm and welcome in his job. We'll make sure he becomes a fine Caudillo for Iberia."
 
 IBR_making_new_appointments:0 "새로운 약속"
 IBR_making_new_appointments_desc:0 "Salazar's former yes men will likely be in for a surprise when they hear of Caetano's plans to rejuvenate his office with his own men. Caetano clearly has no need nor use for the bureaucratic vestiges of a dead man. Instead he looks to the future, his future more precisely with his own people. All will know that Caetano is not just some carbon copy replacement of Salazar. He is his own man, with his own ambitions. These ambitions will hopefully be delivered with this influx of new staff. Iberian political life will no doubt be impacted by these latest changes as the era of Salazar slowly fades from memory."
 
 IBR_tour_of_iberia:0 "이베리아 순방"
 IBR_tour_of_iberia_desc:0 "A Caudillo should know his people. A new one especially, will need to grasp the people's needs and demands as he rules over them with great oversight. In order to satisfy this particular need of his new office, Caetano shall go on a grand tour of Iberia to meet the masses face to face. Some in Iberian political society have turned their noses up at the idea, seeing it as stinking of Caetano's alleged reformist mindset, but many more see it as a welcoming take on the role of Caudillo. It will certainly cause a bit of a stir and shall show off the Caudillo role for the public to gawk at, face to face. Hopefully, some form of rejuvenation through being in the public light shall come from all this preparation."
 
 IBR_for_the_good_of_the_union:0 "연합을 위해"

He has, thus far, graced the office with this professionalism and has reinvigorated it with a welcoming freshness. Kicking out Salazar's cronies, and the various other stooges and lackeys that made up the crux of the office, and going on a grand tour of Iberia has certainly put Caetano in our good books. The Union looks to be strong, sturdy and stable with Franco and Caetano ruling over the nation as dual Caudillos. It is a welcoming sight to see the maintaining of the Unions stability with this choice of Caudillo now seemingly entrenched. For the greater good of Iberia, Caetano will hopefully prove himself to be a more than capable Caudillo."

Rumours of fighting, riots and looting have been thrown around but we can confirm very little for the moment. What we are not hearing though, is any sort of calm and lack of disturbance. This can only mean that some form of trouble is starting to arise at an ever-quickening pace. This trouble seems to be spiralling out of control at an uncontrollable rate, and we can only hope to get a grasp on the reality of the situation soon. For something will have to be done sharpish, before whatever situation is arising comes to a head and it becomes too late to do anything about it. If we don't keep a handle on this soon, the consequences could be truly devastating for the whole of Iberia. Containment, it seems, will soon become key. For if these incidents are not contained, they threaten to swallow Iberia in destruction and terror."

It's become apparent that containment is the message of the day and this will need to be implemented sharpish or we will face unforeseeable, but likely terrifying, consequences. Something must be done, that we can all agree on. The question though remains, how uncompromising shall our response be?\n\nOne side recommends we take a firm hand but not one that overdoes it. Control will be hopefully established, but our forces will not be allowed to run rampant in order to put down the insurrection by any means. In response, another side recommends going the whole 9 yards with our reaction and let the protestors know we mean business. No chances can be taken with this situation, we cannot afford to look weak in the face of a challenge such as this. Control of the situation must be established as soon as possible by any means before the protests gain enough momentum to become near unstoppable. It's a tough decision, and one that will definitely have consequences not just for Portugal but for all of Iberia."

They are partly responsible for the current crisis and thus, it is only right for us to hold them accountable. We will need to decide though, just how much we're going to hold them accountable for and how harsh we will be with our justice.\n\nOne option would be to send a message with our righteous justice that these actions will not be tolerated. It will certainly put off any other would be two-bit politician who thinks they can stand up to the Iberian Union's central government. Others though have expressed doubts as to whether this option will not have lasting ramifications that could create a deep-rooted atmosphere of future distrust and bitterness over our handling of these events. Instead, the situation could be resolved with a more forgiving hand in order to settle the situation. It may just calm the situation, but it could also be interpreted as a sign of clear weakness that the fifth column and other opportunists may pounce upon. Whatever decision is made, it will have to be done quickly in order to settle this ever-growing crisis."

We have certainly done our very best to quash this crisis and stop it from escalating out of control. What may be more troubling now though, is what the aftermath of all this shall be. The atmosphere, the very memory of what occurred here may have a lasting legacy we cannot hope to escape from. As people ponder what happened here and what could possibly occur again, it is our job to steer the nation through these tormenting times. If not, we will have to face something even bigger and much worse than the previous incident."

The decision to take in public input would be drastic and will no doubt showcase a commitment for democratic reform.

Of course, it is likely that they wish to shape the discourse to make sure the military's power remains absolute yet they also make up an integral part of our movement.

To make sure Caetano doesn't cause trouble he will have to be convinced of the purpose of these undertakings and if need be, be pressured on so that he does not threaten the Congressional process.

 IBR_the_Council_Unchained_desc:0 "It's time to truly showcase our commitment to the process directed by the Iberian Council, through loosening certain restrictions that were previously put on the Council. They will now have a freer rein to guide the extraordinary transition that is taking place in Iberia. This will also show the faith the Iberian leadership has in the Council and the good work it is doing. A mandate will be established by this decision, one of trust in the transitional process that is taking place. The Council now has our full confidence to do what is needed to achieve this transition."

Amongst the most serious of these antagonists would be the old guard of the military. The head honchos of the Iberian military are likely to put a spanner in the works if we are to go all the way with this process. In order to stop this, we shall shake up the military staff and rotate the generals to sap their power and influence. This should stop the old guard from acting up and allow us to continue with the process without a major hiccup."

The governors of Iberia rank amongst some of the most important key players in the political scene. We shall speak to them to address and put down any concerns they have about the process and thus help guarantee a much smoother democratic transition."

 IBR_tighten_the_window_desc:0 "There was once a time where Iberia, for better or worse, had to be ruled with an iron fist. History may not absolve those who once ruled over Iberia with a firm and authoritative hand but from now on things can change. The age of authoritarianism in Iberia is to come to an end. Rules, laws and accountability will put an end to full blown despotism in our nation. It is no longer acceptable nor wanted to lead with a selfish and cruel heavy hand. Something far more open and democratic will now hopefully take its place."

 IBR_a_true_new_state_desc:0 "Once it seemed like Iberia would be stuck in its own political mess forever. The competing antagonistic power game and bureaucratic inefficiency, all tied together by the tight grasp of authoritarianism, once meant that it seemed Iberia would be sent to the ash heap of history. Remarkably, this seems to be no longer the case. With the thankful success of the democratic process, a new state can now arise out of the old Iberia. A new, democratic Iberia will take its place, saving us from the trials and tribulations of what could have been a failed state. We are now ready to become a truly democratic state, averting what could have been a significant disaster."

To allow for a radical and sudden change at this moment could put the whole of Iberia at risk of destruction, chaos and instability. Who knows what could occur if we were to give a free reign to absolutely everyone all of a sudden? No, the best way through this crisis is a slow and steady pace while we place a watchful eye over the Congress. After all the future of all of Iberia is at stake is it not?"

There are evidently some Council members who heavily lean on the side of sudden democratic change or who are inebriated by pretensions of heavy autocracy. For the safety of the Iberian nation, we will diminish the roles of these councilmen. When you consider what is at stake here, it is after all for the best that this occurs."

 IBR_old_guard_hangs_on_desc:0 "There have been murmurings around the Congress that the old guard of Iberia should be tossed out and left to wither outside the political scene. How could we possibly let this occur? These men once put everything on the line to save Iberia from the fifth column threat. To completely ignore their voices now would be a stain on the new government. The old guard shall remain, no matter what the more idealistic members of the Congress may say."

If the future of Iberia is at risk due to the incompetence or intentions of the Council then it is only just that the Caudillos are able to save Iberia from this scenario.

Well fear not, for they shall do some "important" work elsewhere from the main currents of the Iberian political scene. Be it at the colonies or some far flung embassy abroad, these nuisances will be thankfully away from the new Iberian government. It will surely be for the better that this occurs and all of Iberia will eventually thank us."

Sudden drastic changes could take place without so much as a murmur with little jurisdiction. This would allow the Council to run rife and potentially destabilize an Iberia we have worked so hard for. In order to avoid this likely catastrophic sequence of events, the council shall be equally balanced between those belonging to the reformist and conservative factions. This should stop any surprises arising from the Council."

In order to avoid a succession crisis that may threaten to tear our country apart, we will have to change the way we get a new Caudillo. Instead of the Caudillos merely hand picking their successor, the Council shall elect a future Caudillo in order to maintain the stability of the country in an act of conciliation and agreement among the councilmen. This shall hopefully mean we can avoid a future disastrous leadership crisis."

 IBR_let_in_desc:0 "We have done it. The grand all-encompassing part of the process is over and we have guaranteed our future. Some may cravenly mutter in darkened corners that our reforms were not enough, that they were merely acts of self-preservation, but what do they know?! They can't even begin to comprehend what was at stake here. If this process was not done in this way then murder, war and chaos could have swarmed our blessed Iberia. We have done what we must. We have saved Iberia from itself. In doing so, we have protected the lives of all of Iberia's citizens who couldn't possibly imagine how close they could have been to certain death."

We will make it seem as if we are going to liberalize our policies on political opinions, and use this to coax a bit of relieved honesty from them.

Usually, we don't offer very much - trinket reforms, a few hollow promises. Nobody falls for it anymore. To really get anywhere with them we'll need to really convince them that this is the time where it's different; where it's going to change. In order to do that, we'll need to put a bit more on the line than usual.\n\nThe best way to mislead the councilmen into thinking we're going to do something good for them is in the most part posturing.

It wouldn't do to have someone who didn't have Iberia first, after all.\n\nSimultaneously, the rest will be forced to remain in the chamber for far longer than necessary. It's not out of cruelty, but out of preemptiveness. Most do not take the job seriously, which does not lead to someone who will do a good job.

For the good of the councilmen, it will change.\n\nThese worms are going to sit themselves down, and they are going to think. They will be given a time limit, and they will give a solution once the time is up. While they whimper to themselves, we will think of the solution to our own problem.

There are a number of councilmen who were paragons of virtue, shining examples the others neglected to follow.

 IBR_cycle_the_regional_governments_desc:0 "It is, simply put, a horrible idea to let someone govern his own countrymen. A petty nationalism still exists in place of an Iberian spirit, so until it subsides no governor shall rule over his own origin. If we let them rule over their own people, then they will place them above the Union.

Let it never be said that we are not generous - each councilman and his family will be carefully and expertly cared for in a luxurious suite complex that will cater to their every need. Of course, this all depends on them staying loyal to Iberia. To make sure they do, or at the very least as leverage for if they don't, the new residential area will allow us to keep a close watch on their loved ones. For safety's sake, of course."

Who knows what damage they could inflict in such a position?

The more meticulous the better, so we will leave nothing in their pasts unchecked."

 IBR_Lets_Keep_Order_desc:0 "We value the stability of Iberia above all else. Usually the Council is a positive force for this stability - they provide insights and perspectives on issues that would otherwise go ignored. This advice can allow for laws to be better tuned, ensuring they're as efficient as possible. Sometimes, however, they have the opposite effect. Council members can at times take the impression that they are entitled to more. While dedicated, they simply do not need more to continue doing the job that they do. It's important that we make them aware of that fact."

Sadly, it seems we were mistaken when we estimated that our Council would be able to work fine as it is. The times are changing, and unless we change with it we will be left in the dust.

 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions:0 "Listen to The Council's Suggestions" 
 IBR_Listen_Their_Suggestions_desc:0 "The Council must have more weight behind what they propose. It would be impractical to even have them only to disregard everything they say seemingly for the sake of it. We ought to be more receptive to their ideas; not to say that we will agree with everything for the sake of it, but that we must recognize that, occasionally, they know what they are talking about. After all, if they are on the Council then by virtue of that alone they must have some experience to back their words."

 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government:0 "Listen To the Regional Governments" 
 IBR_Listen_Regional_Government_desc:0 "It would be wrong to leave out the regional governments of Iberia.

We could use the input of each regional government to help fine-tune coming reforms."

 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences:0 "Respect Our Differences" 
 IBR_Respect_Our_Differences_desc:0 "Every nationality in Iberia has a few 'quirks' to them. These 'quirks' can make administering them all quite difficult at times, since it can cause quite a bit of a headache trying to keep them all in line. Rather, we could devise a new system to allow the loyalty of these minorities. While autonomy is out of the question, we could still strike a mutually beneficial agreement. In exchange for loyalty and unconditional support for the Union, we could most likely look the other way in regard to some of their less harmful 'quirks'."

 IBR_Revamp_Council:0 "Revamp the Council"
 IBR_Revamp_Council_desc:0 "Now that we've laid the framework, we must now begin setting it all down in stone.

There are many dissidents in the Union still, but they will find that the people tolerate their nonsense much less. The new place of the Council seems to have soothed the worry of many, and with the promise of a bit of tolerance, many others have found newfound loyalty to the Union. We have saved Iberia from those that want to tear it apart, and all it took was modifying the role of the Council."

Loud cries are, however, heard across the country urging the Council and the Caudillos to "ensure everyone's right to participate", with a minority of council members speaking up on their behalf.

While the chaos of the past years failed at putting an end to our Union, I say this with certainty: Iberia was on its last legs. Indeed, it would not have survived this far, if not for the invaluable help provided to me by the Council along with the competent leadership of Portugal's Caudillos. Having seen the work of the Council towards the survival of our Union, I am now confident in the value of reform. The system of government, as it stands, cannot last much longer. Despite how it pains me to say these words, I realized that stepping down is the only way forward. I have too many memories, and too much hope in the people of Iberia to let you down. I believe you have it in yourselves to lead the Union into a brighter future. Thank you for having put your trust in me."\n\n-Francisco Franco"

In conjunction with fellow Mediterranean nations who also had felt betrayed and under assault by the northern menace we had formed the Triumvirate alliance. This formally severed many ties between the National Socialist threat and the southern states. As a part of this we instituted a blanket embargo on trade between Iberia and the German sphere.\n\nWith Germany's economic downturn and the collapse of the Triumvirate realities have however changed. We must take a note out of Bismarck's playbook focusing on pragmatic Realpolitik. The embargo had been a necessary measure to show solidarity with the fellow Triumvirate members but in reality, it had often been broken if only secretly.

 IBR_stabilizing_the_country:0 "국가 안정화"
 IBR_stabilizing_the_country_desc:0 "So much for the "police state" - unrest has gripped the country in the form of both terrorism and a general civil unrest for years on end. Now that democracy has been restored, the old guard are up in arms too, attempting to strangle freedom in its crib and restore the autocracy. At least the other major parties and their supporters have accepted the election results peacefully. Our first priorities must be to deploy the police (in a responsible manner), make clear our aims to the restless working class and make sure that the military doesn't get any funny ideas."

 IBR_the_matter_of_autonomous_communities:0 "The Matter of Autonomous Communities"
 IBR_the_matter_of_autonomous_communities_desc:0 "The Autonomous Communities - the administrative divisions of Iberia - haven't had anything resembling autonomy since the civil war. Franco and Salazar's obsession with centralisation led to any degree of self-governance they once enjoyed being stripped away in the name of "streamlining" the administration. The result, rather than a more efficient government, was a bloated and overworked bureaucracy that served as a breeding ground for corruption. Reversing the centralisation of our state is not only the right thing to do morally; it is also much more practical and will ease the burden on our administration."

 IBR_meet_with_the_regional_leaders:0 "Meet With The Regional Leaders"
 IBR_meet_with_the_regional_leaders_desc:0 "Though popular unrest is the most visible kind in our nation, it rarely erupts spontaneously. There are a number of regional leaders who are usually responsible for the various protests, strikes and riots that crop up from time to time. Though they have always possessed a fair degree of plausible deniability, their names and involvement is an open secret these days. Given the current unrest, they clearly remain unconvinced by our campaign promises. The best course of action would be to meet each of them privately, so that we may clearly elucidate our plans and get them on-side."

 IBR_legalize_their_languages:0 "Legalize Their Languages"
 IBR_legalize_their_languages_desc:0 "The banning of the Basque and Catalan languages was more than just an act of petty collective punishment on Franco's part. He sought to totally erase their distinct cultures after they dared to defy the Nationalists. Restoring the right of these people to speak their own language is no act of revolution, but merely a return to that most time-honored of Iberia's traditions: diversity. This injustice must be dealt with, now."

 IBR_new_statues_of_autonomy:0 "New Statues Of Autonomy"
 IBR_new_statues_of_autonomy_desc:0 "The old statutes of autonomy were shockingly easy for Franco to rescind. There was virtually no resistance from the government remnants of the time, likely out of spite for the perceived "failure" of the Basques and Catalans to halt the Nationalists. Though we cannot say for certain that there will never be division within Iberia again, we can take steps to soothe wounds both old and new. Not only will the statutes of autonomy be re-established, we will also enshrine them in the constitution. Henceforth, regional autonomy will no longer be a matter up for debate."

 IBR_the_agrarian_unrest:0 "The Agrarian Unrest"
 IBR_the_agrarian_unrest_desc:0 "The peasantry and landowners were two of the few demographics not severely impacted by autarky, as the vast majority of their crop yields were purchased by the state itself or by food companies operating under state supervision, rather than being exported. The end of autarky has many of them worried about foreign competition, and some peasant communities have already downed tools in protest of our promises to make the agricultural sector more competitive. Unlike our compatriots in the PRD, however, we will be careful not to let the free market get out of hand. Reassurances must be doled out to inform the agrarian populace of our good intentions before we find ourselves facing widespread protest action and subsequent food shortages."

 IBR_meet_with_the_axencia:0 "Meet With The Axencia"
 IBR_meet_with_the_axencia_desc:0 "The Axencia are quite rightly a force to be wary of. Their long record of successful prosecutions and tireless zeal in pursuing anyone deemed a threat to national security is both commendable and rather concerning. However, they are clearly professionals at heart, and rather less politicised than we initially feared. We think that's the case, anyway - they haven't arrested us for winning the election yet, at any rate. There may be some mutual misunderstandings that remain, so our new cabinet should meet with their leadership as soon as possible to smooth things over."

 IBR_find_what_were_looking_for:0 "Find What We're Looking For"
 IBR_find_what_were_looking_for_desc:0 "When we set out to fulfil our promises of restoring regional autonomy, our critics demanded to know exactly what we hoped to accomplish by turning back the clock on centralisation. Many pointed out that regional unrest, most prominently in Catalonia, was a leading cause of the coup that triggered the civil war. We must admit that they were not entirely without fault - the party was, indeed, divided over what fulfilling our promises meant. Now, however, we believe we have found the answer that was demanded: a new vision of autonomy, where the constituent nations of Iberia act as faithful confederates with the assurance that their ancient rights will not be trampled upon by government overreach and paranoia."

 IBR_in_defense_of_democracy:0 "In Defense Of Democracy"
 IBR_in_defense_of_democracy_desc:0 "Iberian democracy is young and fragile. While the police and Axencia have so far proven themselves trustworthy, we cannot rely solely on them to protect the systems of government. Teething problems are to be expected, and rumours of election fraud have already reached us. Weeds in the garden are best ripped up before they can entwine their roots with their neighbours - the same approach must be applied to any miscreants and aspiring tyrants in our new administration."
 
 IBR_investigate_election_fraud:0 "Investigate Election Fraud"
 IBR_investigate_election_fraud_desc:0 "Though it clearly failed to influence the election, there was undoubtedly a good deal of election fraud in vulnerable areas. In Catalonia, it was even reported that club-wielding Falangists attempted to scare away Catalan voters! Had it not been for the Guardia Civil, who knows how widespread such incidents might have been? Similarly, more than a few radical leftists were caught red-handed, their pockets stuffed with forged and filled out ballot papers! An internal investigation, headed by a reliable prosecutor and operating with the assistance of Axencia and the police, must be carried out post-haste."

 IBR_get_the_municipalities_on_board:0 "Get The Municipalities On Board"
 IBR_get_the_municipalities_on_board_desc:0 "The municipal governments grew accustomed to taking things easy under the Caudillos. With so much authority centered in Madrid, there was little for them to do beyond run-of-the-mill paperwork. This laxity is no fault of theirs, but the era of smooth sailing is over. Their inexperience with democracy proved problematic when they were assigned the responsibility of managing polling stations. Councils and mayors must be roused to action and cooperate with our investigation, or else be replaced."

 IBR_investigate_the_causes:0 "Investigate The Causes"
 IBR_investigate_the_causes_desc:0 "The causes? Those are obvious enough to everyone. There are many anti-democratic groups in Iberia, both left- and right-wing, who loathe what we stand for and wish to see Iberian freedom destroyed. It would be folly to simply send out the police en masse to arrest everyone we think is responsible, however. Proper, thorough inquiries into each and every suspected group, individual and ideology must be carried out. Due process must win out over political convenience."

 IBR_protect_the_congress:0 "Protect The Congress"
 IBR_protect_the_congress_desc:0 "Securing safe and free elections is the most important item on the agenda right now, but we must also look to protecting Congress itself against direct action. Iberia has a long history of political violence. Prior to and during the civil war, leftists, fascists and the military killed one another with impunity, whittling away at the foundations of the Second Republic with every death. Nobody who votes should have to worry about going back to the polls a month later because a bloodthirsty ideologue mowed down their representative in a hail of gunfire. The Caudillos made the houses of government well-suited as fortresses - let's double down, and extend the role of the Guardia Civil to protecting the physical manifestation of government."

 IBR_extend_the_vote:0 "Extend The Vote"
 IBR_extend_the_vote_desc:0 "The surest way of making election fraud more difficult, short of arresting the perpetrators, is to drown out fraudulent votes. The first election had a good turnout, but the franchise was not as broad as it should have been. The voting age of 21 is far too high, and the fact that women had to qualify at all when most other major democracies have had universal suffrage for half a century is absurd. Additionally, there are many citizens convicted of petty offences who have been forbidden to vote for life. With our majority in Congress, drafting and signing into law the legislation required to address these injustices should be no problem at all."

 IBR_faith_in_the_people:0 "Faith In The People"
 IBR_faith_in_the_people_desc:0 "What greater expression of faith in one's people is there than to place power in their hands? The Iberian people might have chosen poorly, but they knew better - as we believed they did. They made clear that they did not wish for petty division and civil strife, but rather longed for peace and justice. For years, the Caudillos insisted that democracy could not work in Iberia for so long as the threat of radicalism persisted, but the people proved them wrong. The radicalism that was so feared amounted to little more than a few misguided souls screaming into the wind of change. The Iberians were tested, and were not found wanting. Democracy shall continue, and its principles shall never die so long as a free Iberia endures."

 IBR_ending_the_franquista:0 "Ending The Regime's Laws"
 IBR_ending_the_franquista_desc:0 "Dismantling the old regime's extensive system of harsh laws, surveillance and brutal repression is not going to be an easy task. We can expect resistance from the old guard, Falangists and possibly even the conservatives of Alianza Popular. But it must be done. There have been too many families torn apart by baseless convictions; too many denied basic freedoms because they spoke out of turn; too many miniature Caudillos who grew drunk on the power they held over the people. Justice is due."

 IBR_legalize_the_opposition:0 "Legalize The Opposition"
 IBR_legalize_the_opposition_desc:0 "The idea unnerves even us a little, but the parties outlawed by the Caudillos must be allowed to operate in the political arena again. This includes the social democrats, socialists, communists and even the anarchists (though they're not likely to care either way). There will be outrage and frothing at the mouth from the right, but we must stand up for our democratic principles. Anyone willing to participate in a democratic system and who swears not to subvert it will be welcome, so long as their party is not found guilty of any wrongdoing."

 IBR_audit_the_prisons:0 "Audit The Prisons"
 IBR_audit_the_prisons_desc:0 "The prisons have been full to bursting since the civil war. Countless political prisoners and citizens jailed for minor offences have simply been thrown in with the genuine criminals and left to rot. This state of affairs is unacceptable, especially given the horrifically high rates of assault, murder and suicide within prisons. Though the process will be long, painful and drawn-out, the only just solution is to go over conviction records, the judicial system and the prisons themselves with a fine-toothed comb. We must find the resolve to press forth until every wrong is righted."

 IBR_close_down_tarrafal:0 "Close Down Tarrafal"
 IBR_close_down_tarrafal_desc:0 "The Tarrafal is the most infamous and brutal prison in the entire peninsula. Essentially a fortress built around a concentration camp for political prisoners, none who enter will ever leave - save for the guards and prison staff. This symbol of Francoist tyranny must be shut down immediately. Every single staff member will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with accordingly should they turn out to have been complicit in any criminal offence themselves, including mistreatment of prisoners. The inmates of the prison will be distributed among several smaller, more modern and humane prisons until reviews of their trials and supposed crimes are completed. The Tarrafal will be mothballed until we figure out what to do with it - perhaps it would make a nice museum or luxury hotel with a bit of work?"

 IBR_we_can_be_better:0 "We Can Be Better"
 IBR_we_can_be_better_desc:0 "Merely undoing Francoism is not enough. We must replace it with something new and improved. Injustice must be replaced with its opposite number - just so for corruption, immorality and brutality.

Who knows how many burgeoning fascists these lies have created? This kind of despotic claptrap will no longer be permitted - from now on, our mandate on education will be that our recent history, from the early 20th century onwards, must be taught in the most objective manner possible. People must be permitted to form their own opinions instead of being indoctrinated for generations on end."

 IBR_investigate_military_corruption_desc:0 "Considering its size, the military hasn't been up to much since the civil war. We know that their equipment and training could be better, yet no apparent improvements are ever made. So where, pray tell, does all that funding go? Why are so many of the wealthy bourgeoisie of our nation commissioned officers rather than bankers, businessmen, entrepreneurs and lawyers? Why is the private still paid a pittance while every second lieutenant has a house, a mistress and an Italian sports car? We must brave the lions' den and set about the military apparatus with the same rigour and decisiveness that we have applied to the bureaucracy and judicial system, lest this blatant corruption continue even in the face of renewed German aggression!"

Through all the years of dictatorship, there were those who held on to the dream of a better Iberia. Even within Franco's inner circle there was always dissent, and now those dissenters turn to us for the realization of their dreams. It is not enough for there to be mutual trust between ourselves and the electorate - we must extend the hand of friendship to any who will take it in earnest. Iberia is not yet lost."

 IBR_the_beginning_of_our_ascent_desc:0 "Like a gentle spring rain from on high, peace and justice now hold Iberia in their warm, soothing embrace. Wrongs have been righted, justice dispensed and grievances addressed. Where once the streets were quiet and ordered, the jackboots of the over-militarised police clicking on the cobblestones, they are now filled with life. Businesses, homes and churches alike have become places of hope and happiness. Even the halls of government peal with laughter at times, as a sense of optimism unrivalled in our nation's history sets in. Above all else, there is the sense that no matter what comes, Iberia and its people will find a way to endure. No fascist, terrorist or mad dictator will halt our ascent to heights yet undreamt of! For a free Iberia, and a better tomorrow!"

Our government cannot stand for that so the next action that needs to be taken is an expansion of our current healthcare facilities. This expansion will cover both the quantity and quality of the current healthcare system and will involve some minor nationalisation and joint public/private construction.

Additionally, we will implement temporary wage controls in order to keep both prices and wages down.

However, since this will take some time we shall also subsidise the building of wind farms in the north of the peninsula.\n\nThese will be expensive but having control over our own energy will help to ensure that the next time there is a crisis in the Middle East, we're not up the creek without a paddle."

The cries of those backwards thinkers stuck in the 19th century grow ever quieter beneath the cheering of the masses at our success, and even men of the old regime offer their thanks and congratulations!

Divorce is an issue that continues to divide both Iberia and our party, with many considering the traditional family too important to social cohesion for us to dare infringe upon.

While the Catholic faith ensures that all men are treated as brothers in Christ, economic and personal freedom will ensure that said men are able to make the best possible use of their lives and careers, rather than labouring under the yoke of autarky.

It is our luck that the loyal institution of Opus Dei has provided a comprehensive plan in order to emerge from these dark times.\n\nThe organization has promised that with certain stimulus arrangements the market would be able to recover and begin resuming a normal trend. In general, however, the emergency program is designed to uphold the market liberal ideology while alleviating the shock of the crisis. After all, the market has always proven itself to be most efficient at designating resources. Opus Dei have promised that opening the possibilities of exploiting new energy sources to investors, and pushing for tax cuts across the board, will bring back the forces of supply in order to meet the outstanding demand.

We cannot have companies going bust and damaging the necessary market forces we need to stave off this crisis.\n\nTo remedy this issue it has been suggested that a new work culture should be introduced, one where we can insure that firms uphold required staff numbers without paying for it with unmet variable costs.

This should promote productivity in the long run too."

In line with arguments that have claimed that it only is a bottomless pit that continuously sucks money without giving back to the economy, we have decided it finally is time that we audit the whole operation. There certainly will be parts that are either not an absolute necessity or that are downright mismanaged.

Time and time again when central authority has intervened in order to bring about what it says as good change has it resulted in terrible outcomes.

In a similar vein to energy diversification we also must seek to expand our trading networks.

It is not for the government to sort out issues with how people interact with the market and more importantly how it functions, yet we should certainly facilitate an opportunity for the market to resuscitate itself.

Under the guise of returning financial stability to government expenditure it has been decided to allow private versions of public services to be authorised. With those who can afford private provisions switching we are still providing a safety net to the less advantaged strata of our society.

A number of them have insisted that Iberia pay back its debts with the most utmost urgency, in some cases even with reduced interest rates.

Clearly when relying on technocratic advice it sometimes is difficult to make the public understand our intentions. Necessary sacrifices may be seen as negligence or even worse intentional evil.

We have done all we can for now, our response was well orchestrated and allowed the passing of necessary legislation in combating the crisis.

 IBR_Cultural_Diversity_Protection_desc:0 "At the end of the day, we are a federation of constituent nations, not an all-encompassing juggernaut that tramples its own people. It has been this way even before the Iberian Wedding of Ferdinand and Isabella. Perhaps Franco was right to clamp down on the autonomy of the Basques and Catalans at the time of the civil war, but that time has passed. God did not make the Castilians, Leonese or Portuguese to rule alone; He made us as equals. With the political situation no longer necessitating Franco's stern measures, we can instead look to healing the divisions between the majority and minorities in our nation, and guarantee that our national brotherhood will endure any future tribulations."

 IBR_Rural_Roots_desc:0 "The economy isn't what it used to be, and the days of the peasantry as the majority of the population are long past, but does this mean we should simply embrace the materialistic urbanism of the Americans or the Reich? Of course not! The soul of Iberia is that of ruralism, even if economic realities mean that cities and industry are the way of the future in practical terms. In the rural life, we find reflected a simpler, happier time, when the peasant whiled away the days in his fields under the responsible stewardship of his lord and the local parish. This is what we honor: the peace and respectability of the life that was for the vast majority of our history."

 IBR_Iberia_Forever_desc:0 "Odd as it may seem, there is one new tradition that has come to us in these troubled times: Iberia itself. Initially created for solely pragmatic purposes, it has come to represent something else entirely: a great and diverse people - the IBERIAN people - who, having been divided by tribal boundaries, petty rulers, and mad ideologues for millennia, have finally come together as one family. From the plains of Andalusia to the mountains of Navarra and from the picturesque Lisbon seaside to the humming industrial towns of Catalonia, our strength and brotherhood flourishes like never before. The nations that fathered us will live on, but they are no longer all that we live for. Iberia now, Iberia forever."

Now, they say nothing - if they dare to do so, they are shouted down. Not by us, for we would never deign to engage in political brawling, but by the countless loyal supporters we find amongst the populace. What clearer mandate to govern could we possibly enjoy? Iberia, with the backing of the people and the Catholic Church, has begun its climb to heights unmatched since the days of the Armada and the empires! We have in short order accomplished within a democratic system what the Caudillos could not accomplish in nearly two decades of their joint dictatorship! A new era dawns for all of Iberia: one of peace, prosperity and, above all, stability. There can be no greater gift for our generation to leave the Iberians of the future. God bless Iberia!"

This was especially true of the radical left, which commonly organised itself along the lines of trade unions, workers' militias and village communes. It is only common sense to require any and all political groups to register as a formal political party, so that everyone can keep track of who exactly stands for what these days."

 IBR_Demilitarize_Police:0 "Demilitarize The Police"
 IBR_Demilitarize_Police_desc:0 "During the civil war, the Spanish metropolitan army proved itself either treasonous or comically inept, with only the Army of Africa being reliably capable and loyal fighters. As a consequence, Franco drastically expanded the numbers and roles of the police to maintain order amongst the ruins. Entire squads on patrol with military-grade equipment certainly put the fear of God into any recidivist reds, but they were also expensive and prone to overreacting to perceived threats. With any major unrest and secessionist movements now suppressed, such a bloated force is no longer necessary, and we can be confident that rolling back Franco and Salazar's reforms will not cause any undue problems for us in the long term."

We are loathe to continue Franco's policies, which actually seem to have encouraged a stiffening of resistance at times, but at the same time we cannot heark back to the Popular Front's policy of increased autonomy, for that would only end in disaster and the dissolution of Iberia. The matter must be put to the Cortes and the cabinet. Perhaps it may even be worth putting out feelers towards regional groups?"

 IBR_Token_Autonomy_desc:0 "Naturally, the matter of autonomy has already been decided. There will be no "states within states" in Iberia again. While we understand their desires, regionalists must learn to accept the reality of the Iberian Congress. If total legal equality is good enough for everyone else, it's good enough for them.

Operating at a level the police and even the military cannot, the Axencia is both sword and shield of the state - and, by extension, the people of Iberia. Since they have not apparently made any moves against the democratic process, we feel confident in our belief that they serve the state first and foremost, rather than those in power. In light of this and their years of loyal service to Iberia, it is only fitting that the organization be expanded and its funding increased, especially as the role of the police is reduced in our renewed state."

Falangist old guard, fascists and marxists alike can all be relied on to attempt to subvert our democracy whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself. Though we have already taken the initiative and enshrined the secret ballot, we must go further. Election monitors will help prevent electoral fraud, and a new cadre of bureaucrats will ensure the electoral rolls remain clean and well-organised.

Doubtless, they always had Iberia's best interests at heart, but everyone knows what they say about Hell and good intentions. Indebted though we may be to their vigilance, we must not indulge in any whitewashing of their deeds. Nobody needs to know the gory details, but publicly accepting the realities brought about by the harsh times the Caudillos reigned over is an important first step towards building trust between ourselves and the electorate - not least because there are many former regime staff within our party."

 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code:0 "Rewrite the Penal Code"
 IBR_Rewrite_Penal_Code_desc:0 "Under the Caudillos, there was an aggressive approach to law enforcement at times. While we recognize the necessity of strong-arm tactics by the Axencia, the court system itself should not have such a reputation for brutality and heavy-handedness amongst the common people. The working class, especially, remains wary of them despite our promises. It would be most prudent to rewrite our nation's penal code and ensure proper judicial oversight, especially given the strong sympathy for the Caudillos amongst judges and prosecutors."

 IBR_Franco_was_Franco_desc:0 "As we have repeatedly told our critics: Yes, we are aware of everything that Franco did before, during and after the civil war. Should we renounce him merely because his actions were often unpalatable to modern sensibilities? No! His gradual easing of harsh laws and the successful return of democracy proves more than anything that he was no fascist demagogue beholden to a Bohemian corporal, but a highly pragmatic man who would go to any lengths for the sake of his beloved nation and its people. He only cracked down on genuine threats to Spanish stability, and in the case of the reds it was certainly well-deserved! Did he accept the aid of Hitler and his motley of gangsters? Yes, but who then could have forseen Germany's total conquest of Europe or the construction of Atlantropa? None should be so hasty as to judge him with the benefit of hindsight. This will be our party line, and there shall be no apologies for it."

 IBR_Renew_Catholicism_desc:0 "Even under the Caudillos, regular church attendance was far below its height in our more prosperous days. The only spike in recent years was when the German civil war erupted and the people suddenly found something rather pressing to pray about. What kind of Catholic party would we be if we failed to take advantage of our newfound legislative power by reminding the people that Iberia is, above all else, a Catholic nation? Nobody is suggesting mandatory church attendance, not only because it goes against our principles but also because it is unlikely to truly motivate the faithful. Instead, we should focus on inviting the church to play a greater role in social, welfare and educational programs. Combined with a healthy dose of funding for new religious construction (especially in the chronically godless region of Catalonia) and some well-deserved tax exemptions, we can restore Catholicism's place of pride as one of the pillars of Iberian culture and society."

That said, they are far more influential in our nation's economy than we would like them to be. We shan't go so far as to criminally probe them - that would be totally unjustified and a waste of resources. However, it would be perfectly reasonable to declare that an audit of their finances and activities is due; a simple bureaucratic review to make sure that everything is in order. While this is obviously just a sensible thing to do from a government standpoint, doing it publicly may also ease the fear common among the fascists and the godless that we are unable to treat Catholic organizations objectively."

Despite the conservative nature of the church in Spain, there is strong support among Catholic women for the earlier iterations of feminism that brought about change in more liberal nations. Our party is split on the issue along reformist and traditionalist lines. One the one hand, the Church's teachings on the structure of the family are clear, and we would not wish to give offense or act in an un-Christian manner. On the other, can we really afford to retain the idea of women acting solely in traditional roles, with a modern industrial economy and a broad sense of internationalism on the rise?"

It was the Christian vote that carried us to our first electoral victory, and it shall be the Christian vote that buoys us in future elections. This is only possible because we alone recognize what other parties do not: that Iberia and its constituent nations are, now and forever, Christian nations, bearing the heritage of nearly two thousand years on their collective shoulders. To abandon our faith as the bedrock of society would be folly; to actively abolish it would be madness."

By chaining our government spending, we will be able to ensure that the crisis doesn't get any worse than it currently is.\n\nWhile this certainly won't endear the population to our government, we can only hope that we will be able to hold our position in power long enough to get through this crisis so that we will be able to lift the measures."

While the time of feudalism is long dead and gone, we will never allow its execution to die out. Again, there will never be nobles and barons in the Union, but the decentralization found in feudalism will be.

You are politically accountable for what you do and the legitimacy is still simply not worth heaving to wrangle opposition. We will forever be opposed by Leftists and Bolsheviks because they are capable of manipulating the system to stay in their power. What's worse, the obsession with individual over collective has ruined the moral standards of the Union until nothing will be left but anarchy and degeneracy.\n\nThe decrepit system is incompatible with our radical reforms. Democracy is nothing but a sham used by Leftists to seize power against the will of the people. The system needs to go, for the good of Iberia. Equally so, anyone who objects must be shut down and silenced. It will take a long time to fully dismantle these shams, but it will be time well spent. The only concern is that the people will, brainwashed as they are, reject these reforms out of stubbornness. They will all come around in time."

Faithful Catholics one and all, farmers and ranchers are the true examples of the proper organic components. Tireless work to improve the whole, and they know the importance of their place.

Only one step remains until we can take on the legacy of the Caudillos.\n\nWe will proclaim O Estado Novo - the new state.

The only way we can stop this disturbing trend is to give the Axencia the ability to work better with less, and even better with more.

If we allow an oil shortage to disrupt our pride, then we have truly failed as a country.\n\nWhile it is true that there is less oil to go around, with our austerity measures in place we will be able to make sure the military has the fuel it needs to operate - and some in reserve.

Many would claim that a ready access to large amounts of cooked food is starvation. It is not.\n\nThe truth is, this recent crisis must force Iberians to reconsider their dietary habits. Much food requires cooking, and cooking burns oil we cannot afford to waste. If citizens absolutely cannot do without cooked food, then very well, but they must take care to only cook the minimum."

The masons, a group to be added with the terrorists and the separatists, are to blame for this crisis. We were only hit as hard as we were because of them. They prepared for something like this, and made sure to twist the knife as hard as possible.\n\nThe masons are guilty of treason, nothing less. We need to expunge them from our government, and not stop until the last of their traitorous scum are wiped from the peninsula.

As it so happens, one of his teachings lines up with our goals closely enough to embrace it.\n\nJesus lived a simple life, disconnected from most comforts and happily making do with the minimum.

For his faith, he was rewarded with rain, solving his drought and banishing the false prophets. This passage applies to us, too. The false prophets, the terrorists and the separatists, they claim that they can save their people, but they are built on lies and falsehood. We shall remain faithful, and even though we are in a drought of fuel, it shall return to us as surely as the rains if we remain steadfast. Iberia will prevail!"

There is no greater glory for a wife than to give life to a new generation of good, strong Iberian boys and girls - the shapers of the future and the bearers of our dreams.

Even the Caudillos would admit that the men who keep Iberia safe and strong would be nothing without the fairer sex to bear their spirits aloft, endure the trials of childbirth and keep their homes from falling into chaos and disrepair.

One of these goals that they have in mind is a new kind of regional autonomy, wherein minorities would be guaranteed core rights such as the use of their languages and the freedom to celebrate their traditions.

Having an international patron is very important, and their aid will allow us to assert ourselves in ways we never could otherwise. This wasn't a particularly hard choice, either - the Americans are far better than a callous government two continents away or the same bastards that stole everything from the Iberians.\n\nOf course, the only way to show a country you want to make friends is to angle yourself correctly. The best way to get the attention of the United States is to give them some help in very important places. Since they seem to be occupied down in South Africa, perhaps the best chance to help out is wide open. Giving particular support to this plan is Salazar, who has been spearheading the effort to increase Iberia's relevance in Africa."

 IBR_Music_Concert:0 "음악 콘서트"
 IBR_Music_Concert_desc:0 "The National Women's Movement has never ceased to be a great boon to Iberia. They are of upstanding moral character, making very good care workers, and frequent volunteers. All we need to do is so much as ask and they will be willing to help, and more often than not have someone able to do what is needed.\n\nIt is said that a good song can lighten even the darkest heart, and there are many dark hearts in wartime. The American soldiers stationed in South Africa would most likely appreciate someone to sing for them, and for a sweet melody to raise their spirits. The Women's Movement has many talented singers in it, and they can be sent to Africa to play for the American troops. The concerts will be funded by us fully, and they are sure to appreciate what we can do for them."
 
 IBR_Navy_Exercises:0 "해군 훈련"
 IBR_Navy_Exercises_desc:0 "The American navy is very adept at what they do; It is only logical for a world power to have a great sailing force, able to dominate the waters. Since American relations seem to be improving, it may be possible that they would be willing to participate in a few mutually beneficial programs. All it will take to bring them around to it will be a small amount of persuasion, and then some competent scheduling.\n\nIt is no secret that the Iberian and American naval fleets have a world of difference between them, with different doctrines, tactics, and officers all creating a vast gap between the two. Opposites attract, and a contrast of naval styles could prove very helpful. To this end, arrangements will be made for a joint naval exercise, which will prove invaluable in providing intelligence to better improve our strategies."
 
 IBR_Lease_Sao_Tome:0 "상투메 섬 임대"
 IBR_Lease_Sao_Tome_desc:0 "São Tomé. One of the only Portuguese colonies to resist German incursion, and a stable and pleasant island. The island is a darling of Portugal, not for its beauty, but for its importance. It was first colonized to serve as a waypoint in the long and treacherous journey to India. Even though it has been centuries since then, and decades since the last time the island was necessary, it is not without use. The island is in a location of immense tactical value, able to serve as a dock for ships and a point through which to filter supplies. It is for these reasons that the Americans want to use it.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill, we can effectively rent out the island to them, and allow them to use it as they please - so long as it is given back to us in fair shape. It so happens, conveniently, that a fair sum of money can be made off the deal."

 IBR_Provide_the_Maps:0 "지도 제공"
 IBR_Provide_the_Maps_desc:0 "The Germans took the Portuguese colonies from their original owners. Ripping out the pride and soul of half of the Union, it was nothing short of an act of cruelty. Worst of all were the retornados, who were forced to flee their homelands to escape the tyranny that would affect them. The heart wrenching stories of those who have truly lost everything have made a very strong case to the government.\n\nTherefore, it is about time they got their revenge. If the Portuguese shall not have it, then the Germans assuredly won't either. Even though they seemingly took everything, there is something very important they failed to take. We still have the map of assets around Angola and it is unlikely that Germany has modified anything. It would be a shame if that map were to be given to the Americans, so that they could disable the infrastructure when they find necessary."
 
 IBR_Green_Berets_Bissau:0 "비사우의 그린베레"
 IBR_Green_Berets_Bissau_desc:0 "Africa is a vast place, with many different environments. What no-one will tell you is that these environments are less different than one would think, and there is a lot of crossover between them. For example, there are many skills you can learn in one place that you could make use of in another. It is only logical that the Americans would appreciate learning some skills for their time in South Africa.\n\nWe will open up Guinea Bissau to the United States military, and in particular invite their special forces to come train in the area. They could use the practice to fight better in the hostile environments of Africa, where Guinea could prove a valuable introduction to it."
 
 IBR_Cancioneiro_Niassa:0 "니아사의 노래"
 IBR_Cancioneiro_Niassa_desc:0 "The mission of the Portuguese in Angola, their divinely ordained duty, was to civilize the people there. Since the Portuguese were chased away by the Nazis, that job was left only half-finished. Yet still, the history of Portuguese colonialism in the region is something that can be used to our advantage. One of the first things the settlers did was teach the inhabitants Portuguese, in order to better communicate with the natives. Portuguese language is by no means universal, but a significant enough number of Africans in the former colonies know the language to make alternative operations practical.\n\nWe will deploy forces able to use the power of song and voice to strike fear into the Africans fighting under German command, turning their traditions and customs against them. These operations will harm their morale, allowing the Americans a better chance."
 
 IBR_Airborne_Nurses:0 "Airborne Nurses"
 IBR_Airborne_Nurses_desc:0 "Some of the Portuguese are without a doubt brave. That, or they are just thrill-seekers. Either way, their willingness can be put to good use in service of the Americans. Medics are not always on time, nor can they get to some places easily on land. What makes it worse is that they can't always get where they need to be by air, either - as they would have nowhere to land. The Portuguese airborne nurses have been created to solve that problem.\n\nThey will parachute out of helicopters and other aircraft at high altitudes, into hostile conditions, in order to save lives. Through thick and thin, no matter the risk. It is here that the bravest will shine, and those who are in it for a thrill will get exactly what they want. They will be like angels from heaven, come to bring salvation to those in need."
 
 IBR_Counter_Insurgency:0 "Counter Insurgency Units" #Jungle if you change it again I swear to God I will come to Brazil and break your kneecaps
 IBR_Counter_Insurgency_desc:0 "The African SS are native to the land. Despite their faults, they make valuable guerilla fighters. Since they have grown up, lived, and will likely die in the battlegrounds that make up the area near South Africa, they are intimately comfortable with the land. Because of their unique heritage, they are like ghosts. The Africans move from the land, strike, then hide with the native population before the Americans can so much as lift a finger. No longer!\n\nThe time has come to even the advantage. Some retornados were natural outdoorsmen, and have never truly forgotten their old home. For these qualities some have been approached by the CIA, who wish to recruit them for the war effort. If we allow them to, it could nullify the advantage the Africans have."
 
 IBR_New_Viritatos:0 "Os Viriatos"
 IBR_New_Viritatos_desc:0 "Iberia has sent quite a few Portuguese down to the south of Africa. No matter how many we send, it just doesn't seem to be enough. Clearly the mistake was prioritizing quality over quantity so highly, as we have sent barely anyone. Any advantage is quickly nullified by the total lack of people to capitalize on it. As it were, we will be sacrificing a bit of that fighting quality for numbers.\n\nTo this end we will reform the Viriatos volunteer divisions, originally deployed to Spain to assist Franco, many years ago. Many brave Portuguese men will be able to taste the honor of battle, made all the sweeter by revenge. They will not rest until Angola and Mozambique have been avenged!"

 #EVENTS
 IBR.1.t:0 "1962년 인프라 프로그램"
 IBR.1.d:0 "연말이 다가옴에 따라 드디어 새로운 인프라 확장 계획을 발표할 때가 되었습니다. 이것의 시작은 소규모의 개선 작업으로, 이를 통해 연합에서의 우리의 경제구조를 포괄적으로 개선시킬 수 있을 것입니다. 올해 계획의 하이라이트는 마드리드 외곽에 새로 건설될 준 주요 도로로, 카우디요 프랑코 또한 큰 관심을 보이고 있습니다. 듣기로는 그가 이미 수많은 작업현장을 시찰하였고 정기적으로 건설작업을 점검하고 있다고 합니다.\n\n하지만 낙관적인 연합 관리들은 위 계획에 들뜬 나머지 포르투갈 사회에 가득찬 불만을 알아채지 못한 것 같습니다. 포르투갈의 많은 지역의 도로는 보수가 절실한 상황이며, 수도에서 수백마일 떨어진 도로는 운이 좋을 경우 적은 양의 자금만 지원받을 것이며 최악의 경우 그냥 방치될 것으로 보입니다. 하지만 프로젝트 관련자들은 분리주의 테러리스트를 감시하기 위해 대규모 보안대가 배치되어 있기 때문에 프로젝트를 무사히 끝마칠 수 있을 것이라 확신하고 있습니다. 더욱 중요한 것은 이 프로젝트가 연합 전역의 인프라에 미칠 잠재적 영향을 이들이 인식하고 있다는 것입니다."
 IBR.1.a:0 "그렇게 되길 바라자..."

 IBR.2.t:0 "마드리드 외곽순환도로 제안"
 IBR.2.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the new flagship infrastructure plan has hit the same filter of survival that most policy proposals hit once both halves of the ever-bickering union has access to information regarding them. Angry invoices and incessant phone calls to the Ministry of the Interior in Madrid were all of the same nature, a rejection of the plan to start construction on the proposed highway outside of the Spanish capital because of another trivial matter. The matter of the tools being used not being exactly proportional in terms of national origin. This obstacle has the potential to freeze the Iberian domestic arm of the government if not truly addressed; thus, we have to options to consider for going forward."
 IBR.2.a:0 "포르투갈 건설장비를 더 많이 사용하자."
 IBR.2.b:0 "Bribe them with a matching road in Lisbon."

 IBR.3.t:0 "아스팔트 혼합물"
 IBR.3.d:0 " 새로운 인프라 프로젝트가 계획 단계부터 진통을 겪고 있는데, 이는 어느 꼼꼼한 포르투갈 공무원이 아스팔트 혼합물에 관한 스페인과 포르투갈의 관련 규정이 서로 다르다는 것을 눈치챔으로 인한 것 같습니다. 아무런 개입 없이 추가 작업을 계속할 경우 도로를 망가뜨릴 가능성이 있습니다. 프로젝트가 두 연합 구성원들간의 협력의 결과물이 될 것이라는 것을 고려할 때 우리는 한 치의 오차도 허용해선 안될 것입니다. 다시 말하지만 이는 단지 도로일 뿐이며, 이후에는 더 대규모의 프로젝트가 진행될 것이며 결국엔 이베리아의 안정화에 도움이 될 것입니다. 이 문제를 어떻게 처리해야 할까요?"
 IBR.3.a:0 "이곳은 스페인 땅이니 스페인 법을 따라야 한다."
 IBR.3.b:0 "도로 건설 자재에 관한 연방법을 따르자."
 IBR.3.c:0 "왜 규정이 필요하지? 우리가 가져온 자재를 사용하자."

 IBR.4.t:0 "The Question of Repairs"
 IBR.4.d:0 "With the asphalt mixture problem resolved and the investigation underway, we have been given the go-ahead to start our project. State sanctioned contractors are beginning to arrive in droves, already making great progress as they begin to tear out defunct infrastructure to implement the new great works. Both foreign and domestic journalists gasp in awe when they get their allotted time to visit the construction sites; a process requiring a great deal of effort and delay on our part as everything has to be prepared accordingly in advance.\n\nOn one such visit everything changed however, time coming to a freezing halt as a blood curdling scream tears down the perfect visage we created.\n\nAn explosion of asphalt ruptures the now trembling earth, exposing cracks within the hardly setting concrete. Swathes of road cratered in after tons of dynamite were preemptively detonated in the foundations of an interchange, reducing days of toil into rubble and ash. Large stockpiles of resources and machinery are lost in the horrific mess. Emergency services were deployed within minutes, tending to wounds and attempting to pull grasping, bloodied hands out of the charred piles of ruin. We have confirmed four deaths and over three hundred workers injured, adding costly medical bills to the already colossal repairs we need to immediately address.\n\nAfter the cry of "Bietan jarrai!" was reported during the chaos, we have strong evidence supporting the notion that Basque separatists belonging to socialist organizations are directly responsible for the attacks, based off reports of similar terrorist activities that have plagued other government sponsored public works. The SECED has begun an investigation to address our suspicions, but in the meantime, we need to figure out how to amend or adjust our budget to deal with this shortfall. How should we recover from this disaster?"
 IBR.4.a:0 "Ask for a grant of Spanish tax money."
 IBR.4.b:0 "Ask for a grant of Iberian tax money."
 IBR.4.c:0 "Cut corners - we can save material here and there."

 IBR.5.t:0 "조사"
 IBR.5.d:0 "After the bureaucratic nightmare that was finding the necessary funds for the desperately-needed repairs, it seems as if we may at last proceed. The many confused workmen were finally allowed back onsite, the immense amount of resources again made available, and the heavy machinery was driven out of storage.\n\nIf only it were so simple.\n\nIn the early hours of the first morning of official repairs, the construction site was suddenly swarmed with mysterious men in dark suits, who quickly cordoned off the area and hustled several of the foremen into black vans before ordering the workers to vacate the site immediately. When the regional governor's office received a phone call from one of the contractors explaining what had happened, he was furious. However, that tone was dampened by the arrival of several SECED agents bringing... less-than-ideal news.\n\nThey had already identified the people responsible for the bombings: a group of radicalized Basque students-turned-separatists with leftist leanings. Their ringleader was one Iñigo Nuñez, cousin of Alfredo Nuñez... one of the foremen for a contractor hired on the project. SECED has reasons to believe that Alfredo may have aided his cousin's terrorist cell in organizing the bombing, and that he was not the only one operating on the inside. They have obtained an official warrant to fully investigate and audit all the contractors we have hired, in order to vet them for any other associates of Alfredo who may share his separatist ideology. In the meantime, all road work must be halted for the duration of the investigation, effective immediately to make sure no further damage can be inflicted on the already controversy stricken project."
 IBR.5.a:0 "Are you really- are you KIDDING ME?!"

 IBR.6.t:0 "Lane Expansion?"
 IBR.6.d:0 "The project should've been simple. It should've just been a two lane road going from point A to point B. Yet sadly nothing can be that simple, these are turbulent times for Iberia, a political union where the building of a road is vastly outdone in effort just by the timescale of getting everything about said road approved with multiple administrations. Every little thing must bear with it fifty clauses and a hundred subsections, as though the mix of the pavement itself could potentially spark an inter-ethnic conflict were it not for corpulent bureaucracy that keeps us moving at a snail's pace.\n\nThe government in Madrid has now become involved in the construction of the road, and with it comes an entirely other magnitude of legislature and administration. The bombing of the road has forced us to create an extra-wide shoulder to be able to actually get equipment around the crater left by said attack. Madrid is now demanding that we turn this shoulder into an entirely new lane. They either have no idea what they're asking for, or, more likely, they don't care.\n\nThis is a case for the federal government. You would have to file a pile's worth of appeal paperwork asking for a permit to actually alter the road we're working on, and then of course there's a lengthy waiting period all just so a committee of pencil pushers and nepotists can take a quick glance at the paperwork and grant or deny your requests on what feels like a whim. Madrid's ignorance of the realities in the ground are mind-numbing. We can't just turn a larger than average shoulder into an entirely new lane! The shoulder would have to be expanded, the budget would have to be reconsidered, and we'd just fall once more into the seemingly endless abyss of bureaucracy we've been dealing with for the past months."
 IBR.6.a:0 "Accept the request, and appeal to the federal government."
 IBR.6.b:0 "Decline the request, to hell with the city government."

 IBR.7.t:0 "Construction Planning Finalized"
 IBR.7.d:0 "After a long period of bureaucratic delays and general pitfalls it seems that the construction of the outer Madrid road is finally proceeding smoothly. Senior contractors and civil servants have created multiple detailed models which all currently project it to all be finished in several months allowing us to finally move onto other, more grand parts of our infrastructure overhaul project."
 IBR.7.a:0 "Let's hope it's really several months."

 IBR.8.t:0 "Portugal Vetoes Construction Regulations"
 IBR.8.d:0 "The small motorcade of Portuguese officials meandering through Madrid's old roads carried with it another message bound to cause disarray. Their national government has very foolishly decided to veto our request to use Spanish law instead of Portuguese laws when determining the acceptable mixture of asphalt for the construction of the outer Madrid road.\n\nTheir decision is supposedly based on technical difficulties with the sand and gravel mixtures but any politically savvy individual could clearly see that it is rather another attempt to defy Iberian centralization with lesser Portuguese characteristics, even on a small matter such as this. They would have us work less efficiently and with a higher cost rather than swallow their pride and admit that other parts of the Union might just have better laws! To remedy the construction deadlock this will create we will have to find a way around this ruling. There is always a loose screw or a bad apple in the bunch, and if we can find them and "convince" them to look the other way, then we will still end up saving a very good amount of time, money, and effort. We will just have to make sure that these less savory actions are not discovered by anyone else."
 IBR.8.a:0 "Do it. Bribe the officials."

 IBR.9.t:0 "Permit Alteration Accepted"
 IBR.9.d:0 "The proposed alteration to our construction permit has been accepted by the federal government, and we are once again cleared to begin work. The new road will now have the desired amount of lanes wanted by the Madrid city administration. "
 IBR.9.a:0 "A miracle!"

 IBR.10.t:0 "Spain Denies Permit"
 IBR.10.d:0 "The Spanish national government has declined our request to alter the construction permit, stating that the city government has no right to make requests that would fundamentally change the new flagship union project. We will not be able to expand the lanes."
 IBR.10.a:0 "At least it saves money."

 IBR.11.t:0 "Portugal Denies Permit"
 IBR.11.d:0 "The Portuguese government has unfortunately decided to deny our request to alter the construction permit to fit more lanes onto the current flagship infrastructure project outside of Madrid. They claim that a municipal government such as ours has neither the ability nor the right to make these kinds of major changes to a project that so clearly falls under federal jurisdiction. This not only means that there will not be any lane expansions but it also sets a decidedly chilly mood for future negotiations on the project. Despite our proximity to the infrastructure and therefore the heightened fallout whether positive or negative for us, we can now only hope that they will be more reasonable in the future when it comes to the project, as it seems any further involvement on our part is being opposed at high government levels." 
 IBR.11.a:0 "At least it saves money."

 IBR.12.t:0 "Conflict of Interest Investigation"
 IBR.12.d:0 "Another hardship fell onto the contractors and bureaucrats involved with the 1962 infrastructure overhaul plan, which has already been the target of controversy. Senior officials in the domestic office of government, particularly those concerned with optics and propaganda, have begun to take a more intense interest in the proceedings of the road construction. Allegations of misused and downright embezzled funds, overworked laborers and withheld pay are being thundered down on the already shaking shoulders of the hard pressed overseers. The duality of work objectives and optics seems to have come to its natural conclusion, a direct conflict of interests. Whether this scandal will halt the project indefinitely is yet to be revealed by the machinations of the wise Iberian government." 
 IBR.12.a:0 "Since when did Iberia care about corruption?"

 IBR.13.t:0 "Violation of Material Regulations"
 IBR.13.d:0 "A surprise inspection has discovered that we have not been obeying established regulations regarding the asphalt mixture to be used on the road. The Iberian government has fined us for said mistake, stating that only the best and agreed upon quality was allowed to persist in any further construction work. Why government employed workers were being fined by the government for I competency outside their pay grade was still to be found out."
 IBR.13.a:0 "Corruption is to be expected."

 IBR.14.t:0 "Federal Tax Money Proposal"
 IBR.14.d:0 "Our request for more federal tax money to be used for repairing the road has been finally been accepted by officials both in Madrid and Lisbon. Our constructions can now hopefully continue and eventually finish without any further delay." 
 IBR.14.a:0 "Thank goodness."

 IBR.15.t:0 "스페인의 세금 제안"
 IBR.15.d:0 "세금을 도로 관리에 사용하도록 하는 우리의 제안을 스페인 지방정부가 받아들였습니다. 이는 마침내 이 저주받은 프로젝트가 끝나고 다시 일터로 돌아갈 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다."
 IBR.15.a:0 "훌륭하군."

 IBR.16.t:0 "이베리아가 자금 지원을 거부하다"
 IBR.16.d:0 "이베리아 연방 정부는 도로 건설에 대한 추가 자금 지원을 거부하면서, 충분한 자금이 이미 여기에 지원되었다고 덧붙였습니다. 비참한 폭탄 테러에 대한 그들의 폭넓은 지식에도 불구하고 그들은 이러한 결정을 내렸습니다. 우리는 자금 조달을 위해 다른 방법을 찾아야 합니다."

This will be the first stepping stone in providing Iberia with a logistical infrastructure system that will bring the half-peninsula the capabilities to flex its eager muscles on the international market.

 IBR.190.d:0 "The less experienced labourers at the road construction site this morning were surprised to see all machines that had used the concrete mixture were in a state beyond repair.

 IBR.27:0 "Trade Debate - Triumvirate Tariffs"
 IBR.27.t:0 "Trade Debate - Triumvirate Tariffs"
 IBR.27.d:0 "With the collapse of the Triumvirate, many of Iberia's former trade partners have suddenly declared themselves hostile to the nation. Today, in their meeting in Galicia, the two Caudillos discussed the possibility of levying tariffs on Italy and Turkey. While they generally agreed that tariffs were a decent idea, the discussion was quickly bogged down by furious argument over exactly what products had the highest priority to levy tariffs on. Spanish and Portuguese institutions both provided conflicting data, much of which was severely out of date. Once the dust settled, no comprehensive agreement had been reached."
 IBR.27.a:0 "Can't they agree on anything?"
 
 IBR.28:0 "Trade Debate - Tariff Sourcing"
 IBR.28.t:0 "Trade Debate - Tariff Sourcing"
 IBR.28.d:0 "With the utter indecision of the previous debate, the Caudillos have moved on to a new topic. Namely, precisely where the money from potential tariffs would go. Again, a consensus was not reached, with precise ratios not being worked out. The issue of the Union government not recieving any sort of reasonable amount of funding appears to be likely to persist indefinitely, as the Caudillos clash over what factors shall determine which administration will collect and distribute tariff money."
 IBR.28.a:0 "We needed that!"
 
 IBR.29:0 "Trade Debate - Port Ownership"
 IBR.29.t:0 "Trade Debate - Port Ownership"
 IBR.29.d:0 "After the disastrous attempt at negotiating tariffs, the Caudillos have taken another topic in to be tormented. The matter of the day is now port ownership, namely the question of which administration owns national ports. While Salazar insists that regional governments should be in control of the ports, Franco argues that all ports should be under the direct control of the Union itself. After nearly three hours of argument, the decision was unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion, and has thus been delayed until the next meeting. Until then, Iberia's ports shall be held in uncertain hands."
 IBR.29.a:0 "At least it wasn't something more important."
 
 IBR.30:0 "Trade Debate - Railway Gauge"
 IBR.30.t:0 "Trade Debate - Railway Gauge"f
 IBR.30.d:0 "The final topic in the Caudillo's hellish trade conference is the matter of railroad gauge. Certain obscure railroads in inner Spain are unable to support railroad cars wide enough to hold standardized shipping containers. Thus, Franco argues, federal funding must be granted to expand the railroad tracks to a regulation length. Salazar, however, does not agree, stating that shipping maritime containers through inland Spain is useless, when containers could simply be unloaded and processed on Portuguese soil. The esoteric argument managed to last longer than any other, and end in bitter indecision."
 IBR.30.a:0 "Was Iberia meant to be this dysfunctional?"
 
 IBR.31:0 "Taxation Debate - Foreign Taxation"
 IBR.31.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Foreign Taxation"
 IBR.31.d:0 "The conference on taxation has begun with the most crucial item on the list, namely, taxing foreign assets. Iberia, due to its weak federal tax code, has a reputation as a tax haven equitable to the worst of the West Indies. In this debate, several schools of thought have clashed, with some arguing to end Iberia's status as a de facto tax haven, while others believe that any taxation at all will lower investments and make the country worse off than it started. In the end, no side prevailed, as Caudillos Franco and Salazar were split on the issue of potential tax discrimination by country of origin."
 IBR.31.a:0 "That was important..."
 
 IBR.32:0 "Taxation Debate - Income Taxation"
 IBR.32.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Income Taxation"
 IBR.32.d:0 "Another dreaded topic of discussion was the potential of a federal income tax. While it has general support amongst the Opus Dei economists recently allowed into the government, the Caudillos are still bitterly split on the issue. Salazar, ever the corporatist, refuses to agree with any sort of concrete estimate on a tax amount or collection mechanism. Thus, once more, an idea sinks into the pits of Iberian government and is forever lost."
 IBR.32.a:0 "An absurd display."
 
 IBR.33:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Distribution"
 IBR.33.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Distribution"
 IBR.33.d:0 "The grand debate on taxation has finally come around to where, precisely, the money from a federal tax would go. There are numerous proposals, such as corporate subsidies, business stimulus, the Gibraltar Dam, and military expansion. However, neither party is willing to give up on their own interests. As the fifth day of debate concludes, the only concession made is a solitary funding break for increasing the budget of the Moroccan police force."
 IBR.33.a:0 "That was a necessary consensus!"
 
 IBR.34:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Collection Authority"
 IBR.34.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Collection Authority"
 IBR.34.d:0 "As with all things in Iberia, the worst has yet to come, for now is the time to debate the federal tax collection authority. For reasons related to regional autonomy, this issue has been heavily debated, and a conclusion was unable to be reached.\n\nA conclusion was still not reached. Equal expansion of Spanish and Portuguese tax collection agencies was shot down by Salazar, as the change would require cross-regional jurisdiction to be given to tax collectors purchasing regionally taxed goods in the other region. A strong federal tax authority was also shot down, as it was determined to not have enough force backing it up in the case of tax evasion. Due to this gridlock, the tiny tax collection agency of Iberia will remain dysfunctional..."
 IBR.34.a:0 "The absurd becomes the usual."
 
 IBR.35:0 "Military Debate - Military Training Funding"
 IBR.35.t:0 "Military Debate - Military Training Funding"
 IBR.35.d:0 "In general, while our militaries are fairly overfunded, our training sector is extremely weak. Routinely, there is not enough ammunition to properly be used in training camps, and shot-count limitations have to be imposed on trainees. This issue was brought up between the Caudillos, and miraculously passed - almost. An issue with funding for various training camps being biased towards Spanish locations lead to the infamous Portuguese veto being applied, and a furious bout of argument in the chamber. Franco accused Salazar of wanting the Germans to be able to take Iberia easily, and nearly had to be restrained physically."
 IBR.35.a:0 "As if there wasn't enough tension already."
 
 IBR.36:0 "Military Debate - Funding Allocation"
 IBR.36.t:0 "Military Debate - Funding Allocation"
 IBR.36.d:0 "The state of the Iberian Army is objectively awful. That, no party can deny. However, when the time comes to potentially resolve that, the consensus breaks down.\n\nToday, in A Coruña, the negotiations for increased funding to the Iberian Army broke down in spectacular fashion, as bickering military commanders from the Spanish and Portuguese Armies flooded the stage with papers stating that their funding was far more important. As the Caudillos accept these claims, it appears that the Iberian Army shall once more be sidelined."
 IBR.36.a:0 "Hopefully, the Germans won't invade any time soon."
 
 IBR.37:0 "Military Debate - Standard Equipment"
 IBR.37.t:0 "Military Debate - Standard Equipment"
 IBR.37.d:0 "With the state of the Iberian army out of the way, the time has come to review the army equipment. Since the end of the Second World War, Spain's main weapons providers were Germany and Italy, and with the formation of the Iberian Union, it's clear that Spain cannot keep relying on Germany despite the success of the Bär Program of 1943.\n\nHowever, Italy is not in the best position to continue supplying our under-equipped army, and many officers from both armies have stated their opinions on the subject, with two clear major groups coming out on top in the discussions. One of them advocates for the continuation of Italian weapon imports for as long as they can be relied on, and then switching to another major weapons producer if necessary, and another faction advocating for the expansion of the rather small Spanish Arms industry, mainly based around small-time workshops rather than fully blown companies for now. As the Caudillos analyze their options, it is clear that continuing imports it's the simplest and cheapest solution."
 IBR.37.a:0 "Let's hope the Italians still have their guns on the cheap."
 
 IBR.38:0 "Military Debate - Drill Sergeant Language"
 IBR.38.t:0 "Military Debate - Drill Sergeant Language"
 IBR.38.d:0 "With the many attempts of standarizing the army drills, a major issue has been brought up to the Caudillos: The many recruits don't speak the same language as their squadmates from different regions.\n\nThis has sparked a debate on whether or not the soldiers should be split into squads from the same region with separate drill instructors, with the support of Salazar, or trying to maintain and reinforce the current system which tries to force bilingualism through down to a squad level, which is advocated by Franco after his attempts of unifying the culturally diverse Spanish Army during the Spanish Civil War. As neither seems to budge on their position, it seems like the status quo will continue."
 IBR.38.a:0 "Well, at least the drill will be educative for those who only speak one language."
 
 IBR.39:0 "Minorities Debate - Anti-Separatist Agency"
 IBR.39.t:0 "Minorities Debate - Anti-Separatist Agency"
 IBR.39.d:0 "The Iberian Union currently enforces total equality between the two forming states, Spain and Portugal. This however, forgets one of the most basic issues that Spain has to deal with since its inception, and that's the split between the very different and even opposing cultural groups that form Spain as a country in the first place. Many of those groups, like the Basques or the Galicians saw the Portuguese as a separate entity for centuries, but now that they're all in the same union and the Portuguese are given special treatment while they are still treated as part of the heavily Castillean-dominated Spain where they feel their desires are not represented, rallies and riots against the government have become common throughout the years.\n\nThis is turning more and more into a large issue as many regions have seceded in the past, with an attempt of the Basque and Catalonia to break off in the 30s, and those attempts have both Caudillos worried that further separatism may break the Union apart. With their combined effort, they have devised a new institution for Spain, the 'Axencia Anti-Separatista' which will answer directly to them and will deal mostly with discrediting propaganda and direct supression of separatist movements."
 IBR.39.a:0 "Unbelievable that they agree for once."
 
 IBR.40:0 "Minorities Debate - African Languages"
 IBR.40.t:0 "Minorities Debate - African Languages"
 IBR.40.d:0 "With the growth of our African possessions after the Second World War, we are now faced with the rather difficult challenge of integrating the regions into our mighty country. One of the first and obvious issues is the status of the African languages in them. Iberia currently owns large regions with Tamazight, Shilha, Rifian and Seghrouchni Berber-Arab sub-languages, which are clearly incompatible with the latin Spanish and Portuguse languages.\n\nBoth Caudillos argue harshly on this, as both countries have had very different colonial policies in the past in regards to language. Salazar argues that the Union should enforce the language policy of the Portuguese Empire, forcing Portuguese through all stages of public life for the colonies, while Franco argues for the Spanish Colonial approach where natives can keep their languages but can only hold public posts and take part in their local government if they speak Spanish. Both Caudillos are pushing for their languages and in the end, the discussion turned so rabid that the final result was a simple, but at the same time, underwhelming compromise: Both languages will be taught in the region, and the administration will be handled in bilingually in order to encourage its their, but it will also try to push for both to be used in the private sphere."
 IBR.40.a:0 "Two administrative languages? Let's hope this doesn't bite us in the long run."
 
 IBR.41:0 "Minorities Debate - Iberian Minority Languages"
 IBR.41.t:0 "Minorities Debate - The Status of Iberian Minority Languages"
 IBR.41.d:0 "The Iberian minority languages are the strange result of artificial kingdoms and caliphates being slowly integrated into Castille-Aragón, causing the Iberian peninsula to be a complete linguistic mess where two provinces can hardly communicate with each other without the help of Castilian Spanish. However, many people in these regions cannot communicate in Portuguese as well as they can in Castilian Spanish, and it's slowly turning into a huge issue as both Spain and Portugal lean ever closer together.\n\nSalazar has demanded that Franco change the official languages in each region in order to accommodate the new status of Portugal, with Portuguese language being enforced in regions such as Catalonia and Euskadi just like Castilian Spanish. Franco has disagreed, arguing that such a move would only cause the regionalist movements to spark back to life, each of them trying to claim the same linguistic rights as Portugal.\n\nThe Debate has ultimately ended with a tie. With the mainland's linguistic status quo being preserved."
 IBR.41.a:0 "More gridlock from the Caudillos."

 
 IBR.42:0 "Minorities Debate - Status of Rio de Oro"
 IBR.42.t:0 "Minorities Debate - Status of Rio de Oro"
 IBR.42.d:0 "Rio de Oro has been a colony of Spain for quite some time now, and is currently the oldest owned foreign territory of our country. While the creation of the Union has set back the integration of the Rio de Oro into Spain proper, the lack of native opposition and the swift progress of infrastructure works in the region has made Franco confident that it can be easily incorporated into the Union as a proper state.\n\nThis however, did not sit well with Salazar. The area is mostly Spanish speaking, with the introduction of Portuguese being very recent and very limited. Salazar fears that Franco's plans to incorporate the colony directly to Spain proper and force once again Spanish hegemony over the rest of the region. Having all of his integration proposals blocked off by a relentless Salazar, Franco has decided to refrained from integrating Rio de Oro until the province is able to be integrated under joint administration between Portugal and Spain."
 IBR.42.a:0 "I guess that does it for now."

 
 IBR.43:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Funding Amount"
 IBR.43.t:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Funding Amount"
 IBR.43.d:0 "Spain has been left in charge of the Atlantropa project for some time now, and maintaing the dam itself as a whole has been severely damaging for our country. This has led to the final decision years ago that the Union would cover for the expenses of vital repairs, but would refuse to pay for normal maintenance, which would run at the hands of the Triumvirate.\n\nAs our policy remains the same, both Franco and Salazar have their concerns with different regions of the dam. The internal workings of its system are starting to rot, and the risk of them collapsing sooner or later seems to be ever growing if our government doesn't pay for its replacement. On the other hand, the conditions of the technicians that work on the dam to keep it working are also severely threatened. While our manpower is plentiful for the dam, our technical experts are hard to come by, and even more those brave enough that wish to work on Atlantropa. After some short discussions and some interjections with some high ranking members of the maintenance crew of the dams, both Caudillos have decided they will increase the spending in the working conditions for the Technical experts in order to provide them with a safer work enviroment, as to not risk running out of manpower in a moment of need."
 IBR.43.a:0 "Our Engineers deserve the best, although maybe we should fix the internal workings sooner or later."

 IBR.44:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Maintenance Project Labor"
 IBR.44.t:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Maintenance Project Labor"
 IBR.44.d:0 "A huge issue Atlantropa has brought up is the sheer demand of manpower required to keep it from falling apart. While the Union has kept the demand covered until now by hiring a lot of state workers, the dangerous working conditions, relatively low pay and even lower prospects of professional growth has forced us to severely rethink the way we handle our workforce on the dam.\n\nWhile Salazar has proposed to continue using cheap workforce, Franco has come up with a better solution: conscripting criminals for them to work on the dam in exchange for their liberation in ten years time. According to Franco, they'd be able to import prisoners other countries want to 'dispose of', and would be able to tackle the expenses of this new penitentiary system by providing for the basic livelihood of said criminals. While Salazar believes this will be detrimental in the long run as it allows dangerous criminals to be absolved from guilt, Franco has reassured him that hardly anyone will be able to survive those ten years of work, and that the expenses of maintance would be cut by 30% in doing so. With both Caudillos agreeing in the end, Franco's proposal will come into effect and the workforce in the dam shall be progressively replaced by criminal conscripts."
 IBR.44.a:0 "Better them than us."
 
 IBR.45:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Hydroelectric Installation"
 IBR.45.t:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Hydroelectric Installation"
 IBR.45.d:0 "One of the major flaws of Atlantropa is the massive expense it places on the state, with little to show for it in return. With the ever increasing expenditure in its maintenance, the Caudillos have been looking for a way to make the dam profitable for years.\n\nA new proposal has managed to reach the Caudillos recently, consisting of a scheme devised by architect and engineer Pedro Martínez Ayola to reform a series of sectors in the dam to produce hydroelectric power. However, the cost of his project is huge, and just the maintenance of the dam is a risky and slow endeavor. However, both Caudillos have agreed that the expansion will be necessary in the long run, so both are willing to start preparations for those modifications to begin. However, it should be noted that said modifications affect core sections of the dam, and the high risk of reforming these areas may lead to a higher casualty rate than usual in the maintenance crew."
 IBR.45.a:0 "Nevertheless, if it makes the dam pay for itself, it's worth it."
 
 IBR.46:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Flags on Dam"
 IBR.46.t:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Flags on Dam"
 IBR.46.d:0 "In yet another episode of the Caudillos feud, an argument has erupted over the placement of the Iberian flags on the Gibraltar Dam. Salazar argues the Iberian Flag should take precedence over the banner of the Reich, and that the bottom of the Iberian flag should begin at the top of the Reich's flag. Franco urges that the Iberian flag should be much higher and at least two or three meters above.\n\nThe pair ended up arguing for several minutes over the issue, and it ended in an archetypal lack of consensus."
 IBR.46.a:0 "This is worse than the Rojos."
 
 IBR.47:0 "Siesta Debate - Impact on the Economy"
 IBR.47.t:0 "Siesta Debate - Impact on the Economy"
 IBR.47.d:0 "In a passionate feud over a time honored Spanish tradition, Franco and Salazar have erupted into a debate over the impact that the famed siestas have on Iberia's consistently poorly performing economy. Salazar argues that the net hours lost is time that, if used, could significantly boost Iberia's productivity, and that they are a major detriment.\n\nFranco responded with expected anger, refusing to concede and insisting the effects are negligible compared to the cultural importance. The feud ended in a typical stalemate."
 IBR.47.a:0 "How is this relevant?"
 
 IBR.48:0 "Siesta Debate - Portuguese Siestas"
 IBR.48.t:0 "Siesta Debate - Portuguese Siestas"
 IBR.48.d:0 "The two highest echelons of Iberias hardly functional government became embroiled in yet another endless argument as Franco and Salazar sparred over expanding official support for workplace Siestas into the Portuguese regions of Iberia. Salazar insisted that there was no need for such an unproductive and senseless cultural tradition to be brought into Portugal, but Franco argued it would be a positive change in policy for the nation. Salazar was baffled and categorically refused to concede as the argument ended as the Caudillos feuds normally do: indecisively."
 IBR.48.a:0 "So many better things to discuss..."
 
 IBR.49:0 "Siesta Debate - Regulation Time"
 IBR.49.t:0 "Siesta Debate - Regulation Time"
 IBR.49.d:0 "The Caudillos of Iberia have erupted into a furious argument once again, this time dealing with the time zone difference between Spain and Portugal, and the establishment of a maximum siesta time. Salazar insisted that the siestas, primarily in Spain, needed a maximum cap to try and limit the economic effects of siestas. Franco countered this by retorting that economic growth could also be streamlined if Iberia were to adopt a uniform time zone, rather than keeping the current two. The argument went nowhere, as the two men simply continuously repeated their arguments and were unable to come to any kind of settlement."
 IBR.49.a:0 "It shouldn't be that difficult!"
 
 IBR.50:0 "Siesta Debate - Talks Break Down!"
 IBR.50.t:0 "Siesta Debate - Talks Break Down!"
 IBR.50.d:0 "In a uptick from the normal endless debates between Iberias Caudillos, Salazar took the step of suggesting banning siestas altogether, citing the effects it has on Iberias economic productivity. Franco was outraged by this proposal and the two soon erupted into a full blown feud. As Salazar repeated his suggestion, the two almost came to blows. Despite most likely being sympathetic to their respective national leaders, guards intervened to separate the two leaders, both of whom left in a furious mood."

 IBR.51:0 "Iberian Council Debate - Establishment and Need"
 IBR.51.t:0 "Iberian Council Debate - Establishment and Need"
 IBR.51.d:0 "Today a series of meetings have begun between the Caudillos Franco and Salazar to debate the establishment of an Iberian Council. The first meeting consisted of determining how and why the Iberian Council will be created and the Caudillos have already disagreed on some things.\n\nEven though both Caudillos agree that the Council should be small at first and grow with time, the growing speed of the Council is one of the things they disagree with; while Franco thinks the growth should be slow so that the power balance remains steady and doesn't unexpectedly shift hands, Salazar wants the growth to be as quick as possible to try avoiding the bureaucratic pain the slow growth rate would cause. This matter was debated for far longer than expected but the meeting finally ended.\n\nBoth Caudillos left the meeting happy because they agreed on the fact that the Iberian Council was going to be created 'for the benefit of the Iberian people' even though that was not what they called the meeting for and no news of the establishment debate have been revealed." 
 IBR.51.a:0 "They agree on something, so that's... good"

 IBR.52:0 "Iberian Council Debate - Representation"
 IBR.52.t:0 "Iberian Council Debate - Representation"
 IBR.52.d:0 "One of the hottest issues when it comes to the formation of the Iberian Council is who is represented there and how they should be represented and as with most things, Franco and Salazar have different opinions on the matter.\n\nFranco stated that the Council should be based on what he considers are the three natural parts of society: the family, where one is born; the town, where one lives and the syndicate, where one works. Salazar opposed this and instead proposed that the Council should be filled with members chosen with an odd pyramidal system. Franco's difficulty to understand Salazar's unique choosing method together with Salazar's frontal denial of Franco's proposal made sure that the meeting lasted much longer than it was intended to.\n\nAfter much explaining Franco finally understood Salazar's sytem, which he then vetoed before calling off the meeting. Both Caudillos say they are very close to choosing a system but not a word was said regarding representation for regions like Catalonia, Galicia or the Basque Country." 
 IBR.52.a:0 "Can you explain Salazar's system again please?"

 IBR.53.d:0 "Iberia has a lot of beautiful buildings and locations full of history and meaning, but sadly only one place can host the Iberian Council. Of course, as with most things, the Caudillos are deeply divided in this matter.\n\nFranco proposed that his own residence, the Royal Palace of El Pardo should be the meeting place but Salazar then proposed his own estate to host the Council. This conversation then transformed into an argument to see whose residence was better before turning into a string of insults to the other's. The matter was finally dropped and the debate moved to the proposals of hosting the Council in either the Palacio de las Cortes or the São Bento Palace with each proposal being defended by Franco and Salazar respectively and followed a pattern similar to the private residence proposal, arguing which one is better before deciding to insult the other building.\n\nThe meeting was called off but both Caudillos say they are still analyzing options. The only thing this meeting left clear was that El Pardo has better plumbing while São Bento has less leaks."

 IBR.54.d:0 "Every Iberian knows that the Caudillos tend to veto each other's decisions, even the most trivial ones; something that is used by underground publications to satirize their figures and for the common people to make jokes about. This veto situation was the matter debated today for the formation of the Iberian Council.\n\nFranco proposed that veto powers should be reserved for himself and Salazar, but Salazar unsurprisingly said no to this and proposed that a proposal could only be vetoed if the number of members of the council who decided to veto it was higher than the number of those that didn't want to veto it. Franco then refuted Salazar's argument asking if those members who voted blank would simply be ignored. This spiralled out of control and ended up being a heated philosophical debate of what is a veto and whether a veto could be nullified if it was discovered it was motivated to harm the Iberian people rather than help them.\n\nAt the end nothing was agreed on, so we must expect the veto powers will remain in the hands of the Caudillos, at least for now."

Their capacity shall be to serve as a new council of advisors to the Caudillos, with the intent of allowing the true leaders of the nation to make more decisive decisions. They shall serve on the Council in perpetuity, until the time has come for them to resign, or the Caudillos no longer require their services.

 IBR.58.d:0 "As the representatives arrive in Madrid, and file into the Palace of the Parliament, armed officers of the Guardia Civil block streets off in preparation for the beginning of the First Iberian Council.\n\nThe Caudillos, as expected, are both present, standing sternly in their uniforms. Instead of entering the Chamber of Deputies, however, the representatives are escorted to a small conference room. It is there that the thirty representatives, dispatched by Iberia's smaller governments, shall be briefed.\n\nThey are informed of their new duties through distribution of packets of paperwork hastily stamped with the compromise-coat of arms of Iberia. Their duty, in a surprising move by the infamously aloof and detached Caudillos, is to serve as a new, limited Iberian legislature, that answers to no body but the Caudillos. While it remains unknown precisely what powers they will have, it appears that this will be a significant step forward in resolving the bureaucratic problems that cripple the nation."
 IBR.58.a:0 "Hopefully decisions can be made."
 
 IBR.59.t:0 "The Law of the Organic State"
 IBR.59.d:0 "In order to ensure that the Iberian Council has a reasonable amount of power, and the ability to perform the tasks that is has been entrusted with, a new Fundemental Law Of The Realm has been passed, the first amendment to the original Fundamental Laws of Iberia since the late 1940s.\n\nThis law, at least in writing, gives the Iberian Council several powers, such as the ability to levy federal taxes and issue federal laws with the approval of Salazar and Franco. It remains unknown, however, how much power the legislative body will actually be able to exert."
 IBR.59.a:0 "Good to keep things legal."
 
 IBR.60.t:0 "Determining Legal Political Stances"
 IBR.60.d:0 "From the events of the Spanish Civil War, and the crisis Portugal was embroiled in before the Estado Novo, we have ample reason to ban liberal opinions within the Iberian Council. However, as has been pointed out by several advisors, doing this could potentially alienate Opus Dei, which is a promising organization.\n\nDespite the wishes of both of the Caudillos, it may be necessary to liberalize our regime somewhat. In the case of letting some more liberal elements onto the council, we will have to watch it much more closely to root out subversion, but the benefits could potentially outstrip the expenditure of resources."

 IBR.61.t:0 "Codifying the Council's Powers"
 IBR.61.d:0 "The Fundamental Law of the Organic State gives the Iberian Council numerous powers, including the power to tax, the power to pass law, and the power to oversee the operations of lower-ranking government organizations. This is far greater than any power that the formerly weak Council has had in the past, and so may require some reasonable limitations to keep them in check. The question now facing the two Caudillos is exactly how much of their de jure powers the Council should be able to exercise in practice."
 IBR.61.a:0 "Best to minimize their workload."

 IBR.62.t:0 "Making Provisions for Legislative Oversight"
 IBR.62.d:0 "Another part of the Fundamental Law of the Organic State enables the Council to, in theory, request information from organizations such as the military and the governments of Spain and Portugal. While this could make their job much easier, it would also empower the Council even more, something that both Caudillos are reasonably worried about.\n\nWhile limiting their power to request information is a legitimate option, restricting the Council in this manner could severely hamper their ability to effectively perform their duties, potentially causing any more of the lethal intragovernmental conflicts that threaten our Union every day."

 IBR.63.d:0 "One of the most destructive systems within Iberia is the allowance of Spain or Portugal vetoing the other nation's domestic affairs. We could potentially limit the Iberian Council's ability to do this, with significant political expenditure. However, it is almost certain to anger Salazar, and may increase the perception of Spanish dominance within the Union. If this is performed, a campaign to re-assure Portugal that the federal government represents all of Iberia, and not just Spain, will be required."

 IBR.64.t:0 "Rooting Out Leftist Influence"
 IBR.64.d:0 "Because of the Iberian Council presenting a potential inroad to power for malicious elements, regardless of how small it is, the Council must be carefully watched for malignant leftist influence. Officials must be carefully vetted to ensure no connection to the PCE, CNT, IR, or other problematic groups. Additionally, we will ensure that peripheral personnel, such as staffers, do not have historical ties to left-wing groups. Through these programs, we can reasonably and securely ensure the integrity of the Union, and make it immune to leftist subversion."
 IBR.64.a:0 "We shall remain vigilant always."
 
 IBR.65.t:0 "The Emergency Provision"
 IBR.65.d:0 "In order to ensure that the Iberian Council remains a useful tool and a reasonable system, the Caudillos shall create a legal mechanism for the dissolution and re-founding of the Council. With a potentially compromised council able to be shut down at any time, Iberia should be able to function better than ever before.\n\nOf course, to ensure that this system is not abused, it shall require unanimous consent amongst the Caudillos, and the Council shall be able to be re-established at any time.

 IBR.66.a:0 "To a more productive future."
 
 IBR.67.t:0 "Calling a Advisory Summit"
 IBR.67.d:0 "Today the first official meeting of the Iberian Council took place in the Palace of Parliament. The meeting was headed by Franco and Salazar and the most important subject were debated there.\n\nThe situation in Germany was the first point in the agenda and this led to a very lengthy and heated discussion as many members believe that the German paranoia is baseless since Germany has demonstrated once and again their total lack of planning for the future and that any threats to Iberia are prone to dissapear soon after they begin; but a minority thinks that even if the Germans aren't the best planners they can be quick to make moves and that could harm Iberia.\n\nThe other point to be debated was the way to fix the Iberian economy and if the German debate was heated, this one almost made the room explode. Council members are deeply divided in this issue and they aren't willing to listen to other proposals that aren't their own, so the debate transformed into a full fight between some of the members and the Caudillos had to be escorted out of the room.\n\nEven though this fight wasn't known outside the room, the press has already started writing stories about what could have happened in there and this has both Franco and Salazar enraged, who have decided that there will always be a couple of Guardia Civiles in the room to watch over the members and to avoid future fights, members aren't allowed to go in groups larger than three in the halls of the Palace of Congress."
 IBR.67.a:0 "They will be kept under control."
 
 IBR.68.t:0 "Rigging the Council's Proportions"
 IBR.68.d:0 "While formally the seats of the Iberian Council are divided up in such a way as to present the Caudillos with diverse advice and represent a broad number of viewpoints held by those in positions of authority across the Union, the reality is decidedly different. Everyone knows that the Iberian government is divided into several factions, all bickering for more control and influence, and some of them even willing to go so far as to openly disagree with the Caudillos. To prevent the Council from being drowned by this poisonous factionalism, Salazar had the idea of stuffing the Council with members that blindly supported him and Franco. Surprisingly, Franco agreed to this.\n\nHowever, this plan for disproportionate representation has come at a cost. Many members of government have protested that the Iberian Council isn't fully proportional and that some "sectors'' have more representation than others. Of course, when asked about these "sectors" most of the complainers fall silent, since the factionalism that grips the government is a deeply taboo subject which the Caudillos have tried to keep behind closed doors.\n\nUntil someone is brave enough to speak up, the Caudillos can seat back and relax knowing that the members of the Council support them and their decisions." 
 IBR.68.a:0 "The Council was rigged from the start."
 
 IBR.69.t:0 "The New Law of the State"
 IBR.69.d:0 "When the Iberian Union was first formed, a constitution (if you can call it that) was created. Among the many articles it contained, one of its most well known ones stated that both Caudillos, Francisco Franco and Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, held supreme power over the country and that no other institution or person could share this supreme power with them.\n\nWhen the Iberian Council was formed, few paid much attention to whether its establishment was in line with this article or the constitution as a whole. Yet a recent article in the press has shed light on this issue, arguing that the establishment of the Iberian Council constitutes a breach of the Iberian constitution, and suggests that the Caudillos intentionally avoided bringing up a constitutional alteration as it could decrease their own powers.\n\nThe Caudillos have responded by announcing that they would rectify the discrepancy and alter the constitution. A very extravagant public ceremony was organized in Madrid in which Franco and Salazar, both in their best suits, officially changed the constitution and added the Iberian Council to it. This ceremony is already being satirized in the press with Franco and Salazar depicted pouring correction fluid over the article and rewriting it with a ball-point pen. The sketch has already become an enduring image of Iberia's brief constitution crisis."
 IBR.69.a:0 "A productive change."
 
 IBR.70.t:0 "Auditing the Council"
 IBR.70.d:0 "In the past, corruption has hindered the efficacy of the Iberian government. Though significantly less severe today than it was 10 years ago, we must still ensure that, with the delegation of some of the Caudillos' authority to the council, that these problems of corruption do not creep up to the highest levels of government.\n\nAs such, we are launching an audit of all prospective council members immediately, in order to better understand their ambitions, their finances, and their personal relationships. While all councillors have already been carefully vetted, there is certainly no harm in vetting them further."
 IBR.70.a:0 "A neccesary precaution."
 
 IBR.71.t:0 "Keeping the Council in Check"
 IBR.71.d:0 "There remain some voices in the council who still do not understand their function. They see their jobs not as being to aid the Caudillos' in their work, but instead to pursue the advancement of their own careers. To that end, we must ensure that the councillors do not operate with too much independence. Beginning today, at all further meetings of the council, councillors will be provided with a document stating the goals which the meeting is intended to accomplish. No longer will councillors debate what goals to pursue. They will only debate how best to pursue them.\n\nWith the initial implementation of the new measures, there was a marked sense of tension among the would-be councillors. However, they shall all grow accustomed to their roles in due time."
 IBR.71.a:0 "The state shall reign supreme."
 
 IBR.72.t:0 "Strengthen the Illusion of Choice"
 IBR.72.d:0 "It seems that there are some concerns from the public that the Council is filled with nothing but stooges loyal to one of the Caudillos. This is, of course, true. They are saying that their constant bickering and inability to pass even the smallest of laws indicates that nothing has changed, that the problems Iberia faces are nowhere near to being resolved.\n\nAlready newspapers are reporting on the various incidents that have occurred during preliminary Council sessions. One such incident involved a physical confrontation between two Council members after one insulted the mother of the other Councilor.\n\nTo remedy this issue, the Caudillos have decided to allow "elections" for Council members. In reality, all candidates will all still be hand picked by the Caudillos. The populace will think they have a say in Council matters and their concerns, at least for now, will be silenced."
 IBR.72.a:0 "The better to keep the people quiet."
 
 IBR.73.t:0 "Controlling the Representatives"
 IBR.73.d:0 "Some of the regional representatives seem too independent minded. They are advocating for more power to their respective provinces. As this is more of a problem in the Spanish part of the Union, it has become a headache for Caudillo Franco. Salazar, meanwhile, finds the situation amusing. He has been heard bragging that all representatives from Portugal are loyal, saying that a good leader would have no trouble with some pesky politicians.\n\nTo this end, Franco has come up with several options. Those representatives found to be especially rebellious would be removed and jailed for treason. This move might cause more problems that it would fix, but Franco will be in absolute control. There is, of course, the softer approach. Franco can decide to simply recall problematic representatives if they sir too much trouble and replace them with ones more loyal to him."

However, there are concerns that allowing representatives for only those two regions would disenfranchise the smaller provinces.\n\nThere are two options. The Caudillos can ignore their cries for representation and allow only Spanish and Portuguese representatives. The other solution to this problem would be to accept a few token representatives from the smaller regions such as Catalonia or Galicia.

 IBR.405.d:0 "The German Reich, once thought to last a thousand years, is in peril. Adolf Hitler's death has lead to various pretenders to the throne, quickly turning Germany into a battleground. Many of our citizens, and indeed most of our government, believes that the best course of action would be not to get involved. After all, Germany eating itself alive gives us the valuable opportunity to focus on our own affairs without worrying about imminent invasion.\n\nThe esteemed Caudillo, however, has other plans.\n\nFrancisco Franco believes we could potentially come out much stronger by involving ourselves in the affairs of the civil war, at least to a certain extent. He has proposed two ways we can do this, the first being sending some aid to Albert Speer's faction, in hopes that we may gain a powerful ally when this is all over. The second option, which Franco seems to personally prefer, is simply to sell guns and supplies to each side, making enough of a profit to fix our economic woes.\n\nIt seems that to maximize efficiency, it would be in our best interests to put our effort into only one option, as we dont have the resources to stretch ourselves between the two. But surely, with the guidance of the Caudillos, our intervention in the German Civil War can only turn out well."
 IBR.405.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"
 
 IBR.406.t:0 "Money Talks!"
 IBR.406.d:0 "For once, the Caudillos have come to an agreement. Speer has a very slim chance of winning, and even if he does through our aid, it's not exactly good praxis to help out the nation responsible for ruining up our economy in the first place. If we're going to get involved, we should at least get something out of it.\n\nWhile they debated who to sell equipment to, Salazar came up with a brilliant idea: just sell as much as we can to as many sides are as willing to buy. By simple math, this would quadruple our potential profits and provide us with enough currency to get our economy back into shape, which will hopefully solve other issues down the line.\n\nSome in the government, as per usual, worry that this whole act of "playing all sides against" each other is morally dubious. Moreover, they worry that if one faction finds out, it is quite possible we will face not only diplomatic condemnation but also sanctions, something Iberia can ill afford. Fortunately, our Caudillos are brilliant leaders, and surely they have an excellent plan in mind."

 IBR.408.d:0 "The idea of playing all sides while staying hidden has ultimately proven appealing to most within our government. In part due to anti-German sentiment, and definitely not because they were pressured into agreeing with the Caudillos out of fear of their own safety. A plan of attack has been drawn up, strategizing what items to sell, and where to sell them.\n\nObviously, Goering is going to be our biggest buyer, so he will be prioritized, and likely the source of the plurality of our profits. Not only does he control a lot of territory, which comes with a lot of troops, but as a diehard militarist he's bound to be grabbing guns even when he doesn't need them. Bormann is second priority, as he controls a lot of territory himself but is a little more reserved. Many feel safe in discounting Speer, but his army is rather sparse, so profit could be made there too. Hell, even Heydrich might be willing to buy some of our stuff, though admittedly he's lowest on the priority list.\n\nNow, with the plans set out, only one issue remains. The fact of the matter is that we cant sell our weapons to all sides, at least not directly. We're going to need to find a middleman. But who among the nations of the world is willing to dive this deep into the black market?"
 IBR.408.a:0 "We'll make them an offer they can't refuse."

 IBR.409.d:0 "As it turns out, we only really have one option when it comes to black market deals of this magnitude: Brittany. Sticking out of both France and the Greater German Reich like a sore thumb in more ways than one, this little nation has gathered quite a reputation in its ability to smuggle all sorts of forbidden things into Germany and its territories. And as luck would have it, Breton agents within our country have heard of our predicament, and are willing to help us out.\n\nNow, granted, this comes with its share of risks. In addition to Brittany being home to some very unsavory figures, pirates, rogues, and the like, using them as a middleman means we need to add another layer of secrecy. Surely, if other countries, or even if our own citizens, get wind of us consorting with black market dealers, they would think less of us. But as long as everybody stays quiet, we should have no problems making a profit."
 IBR.409.a:0 "Dangerous games..."

 IBR.410.d:0 "Ever vigilant, it is the accountant who first catches an air of trouble. Looking through the various papers where transactions are recorded, he realizes something is quite wrong, the numbers don't make sense. Not what's going out, mind you, but what's coming in, there's far far too little considering what we've been sending out.\n\nAn investigation by other accountants confirms this, and the matter is brought up to the Caudillos themselves. Franco and Salazar comb through the findings themselves, and are absolutely aghast to discover that so little money has come back to us. They soon realize that there's only one explanation: our middleman dealers in Brittany are smuggling off both goods and profits, leaving only a trickle to come back to us.\n\n"You utter baffoon!" cries Salazar, "When you told me we were going to sell to all sides, you assured me you had found reputable markets to push our goods through!"\n\nThe Castillien dictator stammers, a mix of anger and confusion in his voice. "I can assure you, I...WE thought we ha-"\n\n"Brittany is literally the OPPOSITE of reputable!" his counterpart interrupts.

And though they eventually gave up yelling at each other in order to sleep, the problems still remain. Our black market dealers have double crossed us, and we have wasted valuable time and assets attempting to reach Germany through them."
 IBR.410.a:0 "Damned Pirates!"
 
 IBR.411.t:0 "Marking Up Prices"
 IBR.411.d:0 "Obviously, we only have a limited number of goods to sell around, and thus simple math tells us that there's a limited profit to be gained at the moment. We COULD actually put in some effort for once, and ramp up our equipment production so that we can turn in a profit, but Francisco Franco has a far better idea.\n\nRather than producing four times the goods, we'll get the same amount of money with a quarter of the effort if we just quadruple the prices. They get their guns, Iberia gets a profit, everybody wins. Mostly us, anyways. Of course, some in the government, Salazar included, believe that if we jack up the prices too much nobody will buy from us, but they have forgotten to factor in how desperate each of the German factions are for more equipment. Surley, they will be willing to shill out some extra cash in this hour of need."
 IBR.411.a:0 "How could we fail?"
 
 IBR.412.t:0 "Offering Military Grade Weapons"
 IBR.412.d:0 "Even by raising the prices to ridiculous amounts, we still don't have enough equipment to turn a meaningful profit. Sure, we could actually make enough arms and supplies to earn a meaningful amount of money in the process, but that would take actual hard work. However, once again there seems to be an easier way around this.\n\nAs it turns out, we still have plenty of Triumvirate equipment that we... borrowed from Italy. Since it's very doubtful that they're going to try and take it back, why not make some use of it by selling it to the Germans? With all this stuff sitting in reserve, we're likely to make nearly double what was projected.\n\nOf course, once again the worrywarts in government are raising concerns. Salazar in particular thinks that this is a bad idea as "we don't actually have that much Triumvirate reserves" and "we have no idea if it even works properly or not". Even if it's not in the best condition, it's not like the buyers are going to know about it until they've already paid for it."
 IBR.412.a:0 "The Italians won't miss them."
 
 IBR.413.t:0 "Fading Profits?"
 IBR.413.d:0 "In theory, our two-pronged approach of raising prices while digging for extra guns would have increased profits immensely. It was clever, ingenious even. But unfortunately, this being Iberia, nothing ever goes according to plan.\n\nThe Caudillos got a rather rude awakening around noon today when the most recent profit reports came back...and were almost entirely unchanged from the last one. In fact, a quick look back at previous reports shows that our antics haven't made a lick of difference. These results, to say the least, have baffled both our ministers and Franco, who were positive that quadrupling prices would mean quadruple profit, and not result in crashing demand.\n\nFurious by the incompetence from his Spanish counterpart, a meeting between the Caudillos today resulted in Salazar quickly losing all patience. "You simple-minded idiot!" he screams, ripping up some important documents out of sheer anger, "What foul witchery drove you to such ludicrously poor judgement?"\n\n"In my defense," stammers Franco, "it seemed like a good idea at the ti-"\n\n"Oh, so it SEEMED like a good idea, very nice! Sure, you acted without any oversight from the Portuguese government and made errors that are leaving our economists alternating between shaking their heads and laughing uncontrollably, but I guess since it SEEMED good everything's peachy, huh!?"\n\n"That's entirely unfair! At least I'm actually coming up with ideas! I didn't see you brainstorming any way to profit off the civil war! Sure, some poor decisions were made, but at least I acted!"\n\n"If the choice is between inaction and acting like an imbecile, I choose the former!"\n\nAs with many others, this argument between the Caudillos carried on for several hours, ending with nothing accomplished but a lot of hot air being blown around. Regardless, it seems that Iberia's schemes have failed to pay off, in both senses of the word, and may have made our economy even worse for wear."

 #Heydrich's Tree
 IBR.76.t:0 "Heydrich Wins The German Civil War!"
 IBR.76.d:0 "Terrible news has reached the Iberian peninsula, the German Civil War was finally over, its last contender standing was Reinhard Heydrich, a secretive, ideologically driven monster of a man. The initial jubilant reaction to the more immediate threat of a rampaging Goering having been defeated has been replaced by a thoughtful, uneasy silence in our nation. Now there was only a dark stain in the center of Europe, ready to swallow its poor, weary citizens and drag them into the abyss just like it did with the other, at least human, Führer contenders. Heydrich, the blonde beast, the hangman, now sat in a ruined Germania, his plans unknown, just like his equally elusive counterpart in Burgundy. Panic has stricken certain parts of our nation, the German refugees who had escaped the horrors of the Civil War and the SS being especially distraught by the news. The church also seemingly was recoiling in horror at the news. Attendance for mass in the immediate days after Heydrich's victory proclamation rose dramatically, yet no real answers could be given to the terror stricken people. Frantic public officials and other authority figures tried to give calming reassurances to the population stratas that were terrified at the development in Germany using propaganda and speeches, yet their own unease and lack of knowledge on the handling of this crisis hindered their use ultimately. A few dissenting clergymen advocated that these were the end days, God's last test for humanity before he would come to lead us into salvation, but these doomsayers were quickly taken away from any official positions when the reports of their wrongdoings reached the police, most not to be heard of again and certainly not the last of the desperate who would befall to this fate. In these dark times, the only certainty, in relation to the future of Europe and therefore Iberia, was uncertainty. "

 IBR.77.t:0 "The Panicked Commanders"
 IBR.77.d:0 "The news of Heydrich's victory evidently did not just worry those who understood the darkness of the beasts ideology; military commanders and officers in all of the Iberian armed forces were exceedingly panicking about the battle hardened and extremely disciplined SS becoming Germany's primary armed forces, no longer restricted by the Wehrmacht and the NSDAP leadership. Our enlightened, civilian leadership however seems far less on edge, their expert political analysts having predicted that Germany would spend a vast amount of time, impossible to judge at this moment, recovering from the Civil War, and be far less powerful due to the collapse of their sphere at the end of it. Any plans the reticent hangman of Prague might have would be limited to the admittedly poor German populace that had to suffer his rule. However not all in government seemed to share this view, some took the worries of the military quite seriously indeed, even when they recognized the factual evidence of the political situation in the center of Europe. Chief amongst these was Caudillo Salazar, who had always despised the Nazis as being paganistic barbarians. For him, Heydrich and his twisted ideology represented a darker if not as obvious threat as Goering did. Which faction was to be proven correct in their estimation of Germany's threat to Iberia would only be determined by time, yet it did not harm for the military to be prepared for any unexpected circumstances.

 IBR.80.d:0 "Yesterday, during one of the short, regular meetings with senior military and naval personnel that Caudillo Salazar had requested since Heydrich's seizure of ultimate power in Germany, following his victory over the other Führer candidates in a civil war that had drained the once proud German nation, both of the Caudillos were informed of the necessity to reinforce military presence at the Gibraltar dam. One of the navy commanders spoke gravely about the woeful shortcomings of the defence around the dam, how simple it would be scuttle the current naval installations and ships stationed near Gibraltar for a military power such as Germany. A military commander interjected with corroborating evidence that it was unlikely that if the Germans were to assault Iberia that they would cross the mountainous Pyrenees, and would more likely commence a major naval invasion of one of the weaker port regions of the peninsula or strike right at the dam, which for then was a symbol of lost prestige. Caudillo Salazar was listening intently, noting down all the information that the advisors were giving him while Franco sat back looking dazed and bored. For him there was no chance the weakened Germans would ever be capable again to pose a serious threat to the empire he and Salazar had built, yet as a military man himself he could hardly argue against the necessity of careful advanced planning, so for once when Salazar proposed to deepen defence around the dam he did not oppose his Portuguese counterpart."

 IBR.81.t:0 "Pumping Up The Military"
 IBR.81.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar's deepening paranoia since Heydrich's victory was not going unnoticed to Franco. The Portuguese statesman was beginning to speak the language of the dictator of Spain, who in a not so distant life had been a brilliant general. Salazar was proposing spending more of the yearly budget on defence, building up the Iberian forces to a standard that they could be considered a deadly force to be reckoned with, not just target practice for the disciplined, dangerous SS. Franco allowed a brief smile during their meeting, something he could rarely afford with his constant squabbling with his fellow Caudillo, as he lightly slapped Salazar's back in a friendly fashion. He assured the Portuguese that if he desired to expand the land and naval forces of the union he would not oppose him during the council, rather he would enthusiastically encourage the idea, giving a speech to accompany the proposal. The relief that began to spread across Salazar's face disconcerted Franco slightly, he did not understand why the fiercely intelligent Caudillo would be so worried about a destroyed nation, however he did not question it as they then returned to normal disagreement on the next matter of state."
 IBR.81.a:0 "Who cares if it's sustainable?"

 IBR.82.t:0 "Unity Against The External Threat"
 IBR.82.d:0 "In an unprecedented move of unity both Caudillos announced during a recent council meeting that in the face of the immense external danger an SS run Germany could pose to Iberias unity and quite frankly survival, that both wanted to depend the solidarity that the Iberian peoples felt towards one another. Therefore propaganda tools during the upcoming weeks should be focusing on painting a beautiful picture of a splendid union of equals, united in diversity against the uniform collectivism the Nazis would impose on a conquered Iberia. The surprised council members left the conference room in a dreamlike state, both terrified of the nature of the message that been imparted on them but also the unprecedented cooperation between both Caudillos. Little did they know that Salazar had to compromise with his Spanish counterpart in a fashion that rather went against his personal principles but had to be done to deal with the threat he knew would come in time, if not in his lifetime then in the next. He agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Francos suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity. Anything was better than falling to the darkness bumbling and fermenting in Europe's dark heart, anything, even if it meant agreeing with his gruff fellow Caudillo."

The fearful capabilities of the Luftwaffe can be seen in the desolation of western Africa following the Second World War, and the bombing operations that turned Russia from a respectable power into an anarchic wasteland. Thus, in order to avoid meeting this fate ourselves, a means of protecting our civilians is necessary.\n\nThis means shall come in the form of the humble air raid siren. While not capable of directly protecting our industry, they would give ample time to our citizens to get to shelters, and for various cities' garrisons to get anti-aircraft systems online.

While Müller is slightly more reasonable than the Reichskommissars that seized the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa, he still presents the same mortal threat that any agent of the Reich does, simply by existing on our borders.\n\nAdditionally, with the formation of the Afrika-Schild and the South African War, it is extremely evident that the Reichskommissars will not hestitate to expand wantonly into any territory that takes their fancy. Therefore, our at-risk colony must be fortified as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. While its risky position and the appalling state of our economy will present challenges in this sector, there's nothing that a few honeyed words, promises of freedom, and 'volunteer' labor cannot solve, when it comes to the field of construction. Hopefully, when the endeavor is over, the Reichskommissars will choose a different target, and kindly leave us alone."

We shall hold an enormous military exercise in the far western Pyrenees, simulating a potential German invason from the French border. While the plans for this exercise existed before, it has been heavily altered to reflect the loss of the Triumvirate as dependable allies in wartime. Still, even without Italian naval support, armored divisions, and supplemental airpower, the display is sure to be enough to make Bormann turn his head towards a weaker neighbor.\n\nThe festivities shall occur over a week-long period, and be attended personally by both Caudillos. Elements from every wing of the Iberian armed forces shall be present, from the federal army, to the Portuguese Army, to the Spanish Army, to Guardia Civil units being used as reserves. Two full tank divisions, the majority of Iberia's armor corps, shall be deployed in advanced maneuvers in the foothills of the Pyrenees, while split elements of the Spanish and Portuguese armies shall serve as the federal army's opposing force in the mountains themselves. To prevent foreign interference, a massive deployment of military policemen and elements of the AAS shall stand in support.\n\nAs a bonus, since the exercise is occuring within the Basque-populated region of Iberia, it could serve to shock the problematic ETA into lying low for a while..."

 IBR.90.d:0 "The whole political world of Iberia was in chaotic uproar, entire ministries in utter pandemonium, with civil servants rushing from meeting to meeting, each more depressing than the last in its tone and content.\n\nThe disastrous news that had reached them this morning from Germany had awakened an ice cold terror in many a strong man. Göring, the proud, fat oaf, who had had the immense backing of most Wehrmacht personnel, was now the new Führer of the destroyed Reich, now but an army with a half functioning state. He had vanquished his opponents in hellfire, carving a deep scar into Germany, one that was unlikely to heal soon if ever. The unwavering militarist was likely already crafting extensive plans for foreign policy escapades with his hawkish advisors, while all around him ordinary people were suffering abject poverty and devastation.\n\nAn emergency council meeting had been called when the official declaration of victory had come from Germania, both Caudillos fearful of the danger that may soon face Europe and Iberia. Salazar seemingly had first been surprisingly joyous that it was not Heydrich who had climbed the iron throne of the Reich, but he also shared his Spanish counterparts apprehension of what an openly militaristic Germany could symbolise for their future. Their only hope was that the Reich still needed time to repair and prepare its offensive forces. If we act quickly we might be able to hold off the Germanic horde when it comes."

 IBR.91.t:0 "The Pyrenees Line"
 IBR.91.d:0 "The emergency council meeting concluded with a series of intense measures that were to be undertaken with immediate effect, one of these was the reactivation and expansion of the Pyrenees defensive line. The mobile Germans had proven themselves expert in defeating, or rather avoiding, strong defensive positions in their last European conquest to encircle troop contingents and rush strategic targets.\n\nHowever, times have radically changed. More effective and efficient defensive installations have been invented to compliment that are able to compliment the natural fortification that the Pyrenees Mountains gives our great Peninsula. Even more importantly military analysts have also concluded that the German hordes had enjoyed a great deal of luck in the conquests of France and the lowlands, something we will not allow them to have if they dare knock on our doors. However, some of our high command, especially those who advocate for increased special force use, have warned of naval invasions to try to take key strategic ports or possibly even the vulnerable Gibraltar dam itself. Although not an impossibility we still have deemed the Germans under Göring will prioritize a direct approach."
 IBR.91.a:0 "Hopefully it can hold them."
 
 
 IBR.93.t:0 "Fortify Equatorial Africa"
 IBR.93.d:0 "Just a decade ago, the fat Reichsmarschall had had the brilliant idea of seizing the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa, a bold move to consolidate German control in the region during the formation of the vast African Reichskommissariats. One that fit in well with Hitler's intense megalomania. It was what had driven the pragmatically opposed Caudillos in each other's arms in the first place, the starting shot of Iberian unification which Salazar had initially opposed based on sovereignty issues. With the loss of his treasured African colonies however, he had no other choice but to accept Franco's proposals for a united front against the reviled Germans.\n\nNow, the German Civil War was over, and the hated Göring stood victorious over his defeated foes. The expansionist, the military man. In time he would certainly bring the African Reichskommissars back under his jackboot and look to Equatorial Africa as another target. It was a simple assumption to make; therefore one Göring was likely to take into consideration.\n\nDespite the region originally having been a Spanish colony, Salazar was ecstatically pursuing plans to fortify the last Iberian stronghold below the Sahara. For once, for the usually collected Caudillo, this had become a matter of pride and prestige; Franco also not eager to lose what formally was just his colony, did not sit idly by either. Extensive plans for strong fortification lines and subsequent guerilla warfare, once the lines would be breached, were drafted, military high command eager to follow the lead of their Caudillos as they saw the strong strategic use of drawing away more German forces from the European theater. The Nazis would have to fight hard and suffer bitterly for our land in the sun."

Therefore propaganda tools during the upcoming weeks should be focusing on painting a beautiful picture of a splendid union of equals, united in diversity against the painful conflict and conquest that Göring would bring upon Iberia, reminiscent of the horror of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe terrified council members left the conference room in a dreamlike state, both eager to impart the Caudillos message into public policy but also happily shocked by the unprecedented cooperation between both Caudillos. On this matter the two old men had finally come to full agreement, both were too fearful of the danger that was strengthening just beyond the horizon, a bond reforged that first had been set in place by the same man they now again may have to confront. Salazar even agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Franco's s suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity.

 IBR.97.d:0 "An official news broadcast from a ruined but now hopeful Germania was picked up on waiting Iberian airwaves today, both Caudillo Salazar and Franco waiting together for the past few hours for the statement from the Reichstag to finally be pronounced. Speer, the liberal and idol of Germany's youth, has won the German Civil War, a huge sigh of relief could almost be heard coming from all freedom loving peoples of this wretched earth. The Nazi reformer now becoming Führer was seen as a much appreciated shift away from the current dark paradigm that Europe has had to suffer for the last 20 years, conquest and economic ruin being its defining hallmarks. In Iberia this view was shared by the vast majority of the populace, even both Caudillos could for once agree that this was the best possible outcome of that terrible conflict, an outcome with a future that may not have to involve further war and death. The possibility of regained prosperity from trade, bettering of diplomatic relations, finally the chance for Europe to come closer together. After brief celebrations and a short meeting with other senior government officials, the two Caudillos parted ways for now, Salazar leaving with a secretive, yet buoyant grin. If everything went accordingly now and Speer kept to his reformist promises, the Iberian Union may become defunct as a necessary measure of unity against an external threat. Portugal could become independent again, sovereign again, reigned just by the pragmatist, regaining its lost glory. His daydream was almost too perfect, to be free of Franco and his split, mismanaged country. Whether Speer would be able to actually change Europe's oppressive, dark dynamic was yet to be seen, but for once Salazar could finally entertain the idea of hope."

The new Führer was still a national socialist, formerly a devoted, close acolyte of Hitler, one that may talk sense but still a by blood a barbaric German. The idea that Iberia could now relax, possibly even devolve as Salazar hoped for an idealistic future, was not one rooted in the still grotesque reality they had to endure. After initial jubilance even the Portuguese Caudillo became rooted again, adopting his usual composure in the next council meeting. Invited military and economic analysts began to give estimates, derived from close analysis of Germany's material reality and Speers proposed policies, of how long it would take Germany to rebuild and what sort of military capabilities the Iberians would need to prepare for in a worst case scenario. Caudillo Franco, unusually for the aging fighter, was very invested in this meeting, interrupting regularly to ask specific questions on military matters. Salazar, spotting Franco taking charge of the situation in a way he did not appreciate in the slightest began to make equally valid statements on the political and diplomatic motivations Speer may follow, trying to reduce the push for further Iberian military expansion as he viewed this as being an unjustified, aggressive move, one that may produce negative reaction. Underneath his open reasoning, he also was motivated to try to reduce the further integration of the two nations this would create. Surprisingly, the council took Franco's side in this matter, the final decision of the council being to prepare for a worst case possibility, to better be safe than sorry. Salazar retched internally once he left the meeting."

Instead it was greeted with the unusual sight of a rather large contingent of the Iberian navy, both Portuguese and Spanish ships conducting a large scale exercise, a show of strength personally overseen by Caudillo Franco from the shore. The brutish Spaniard had secured this personal vanity project out of his Portuguese counterpart in the recent debate over the Iberian response towards the victory of the liberal reformer Speer in the German Civil War. Salazar, quite fond of the his navy himself, had quickly recognized that the Germans would take little notice of this waste of precious fuel, their attention mainly focused inwards at this moment, any of their little foreign policy decision being in regards to their subjects around the world, and therefore granted his fellow Caudillo's request without much opposition. He needed Franco grateful and ready to compromise with him on more important issues regarding the new diplomatic scene of Europe, but the training also showed him the Portuguese naval capacity, which he also inspected closely from his comfortable viewing platform standing next to Franco. It after all was vital to rebuild the empire he had lost to the marauding Teutons, who it seems now might be finally tamed from their destructive nature."

 IBR.107.d:0 "The Pyrenees mountains, an immense, natural defensive line that once had split the peninsula from the feared French, now divided Iberia away from a Europe ruled by a far greater evil. Or so it would seem for anyone watching the sunburnt manual labourers and military men toiling away endlessly, using man's great ingenuity to further expand the large fortifications that lined the beautiful mountain range on the Southern French border. Again the Iberian council had voted for Franco's gruffly made proposal that had led to the constructions, to the deep and bitter chagrin of Salazar who was getting more impatient with Franco's defensive demands each new meeting. The Spaniard did not seem to run out of ideas. So far the intelligence services had reported nothing that could suggest Speer had untoward desires when it came to Iberia and its peoples. Whether that would change with each new military venture that Franco departed on was yet to be seen. In all honesty, Salazar was not entirely against the fortress installations being built, yet for different reasons to the Spanish Caudillo. He saw a great threat emitting from the former German puppet of Burgundy, the secretive SS state. Any kind of defense against this ominous threat was a welcome one indeed. He therefore has not vetoed this idea either."

 IBR.108.t:0 "Keeping Contact"
 IBR.108.d:0 "In the ever worsening personal conflict between the two contrasting Caudillos over the official Iberian government policy towards the new Reich, the traditional statesman and politician Salazar had finally been able to wrangle a significant concession out of the aging former general. Drawing upon all the previous plans and projects from the Spanish Caudillo that he had not vetoed for the sake of an opportunity like this, the old Portuguese convinced the Spaniard that even if the government's policy will follow one of caution toward the wobbling European hegemon, we should not allow the Germans to see any aggression in our handling of state affairs. Following another debate, this time more of a monologue as Franco had lost interest, it was decided that diplomacy would be initiated with the new regime in Germania, diplomacy on mutual necessity. In other words trade and commerce. It would allow a channel of communication in the possibility of crisis. Through this change in policy it might also be possible to expand the intelligence network we are still building in the ruined country, to ascertain the direction and working of the German government, but for Salazar more importantly it could allow a thawing of previously frozen relations between the two European nations. Like usual, Franco had not been able to object to the ascetic statesman when he had begun his rant. He saw no real danger in pursuing what Salazar proposed but deemed it not useful enough for Iberia, the nation needed a threatening external force to unite against. Looks like he might have to create a new enemy."

Fluttering with the panic of a nightmare, he exploded from his horizontal position into a vertical one, standing upright and grasping at his throat with all of the instinct of a wild gazelle. As the vestiges of sleep left him, and consciousness returned to reign, he removed his hand from his neck and remembered what was caught in his throat. It was the silence. He was all alone in the Palacio de la Bolsa de Madrid, and it was silent among the marble pillars and stained glass and stock ticker and rotary phones all left off the hook. Mateo, for his part, had fallen asleep slumped in some obscure corner of the trading floor. With a building horror, he began to remember the events of the last few hours.\n\nAt 10 a.m, open outcry begins. There is clear panic in the shouts of many traders as they desperately unload stocks, a panic that seems utterly unfounded in Mateo's eyes. The recent government economic plan has seemingly been effective, and while the markets were shaky, they were trending upwards. Mateo decided against giving into the panic, deciding instead to buy the dip. At about 10:30 a.m, it became clear that the dip was not going to correct, or even slow. Open outcry will last for several more hours while the "dip" builds inertia, like a stone chucked down a deep well, reverberating as it hits the walls, becoming more and more undeniable.\n\nEventually, the pressure breaks him. Mateo, fearing further downturn, sells a huge number of Rumasa shares. Après lui, le déluge. The building crescendo of fear and doubt breaks like a wave as Mateo slams into the fray of the trading pit. All of the other traders on the sidelines join in, and what breaks out is more anthropological than financial. It is an unmitigated disaster; it is nature, red in tooth and blood. As every trader in Madrid becomes desperate to sell, open fights break out on the trading floor as government men desperately attempt to shut down trading, but it is too late.

 IBR.233.d:0 "With the new foreign policy of Iberia focusing on looking outwards, it is imperative that we recognize that Italy is not the only Catholic nation in the world, and despite the presence of the Holy See in Rome, should not act as the sole representative. Instead, Caudillo Antonio Salazar has taken it upon himself to head to Ireland and France to strengthen the bond with Iberia's Catholic brethren.\n\nIf we play our cards right, Iberia may be able to gently push Italy out of the limelight and take its place as the strongest of the Catholic nations. Not only will this net us stronger relations with Catholic nations as a whole, but it will also be seen as a moral victory over the Italians, something which the people of Iberia desperately need.\n\nBags packed and plane ready, Caudillo Salazar is ready to send off to Ireland and France, hoping to tie the nations closer to Iberia, showing the world that Iberia is a strong, unified and proudly Catholic nation."

A brief photo-op was held between the Caudillo and the Irish president, before both men quickly were whisked away to the parliament house to meet in private.\n\nHere, Salazar and President de Valera both begin discussing the future of the relations between Iberia and Ireland. Even with the warm relations between the two nations, both from the shared religious background and similar diplomatic situation, the situation of Ulster still looms.\n\nOfficially, Iberia remains supportive of the Irish claims on the region, though there are some that believe that the Caudillo should take careful steps not to draw too much attention to it, as it could incite further violence between Protestants and Catholics. Regardless, the economic benefits of Irish and Iberian friendship are obvious, and both men are ready to tie the two nations closer together than ever before."

Short lived and nothing spectacular, the Caudillo's staff scurried him away towards a more secure area of South Paris to meet with the representatives of the French government.\n\nDespite everything, the meeting with the French went by swimmingly. A wonderful state dinner and several photo opportunities had managed to raise everyone's spirits, and several impromptu speeches were made to the people of France and Iberia.\n\nNow, however, Salazar is faced with either continuing his meetings with the French in order to strengthen trade relations, or to begin approaching church leaders to gather their support for future Iberian endeavors. With the Burgundians breathing down the necks of the French, the Caudillo only has the time to meet with one or the other."

South Africa is our sole priority due to its unique position between the OFN and Unity Pakt. Salazar will have to be careful as the country is a hotbed of tensions between the ruling Anglo aristocracy, the Boers, and the disenfranchised native population. Furthermore, the internal conflict is amplified to the global stage by the support given to the Boers by the Reichsprotektorates to their north, setting South Africa to be a potential stage of proxy war between the Reich and the USA. It is through this that Caudillo Salazar must use his diplomatic skill to navigate the political landscape of South Africa whether that be by standing with the government's current position or by lobbying for reconciliation."

As Salazar meets with the nation's richest businessmen, most powerful politicians, and most influential community leaders, a feeling that would not subside is that South Africa was a nation by and for Anglos regardless of the government's position that this was the best situation for the Boers and Africans.\n\nHowever, Iberia seeks diplomatic reasons and so must make a decision whether the Union will officially recognize the South African government or whether to call for reconciliation between the three factions at odds. If we are to recognize the government, it could grant us further ties with the OFN and help us position ourselves with them in this cold war. On the other hand, we could call for reconciliation in the hopes that, with enough pressure, the government could open up its government to the Boers and Africans."

We can either talk business with the Argentinians in the hopes that we can strengthen our economic ties with the country or we could meet with local Iberian community leaders.

Nevertheless, beauty still shone in the city with the Franco's visit to the impressive Biblioteca Nacional, one of the largest libraries in the world, and the Paço de São Cristóvão, the beautifully crafted old imperial palace of the Braganzas.\n\nOnce the tour had concluded, it was time for the Caudillo to decide what the focus of this trip should be. We could either talk business with the Brazilians or meet with President [BRA.GetLeader]. Talking business with the Brazilians has the potential to yield many rewards as they are in possession of a vast array of natural resources with a decent industrial sector to go with it and improving trade ties between our nations could bring the riches of the Amazon to Iberia once again.

It is through this that we must consolidate our economic ties and continue in the long standing tradition of helping develop the country in a way that develops our own too.\n\nIn spite of this, the presence of Japanese Zaibatsus in the country cannot be understated and it is because of this fact that we must weigh up whether to focus on meeting with the representatives of these Zaibatsus and engage in joint projects with them or whether to meet with local Mexican businessmen to directly work with Mexican firms. The former would allow us to utilize more economies of scale as the Zaibatsus have a larger pool of money to use for development than the Mexicans as well as helping us to draw closer to the Japanese should we want to create stronger ties with them. However, the latter would mean that we can gain more influence in the country and would go further to endear the Mexicans towards us. Either way, we can only focus on one of the two so it is up to Franco to make that choice. "

Within the city itself, Caudillo Franco did his prayers in Havana's cathedral, received a private viewing of an Alicia Alonso ballet in the Gran Teatro de La Habana, and got to relax and drink coffee in San Francisco Square.\n\nHowever, the Caudillo did not come to Havana to sightsee, but rather to establish Iberia's new foreign policy. Franco could either meet with Castro and seek to establish diplomatic ties with Cuba or meet with the most influential church leaders in Cuba. If we are to meet with Castro, it would help to align us with the OFN should we choose to and could open up economic opportunities with the Cubans.

Approaching the podium, many notice that Franco, in an unusual breach of convention, walks several paces ahead of Salazar in his approach to the podium. With Salazar standing aside, Franco mounts the podium, and the assembly hall falls silent. "It has been decided, after careful consideration, that the way forward to ensure Iberian prosperity is to pursue a path of self-reliance. We will be the masters of our own economic destiny!"

The council has shown to favor two radical options of economic reform. Liberalization or Autarky. While Salazar maintains his belief that the status quo remains the best option for the future of Iberia, he lacks the support required to assert his standpoint. Salazar stands alone. Despite the council being merely advisory, Franco finds that it would be within his best political interest to seriously consider both camps of the debate. The Caudillos debate the options for hours, as the politicians of the assembly grow tired. Despite hours of internal debate, no decision is made. The two leaders agree that it would be reckless to come to an absolute decision.\n\nThe Caudillos exit the secluded room and take to the floor of the assembly. Approaching the podium, many notice that Franco, in an unusual breach of convention, walks several paces ahead of Salazar in his approach to the podium. With Salazar standing aside, Franco mounts the podium, and the assembly hall falls silent.\n\nHe announces to the assembly that, given the gravity of the suggested reforms, a swift government inquiry will be launched to assess the plausibility of both liberalization as well as autarky. He assures the council that their voices have been heard by the Caudillos, and that following the inquiry, a plan of economic action will be deployed. A disappointed murmur sounds from the council, as the assembly is inconclusively dismissed."

 IBR.416.d:0 "The Caudillos find themselves in a deadlock. Franco, seeing an opportunity to gain political traction through supporting a popular standpoint, stands with the technocrats and their proposal of liberalization. Salazar, on the other hand, fervently stands by the status quo, despite the popularity of the technocrats and the political traction of the falangists. Franco and Salazar recognize that neither man among them carries the political weight behind them to enforce their standpoint upon the other.\n\nThrough the deadlock of lengthy debate emerges a compromise. It is decided that, as the two men are unlikely to come to a decision through personal deliberations, the council shall hold a vote to decide upon the topic. Despite the original intent being for the Iberian Council to remain advisory only, giving it the power to vote upon the economic reform remains the only method of decision the Caudillos have left, save for complete capitulation to the other man. Furthermore, both Franco and Salazar recognize this final opportunity to garner support for their cause, before a final vote is cast.\n\nThe Caudillos exit the secluded room and take to the floor of the assembly. In their approach to the podium, the two men walk shoulder to shoulder, maintaining a nearly visible effort to remain level with one another. Salazar and Franco jointly mount the podium, and together they inform to the assembly of their decision. At a soon to come date, they announce, the Iberian Council will convene to vote upon two options for the economic future of Iberia: the approach of liberalization, or the maintenance of the status quo. Immediately, the Falangists audibly express their immense disapproval over their lack of representation in the final vote, and many members of that bloc immediately stand and storm out of the council chambers. A curious murmur emerges from the benches of the assembly."

The path to Iberian prosperity lies not within radical policies and political toss-ups, but rather with stability and a proven approach. Gentlemen, I am grateful for your most trusted feedback upon the matters at hand, and it will not be soon forgotten."\n\nWith a confused mutter rising from the benches of the council, the assembly is swiftly called to a close.

Many within these blocs, however, remain unconvinced of voting to appease the Caudillos, and plan to vote for the true economic path which they support. As Franco attempts to steer conservatives to vote for liberalization, and as Salazar attempts to whip votes for his agenda of conservatism, the fate of the economic reform seems uncertain.\n\nThe time of the vote comes, and the deliberative murmur of the assembly dies down. The Caudillos call for the votes to begin. The Opus Dei are the first to table their reform, supported by Franco in an attempt to secure the most plausible majority vote. The speaker calls for all those in favor of the proposal to rise. Much to Franco's dismay, a large majority of the conservatives, who he had appealed to vote in favor of liberalization, refuse to rise. The liberalization reforms fail to grab a majority. Next, in defiance of Franco's support for the Opus Dei, the Falangists table their autarky proposal. Without Franco's support, however, the Falangists obtain a pitiful fraction of the vote. Finally, the Salazarian conservatives table their motion for a status quo. Once again, a clear minority rises to their feet in favor of Salazar's status quo. The Iberian Council rests at a standstill, with only the Falangists being decisively defeated. With the voting inconclusively drawing onwards into the night, the Caudillos call voting to a close, both of the leaders hoping to be able to regroup their support for a later voting date."

 IBR.702.d:0 "30 years of dictatorship has made the prospect of a free and fair election purely theoretical up until now. Franco's relinquishment of power to the council has changed that, which means that Iberia has entered a crossroads where the way in which we choose to organise the election has been pushed to the forefront of political discourse.\n\nWhether it be the question of foreign observers or the possible extension of suffrage, the future of Iberian democracy and the Unión Nacional's political hegemony now lies in the halls of the council-chambers with decisions which will shape the lives of Iberians for generations. From the conservatives to the reformists, lines are beginning to be drawn on the questions that we will have to answer in the coming months. A liberal democracy? An authoritarian democracy? The urban/rural political divide? The answers to these questions will decide the fate of Iberia on both the domestic and world stage for years to come."
 IBR.702.a:0 "A monumental task"
 
 IBR.442.t:0 "The Question of Observers"
 IBR.442.d:0 "With their newly granted powers, the reformists in the Council are now in the position to truly reform Iberia into a democracy. However, this means that the way in which we structure our electoral system is still up in the air, and it is up to them to determine what the new Iberia should look like.\n\nThe first issue that requires discussion is whether foreign governments should be allowed to monitor our election to ensure that the election is run fairly. While this would help legitimise whatever party wins and by extension our political system, there are worries amongst many of the more nationalist leaning people that this would infringe on the sovereignty of the nation and potentially give the countries we grant observer status a chance to influence the election.\n\nThat being said, the hard-line reformists demand that we allow total transparency in this upcoming election as the peninsula hasn't seen a free election since the days of the Second Spanish Republic back in 1936, and they fear that authoritarianism could return without these international checks and balances. We could reach a compromise between these two by allowing the observers but in a limited fashion in order to garner a better reputation amongst the democracies of the world."

 IBR.443.d:0 "Iberia has always been a sparsely populated area with much of the electorate being located in rural areas where getting to the ballot box is considerably harder than in our urban centers. This raises the question of how exactly we should distribute the ballot boxes to ensure that all voters can reach them and get their say in the election. Representatives from rural areas have asked for disproportionately more ballot boxes than in urban areas because of their worry that there won't be enough to make sure that the people in these small communities can reach them on election day.\n\nHowever, representatives from the urban areas claim that this is unfair; that the current plans for distribution should suffice and that rural representatives are trying to have their areas overrepresented. Regardless of what proposed plan we choose, we will be making either the urban or the rural areas feel threatened by under representation which could turn into apathy from the people who live in these regions, potentially undermining their faith in whatever government is elected."

 IBR.444.d:0 "The question of suffrage is perhaps the most important question in deciding the election. Who deserves the right to choose how they're governed and who doesn't is a very controversial issue amongst the Council members, and three main proposals have been put forward for the Council to vote on.\n\nThe proposal put forward by the conservatives details a plan which would continue to exclude the people who couldn't vote in the undemocratic elections back when the Caudillos reigned supreme. This has come under heavy fire from the hard-line reformists and would surely outrage the people disenfranchised by it, however the conservatives argue that allowing these people to vote would only lead to instability in our newly christened democracy.\n\nThe radical reformists have declared that suffrage should be expanded to everyone over 18. While they only hold a minority in the Council, they seem to have popular support throughout the country, judging by rallies which have been held, visited by tens of thousands, in order to pressure the government to open up the franchise.\n\nThe final proposal, seen as the compromise option between the conservatives and the hard-line reformists, details universal suffrage with an ID registration system. This system would potentially dissuade some of the elements the conservatives want to ban while fulfilling the populace's desire for universal suffrage."

As a result of this, the idea of using the Guardia Civil to protect polling stations has been brought to the council. Using the police would be able to break up any conflicts that could occur, and even act as a deterrent to dissuade troublemakers from showing up. Furthermore, it would be a signal to our citizens that we are truly committed to democracy and encourage them to participate where they otherwise wouldn't have.\n\nIn spite of this, the general consensus among the officials we have put in charge of organising the election is that the fears of voter intimidation are exaggerated, and that the deployment of the Guardia Civil would be a waste of police time and resources which could otherwise be spent elsewhere."

Those sympathetic to the rule of Franco and Caetano wish to actively fund Unión Nacional, through proxies and Swiss bank accounts, to ensure that no other party can match their level of funding. Others have considered using suppression to ensure that no liberal parties can become elected or even become part of a coalition. For these moderates, so long as some kind of conservative party wins, Iberia will be safe and the reforms will be limited.\n\nNaturally, the reformist ideologues have expressed disgust at the thought of illegal funding or suppression of parties and reject the notion that only Unión Nacional can guide this country sufficiently, declaring that only free and fair elections can allow the people of Iberia to choose the direction of their nation democratically."

All of these groups have seen a resurgence since the rallies began, and every day their support grows wider and wider. Many in the Council have expressed disgust at the prospect of a liberal or even a socialist government and have considered a media blackout to halt this momentum and prevent what they see as a red tide poised to sweep the nation. Rural representatives have also expressed support at this measure, wishing to keep leftists and cosmopolitan urbanites as far away from their communities as possible.\n\nThe more optimistic within the Council have stated their opposition to the blackout, believing that they can beat back their political enemies on the merits of their arguments rather than resorting to dirty tricks and backdoor politics."

In order to counterbalance this, many within the Council have begun to discuss ways to get rural, god-fearing, conservatives to lead the way with their faith in tradition, providing a solid bedrock for the glory of the nation into the coming decades.\n\nBy utilizing our ties to the Church, we could ensure that those who hold our nation together not only come out to vote, but come out to vote for the right party. With enough propaganda in the right places, we could turn the farmer and villager voting blocs away from Alianza Popular and towards the Unión Nacional and potentially secure victory in the election.\n\nThat being said, many of the moderates in the Council have stated their position that an Alianza Popular victory in the election would be satisfactory as we share many of their values. The more liberal minded in the Council have proclaimed that there should be no meddling in these areas, and to allow the people of Iberia to choose the government that they wish.

The announcement of Iberia's first free elections had been made. The jubilation tingled in the air, leaving its mark on anyone who ventured out that day. All the excitement and anticipation that had been built up to the announcement had burst out into a celebration larger than any other in Iberian history. For one day, all peoples in the nation felt united and all differences had been ascended. The old wept at seeing how far the nation had come from the days where collapse felt inevitable. The young finally had the chance to be represented and to choose a government they weren't born into. As the day marched on, the crowds only got bigger, the cheers only got louder, and the spirit of democracy only grew stronger.\n\nFor Franco, this was just another day. He didn't get up early nor did he eat breakfast with any haste. However, as the aging Caudillo left his residence for some air, he saw the crowds. Crowds he had not seen the like of since the victory 31 years ago. He had only reluctantly given additional powers to the council, and throughout this process had gone back and forth on whether it had been a good idea, but seeing the people of his nation cry out with such elation caused a single tear to drop from behind his glasses.

The talk of organizing the election is over and now the practicalities of running an election have begun to take place.\n\nNow that the decisions made by the council in preparing for the elections have begun to take shape, there has been criticism from all sides regarding the handling of the logistical side of things. Some believe that the numbers of police deployed is too much, while some say too it has been too little. Some have stated that not enough ballot boxes were sent to rural areas, while others too many were sent. The old adage, "you can't please everyone" applied to politics seems to be closer to "you can't please anyone".

At the moment, the parties that seem to be gaining traction are: the socially liberal Unión Republicana, the conservative Alianza Popular, and the economically liberal Partido Renovador Democrático.\n\nThe newfound diversity in the republic has shocked the old guard who believed that many of the views now being openly advocated in the streets had died out under the Caudillos' watch, but to their dismay both the red banner and the flag of the second republic is being paraded around with seemingly no consequences. With the decline of the Unión Nacional, reactionary elements within the party have been provoked to believe that a stronger hand will be needed to guide the UN to victory in the election."

This made the Unión Republicana's decision to outline their plans for minority representation in the city a clear sign of their commitment to the cause of peaceful devolution. The rally itself was rather short, but the speech was almost drowned out by the cheers. Once the rally was over, brawls sporadically broke out across the city between Galician nationalists and unionists. City officials denounced the UR speakers for "incitement of violence" and "disturbing the peace". Torcuato Fernández-Miranda has refused to acknowledge the denouncement, staying committed to the slogan of "Freedom and Autonomy for all of Iberia's children!"\n\nThese words would have gotten any man imprisoned mere months ago, but has now become the rallying cry for the up and coming Unión Republicana; a party dedicated to reducing inequality, empowering Iberia's minorities, and seeing that the process of democratisation is brought to its natural conclusion. The party has seen widespread support in urban centers, from moderate minority nationalist movements, and from the most hard-line reformists in the council.

Criticising their "inflammatory anti-Iberian language" and "highly idealistic and unrealistic policies", the article has inflamed public opinion with its use of divisive language. To accompany the article, Fraga has released their manifesto in which the policy positions of Alianza Popular were showcased. As expected, it calls for aggressively combatting terrorism, maintaining a unitary style of government, and strengthening of the bond between the Church and the state. Naturally, this has come under heavy fire from the liberals who claim that Alianza Popular wish to maintain the status quo at a time when reform is needed, with conservatives arguing they only wish to preserve what makes Iberia great."

Whether this call will fall on deaf ears remains to be seen but the publicity around the stunt has given the PRD a boost in the polls and has propelled them to the lead for the title of the main center party with their emphasis on the civility needed in politics.\n\nPromising a focus on economic liberalization along with vague promises on social reform, the Partido Renovador Democrático has managed to gain the support from the urban business leaders and the money that comes along with them. Given the stagnation that occurred under the Caudillos' rule, their message of adopting a laissez-faire approach has resonated with many of the people most affected by the pitfalls of the old economic system, and the more measured tone on social issues could mean that the PRD stands to poach voters off both Alianza Popular and Unión Republicana.

As a result, the question of secret funding has been brought up, behind closed doors, in order to prevent the Partido Renovador Democrático or God forbid the Unión Republicana from taking over and carrying on with even more reform.\n\nHowever, who this funding should go to remains undecided. The UN had seemed like the obvious choice if any extrajudicial funding would be needed, but some in the government feel like they have fallen too far to be saved, even with covert support. Instead, there has been a proposal to fund the Alianza Popular as they have been seen as having a strong chance in winning the election. Although there are some differences in policies between the two, Alianza Popular is still a conservative party opposed to the liberals, and therefore broadly agree with the vision of the Unión Nacional. They could for this reason be the key to preventing liberal influence from disturbing the status quo.\n\nThat being said, some have stated their opposition to any election tampering and wish to ensure that the people of Iberia get to choose their own government, whether that be a liberal or conservative one."

However, it would be costly to be able to print enough ballots in time for the election as printing houses would have to be subsidized to work overtime.\n\nThat being said, it is not immediately certain that the amount by which we would be able to print will fall short of the demand. Should there only be a few thousand people who do not have a ballot, there is a chance that the press wouldn't pick it up and we could avoid the cost. Additionally, by targeting areas that are predicted to vote against the government, it could give us the push needed to secure victory."

The size of the crowds on this momentous occasion dwarf the ones seen when the election was first announced and while the feelings of excitement still remain, there is something else accompanying it that wasn't there before. A feeling of unspoken trepidation. Questions that plagued the mind of the average Iberian. What if it all went wrong? What if all of this was for nothing and the old regime remains, rebranded for a new decade? There were celebrations from dusk till dawn but that anxiety hung over like a stalactite ready to fall at any moment, ready to spear their newfound liberty.\n\nAntonio, Isabella, Leo, and Gabriella could not have less in common. What common ground does a bureaucrat, a student, a banker, and a nun share? Usually very little, but today they all felt that feeling in their stomach. As they gripped their secret ballot, they were united in the foreboding apprehension about their country's future. No words were exchanged but they all shared in the comfort of each other's worried glances. If the future were to be bleak they wouldn't face it alone, but together.\n\nWhile in power, it'd be easy to say that Franco could never really connect with his people and understand their plight but even he could feel the uneasiness in the air. The people wanted reform, that he had been sure of but if they didn't get it, what would they do? Who would face the wrath of the disillusioned masses? Franco was many things but clueless was not one of them and he realized how his position, however ceremonial it may be, could be the target of populist outrage. After coming to this conclusion, he had decided to visit the Cathedral of his hometown of Ferrol for the remainder of the day to pray for everything to work out as intended."

Both Unión Republicana and the Partido Renovador Democrático have both made statements denouncing the government for using voter suppression by proxy to intimidate their voter base.\n\nThe government's response aimed to highlight how they could not know that there would be voter suppression occurring and that their models did not predict anything requiring extra police officers to be stationed at poll booths.

While there had been recent reports that city officials were riling up their constituents to vote, the measures taken by the government were thought to be enough to keep them at bay.\n\nThis was wrong and these same measures were actually used to propagandize against the government which has severely limited the ability of Unión Nacional and Alianza Popular to secure the election. Reports are flooding in, showing that the average urban turnout is well above the average turnout in the rural areas. Not only will this damage the reputation of the Unión Nacional for this election, but has the ability to be used as a bludgeon against them for the elections yet to come.

That being said, the loudest cheers of all can be heard from their party headquarters on General Martínez Campos Street along with the popping of champagne as the officials who worked so hard to ascertain this victory can now, if briefly, relax.\n\nBoth the party president, Fernández-Miranda, and general secretary, Sá Carneiro, have prepared speeches for this victory and have gathered crowds in Madrid's Plaza Mayor to lay out their plans for Iberia in the coming years.\n\nFernández-Miranda's speech focused on how important these next few years will be in ensuring that Iberian democracy does not backslide back into their authoritarian past and that his determination to make sure of this has only grown stronger due to this historic victory. Some journalists have suggested that the wording of the speech suggests that he intends to resign once this objective is done but there has been no official statement on the matter.\n\nAfter Fernández-Miranda was done, Sá Carneiro took the stage and took a more policy based approach in his speech, calling for three "E's" to be implemented "Establecer, expandir e eliminar": the "establishment of a provincial autonomy system"; "expanding civil rights''; and "eliminating the ghost of the Caudillos that haunt Iberia's political system".

Several journalists have noted Fraga's narcissistic tone throughout the whole speech, seemingly placing himself above the rest of the party and, by extension, the contempt blatant in Amaral's glares at Fraga during his speech, however many of these journalists have been denounced as simply being overly partisan.\n\nAmaral's speech was a lot more humble and focused on the party's goals moving forward, highlighting the necessity of co-operation with the other parties, a respect for cultural differences, and an Iberia with a strong moral framework built upon the social doctrine of Catholicism."

Valcárcel had only stayed at their building for the morning as he planned a rally to be held at the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, to the crowds that had amassed there following the announcement of the Unión Nacional victory.\n\nValcárcel's speech mainly focused on congratulating the Iberian people for beating back the hordes of liberalism and socialism and the moral rot that accompanies them. He went on to affirm that Unión Nacional would ensure that the principles of organic democracy, class collaborationism, and Catholicism would be baked into the new Iberia.\n\nLeo, a young journalist, looked around as he saw the crowds erupt into a chorus of cheers and applause as Valcárcel announced his contempt for democracy. He couldn't help but feel like the only one to pick up on this persistent tone in his speech and the lack of any negative response worried him. Even after the speech ended, he had gone to talk to some of his colleagues who didn't seem to pick up on it.

 IBR.500.d:0 "An interesting phenomena has been reported in the Province of Barcelona. Apparently, several Italian arms shipments have gone missing in the state-owned warehouses near the wharf. Due to the fact that these arms were earmarked for the Federal Army, which is rather shoddily equipped in this sector, getting to the bottom of this supply leak is of utmost importance.\n\nSeveral leads have been noticed, and can be pursued, including access records to the secure area of the warehouses, the guard shifts, and, if worst comes to worst, some worrying accounts of separatist activity in the area. As this is Catalonia, it's very possible that nearly any force could be involved.\n\nAdditionally, due to the lack of damage on the buildings or storage areas, it is very possible that the force causing the arms disappearances has one or more men on the inside. While this is hopefully not the case, it could be best to keep the investigation quiet, in order to make sure that nothing leaks."

 IBR.501.d:0 "Our investigation has turned up a lead, and it isn't pretty. Due to some shoddy workmanship, the AAS was able to locate a hidden trapdoor in the floor of one of our warehouses, leading to an old access tunnel. What was found within the tunnel is greatly concerning.\n\nThere were numerous obvious signs of recent habitation, including used food tins, radios, old rifles, and a neatly dug waste disposal pit. Most concerningly, however, is the conetents of an old uniform coat that was left hanging on a chair. Inside its pockets was an old medallion inscribed with the symbol of the CNT-FAI, an anarchist organization that has been a constant thorn in our side since the days of the Civil War.\n\nIf the CNT-FAI is involved in this manner, it can only mean one thing. They are organizing, and they are organizing for a violent revolution. It is imperative that we get to the bottom of this matter as soon as possible, as the arms shipments themselves are still missing, and only God knows what the terrorists could be doing with them right now."

Background checks also failed to reveal anything of note - the Guardia Civil officers charged with guarding the area are apparently all entirely loyal, with no history of corruption at all.\n\nThe access records were also useless, as there is simply no way for anyone to remove crates of guns and anti-tank munitions without being detected by outside forces. Whatever is going on here is clearly either a legal matter for the local police, or a simple bureaucratic error.\n\nThus, it is best to either kick the issue down to the locals or drop it, and instead focus on preventing anomalous situations like this from happening again, be it through greater security or bureaucratic reform."

Several fireteams have been sent into the city proper, to sweep for insurgent hideouts, and attempt to strike back against the leftist threat proactively.\n\nIn a rousing speech before the main square of the city, Major José Delgadillo reminds his small force, as well as several civilians, of the atrocities committed by the CNT-FAI in the past. Gravely, he held up photographs of bombed churches, dead priests, and desecrated saintly relics.\n\n'Whatever it takes', he says, 'to rid this city of the murderous anarchist scum, is justified in our quest to make Iberia safe and free from this degenerate behavior.'\n\nThe officer wishes his men good hunting, and orders them to apprehend or eliminate any potential threat they run across.

With several officers wounded and one dead, the Guardia Civil cease this operation, and instead regroup in numerous precinct houses scattered throughout downtown Barcelona. Instead of a decisive purge, they will need to go door-to-door and quickly smash any signs of revolt.\n\nCalling in some heavy support from the Spanish Army, the paramilitary forces begin sweeping the city for possible CNT arms caches or meeting places."

As nighttime rains wash the blood and broken glass into the city's gutters, the police continue their raids.\n\nDespite resistance, it seems that they are closing in on the source of the city's woes, and many law-abiding citizens hope that they will be done with their duty by the end of the week."

While they are not necessarily expected to find anything, given the devlishly tricky means that were undoubtably used to sieze the arms shipments, it is possible that the locals could pick up on some sort of subtle tip that the federales were not able to detect.\n\nThe AAS has mostly pulled out of the city, leaving behind only a token force at its regional headquarters, a revamped former union hall.

The official report shall state that the disappearances are likely due to a bureaucratic error, and that reforming the supply systems of the Federal Army is the recommended solution to this issue.\n\nDespite the honest recommendation, it is known almost unanimously that this is unlikely. Logistics is just one more field that the Iberian Federal Army fails at, and it is not likely to change that just because some rifles and rocket launchers decided to go walkabouts.\n\nAt the very least, perhaps, Iberia can console itself that it is saving some money on the investigation."

Taken by surprise, the surviving soldiers only managed to put up a small resistance against the CNT-FAI rebels, and were soon after squashed. Of all of the 140 men in the convoy, none have turned up alive.\n\nDue to this attack, the reinforcements outside of the city have been called in, however, more and more army units are coming into contact with the well armed and prepared rebels.

It was all they could do at this point short of raiding every single building in the city. However, after launching a few more of these raids, it was obvious that they were just falling back into their prior pattern. The breaking point of this operation was a large scale showdown between the Guardia and CNT rebels, resulting in the Guardia having to retreat yet again, with 7 officers injured and 2 dead.

This has, of course, made many people upset, and is only raising tensions even higher.\n\nThe police almost had a lead today, but due to some unforeseen circumstances, with multiple police officers disappearing after following false trails.

Unfortunately, the rest of the city was also swiftly devastated by the might of the Iberian navy, as the nature of our ships' guns made any sort of accuracy infeasible. Thus, the hail of shells ravaged civilian buildings and leftist fortifications with equal fury. Total casualties have been estimated to be nearly 4,000, with many civilians included, but this number may prove significantly higher as more bodies are discovered.\n\nNational and international observers alike have watched with shock at the events which have unfolded, and many have likened the response to the brutal suppression of insurgents in the Paris Commune by French pro-monarchy forces nearly a century ago, even going so far as to refer to the city as the "Barcelona Commune."\n\nLuckily, the barbaric leftists have been crushed before their vile ideology can gain any more influence, but the cost to the Union in healing the city may be too much to handle."

Mechanized infantry that followed their advance, swarmed the buildings, clearing them out one by one, of any pesky rebels.\n\nGunfire can still be heard, as the last pockets are cleared out within the myriad of apartments, where each fight is sure to be brutal and often hand to hand, but our soldiers have proven once more their capability to destroy the enemy, independently of the harshness of the fight ahead.\n\nOverall, our units have suffered some 450 casualties, along with 30 downed tanks, while the enemies' losses are estimated to be between 1000 to 3500.\n\nThe Iberian flag waves once more on top of the Casa de la Ciutat."

Advances by our tanks were constantly halted by enemy artillery fire and makeshift bombs, forcing us to call for more and more reserves.\n\nBy morning the next day, we had managed to secure the city, after a fashion. The streets are littered with bodies and destroyed vehicles, and the iconic view of Barcelona has been overtaken by a smoldering ruin. CNT cells within have been eliminated, but the level of destruction needed to retake the city will not make for good optics for either the general population or the government.\n\nAs belligured soldiers fly the Iberian flag above the city once again, some of them wonder if it was truly worth it."

The process of checking individual buildings has been slow, and few readily cooperate with the investigators.

This, in turn, has led to the CNT becoming bolder and more active in recruitment, something which terrifies Madrid and the leaders of the Guardia Civil.\n\nToday, the CNT-FAI has made their move. By targeting our soldiers, officers, and administrative buildings with improvised explosives and leaving few survivors, they have made their intentions clear. It is now evident to all that the rebels are not simply agitators or a boogeyman, they are instead a genuine threat to Spain and now seek to completely take control of Barcelona.

We have a few options on how to deal with this, such as performing an old-fashioned siege with artillery, or bombarding the city from the sea.\n\nThe other solution, one which is likely to succeed but will ultimately be detrimental to the city, is to mobilize our tanks and take the city by force, without letting them prepare for a siege.

They have so far been successful in their attempts to arrest rebel leaders and prominent figures throughout the CNT-FAI, and have also began the slow process of searching buildings, from the industrial districts to the neighborhoods.\n\nWith the violence quelled and the searches underway, many in Madrid understand that Barcelona is securely in our grasp, and that the potential crisis has been dealt with.\n\nAlready, efforts are underway to analyze the situation and find out how these events occured and how to potentially avoid future uprisings."

Seperatist and extremist terrorist groups such as the CNT, ETA, the FSLP and the BTA have been allowed to fester and grow like tumours, accumulating resources, support, and weapons while we turned a blind eye.\n\nSince the Battle ended, countless reports have reached the capital from all the provinces about suspicious activities. If we don't do something, what will be next? The ETA seizing Bilbao? Terrorists targeting cabinet members? Madrid falling to socialists?

Furthermore, very little of the finished product remained, destroyed or otherwise, leading one to conclude that it was taken en masse.\n\nThe political effect of this destruction was disastrous. With new ammunition and supplies at least one terrorist group has been freshly equipped, and they most likely have shared it with fellow separatists. What's worse is the perception of the government.

In order to finally beat back the CNT forces the army had to be called in to restore order to part of the city. Even though their presence has been beaten back, some hold-outs still remain to be flushed out.\n\nAs was simply part of the fighting protocol, beating back the separatists took a large amount of time and was very costly in collateral damage. No favors have been earned with the population of the city, who resent the naturally unpleasant counter-terrorist tactics.

 IBR.589.d:0 "The governor of Navarre has been found dead. A restaurant in Pamplona was the victim of a bombing, rendering many dead. Equally gruesome was that this was on the same day that a party had reserved an area of the facility, leaving one to wonder what purpose such a cruel act could serve. It was only once the damage had been surveyed that the reasoning for the bombing became clear - the governor was there. Presumably, they were eating with some political officials when a bomb was detonated near them, killing them all. From the damage to the building, it was high-yield.\n\nA great loss has occurred with the governor's death, as the man was very politically skilled and was capable of efficiently stopping terrorism. With his political cadre dead with him, nobody remains to continue his policies. Effectively deadlocked, the void has allowed the ETA to blossom, allowing them a better opportunity to commit attacks in the region."

 IBR.590.d:0 "Railway networks all around Iberia have reported outages for an indeterminate amount of time. Terrorist groups have attacked the rails, destroying them with bombs and in some incidents even raiding the trains themselves. It seems to have been done entirely by stealth, as the groups responsible left little to no trace of themselves. The most horrific thing to come of these bombings is an entire train being derailed, unable to stop itself in time due to a miscommunication.\n\nCasualties, thankfully, are mostly few. The targets did not seem to be civilians. Rather, major good transport networks have been destroyed. Without these, it is much harder to supply various forces around Iberia, especially counter terrorist groups. Because they don't have the supplies to fight back as effectively, terrorist movements have grown in number and strength. It will take time to undo this, critical hours in which differences have been lost."

 IBR.565.t:0 "Threatening Graffiti in Gijon"
 IBR.565.d:0 "A government building in Gijon was defaced earlier this morning by a large amount of provocative graffiti. While at first believed to be the work of local hoodlums and troublemakers, it became clear from the content and professional quality that it is the work of none other than the BTA, an underground Asturian liberation group. In addition to slogans and vague threats written in their language, a large portion of the graffiti seems to have been dedicated to drawing some kind of mascot. Due to the presence of three wings, multiple sets of legs, a "very spooky looking eyeball", and clashing colors, it appears the group who painted this was in heavy disagreement over what their mascot should be.\n\nWhile these communist vagrants have been causing trouble in the Asturias region for some time now, they have never been so upfront about their cause. Guardia Civil units are already on the case and arresting suspicious persons, but it is clear now that the BTA is no longer in hiding, and may be planning more mischief in the future."

Seven factories, all of which are involved in the production of munitions, were found this morning in varying states of disrepair, victims of overnight sabotage. The assembly lines have been intricately tampered with, and it may take weeks before they are fully operational again.\n\nAll signs point to the involvement of the BTA, including the literal sign that came in the form of more telltale graffiti, again featuring a mangled "mascot" that now seems to resemble "a hippogriff with a stick up its ass", according to one eye-witness. Guardia Civil and anti-separatist forces are on the case, sweeping the city for dissidents, but our industry has taken a hit."

Within seconds, the entire city's automated capabilities completely shut off, leaving hundreds of thousands without power.\n\nLocal anti-separatist squads, acting on a hunch, traced the problem to a nearby power plant. Sure enough, the power plant was discovered to be in ruins, the victim of what seemed to be multiple bomb blasts. Choice graffiti once again points to the BTA as the instigators, with investigators noting that they seem to have "given up halfway" trying to make a mascot this time around.\n\nThe damage has been done, however, and if we dont act fast people may very well die due to lack of vital services and protection from the elements. Security forces are at this point too busy providing aid for people in need to search the city, but promise they will root out these bandits as soon as possible."

That the BTA is responsible for this is fairly obvious, due to their already heavily anti-police rhetoric that comes from being commies. Graffiti found near the scene of the crime confirms their involvement, which do not in any way involve using blood as paint, despite certain rumors.\n\nWhile police scramble to capture the ringleaders, a sinister feeling hangs in the air. This sudden swing in violence, coupled with the lack of any attempt at a mascot in the graffiti, signifies a darker turn for the BTA. They may have once been considered a joke to some, but they're beginning to make things clear that they are a force to be reckoned with."

 IBR.569.d:0 "The sleepy town of Langreo is shaken to the core, following the latest actions of the Asturian communists. Starting out as an attempted bank robbery by a group of BTA thugs, Guardia Civil units arriving on the scene quickly caused the situation to escalate. A few tense words, some warning shots...and then utter pandemonia.\n\nBy the time the shootout was over, it had claimed the lives of 10 police officers and 17 civilians caught in the crossfire. While the communists were all killed in the confrontation, the lack of any captives to bring back for interrogation means that our counterterrorist units have no further leads. It is feared that the situation will only escalate even further until the Asturias region either gains independence or the terrorist cell is wiped out."

 IBR.570.t:0 "Bomb Attack In Cordoba!"
 IBR.570.d:0 "Asturian insurgents have run rampant in their region, but so far none of them have been so bold as to launch attacks in other parts of the country. This changed with today's incident. Several key government buildings in Cordoba were leveled today as a result of carefully planted explosives, which somehow went entirely undetected. Casualties, which include government workers and civilians, are believed to be in the dozens, with the number of injured at least three times as high as rescue workers continue to pull people and bodies from the smoldering wreckage.\n\nIn addition to showcasing some woeful incompetence on the part of local police for somehow failing a spot check this badly, the incident also sent the Iberian government into a state of panic, as they had almost no clue who carried out this attack or why. Cordoba wasn't a separatist zone, nor was it a hotbed of extremist activity, that is unless they've seriously been overlooking the city's affairs, which was unlikely.\n\nIt was not until a transmission came through on state tv that the anti-separatist division would figure out who was responsible. At 3:15, a regular state news broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a new signal, showcasing the blurry image of a man sitting in a basement, his face concealed by a ski mask. Claiming that these attacks were carried out on the behalf of the BTA, the mysterious man suddenly began shouting angrily, launching into what can only be described as a lunatic tirade against "the ruling class" and "forces of reaction", coupled with some very violent and explicit threats against the government.\n\nTransmission was cut off after less than five minutes, but the entire nation is stunned. The simple fact that a separatist group was able to launch a coordinated attack, let alone one of this magnitude, outside of their home region is proof that they are far more widespread than previously thought. If this continues to go unchecked, we may very well have an organized uprising in the Asturias region."

When the second was found dead and the third checked into a hospital, something was found to be wrong. Once the death toll had reached four, an investigation was ordered. The victims, all deeply involved in politics - each one was very capable and held significant influence in the Iberian government. Even worse, the victims were all nearly incorruptible, leaving a significant hole in the operation of the Union. Upon further investigation, they were found to have all been sent mail shortly before the estimated time of death. More than ten others were found to have checked into hospitals with similar conditions.\n\nWith careful scrutiny it was found that the letters in question contained various forms of anthrax. Though the letters have subsided (apart from a handful of false alarms) the perpetrator is still at large, but they are suspected to have been a member of a currently undetermined terrorist organization. The loss in good politicians was certainly felt, and without them the Union is running far worse than it was before. "

This car crash escalated further when several more vehicles to collide, creating a large multi-vehicular incident from which at most fifty people are dead. The governor of the area was driving along the road, and it appears the only reason he was not caught in the blast was because of a delay earlier on in the day. His vehicle was already close enough to the scene to be damaged, and it is mere fortune that the man is not dead.\n\nThe whole incident has the man shaken up very badly, and his fear of another attack appears to have gotten to him. He has secluded himself from public life for the time being, because of which productivity has declined. Until he has mentally recovered from his near-death experience the Madrid region will have lost their governor, though a less skilled substitute is serving in their place temporarily."

It was only by fortune that it was able to be stopped before it became uncontrollable. It does not appear that there were many casualties, with the main target of the attack being the building and the contents within. The guilty party left nearly no trace of their presence, and the culprit cannot be found with the small amount of evidence present to work from.\n\nWhy anyone would think to destroy such a piece of history is unknown. There is no justification for targeting it, and the whole nation mourns for what could have been a very great loss. It has been a major public relations defeat, with an inability to protect even historical monuments becoming a favorite propaganda point for separatist organizations."

During lunch hour, one of the formen reportedly heard a "nasty metallic scratching sound" from within the factory, leading him to believe that something had malfunctioned very badly. Sure enough, as workers returned, they found that the entire assembly line had been frozen.\n\nIt took well over two hours for a repair crew to fix the damage, seemingly caused by the simple act of throwing a hammer into the gears of one of the machines. Many in the Guardia Civil suspect that this was yet another in a series of attacks on Portuguese industry by the notorious FSLP. Already, police and military auxiliaries have begun combing the city for any potential dissidents, which will hopefully put an end to this mischief."

The Guardia Civil has acted quickly and arrests have been made, but the ringleaders remain elusive as usual, and it is clear from recent statements that the terrorists only plan to continue hindering our nation in whatever way they can."

Within hours of the attack, a spokesperson from the FSLP, speaking in a distorted voice over the radio, took credit for this act of terrorism.

According to witness reports the terrorists were approximately equally armed, and combined this with great fervor to frightening effect.\n\nThe group was eventually fought off, and fled after enough of their number had fallen. Lisbon itself is shaken, a sense of security shattered by the recent attack. The guards have turned more brutal than before, cracking down on various functions quicker out of a fear of such a thing happening again.

 IBR.576.d:0 "Confusion and panic are ubiquitous in the city of Lisbon today, in the aftermath of yet another terrorist attack by the FSLP.\n\nIn a rather unprecedented move, the wee hours of the morning were heralded by multiple high intensity explosions, most of which appear to have been targeted at industrial centers. A few bombs, however, were set inside an apartment complex, leveling it almost entirely and killing over one hundred people. The damage to the factories, meanwhile, is considerable, and any production in Lisbon has been effectively neutered as a result of the attacks.\n\nThe FSLP wasted no time in proclaiming responsibility for the attack, claiming that the civilian deaths were "a necessary motivator to the general public to support our cause". It seems that they regard even their fellow Portuguese citizens as poorly as they do the "Iberian occupiers", if they remain indifferent to their radical cause. Unconfirmed reports have it that membership is increasing simply due to fear of being targeted next, and with ordinary civilians in their numbers they will be increasingly capable of sabotage and terrorism."

 IBR.577.d:0 "Lisbon, in addition to being the capital city of Portugal, is also the location of the main broadcasting center for the Portuguese language version of state controlled news. Unlike the headquarters in Madrid, where the news was broadcast in Castilian Spanish and the newsrooms filled with shouting and commotion, the Lisbon headquarters tended to be on the calmer side.\n\nAt least, until today...\n\nNobody is quite sure how they managed to pull it off. Some claim that they were undercover agents working for the state news for months waiting for the right time, others claim that they were recent converts to the cause, while the official Madrid line is that the terrorists impersonated low level janitors and secretaries to infiltrate the building. Whatever the case, the building was overwhelmed with the sounds of gunfire and terrified shrieks around 8 am, punctuated by the occasional splat and sickening thud.\n\nIberia, and indeed soon the world, would become very much aware as the FSLP terrorists who had taken control of the building used their position to broadcast live on state television, for millions to see. There, in a room littered with corpses and the miserable hunched over forms of terrified employees, a masked spokesperson for the terrorists delivered what was in effect their manifesto. There were no bombastic nationalistic proclamations, nor was there any harshness to his tone; the masked man delivered their grievances to a live audience with a surprising lack of emotion, even as the demands turned into direct threats on innocent lives. At some point about fifteen minutes in, the masked man and his cohorts decided that they had said all that they needed to, and in one last show of brutality executed all remaining employees on camera with a bullet to the head.\n\nBy the time anti-separatist forces arrived the terrorists had managed to make a clean getaway, leaving behind a newsroom in disarray and piles upon piles of corpses. If their manifesto is any indication, the FSLP does not plan on slowing up on these heinous acts until their demands for a free Portugal are fully met."

At an initial examination, there was no correlation between the victims other than being in public and not secure. However, a later look into the case revealed that the victims all shared two common factors - they were in the Iberian administration, and they were all Spanish. As this follows the modus operandi of a Portuguese separatist group, it is safe to assume they were the party at fault.\n\nEven though the culprits are narrowed down and justice is inevitable, the damage they dealt is unavoidable. Many Spanish officials are afraid that they'll be next, and between fearing for their lives and doing their jobs little is being done. The blow to the governmental efficiency is severe, and has greatly diminished productivity."

 IBR.593.d:0 "There has been a regional blackout in the services of the Axencia in northern Portugal. Taking the men entirely by surprise, a terrorist group struck directly at the regional headquarters, using firearms far more powerful than intelligence had suggested. Not only did they have such high-grade weaponry, but they were capable of hiding their firepower from the watching eye of the Axencia, too. Understandably, the agents present were not prepared for a separatist group to strike the anti-separatist forces at their own base of operations. The complex was designed around such an eventuality, and with these pre-built fortifications the separatist defeat was inevitable. They didn't let this stop them, though - the fight they put up was reportedly fierce, with only two or three terrorists not fighting to the death.\n\nIt would be fine if this didn't turn out to be a diversion. An unknown agent allowed a group of separatists access to the facilities, and they made off with records, weaponry, and intelligence. As undercover agents are smothered out and depots raided with the newfound data on them, the Axencia has been busy finding their leaking part. The upper half of Portugal will remain vulnerable until an audit is completed, the loose thread is cut, and new connections are established."

According to the reports of security guards on-scene, a disturbance was responded to, which turned out to be little more than a large distraction. A struggle had begun in the building they were guarding, which had been infiltrated while a diversion was occurring. Their arrival was too late, as the insurgents had defeated the guards and shockingly massacred the staff. When they were intercepted they were in the process of starting a fire on a pile of documents. Even though the terrorists were defeated once their presence had been identified, the guards lacked the means to put out the fire they had started. When it was put out it had burnt through much of the present paperwork.\n\nThe damage goes without saying. Even though much of the lost documentation can be restored in time, it is time exactly that cannot be spared. Since it was a large amount, it will take a large sum of time to replace it all. The time spent replacing papers is time that cannot be spent fighting off terrorists, and they have taken gleeful notice of the fact."

Their martial capabilities almost matched those of the AAS, and it was only with military assistance that the terrorists were defeated in open battle. But for all their ferocity, they lacked the manpower and popular organic support to withstand our relentless assaults.\n\nThough our victory is cause for celebration, there are many questions that remain unanswered; primarily, the question of their material support.

Even during autarky, the effects of which were lessened by their self-sufficient nature, the farmers were pampered and had little reason to support other groups - this continues to today, where they are a secure opposition voting bloc.\n\nThe farmers do not support us, and perhaps this is not entirely unwarranted. We are perceived as an elitist group, the dreadful sort which exclusively supports urban areas (as opposed to the dreadful sort that pandered to rurals before us), and as painful as it is to admit, we are in many ways overly favoring our voting bloc, the urban areas. Even though the way to fix this is fairly obvious, the party is split between three opposing factions on this matter, each supporting a different resolution.\n\nThe first and second groups both wish to effectively buy over the farmers using benefits dedicated to them, though they diverge in what benefits specifically to give. The first wishes to use farming equipment, increasing the effectiveness of the farmers and intending to use that favor to acquire supporters. The second wishes to use less direct means, using subsidies to show that we have not forgotten them. The third, and final, faction does not want to do anything. They argue the farmers are a lost cause, and attempts to buy them would be pointless waste.\n\nWhich idea will the leadership favor?"

 #Meet With The Axencia
 IBR.611.t:0 "Meeting With The Axencia Anti-Separatista"
 IBR.611.d:0 "There is absolutely no justification for the Axencia Anti-Separatista. The bastard child of Franco's obsession with unity, and the resources to enact it, the agency best exemplifies the evils of the Caudillos. Created with an overwhelming sense of authoritarianism, the Axencia has been used not only to stop separatism but effectively act as a paramilitary in some cases - creating some of the worst incidents to come to Iberia.\n\nThis is no reason to create an enemy out of them. As horrible as working with them is, it is a necessary evil until the time comes where they may be defanged.\n\nFrancisco Balsemao will be sent to meet with the higher echelons of the Axencia. His diplomatic skill, hopefully, will prove a valuable asset in the coming meetings. If he is able to convince the Axencia heads that the country is safe in our hands, then we may find them far less obstructive to our aims."
 IBR.611.a:0 "Let's hope this will calm things down"
 
 IBR.5850.t:0 "The Dance of Words"
 IBR.5850.d:0 ""Would you like a cigarette?" Balsemao asked. "Someone seems to have left a pack here." What he didn't mention was that someone had "left it" intentionally, of course.\n\nThe man - about Balsemao's age - regarded the pack for a moment, then shrugged his shoulders. "Of course. Do you have a lighter?" He was handed a lighter, and a cigarette, and took a few moments to cherish a puff. Then he began to speak again. "Now, let us begin our meeting. I am sure you can understand me through a smoke..."\n\nThe man proved to be an eloquent speaker, and the dance of words between two men who made the act an art was a sight to behold. The men spoke for around an hour, around which the meeting concluded and both went their separate ways.\n\nHe was sold. Pleased with our moderation, the official was more than willing to put in a good word in the Axencia, for they greatly appreciated our commitment to ensuring the state evolved at a controlled pace. This is a great surprise - they surely know our end goal with them - but it isn't a matter to complain about."
 IBR.5850.a:0 "Friendship is a beautiful thing."
 
 IBR.5851.t:0 "To Stop A Dance"
 IBR.5851.d:0 ""Would you like a cigarette?" Balsemao asked. "Someone left a pack here." What he didn't mention was that the someone was an aide of his.\n\nThe middle-aged man on the other side of the table, with more Axencia ranks than hair, looked at the man offering him cigarettes. "I'll pass. Smoking in the conference room is poor manners."\n\n"As you say," Francisco responded. "Let's get started with the meeting, if you are ready...?"\n\nThe man was very blunt. He spoke honestly, but he spared nothing for politeness. It was almost respectable, his commitment to curt conversation. He informed Balsemao, in no uncertain terms, that the Axencia was concerned. They were concerned with the progression of the state.\n\n"It would grow out of control, and swallow the country in bureaucracy and waste," the man argued. Even more so, they were scared for their own future. "Is it unreasonable to want to protect your livelihood?" Yet.. this meeting was a promising sign. That the government would meet in good faith was very valuable to the man meeting, and he would push the others to give the Unión Republicana a chance, if nothing else."

 IBR.613.d:0 "It is stupidity to think that the Francoists - or their collaborators - would just lie down and fade to irrelevance. They are still very much alive and kicking, and one of the places they show themselves the worst is one of the most fundamental parts of our budding democracy. The elections have been tampered with. The Francoists have used their influence to attempt to stilt the results in their favor, and they came far too close to succeeding.\n\nWe don't know where they have sunk their claws in. If the Congress is to stay how it must, then we need to find their roots as soon as possible.\n\nWe will not have an easy time, and if we cannot keep sufficient political capital, then we have no chance of finding them. In order to succeed, we must make sure we have everything we need to make sure cooperation is at a maximum, regardless of the stakes."

Despite the fact that there are many promising leads, each one has been stonewalled by interference that falls just short of eligible for legal action. Because of all of it, several undoubtedly involved individuals have made very persuasive arguments to stop the investigation.\n\nGiving up will without a doubt stop our efforts here. What's shocking is that this may not even be the worst possible occurrence. We could always just continue on with the investigation, trying even harder to reach the evidence that is surely just out of our grasp, but this would make us dangerous enemies. Were we to bend the rules to keep investigating, the military would view us with far greater suspicion than before, for it sets the precedent for them too. Is evidence of fraud worth what the way there would unleash?"

We should've seen it coming - it was the exact same as before, of course it would be blocked the same as previously. Regardless, there is no undoing it now. We are at our status quo, with one important change.\n\nThe investigation has infuriated the military. By bending the rules, the general staff is concerned that the rules might be bent to go after them, too. Their anger could have been avoided if there was something to justify it all, but without that they are far more inclined to turn their guns on us."

Even though their collaborators have tried their hardest to stop the investigation before it could uproot the truth, that same truth is now standing before us. It will no doubt be a great blow to their legacy when we release the proof of their deeds to the public.\n\nEven better than that, the intuition shown in the investigation has cowed the military. They are afraid of it being shown on them, sufficiently so that they will likely not attempt anything similar in the near future."

 IBR.614.t:0 "The Problematic Municipalities"
 IBR.614.d:0 "Even though Franco seemed obsessed with the removal of autonomy, he had no issue with looking the other way when his loyal supporters decided to follow their own designs. So long as they followed the instructions he gave them, he allowed some to run about as if they were petty kings, treating their municipalities like feudal fiefdoms. If we have any say on the matter - which we do - that will end today.\n\nAs is the case with every political matter in this country, there is a wealth of options before us on how to handle the municipalities. If we make a show of dealing with these petty tyrants, it may earn us political points with those under their thumbs. If we were to take a lighter hand and attempt to reconcile, we may be able to curb the worst of their excesses while making friends across Iberia. Which would be more effective?"

Still not finished with their prior corrupt dealings, these Francoists without a doubt exercise their power to continue lining their pockets.\n\nWe can't move against any of them under normal circumstances, but there is a silver lining. If any of these hardliners are convicted of a crime, then they will lose their special privileges. They have, for certain, committed crimes in their careers. By investigating the ringleaders, we could eliminate them for their misdeeds, stop their abuses of power, and cow the lesser agents into submission."

Through bribery, bureaucratic maneuvering, and plain coercion, we have been unable to reach beyond the obstruction to grasp our evidence. We cannot try the Francoists for their crimes.\n\nWhat's worse, this flop has been a serious blow to our credibility. Between the last fraud investigation, and this corruption investigation, we have gained the reputation of jumping at shadows. "

The privileged hardliners among the Francoists are guilty of corruption, and beyond that it happens that they have done so much more. We know who has done what, and that the what is damning - there is no way they could worm out of it now. Our prior actions in investigating fraud had created an optimal foundation for this search, and the experience to avoid brick walls.\n\nThe worst offenders were quickly indicted for corruption, and the trial will surely be short and decisive.

"Name and business, please."\n\nSuarez replied, "Adolfo Suarez, here to inspect the building." The guard nodded and stepped aside, letting him enter the building.\n\nThe building was no less secure on the inside. Though they had been tastefully fit into the design, the hallways had been visibly braced and reinforced. The doors into the main chamber had been replaced with much more secure iron doors. He was stopped by two more guards, checked for his business, and then was inside the chamber. Looking behind him, the doors had been given an emergency bar to use if someone tried to break in. There were several emergency phone lines around the room, for clear purposes. There was only one last place to check - the armory.\n\nSuarez beheld a room of firearms, some already missing from their slots. This was part of the contingency plan, where the House would mobilize a large number of guards. It would be against the military, if it came to it; separatists wouldn't dare attack a building like this. In any case, Suarez personally approved the redesign of the building.

 IBR.618.t:0 "Legalizing The Left Opposition"
 IBR.618.d:0 "Many democracies, in their founding, have had to make several uncomfortable compromises and promises, in order to do what they needed to do. We have had to make plenty of those promises, too. During the reign of Franco, many left-wing parties were banned for one reason or another, but in truth they were all banned for being leftist. One of our promises was to unban these leftist groups, securing their support in creating a new Iberia. Now that we are in power, they expect us to make good on our promises and unban them.\n\nIt would be very easy - just a few strokes of a pen - to do so, but the political ramifications would be severe. If we let the Communists into the government, then it could send the military into a panic. Usually, making the one with a gun panic is a bad idea.. But we might need the support we would keep from the action."

 IBR.805.t:0 "General Strike in Barcelona" 
 IBR.805.d:0 "Keeping leftist parties banned has managed to cause an uproar in some cities. Several groups - including the CNT-FAI - have called for a general strike in Barcelona, and their popularity has left the city paralyzed until we unban their presence. Of course, they may just peter out if we don't address them.\n\nIf we were to walk back on our commitment to keeping them banned, it would be a catastrophic loss of face. We would not only be promise-breakers, but seen as spineless as well. We could not entirely unban them safely. There could be a compromise, however. If we were to unban the less-revolutionary groups. We could keep the military's displeasure at a minimum, and repair some of the bridges we just burned."

 #Audit The Prisons
 IBR.619.t:0 "Investigating Political Imprisonments"
 IBR.619.d:0 "Franco gave his loyal supporters a lot of leeway. It so happens, to everyone's misfortune, prisons were some of Franco's most loyal bastions. It's hard to tell if the previous regime even tried to monitor what happened in those prisons, as abuses and violations of rights were so common that it created a reputation for brutality. Franco would simply throw a dissident into the prison and let them die - which was far from an impossible occurrence. We cannot let people be incarcerated in such conditions anymore.\n\nThe best way to lessen the issue immediately is to remove the people committing these atrocities. There are many problematic guards, used to not facing consequences for their actions, as well as those who are so adept at torture that they are better called torturers. If we arrested them all, then we could stop many abuses that could happen. However, we may upset the military by being indiscriminate, which could be dangerous. To that end, we could easily justify only arresting the most heinous offenders."

 IBR.620.d:0 "Tarrafal. A prison designed to hold the most troublesome of dissidents. A prison designed to break their spirits by any means necessary, a grinder of souls. It was made to be inescapable, situated on the island of Cabo Verde, far away from the Iberian mainland. In an ideal world, we could just tear the prison down and put up a monument to the people it has killed. Since it is far from an ideal world, some tact will be required.\n\nThe commander of the prison was largely left to his own devices by Franco, and attempting to chafe on that autonomy may anger him. Since he is in a fortified location, out at sea, with plenty of provisions, his anger would be an incredible blow to an already unpopular decision - for Franco made sure to intertwine his brutality with Iberian pride. With the right pressure, the commander could be pushed to ending the worst of his excesses, which would still be a victory, if admittedly a minor one."
 IBR.620.a:0 "I want that camp gone, now!"

 IBR.806.t:0 "Tarrafal Camp Commandant Refuses To Stand Down!"
 IBR.806.d:0 "The worst has come to pass! The camp commander, angered by our decision, has refused our directives! He has stated that he will "not allow the end of justice in Iberia", and opted to instead make his stand by beginning to hole up within Tarrafal. Negotiations are pointless, as he has mentioned that he will not negotiate, only allowing access to the prison again if he totally achieves his way.\n\nA siege on Tarrafal, of all places, would be political suicide. There must not be a siege, so there are only two options to end this charade: A surgical strike, and the unthinkable. A squad of soldiers may be able to apprehend the commander before he can fortify, sending the pyramid tumbling down. However, if they fail, then the consequences will be truly severe. Otherwise, we would need to concede to the man. It would be a horrible loss of face, but better than what a failure would do."

Tarrafal is being wiped away currently, and its prisoners have been released or transferred accordingly. With the monster itself gone, all that remains is the man behind the slaughter.\n\nThe warden was the man responsible for the state of Tarrafal, creating the system which allowed it to grow as it did. In spite of his evils, there are some in the government who wish for him to be granted a pardon for his deeds - as if running a death camp was a deed.

If we intentionally probe lightly with the investigation, it could open up negotiations and help ease relations - provided they trust us still.\n\nWe must be decisive, remain committed to our choice, and remember that we will not get a second chance at this.

Do you have a list, or should we take it from the top?"\n\nHaving brought in a receptive bunch, Balsemao was pleased to learn that the military, too, was relieved by the prospect of talking things over.

Having been under the tight leash of a regime - two, arguably - which sought to eliminate all political opposition, nearly every echelon of society is staffed with despots, lackeys, and yes men seeking to maintain their power no matter what. For a party like ours, who wishes to move beyond this dark era, these men are often dangerous and unwavering enemies. To throw away help in a situation like this is to prepare our noose.\n\nOur help is, to put it diplomatically, whoever we can find. There are still many moderates in Iberian politicians. Whether they are veterans who have cooled over the years or young dissidents, it does not matter. If we can secure these connections, then defeating the Francoists will be much simpler."

 IBR.5854.d:0 "To assume that a moderate would be inclined to support us is a mistake.

Even though they want to move on from Franco, they wish to do so in a less radical way than ours. We have learned from insider information that many of these veterans are skeptical of our policies, opposing its implementation for one reason or another.\n\nAre they still worth trying to court? If we were to make concessions, there are fair odds they would go along with the show of cooperation. This asks another question, though: How much is their support worth?

The charade probably would have continued indefinitely until someone decided enough was enough. All these dealings were leaked to the media.\n\nSwooping in like birds of prey, the media outlets exposed our dealings to the rest of the country, and more importantly towards those we tried to reach.

With due note to their collective opportunism - if we were not elected they would not give us the time of day - it was very easy to create an effective and comprehensive political alliance. It is certainly a great step up for our power, but should we really show it?\n\nWe could announce our new alliance publicly, as a way of showing the military that we are not to be trifled with.

Impossible to satisfy with nothing short of the death of democracy, they have been a consistent thorn in our side ever since we were elected. Recently, we received a tip from a loyal element of the military that these officers were planning the unthinkable. They were going to destroy democracy themselves, annihilating our government in a military coup.\n\nWhat should we do? Even though it might be a prank, we can't leave an allegation like this standing. How would it look if it were a genuine attempt, allowed to happen by complacency? Something needs to be done. We could start an investigation into the matter, take steps to secure the Deputies, or perhaps even re-assign the probable culprits somewhere where they wouldn't be a threat. Anything would be better than nothing."

"It doesn't matter! It only takes one gun to put any of you down like dogs!" He waved his gun at the deputies, wildly gesturing at no-one in specific.\n\nHe was tackled from behind, only half turned around from footsteps to behold the garb of someone he didn't expect - an Axencia operator.\n\n"You, and your comrades in arms, are all under arrest for anti-Iberian activity." said the operator, locking the man in handcuffs and escorting him out of the building.

Realizing what was happening, one of the guards within the chamber set the door bar down, drawing his weapon and waiting.\n\nThe door was bashed quite severely, and may have even given in had it not been interrupted by gunshots from beyond it. Whoever was beyond the door, they had been caught in an engagement with the House guards. Since both the gunshots and the bangs had stopped, it was reasonable to assume the guards had won. Shortly after, the all-clear was given.\n\nWith only four guardsmen dead, the coup perpetrators had been slaughtered. Among the dead were none of important stature - merely a handful of soldiers. In any case, they came frighteningly close to success. The soldiers were only stopped at the last minute by the careful fortifications leading into the Chamber."

There seemed to be many more than usual. "What's happening?" asked the man.\n\n"We were deployed here to stop an incident." responded a soldier, though his ranking indicated he was a commander of some sort.

"You are all under arrest! You have committed unforgivable acts of treason against the Iberian state! You will stay where you are until you are told otherwise!" He gazed upon the assembled deputies, until he saw that several seats were empty. If the officer was angry before, it didn't hold a candle to his current feelings. "Some are missing!" He turned to a handful of soldiers. "Find them!"\n\nThe missing councilmen had been in other areas of the building as the coup happened, and were mostly able to slip away as the chamber was stormed.

Shown with soldiers and tanks marching through the city, most were cowed.\n\nSome were enraged.\n\nWe have been contacted by leaders and organizers of several leftist organizations, ranging from parties to unions, and they have jointly asked us a question. Recognizing the extraordinary circumstances, and not wishing to repeat the events of 1936, it has been asked of us if they would be prosecuted for following "irregular" means of assisting us. If we let them, it may give us the edge we need to beat the traitors back, but it might give them some uncomfortable leverage after the fact. How badly do we need them?"

He pointed towards one of the buildings, where a handful of still-uniformed workers were aiming guns out of a freshly broken display window.\n\nTwo more soldiers were shot dead, this time from behind. Firmly shaken, the commander ordered an immediate retreat. They were ran off to the sounds of chanted slogans and jeers, as it seemed like the entire street had turned against them.\n\nSimilar scenes were present all across the city, as left-wing militias stood up in solidarity with the government against the military.

With only two wounded, the idea of a hero's welcome re-entered the heads of the soldiers.

If we can stop the traitors here, then we might yet avoid a repeat of the tragedy of 1936.\n\nAs it is looking, we are definitely not doomed. The mutineers have managed to take a small amount of the city, but we maintain a very strong position. They have failed to capture any major institutions.

So far, they are succeeding.\n\nThe military has seized control of a significant amount of the city and possess several important institutions, including the House of Deputies.

Even worse, their presence has inspired many angry conservative-minded elements, who have risen up in even larger numbers to counter the socialists. With their meddling, the work of the socialists is undone and even further beyond - by including them, we have lost even more than we have gained.\n\nUnless we can secure an act of divine intervention, the military will continue to seize important areas of Madrid, and bring down Iberian democracy with the city."

He shot them a quick salute, then waved them through.\n\n"All I see here is a patriotic Iberian citizen." said the guard, his voice low but quick. "Isn't that right, Hernandez?"

The only uncertain part is how they will be sentenced.\n\nThrough political maneuvering, we have great influence in the punishment the officer cabal will receive. Normally, an act of this magnitude would be punished with death. However, if we wanted to use this opportunity to reconcile with the remaining military elements, then "just" a life sentence will serve to show that we can still forgive."

In the middle of the parade was the former government, broken men still in their suits, displayed as if they were wild animals in a zoo.\n\nThe old government was led through the city, in full display of the crowds gathered upon the sidewalks of the streets, to the former House of Deputies. There, under the gaze of the Francoist flag, many of the politicians were lined up, including Fernández-Miranda, Balsemao, Suarez - who had to be tied down from how hard he kicked and fought - and Carneiro.\n\n"You are lucky not to be crucified!" screamed the officer in front.\n\n"Ready!"\n\n"Aim!"\n\nWith only one more word, the dream of a democratic Iberia died."

Their credibility has evaporated, and they will not be able to muster anything like this again.\n\nThere is still the status of the traitors to consider. They did not surrender with the rest of their troops, and still desire to return to menace us. We must deal with them, as only their capture can totally put this treason to rest.

Unfortunately, our military being what it is, most of them have deserted us to join the fascists. It is a fact of human history that some things never change, and it looks like the old Spanish habits will die hard.

 IBR.5400.d:0 "It has become obvious to the government, given the oil crisis afflicting the nation, that it is imperative that an oil rationing system needs to be put in place following our inability to import enough oil for the excessive demand. While there have been prominent voices within the opposition detailing their problems with an oil rationing system and how it might affect the ability of firms to manufacture goods that require oil, the government intends to press on, in order to make sure everyone has at least some oil and oil based products for their day to day lives.\n\nWhat the government has not decided on, is how strict this rationing should be. The first proposal has been a very harsh rationing system to thoroughly ensure that the country does not run out what little oil it has left in its reserves. However, some members of the cabinet have stated their hesitation with the measure warning that it is too strict and could cause the government's approval to tank considering the central oil has in both people's daily lives and the economy as a whole."

It is for this reason, that the government has seen fit to raise interest rates in order to curtail consumer and business spending. While this will impede the economy's ability to grow, the threat of rising inflation and even potentially hyperinflation means that it is something that has to be endured if the government's plan to weather the storm is to succeed.\n\nIn spite of this, our in-house economists are divided on how much to raise interest rates with the two main camps based around raising the rates from 6% to either 9% or 15%. The proponents of the former increase state that raising them too high will paralyze the country's economy and make spending so unlikely that the economy will continue to plummet whereas the proponents of the latter claim that 9% wouldn't impede spending enough to cause inflation to decrease claiming that the average Iberian would soon their currency become useless. Both arguments could lead the country down a road of economic ruin and by extension, an unmitigated defeat in the next election so we have to pray to both God and Keynes that the right decision is made here."

The question of debt repayment begins with who we intend to pay back, as there is substantial debt from both domestic and international lenders who both want their money plus interest back as soon as possible.\n\nOne thing that cannot be ignored is that the government must pay back the debt from the domestic lenders due to the fact that ignoring them would be political suicide and would weaken the government's credibility with small and large businesses operating in Iberia. However, whether the government can afford to pay back the foreign debt still remains up in the air, as the means by which we could afford to pay them back would certainly require a further tax hike which would be immensely unpopular and further inhibit our economic growth. That being said, a refusal to pay these international lenders back would result in eroded confidence from foreign firms and an even bigger bill when we are in a situation to pay them back due to the interest that will have accrued."

It is important that we remember that we cannot leave this recession unless all peoples of Iberia have been raised up and no longer go hungry, no longer be forced to live paycheck to paycheck, no longer be punished for the mistakes the top 1% make."\n\nWhile the members of the "top 1%" didn't seem to like Fernández-Miranda's TV speech, the "average Iberian" seemed to love it and the Unión Republicana has seen a steady increase in the polls as a result of it. The mixture of presenting hope for the future with populist messaging about the rich has really struck a chord with the working class and rallies in the urban areas since the speech have seen a dramatic increase in turnout.

I know my voice will arrive in your residence being constantly interrupted by my tears and constant sobbing; it is natural to feel this way the tremendous pain his absence brings to us. It is a moment of extreme sadness, but we must not become hopeless, it is true that Franco, our Caudillo for so many years, is not among us but he left us his work, his example and the fulfillment of an historic duty. I was witness of his last day of work, when Death had already taken her toll at his heart and I can guarantee you that this was his last message to the people he loved so much:\n\nNow that the time is near for me to stand in judgment before God Almighty, I ask that He look kindly upon me since I have striven to live and to die as a good Catholic. It has always been my desire to be a faithful son of the church, I ask forgiveness from all, as I give my most heartfelt forgiveness to those who declared themselves my enemies. I believe and hope that had no enemies other than those who were enemies of Iberia. Iberia, which I will love until the last moment and which I promised to serve until my dying breath, which is near. Do not forget that the enemies of Iberia and of Christian civilization are watching, and you should also be watchful and should lay aside all personal gain in favor of the goals and interests of our homeland and of the Iberian people. Continue striving to obtain social justice and education for all Iberians and make use of the rich multiplicity of its regions as a fountain of strength for a continued united Iberia.

 IBR.633.d:0 "The minorities of Iberia are the nastiest of them all. With frightening dedication, the secessionists are the greatest threat the Union could ever face. At their worst they are able to create 'red zones', isolated pockets of extreme activity. While these red zones are essentially massive targets that are stomped out just as quickly as they appear, it serves as a great example of how unpleasant they can be. For the sake of stability these occurrences need to be reduced or even stopped.\n\nInitially, the plan was just to simply channel it towards foreigners. There was an issue with this, though, and it was that we didn't have any plan beyond 'point them at the outsiders'. So we put our best minds at the Axencia to it, and after laboring day and night they presented a more in-depth plan. All that remains is to put the plan into effect, and watch them flock to our banner."

 IBR.634.d:0 "We must integrate the minorities into Spanish society. It is the only way, or else we will be prey to eternal terrorism and destabilization from the more radical elements of their people. Minority cultures must die. The first step is to eliminate their language. Only Castilian will be taught in schools, and local media will never use local languages. Like Franco's policies, total immersion in the language coupled with allowing no further instruction of minority language will kill it off until everyone speaks Castilian or Portuguese. After that comes the second phase, where the differences between Castilian and the minority cultures will be slowly eroded until they are the same. Then, no matter what they say they are, they will be Spanish. There's an issue and it's obvious: this will cause a lot of anger. The policies aren't negotiable so it's necessary to find another way to quell most of the unrest.\n\nAnd a contingency plan is exactly what's planned. Should the minorities get too uppity then we'll arrange a meeting with several leaders of their community, and offer them some apparent 'guaranteed rights and privileges' in exchange for them publicly denouncing any separatist forces. What we'll fail to mention is that there is a loophole or an override for all of these, rendering them moot. By then, it'll be too late to object to them."

There's little consensus on just how wide the window of separatism truly is. The dispute got so bad that eventually De Valcàrcel had to step in and set the policy based on his own views on the matter. Coincidentally, his opinions happened to be the harshest of them all.\n\nUnder the new legal definition, separatism extends far beyond simple terrorism. Now, anyone found to be so much as sympathizing with separatists can be charged with the same crimes as the terrorists themselves! That is to say nothing of what now legally constitutes separatism. All that needs to be done is send the new laws to the Axencia Anti-Separatista and direct them to arrest those who had slipped through the cracks previously."

In every minute they were revealing themselves to the people they put on an aura of authority and morality - it really looked like they were entirely ready for both their job and working with each other. The idea of two benevolent guardians was able to tame many into obedience, and not having to take action against as many people only served to reinforce the image of kindness, which in turn led to more obedience, and so on. Over time this image has fallen to the wayside because nobody was willing to use it. It's time that we place it back into Iberian society, as it should be.\n\nTo the populace we will portray ourselves as the successors to the Caudillos. We will claim the legacy of the benevolent protectors, and extract what loyalty we can out of that. After all, we are the new Caudillos, following in the steps of the previous ones; and if you followed the old ones why wouldn't you follow us too?"
 IBR.636.a:0 "We only want what's best for them."

 IBR.637.t:0 "The Principles Of Christian Civilization"
 IBR.637.d:0 "Later today we will begin publication of "The Principles Of Christian Civilization", a thesis declaring Iberia to be a society of moral Christians. The thesis will be particularly targeted at the clergy, who will be able to get the ideas out to more people better than we could. Within the thesis we will begin by elaborating on the definition of 'Western Civilization', and how it is founded on Christian values. Through this we can explain how Iberia, a western civilization, is also founded on these Christian values. From here we shall proclaim that the Union will fall into barbarity and chaos without these values. It will be elaborated on what they are: charity, chastity, and obedience for your highers. The three pillars, the fundamentals of any good moral society. It will be a call to all who read it to maintain and spread these values everywhere they go, and to become the paragons of Christianity by following them."
 IBR.637.a:0 "A little bit of religion never hurt anybody."

 IBR.638.t:0 "The Old Propaganda Tactics"
 IBR.638.d:0 "Back in the days of the Caudillos, they used total immersion in propaganda to more effectively persuade people. If there was no other view, then the only perspective would eventually beat you down into accepting it. There was only one issue to this, and it was that it took a very fine level to achieve the desired results. Too much, and you risked apathy. Too little, and you could let some unapproved material slip through the cracks. But not to worry, as the people who worked this before are still around now. Even better, most of them have come to work for us. All we need to do is let the experts run free, and before we know it we'll have the people twisted around our fingers. After all, if anyone can replicate the success of the past, it would have to be the people who enabled it. They will be provided all they need, and a bit more, to make sure any dissidents are relegated to the fringe."
 IBR.638.a:0 "Whatever it takes, so long as it gets results."

 IBR.639.t:0 "Instigating National Fervor"
 IBR.639.d:0 "Propaganda is only one thing, and if it's all you use you'll never get anywhere in your doings. For maximum efficiency there needs to be a drop of truth, or even better a gallon of hatred. In order to really coax an Iberian identity it is necessary that one of the two are utilized. In this case, it would be better to pour on the hate. Then, it can be capitalized on. Find a scapegoat, give them plenty of blame, or make someone look scary, then talk about how you need the military to keep things in order. Emphasize the armed forces, ensure people know how necessary they are. Regardless, with the emphasis on things you can blame, you can more effectively rally people around opposing said thing.\n\nIt is still trivial to assign some incident from a foreign power as an act of malice. Then, once it is established there is a threat, the nation can be whipped up into a frenzy. By using some limited hyperbole to get the desired effect, hate can be channeled away from the state. Because all of their discontent is aimed at someone else they will be far more willing to listen to their betters. While it is unsavory these tactics are necessary to make sure people properly respect authority. The success of this program is already a given, so everything that needs to be done is to set it into motion."
 IBR.639.a:0 "Someone else is the issue, not us."

 IBR.640.t:0 "Striking Against Leftist Influence"
 IBR.640.d:0 "Socialism has been an eternal cancer ever since the day its vile ideas were conceived. They are a dangerous set of principles that fill people with naive beliefs of what is simply impossible in practice. Even worse, they allow for fools and despots to navigate their power, enslaving everyone who dared help them. For their sake, we must stop this ideology where we can. From here on out, all hives of this dangerous thought will be rooted out and removed from Iberia. More importantly, we will be able to rally the populace in opposition to leftism.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the destruction of socialism in Iberia is that it is one of the few things the upper echelons of the party are in total consensus on. They all want it gone, entirely, as soon as possible. The entirety of the Unión Nacional was united in one goal:"
 IBR.640.a:0 "Iberia must never be red, ever."

 IBR.641.t:0 "Investigating The Left Opposition"
 IBR.641.d:0 "Once the discussion turned from the question of elimination socialism to where to start, any semblance of party unity disintegrated. Thankfully this time the situation resolved itself quickly enough to ensure de Valcárcel did not intervene. The first most important step to removing leftism is to destroy their influence in politics. But how? They clearly must be arrested for their harmful beliefs, but there is no valid cause that they may be arrested for. At least, that we know of. That we might not know about some of their doings - of which could be grounds for arrest - was enough to pique the attention of several party members. The next move was already a certainty. The opposition would be investigated, their socialist and separatist ties revealed, and their members arrested. While the circumstances to enable such a move are contrived and tenuous at best, they are necessary to keep Iberia safe. "
 IBR.641.a:0 "The ends justify the means."
 
 IBR.642.t:0 "The Organic State"
 IBR.642.d:0 "Anyone with a brain knows that more things than humans are living beings. For example, the country itself is a living being too. Much like an organism, the state is comprised of many lesser parts who, all together, create something far greater than each other separate. Nowhere is this more true than Iberia, where several regions come together to form a greater whole. Much like an organism, however, there cannot be room for deviation. All parts must perform their dedicated function, and allowing anything to stray from their role will hamper the function of the whole. This school of thought is one that needs to be applied to all levels of government, and until it is accepted by the people it must be hammered into their heads that they ought to hush up about their grievances, and allow the dedicated leadership organ to do their job, just as they ought to do theirs."
 IBR.642.a:0 "No one can stand if their arm is fighting their leg."
 
 IBR.643.t:0 "Enforcing Catholic Social Doctrine"
 IBR.643.d:0 "A truly moral society is one based on her religion. In order to have a strong union we must lean on our traditions, and the faith is the strongest of all traditions. Therefore, Catholicism should be raised up, and injected into Iberian society. Thankfully there is a pre-established doctrine for placing religion as a main pillar of daily life. The value of the common good above all else is paramount. If one focuses on the individual, then they will neglect the whole to the detriment of the common good.\n\nOf course we lack the support to properly put this into effect. In order to move things along we will need to rely on support outside of our party. Due to their ideological proximity we will discuss the matter with some of the more malleable members of the Alianza Popular. In order to secure the success of the Catholic social doctrine the party must be convinced. Without their support, it will not be possible to achieve our goals."
 IBR.643.a:0 "So you'd best be persuasive."
 
 IBR.644.t:0 "Discussing Corporatist Economics"
 IBR.644.d:0 "No-one could ever deny that morality and piety are critical to the national health of Iberia. However, simply posing these as the end-all be-all of the nation's well being could not be farther from the truth. Any state is tied to their economy, and the prosperity of one spurs the prosperity of the other.\n\nAt least, that is how it should be. Unfortunately, 'should' is frequently replaced with something else. A privatized economy is a good example of something that is anything other than 'should'. Iberia has the right to her own destiny and self-determination. With the corporations of foreign people in charge of her economy, the Union lacks that self-determination, since it cannot exercise sovereignty over every bit they ought to. Therefore, a new system needs to be put in place. Every segment of the economy will be placed under the control of a corporate block, who will then operate it for the common good.\n\nThis matter is undoubtedly unpopular, despite its benefit. Without the support of the Alianza Popular, the corporatist system has no chance of success. Therefore discussions will be held in order to convince the other party that this system will be something worth supporting. Their success is critical."
 IBR.644.a:0 "I'm getting really tired of having to ask others to get anything done."
 
 IBR.645.t:0 "The New History Curriculum"
 IBR.645.d:0 "Iberian history isn't correctly written. Between outright Socialist lies and slightly less harmful half-truths it is easier to say what isn't false. Since our power is secure it is our solemn duty to change that.\n\nThe people of Iberia are held back by the deceptions and so they must be changed. The first truth is that the Caudillos weren't the best for either Spain or Portugal. Everyone knows that, but it is more nuanced than that. Like it or not they were stabilizing figures, and this fact needs to be represented in history. Equally so is the depiction of the empires that preceded Iberia. They aren't given a fair chance, and their qualities - such as their abilities to civilize and bring holiness to savages - are sorely missed.\n\nWhile only a sample of the sweeping reforms that are necessary to properly show the Union's history, it needs to be mentioned how monumental this project is. Once the new curriculum is fully written, it will be printed into new textbooks, and sent off to every school free of charge. After that it is only a matter of time."
 IBR.645.a:0 "There is something truly beautiful in seeing the world for how it really is."
 
 IBR.646.t:0 "Targeting The Fundamental Laws" 
 IBR.646.d:0 "De Valcárcel sat secluded in his study. The sun had long since set and the night had gone on so long that it was closer to sunrise than sunset. It was at this late hour that the party leader contemplated. Sleep had nearly consumed him, but he would not let it until he knew what he was going to do.\n\nLate at night was hardly an apt time to consider matters of state, but there was simply no time to do it elsewhere. There was one thing on the man's mind: their political career. No matter what they did, where they did, it was always blocked by the opposition! Even when they weren't doing it the Alianza Popular made sure to stick their noses in too. Nothing got done, and nothing could be done! A rage was boiling up from the party leader's depths, but he bit it down.\n\nPiecing together a solution only took a few minutes. If the opposition always got in the way... then they'd need to be shoved out of the way, or better yet ran over. As a draft was drawn up and plans were born, Valcárcel's expression went from anger, to smugness, to excitement.\n\nThe scribble of pencil continued all through the night. When the Francoist finally woke up again he found a - barely legible - set of documents and a burned out lamp bulb."
 IBR.646.a:0 "Acceptable. At least now we have the means to make sure we're properly heard."

There is a safety to this peninsula that anyone else - anyone weaker - could not have accomplished. But you trusted in me! Your trust has let me bring Iberia into something beautiful.

 IBR.648.t:0 "Minority Regions React Against Our Efforts"
 IBR.648.d:0 "Operation Forastero was simple and well executed. The first phase was a propaganda campaign directed towards each region of Iberia. The exact contents varied from area to area, but there was one consistent theme: some foreign country, without Iberia, would occupy the area and kill all of the minority group. For the Basques, it was the French. The Catalonians, the Italians. The second phase was to intensify the propaganda, until it was near all-encompassing. Iberia was the least of all evils, it argued, because unlike everyone else it didn't wish to kill you for existing. Anything that dissented with this opinion was swiftly silenced, in order to make sure the narrative was kept vigorous and consistent.\n\nClearly, it didn't work. Whether by leaked documents, a breach in the net, or just from plain disbelief, the idea that the Union was the least of all evils just didn't stick with the population. If anything, they seem to be even angrier. The intent was to decrease terrorist support among minorities, but the opposite has occurred. From the perspective of the average citizen, supporting a separatist, despite the risks, has become far more palatable. After all, they'd not be victim to Iberia anymore."
 IBR.648.a:0 "What? It was just a little lie!"

 IBR.649.t:0 "A Successful Blow Against Minority Nationalism"
 IBR.649.d:0 "Operation Forastero was simple and well executed. The first phase was a propaganda campaign directed towards each region of Iberia.

Iberia was the least of all evils, it argued, because unlike everyone else it didn't wish to kill you for existing. Anything that dissented with this opinion was swiftly silenced, in order to make sure the narrative was kept vigorous and consistent.\n\nIt was in indisputable success. Secrecy was maintained, and the constant barrage of anti-foreigner propaganda proved able to wear down even the most resilient of willpower. The idea that Iberia was the least of all evils for the minorities was one that caught and stayed. While quite a few didn't fall for the ruse, they found it way harder to enlist the aid of their countrymen, who increasingly saw their methods as futile, dangerous, and self-destructive."
 IBR.649.a:0 "Fabulous."
 
 IBR.650.t:0 "Axencia Anti-Separatista Protests New Definitions"
 IBR.650.d:0 "Unfortunate news! We had plotted for the Axencia to be more effective, but the new versions of separatism have only reduced their effectiveness. Rather than simply doing their job a sizeable number of agents have opted to disobey or even sabotage operations. Those that haven't have nearly unanimously put in a formal complaint: our new definitions are horrid, and the Axencia cannot operate using them. The arguments from this have varied from their draconic nature to the inability to feasibly execute them. What they have not seemed to consider is that, by the new laws, this is also separatism. The response is obvious. All protestors of the new programs will be arrested and replaced with people more dedicated to their jobs. Sadly, this will render the Axencia nearly inactive until it is properly reorganized. "
 IBR.650.a:0 "It's better than what we have now...?"

 IBR.651.t:0 "Separatist Arrests Cause Legal Chaos!"
 IBR.651.d:0 "We have gone overboard with the crackdown. Our agents displayed an unusual zealotry in enforcing the new anti-separatist regulations, and have arrested an obscene number of suspects from all around the peninsula. By itself this is no negative - it is a strong positive, as these are people who can no longer threaten Iberia - but there is more to complicate the situation. So many people have been arrested in such a short amount of time that we cannot keep up with it. There is an overwhelming number of prisoners to process, trials to be held, and legal challenges to bat down. All these issues will be sorted, and the initial wave of arrests will eventually die down, but it will take time. Valuable time in which the Axencia will effectively be at a standstill until the holding facilities have enough space to house arrests again."
 IBR.651.a:0 "Just keep going. We can keep this up; they can't."

 IBR.652.t:0 "Protests Against Anti-Separatist Arrests!"
 IBR.652.d:0 "For a while, the new separatist definitions worked. Our men were dedicated, and the prisoner flow was not so much as to overwhelm our processes. As time went on, it appeared as if it had gone as expected. Sadly, it didn't. Once more suspects were arrested we moved higher up, going from random people to more important figures who now lacked a support base to back them. The convicted separatists were able to cause quite a stir among the public, who now organize campaigns of disobedience against us in retaliation. While only a matter of time until the incidents fade from the public eye and these protests become bad memories, until they are forgotten the Axencia will be operating on a handicap. It is far harder to find separatists among a populace who wishes to spite the authorities. "
 IBR.652.a:0 "I hope you know associating with terrorists is also a crime..."

 IBR.653.t:0 "National Union Deputy Assassinated!"
 IBR.653.d:0 "One moment, the man was delivering a speech to the assembled crowd of citizens from Bilbao. The next, he was dead on the ground, with a hole through his chest. A gunshot was audible, but the shooter was nowhere to be seen. Even though the former bodyguards of the deputy and later the Guardia Civil began a sweep for the killer, he could not be found.\n\nEven though it has only been an exceptionally rare occurrence, the recent murder of a deputy of the Unión Nacional has sparked a new wave of fear in the party. Many members are afraid that they would be next in a chain of assassinations, and the attitude has had a negative impact on productivity. Instead of doing their job, some members are more concerned with obsessively securing themselves in the event of an attempted killing. The fear will eventually dissipate into nothing, given time and assuming no other murders take place. It has already done its damage, and the shortfall of work done has temporarily paralyzed Iberia, as the time wasted was needed to make sure the absence of several deputies would not be a negative effect."

As the flames lick at the air they reveal an entire group, objects in hand. One at a time they all toss what they're holding into the flames - newspapers, more textbooks, all sorts of media. After the last object falls into the greedy embrace of the fire the bunch stop a moment more to admire their handywork, then flee off into the darkness of the country.\n\nIncidents of this sort - symbolic destruction of anything in Spanish - have grown more popular since the continuation of the integration efforts. Given recent circumstances, they seem certain to only get more commonplace. Leaders of minority communities have all squarely refused to negotiate, taking stances that vary from neutrality to outright support of what they consider 'just' resistance against Iberia. Given the substantial influence these figures hold within their communities, combined with the integration policies, supporting separatists is far easier to swallow for most. Even worse, more have taken on the mantle of freedom fighter in an attempt to "liberate" their people."

Coaxing them into a negotiation to bring it all to an end was a simple matter. The verbal back-and-forth, plotted out by the National Union, ended with the intended response: the participating minority leaders condemned the actions of their separatists, and in return rights and privileges were guaranteed by the government. By the time they had realized these wouldn't mean anything, the damage had been done. The calls for compliance echoed louder than the cries of betrayal, and so many who would have before resisted instead found it easier to cooperate."

 IBR.656.d:0 "In every region of Iberia, the so-called 'Principles of Christian Civilization' and their ideas were spread to the populace. For the most part, they were conveyed through priests, preaching these moral ideals to those of their audience that would listen. Though not universally followed by priests, many were willing to oblige the Principles. Their intended message was simple and because of that it was simple to work it into something else.\n\nEven through all of this the Principles simply weren't enough. They simply lacked the longevity to stick with those receptive to the idea, a group outnumbered by the group that wasn't. A lasting impression only developed among only a small few. A religious incentive to not rock the boat was simply not going to be, and forcing the issue would only make things worse. So, the Principles passed on as a barely-remembered memory."

Their intended message was simple and because of that it was simple to work it into something else.\n\nThis was far more disastrous than even the worst-case scenarios imagined. In a public statement a clique of key Alianza Popular figures condemned the ideas contained within the Principles, decrying them as a 'lamentable perversion of religion' and even outright calling it 'francoist in nature'. While this proclamation had little effect on those already not in favor of the mandate, to those who thought something of it this was a very effective turnoff. At the urging of the Alianza Popular the more religiously minded of Iberia found themselves a bit less trusting of their ruling government, as a state that was so willing to pervert the meaning of the faith was not their state at all."

 IBR.659.d:0 "It is a chilly morning in Lisbon. But the inclement weather didn't seem to stop a crowd from turning up. Gathered in front of a government building, a cluster of individuals especially stood blocking the way into the building. When an official or a clerk tried to make their way inside someone moved over to stop them. This continued for what felt like an eternity as morning turned to day and only got warmer. Finally, the police arrived. Though some appeared sluggish and reluctant the law enforcement agents did their duty and dispersed the crowds. While functions were able to continue on after that, the damage had been done. Half the day had been wasted by protestors, and function was crippled for a substantial time after.\n\nThis was not the only city this occurred in. Every major city (and some minor too) in the Union had a similar rally, as protestors blocked off government functions as best they could for as long as they could. The emphasis on military and it's necessity caused a large amount of discontent, and so the average citizen was just a little bit less trusting of their government."

 IBR.660.d:0 "Over the course of our crusade to root out bolshevism, dissent has spread to every area of government. Everywhere that we do not directly control has been victim to some sort of agitation or discontent from more foolish souls. Falling under the socialist falsehood that the investigation is not in their best interests multiple figures in the Congress have spoken out against it, declaring it 'unjustified'. This sentiment has gradually diffused into the general populace, sparking dissent and outrage everywhere it goes. Sadly it appears an uproar has already been whipped up and so citizens have began a series of rallies and protests against the investigation into the political left-wing.\n\nThe mass of objectors have one demand: the immediate cessation of the investigation. As there are a large amount of people who have made their opposition vocal folding to their demands is an entirely possible option. Of course, it is also possible to simply send in the Guardia Civil to force them to disperse. The action will not be popular but against law enforcement agents they will be forced to comply."

Crackdowns and forced dispersals have only made the affair less popular with the population. Even worse, it has given a more convincing excuse to call the investigation off. The argument espoused by leftist mouthpieces is that, since it causes enough to force a police presence, it clearly isn't that democratic. The crowd who wishes to oppose us no matter what we do has latched on to this and parroted it to no end.\n\nSince any protest against the action is shut down by the Guardia Civil not long after it begins, we can simply keep on as planned. Public outrage is nothing new, and it will subside with time. Alternatively it would be simple to just call the investigation off. A move like that could save face among elements of the public and would in effect be cutting our losses."

Not even the tiniest violation - they had run an exemplary campaign.\n\nIt wouldn't do. The public reaction - all that for nothing - would be horrible. In these moments of unfiltered desperation, a plan was concocted; if there was nothing to be found, then something would need to be 'found'.

Expecting a group that would leave once asked a bit firmer than nicely, the Guardia Civil were caught entirely by surprise when the people started responding with violence. As time went on a questionable response caused things to only get worse. The Barcelona Incident, as it was later called, was really set in motion by a perfectly positioned car bomb. When the situation escalated the Guardia Civil were caught even more by surprise and were nearly entirely forced out of Barcelona by rioting citizens. What was most devastating about the whole affair, however, was that the law enforcement was humiliated. Unable to entirely contain the situation in a timely manner, they instead were forced to cordon the affected areas off and choke off the riot.\n\nIt appears this wave of unrest stemmed from the accusations levied towards the more left-wing politicians, which were flawed and easily debunked. The idea of evidence being faked in such a fashion seemed only to enrage the population, laying the groundwork for today's tragedy. "

 IBR.665.d:0 "Another protest gathered in Barcelona. Despite the more-than-usual protest against their forcible dispersal, the situation did not escalate into a substantial amount of violence. While the post-breakup mumbling and grumbling lasted for far longer than typical, nobody appeared willing to go further than that. Even that eventually died down and then the day became little more than a memory. Worse, it was considered by most to be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nOutside of the frontlines, incidents had occurred that could almost be considered optimal. The Axencia discovered a group of Catalonian terrorists planning to incite violence by detonating a bomb during the rally in Barcelona. Thanks to some 'convenient' and legitimate appearing documents, the attempting bombing was able to be tied to the more leftist areas of Iberian politics. To anyone who doesn't dig too deep, it really does appear that they supported the separatists. "

 IBR.667.t:0 "Reception To Our Doctrine"
 IBR.667.d:0 "The reaction to the imposement of the organic doctrine has been one of bewilderment, to put it lightly. Only a small, more conservative segment of the population agreed with our ideals and it grew in no way but worse from there. The typical reaction was that of confusion of some form - many just simply didn't see a rhyme or reason to the new political theory. Another small segment of the populace took active hostility against the doctrine. Seeing a 'malicious pattern' in what it attempted to convey led to them opposing it everywhere they found it. To both extremes it was a matter of harsh contention, but the majority didn't think anything of it either way. Even though it wasn't the intended response, it is a small consolation that it was not any worse than it was."
 IBR.667.a:0 "We'll just have to try harder next time."
 
 IBR.668.t:0 "Alianza Popular Opposes Our Proposal"
 IBR.668.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Catholic social doctrine is not to be. After showcasing the doctrine, discussing the proposal, and allowing the Alianza Popular to deliberate, they have decided by a narrow margin that they do not wish to support it. While their reason for being dissuaded from the idea was initially unclear, by information from loyalists within the AP a prevailing attitude was that it seemed overwhelmingly Francoist in nature. Unfortunately, without their full support the doctrine is dead. Even though it would likely be possible to compromise on a neutered version of the proposal doing so would render it pointless. Though it is true that there are some, namely the loyalists, would vote in favor of the measure anyway, they are insignificant. Without the full support of the Alianza Popular there is no meaningful version of the doctrine that could realistically be passed."
 IBR.668.a:0 "They pick the worst moments to abandon us."
 
 IBR.669.t:0 "Connections Secured Within Alianza Popular"
 IBR.669.d:0 "After utilizing the 'loyalists' to aid bringing the matter to the Alianza Popular, they have - by a narrow margin - decided to place the party's support behind our proposal. According to one present, the doctrine was discussed for a long while, and then it was placed to a vote. The prevailing concern among the AP was the 'Francoist' nature of the proposal, but this seemed to not play large enough of a part to significantly influence the outcome.\n\nThe importance of this support cannot be understated. This initial support sets the foundation for a trend that can be capitalized upon later on. Additionally, this means that we are able to move through, unrestricted, with the Catholic social doctrine. Nothing will be left out, and everything will be just as hoped. More advantageous than even the trend of support set by this move is the influence it grants us within the Alianza Popular. The effective puppets that make up the loyalists are stronger and supposedly have more weight behind what they say. "
 IBR.669.a:0 "Baby steps, but important steps nonetheless."
 
 IBR.670.t:0 "Discussions On Corporatism Break Down!"
 IBR.670.d:0 "A corporatist system in Iberia is not to be. Pitted against the best speakers the party could bring to bear, the Alianza Popular just couldn't be aligned towards a more controlled economy. With reactions ranging from distaste to disgust to even hostility, there are only a few who didn't reject our ideas.\n\nInitially the talks proceeded well. Once the far-reaching nature of our policies became obvious, the tone of negotiations changed drastically. From one of those present, 'the whole place dropped a few degrees. Nearly anyone who got what we meant gave us some kind of look.'\n\nWithout these discussions any chances of securing Alianza Popular support for the policy are gone. Nobody else would be willing to even humor these arguments, so a corporatist dream is futile. Even worse, the AP seem less inclined to work with us on economic matters over this quarrel, which means that even a neutered version of the measure is dead in the water."
 IBR.670.a:0 "And this is why!"
 
 IBR.671.t:0 "Planning A Theoretical Corporatist System"
 IBR.671.d:0 "After a long and heated debate on a new economic system with the Alianza popular - not least of which was talking them down from an abrupt and unceremonious 'no' - the party has finally given their grudging approval. Our theoretical economic system will be supported by them in the legislature. With one caveat. We need to propose a system, in its entirety, within a day. If we do not, then the deal is off.\n\nThe prospect of planning an entire system in the space of twenty-four hours proved too much for our economists. Their relief was palpable when it was revealed that much of it was already planned. The ideals were there, and only the minutiae between them needed to be plotted out. The Alianza Popular seemed taken aback when a completed economic plan were presented to them, but they honored their deal and the new corporatist reforms await implementation."
 IBR.671.a:0 "And on we go."
 
 IBR.672.t:0 "Anti-Fascist Protests In Madrid"
 IBR.672.d:0 "Following the beginning of the implementation of the corporatist economic system, many figures people took it poorly. Not only was the plan vehemently opposed by everyone outside of both the Alianza Popular and our own party, but the attitude that the corporatism is fascist seems to have spilled out into the common people. Rapidly rallying their supporters in Madrid, the opposition have used their useful idiots for two purposes. Firstly, they have harassed Unión Nacional members. Even worse is their second use, in which they have been used as leverage to reverse the measures before they go into full swing.\n\nFrom their advantageous position the protestors are capable of placing an immense pressure on the government, which could easily be assuaged by calling the policies off. The side effect of this would be that this would embolden the opposition, which could threaten to deadlock the already fragile system. It wouldn't be popular, but in order to properly disperse the rabble it would be more effective to call in the Guardia Civil to force them to depart"
 IBR.672.a:0 "Go home, miscreants. The plan is happening."
 IBR.672.b:0 "Fine. We'll fold."
 
 IBR.673.t:0 "Corporatist Policies Lead To Economic Slump"
 IBR.673.d:0 "Without even being fully implemented, the corporatist project has led to unexpected consequences. As the market has run itself for so long without the policies in place, it required time to correct itself. Sadly, correction is a long and painful process. This pain came in the form of a downturn economically. Because of the obsession with constant growth this came at great detriment to our popularity, both internally and externally. We have fallen under attack from short-sighted figures from every end of the political spectrum, and the whole affair has been very unpleasant.\n\nEverything we could do to save our situation was to rapidly roll back the corporatist system. This has not saved much, but it left a salvageable sum we would lack from doubling down. It has inspired a wave of militants and reprobates to begin vocal opposition to our party. Circling the wagons should be able to silence most of them, but it seems the damage has been done."
 IBR.673.a:0 "The stocks really are that important to you, then."
 IBR.673.b:0 "There can be no compromise on this."
 
 IBR.674.t:0 "Abandoning Our Ambitions"
 IBR.674.d:0 "Following unexpected circumstances, any chances for corporatism in Iberia have come to an end. The public's faith in us has been decimated, but that can be remedied by various maneuvers. What's more damaging is our own government's loss of faith in our ability. Despite the Alianza Popular's willingness to go along or at least compromise on most matters, they no longer wish to associate themselves with us on economic matters. It will not be an issue in the short term, but once the economy requires further calibration we will find ourselves in unfortunate circumstances.\n\nEven though the Alianza Popular's disappointment was wounding, worst of all was the rifts created within the Unión Nacional. As a large segment were willing to support our measures knowing they would work out, so when they backfired many of the turncoats defected to the Alianza Popular, further cleaving our support in the Congress."
 IBR.674.a:0 "This only ever happens to us!"
 
 IBR.675.t:0 "Reception To The New Curriculum"
 IBR.675.d:0 "The textbooks have been rewritten, and the response to the curriculum has begun to take shape as... dislike.\n\nWhile it was probably because we were too explicit in our descriptions, simple resistance to change cannot be ruled out. The most likely outcome was Leftist rabble-rousing, using their influence to damage the new history's credibility. It worked, as some of the most common reactions involve calling it 'extremely contrived' and equating it to historical revisionism. This taste is one that will likely stay in the public's mouth, even though we can force the new curriculum through. The reaction going forward will for certain get worse, if current trends are anything to work by."
 IBR.675.a:0 "Nothing can work right in this damned Union!"
 
 IBR.676.t:0 "Our Plans Are Leaked!"
 IBR.676.d:0 "Earlier this morning, a break-in was reported in the Unión Nacional headquarters. As little of importance was kept there it was considered to have had no significance - allow the police to investigate, let nothing come of it. This demeanor changed when the news got out. The contents of the theft were discovered by their publication, and not their missing nature from the party headquarters. Valcárcel's drafts, and the plans based on them, were what had been stolen. In their place were a number of 'decoy' documents, which only held up to a quick glance's inspection.\n\nA scandal this size has never been seen before, and getting away from it before consequences come crashing down is probably impossible. Attempts to deflect or divert the public anger have failed. Rather than be mad at the criminals who leaked it, they have instead opted to be angry at the people being leaked. Since de Valcárcel is the head of the party, it falls on him to take decisive action to make sure backlash is minimized. With all of this occurring, the man takes his stance:"
 IBR.676.a:0 "Salvage what we can and stop the news from spreading further."
 IBR.676.b:0 "Try to pretend this isn't happening."

 IBR.677.t:0 "Liberal Leaders Call For Revolution!"
 IBR.677.d:0 ""We must not let this stand, comrades!" Cried the man. He was tall, and his imposing stature only helped make his point further to the crowd gathered before him. "This- this 'National Union' seems to think that we will lie down and let them kill the democracy we have fought so hard for. Worse than that! They suppress this news, and then they expect us to pretend it never happened! Even though they were bad before, it wasn't ever this bold! I will stand. I will stand for Iberia! I will stand for democracy! Who stands with me!?" The apparent revolutionary stopped to catch his breath, the noise washed away by the caterwauling of his followers.\n\nThis sort of incident happened many ways, in many places. And, because of their natures as spectacles, they gained mass attention. With the media growing unruly, the message only got out to more people. In these reached people it found more supporters, and so on. The whole thing had nearly irreversibly spiraled out of control by the time it made its way to Valcàrcel's attention. The revolutionary leaders needed to be arrested, and their message suppressed before it reached even more citizens. Even if the move could add more flames to the fire."
 IBR.677.a:0 ""Please, you must stop their antics here and now!""
 IBR.677.b:0 ""No, no... It's not necessary. We can't let them get more justification than they have now.""
 
 IBR.678.t:0 "Alianza Popular Cuts All Ties With Our Coalition"
 IBR.678.d:0 "Manuel Fraga Iribarne, chairman of the Alianza Popular, has just finished a call to de Valcàrcel. The tone was not positive. Furious with the very fact that the plans existed to be leaked, Fraga spent a large amount of time nearly screaming, making his chagrin at having been tricked into supporting a 'group so authoritarian as theirs'. Francoism was a mistake, and they deceived the Alianza Popular into supporting it. Because of this, the two parties would never associate again. Instead of just staying alone, they would instead work with a separate organization to bring the Unión Nacional their day of reckoning.\n\nWhile most of this was to be expected given the circumstances, the final statement worried Valcàrcel. In the past few days the party had made a lot of enemies, and this was no bluff he wanted to call. As the next meeting of the Congress approached, he felt a growing dread."
 IBR.678.a:0 "What if they meant it...?"

 IBR.679.t:0 "The Democratic Salvation Coalition"
 IBR.679.d:0 "As the latest session of the Congress convened, it began as well as could be expected. The Alianza Popular shunned the members of the Unión Nacional and not a single interaction between the two could be observed, even among those who could have been considered friends across parties. But there was something wrong..\n\nThe opposing political parties seemed too self-assured, too smug.. Something was amiss. A conspiracy had clearly hatched. These suspicions proved themselves right when that same opposition made their move. Beginning by divulging that every exit was blocked, the so-proclaimed 'Democratic Salvation Coalition' and their spokesman - Fraga himself - began speaking to their captive audience.\n\nTheir message, while delivered in so, so many more words, was simple: The Unión Nacional's authoritarian tendencies were unacceptable, francoist, and would drag the entire Union into the dark days they never should be taken back to. Therefore, for the good of the nation, the Unión Nacional could not remain in power any longer. The whole party would stay in the building until they jointly announced their resignations. And they would wait.\n\nFaced with this, Valcàrcel decided to..."
 IBR.679.a:0 "Sneak away - somehow - and find a way to topple this Coalition."
 IBR.679.b:0 "Give up. Sign the resignation form."
 
 IBR.680.t:0 "Tearing The Salvation Coalition Down"
 IBR.680.d:0 "As de Valcàrcel looked around, he realized he needed to act quickly, or everything he had worked for would collapse. This coalition would get theirs, but first he needed to get out of the room. Then... he'd sneak his way to a phone, maybe. First things first.\n\nThe man looked around, until he found what he wanted to see: an entrance, left unattended. The door stood wide open. All it would take is the attention to be focused somewhere else. So de Valcàrcel tapped the shoulder of another party member - a dedicated, trustworthy hardliner - and gave him some simple instructions. Cause a fuss, make a scene, just draw all the attention to you.\n\nAs the man made a fool of himself to a watching audience, de Valcàrcel crept out of the room and through the hallways. Keeping hidden as to make sure nobody saw him sneaking around, he looked through room and room, searching for a very particular object. He would call the Guardia Civil, and have them arrest the opposition! The only issue was to find a phone that also wasn't monitored. Finally, as he found himself near an office room, he saw exactly what he was looking for."
 IBR.680.a:0 "A phone! Salvation! Let's see how those bastards like the feel of truncheon."
 
 IBR.681.t:0 "Unión Nacional Stands Down"
 IBR.681.d:0 "As de Valcàrcel looked around, he contemplated the futility of his situation. There was no way he could slip out of the Chamber. There was no way anyone else could, either. Even then, he spent a few awkward minutes trying to puzzle his way out of the room. Once he was fully confident he couldn't - a process of elimination that was increasingly painful the longer it went on - he simply couldn't find it in him to keep going. His gaze locked to the floor, shoulders slumped, he walked forward and grabbed a resignation form, and sloppily signed his signature.\n\nWith his position forfeit and his presence no longer justified, de Valcàrcel shuffled his way out of the Chamber. The guards stepped aside to let him through. After the departure of their leader, the Unión Nacional's members slowly filtered out too, and after a while the party was no more."
 IBR.681.a:0 "You know, I expected far worse."
 
 IBR.682.t:0 "Democratic Salvation Coalition Takes Control"
 IBR.682.d:0 "Now that the Unión Nacional has been decapitated, we find ourselves dominant in the Congress. Without their leadership they are relegated to that of a writhing snake, waiting for someone to put them out of their misery. That someone needs to be us. However, a large number of obstacles remain in our way to save the Union.\n\nTheir first failsafe is in the bureaucracy. The Unión Nacional has sunk their talons deep, and a large amount of administrators still have loyalty - or sympathies - for the Francoists. These unknown loyalties could prove detrimental, and if they aren't eliminated it could stop any meaningful reform.\n\nIt is undeniable that the UN managed to take a near-frightening grasp on the population, especially in the conservative sectors. This same grip allowed them to do a large amount of damage to Iberian society, with harmful religious propaganda, inflamed minority tensions, and nearly assert their control for a "New State".\n\nEven though their influence and reach were nearly all-encompassing, their more authoritarian policies provide a good framework to tear down the last resurgence of Franco's loyalists. Regardless of even that they still have many loyalists and sympathizers in the lower levels of the Union, and the minority groups are still enraged. All of these challenges together seem insurmountable, which begs the question:"
 IBR.682.a:0 "Could democracy be saved?"
 
 IBR.683.t:0 "Contacting The Guardia Civil"
 IBR.683.d:0 "When de Valcàrcel made a run for the nearest office, he knew his largest threat would be some Coalition goon wrestling him out and away from the phone. Once he was in the room, he pulled a chair to the door and blocked it. Then, he put another chair with it too. As the door was now adequately blocked for his standards, he tread over to the telephone, placing in the three numbers for emergency services. A one... another one... and a two.\n\n"How can we help?"\n\n"This is de Valcàrcel, they've taken the whole house hostage!" He glances outside - nobody has come yet. Then he glances back to the receiver. The voice on the other side was taking too long to answer. Could something be wr-\n\n"Don't worry, señor Valcàrcel. We're sending people right now. Can you wait for a few minutes?""
 IBR.683.a:0 ""Why yes, yes, I think I can.""
 
 IBR.684.t:0 "Guardia Civil Enter The House Of Deputies" 
 IBR.684.d:0 "As it turns out, the Guardia Civil only needed four minutes. Because the office de Valcàrcel had hid in was near an entrance, he didn't have to wait much longer than four minutes for his salvation. Creating a commotion as he threw his makeshift barricade to the ground and rushed through the door to the authorities. He proclaimed to them to follow him, as he would personally oversee the arrests of the traitors. The walk was short, and any Coalition member he came across moved out of the way of his army, though they weren't being arrested - likely being left for later.\n\nTriumphantly, he marched into the Chamber of Deputies with his entourage close behind him. After allowing his party a moment or two of jeering, he began to speak to the opposition. There would be no resignation, only arrests. All traitors to Iberia and the Union will be arrested, and then the country would finally be free. "
 IBR.684.a:0 "Check."
 
 IBR.685.t:0 "Guardia Civil Expels National Union, Arrests Leaders"
 IBR.685.d:0 "On and on continued de Valcàrcel, ranting and raving about anything that crossed his mind, made him mad, and could vaguely be tied to the Alianza Popular. He was fully engrossed in his speech. As such, he failed to notice the Guardia Civil moving near the Unión Nacional members, slowly surrounding them. It was only when a party leader pushed back against an officer and was wrestled to the floor. The noise of the fight was enough to knock de Valcàrcel out of his trance, and as he turned to look he was handcuffed.\n\nMeagre protest was all the man could raise, and the knowledge that everything he did was going to be undone collapsed on him. Most didn't see much, but a younger man saw the leader of the Unión Nacional in tears as he walked by - a sight more pitiful than anything. The rest of the Unión Nacional was escorted out shortly behind him. Awkwardly shuffling towards the near exit, most left with either silence or quiet muttering."

 IBR.5412.d:0 "Unfortunately, we can't rule alone. If we could, the country would be back under a rightful eye and a strong director. Our coalition partner, the Alianza Popular, is still an independent party, and so we need to keep them happy, for the most part. Usually, the most it takes is a concession on some policy or another. With the recent crisis unfolding, we can compromise on plenty of things to get them to keep their heads down.\n\nThe recent drop in oil has made it necessary for non-essential workers to stay home, for conservation. They simply burn too much oil in transit, as well as with running the actual places of work. We can't stop many private workers, but several state professions have been called to stay home to preserve fuel. The Alianza, ever the fiscal hawks, have lobbied for the salaries of these public workers to be frozen, or reduced in proportion to the hours they currently work. We have to do something at the minimum, but if we go as far as the Alianza Popular desires then we may lose support from the people whose salaries have suddenly disappeared. Of course, this may give us a perfect opportunity to extend our influence over them..."

We need to make sure our use of the black gold is less than the scant amounts we can acquire, until the shortage is concluded.\n\nThe current proposal is a raised consumption tax, effectively discouraging oil use by taxing people extra for using it. This plan has attracted remarkable support, both from our coalition and from the other parties. Using this once-in-a-lifetime cross-party support, the law itself is a certainty. The only question is how to best apply the tax.\n\nBack when Franco was in charge, the government didn't need to concern itself with popular support. They simply did what was best, without boiling it down to sate the masses. Franco is no longer here, and his government gone, and to ever bring it back we will need the support of the people. The law would undoubtedly work better if we applied it universally, but if we were to spare the common worker from it, then we would definitely gain their support. Either will work, it is just a question of which is best."

The creditors have greatly reduced their demands after we threatened to destroy them with full force. It isn't a bad thing by any means, but there is the possibility of gaining more.\n\nThe government is definitely not the only group these bastards have scammed, and if we do nothing we will be far from the last. We could definitely make use of these services more than once - though what would bring us there is unknowable - if we kept them going. If we were to try them for their usury and make a great show of it, then it would undoubtedly be a great victory in the eyes of the common man."

Of course, they were not watching him yet- he still had some brief time before he was live. He was worried, for a moment, but the politician crushed his doubt like a separatist. He was Franco's successor, damnit, and he would need to speak like it too. Allowing doubt to fester would be a betrayal of Iberia.\n\nOnce he was live, he began to speak. Emphasizing with grand, sweeping movements of his hands, Valcárcel spoke of the need for unity, above all else.\n\nOr at least, he would have if he had not knocked down his water bottle. He had totally stopped, staring at the water bottle- for far too long - before picking it up in spite of the puddle it had made, and then recomposed himself.\n\n"This must not destroy our Union, Iberians! We are one country, united by our common heritage, and we must act like it! This is your struggle, and it is the struggle of the National Union, and it is the struggle of Iberia! We..." He trailed off, having forgotten the rest of his sentence. "...We will struggle together!

His Eminency spoke about the importance of faith and union in these troubled times, as the Caudillos are getting older and the power in the Union is being transferred from their hands into the Council's, the Archbishop has made use of a metaphor comparing the essence of the Nation with the development of life. At his start the child as well as the Nation must be brought up with a strong hand so he learns obedience and doesn't deviate from the right path, as the child matures the father should start to be more lenient with his offspring and allow him to relish his independence and find his place in the world, if these steps are followed thoroughly the child will make her father proud even after his death.

During the climax of the trial, Kanoi astonished every onlooker when he ignored his attorney's guidance and confessed to all charges, asserting he would not tolerate the ridicule of being treated as a hunting trophy and the work he did for his cause being used as a propaganda piece for a "fascist" government, The defendant then explained to the judge how he made the bomb which killed the two Tricornios, before being sentenced to Life in Prison.

 IBR.750.t:0 "Investigating Federal Agencies" 
 IBR.750.d:0 "The flash of a dozen camera's went off as Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete emerged into the conference room and took the podium. If the newly appointed head of the Guardia Civil was nervous, few could tell. Back straight, his face a visage of determined calm, he was a military man through and through. All knew his record: A former Falangist and veteran of the notorious Division Azul which fought for Nazi Germany, he had now chosen to side with Iberian democracy and the Democratic Salvation Coalition.\n\n"Good morning," he began, greeting the assembled journalists. "I am here today in my capacity as Director General of the Guardia Civil to announce that by direction from the Minister of the Interior, the Guardia Civil, alongside the National Police Corps, the Municipal Police, and other regional law enforcement agencies, have begun a nation-wide inter-agency investigation into the involvement of federal agencies, government organizations, and state officials in the election of the Unión Nacional. It is the belief of the Guardia Civil, and the newly convened Democratic Salvation Coalition, that forces within the Iberian state manipulated the election result, ensuring a win for Unión Nacional in full knowledge of their plans to subvert the constitution."\n\nBefore he could even finish two dozen hands shot up while the room exploded into a cacophony of questions. Topete simply held his hand up, calling for silence.\n\n"Now, before I answer any questions, I wish to address those who may be listening who assisted in this plot. I say to you: Turn yourselves in. The Unión Nacional has been defeated. There is no further cause for undermining the Iberian constitution with the aim of restoring the Unión Nacional to its position of power. You will be found, caught, and punished.""

 IBR.751.t:0 "The Results Of The Investigation" 
 IBR.751.d:0 "Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete looked over the list one last time. There were many names he knew here, men who he had fought with during the civil war, even some he had fought alongside in Russia with the Division Azul. Such men would surely call him a turncoat, a traitor to the Falange, Caudillo Franco, and the Iberian nation. Aramburu didn't much care what they thought anymore. In his many years in the military he had always made choices based on what he felt was most in line with law, order, and security. During his youth that had meant siding with Franco against the terroristic insanity of communism. Now it meant siding with Iberian democracy against his former comrades and their fanatical authoritarianism.\n\nThe list was long, some 300 pages, containing the names of thousands of government employees, army officers, civil bureaucrats, and electoral officials, all party to the conspiracy to rig the elections in favor of the Unión Nacional. Hundreds of confessions had been correlated and compiled, leading to an ever growing number of exposed traitors. Most if not all would be charged with serious crimes, but that would have to wait. Now it was time to purge them all from their positions, and ensure they couldn't do any more damage.\n\nPlacing the list in his briefcase and getting up to head to the Ministry of the Interior, where he would present the Guardia Civil's findings to the new government, Aramburu could not shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The list was larger than even he had expected, and if the Unión Nacional had this much support inside the state, there was no telling how much they still had outside of it."

 IBR.752.d:0 "We've audited the polls, and due to the discrepancies that we have seen, we have in turn begun legal investigations. The Unión Nacional records have been seized by the Guardia Civil, and the preliminary investigation has shown what we had suspected: the UN had committed voter fraud to increase their power in the Iberian Council!\n\nNames have been tampered, more votes registered in polling stations than the number of people they served, and many more such violations of the democratic process had been undertaken, all of it recorded, undoubtedly to reward those that participated. But now all we can guarantee is that the names that were listed will soon be serving prison terms for violating our new electoral system.\n\nIt is a shame that it has come to this, but we can at least show to the world that we will take our new democracy seriously."
 IBR.752.a:0 "Maybe they should have just tried to get votes the proper way!"
 
 IBR.753.t:0 "National Union Campaign Records Burned!"
 IBR.753.d:0 "We've audited the polls, and due to the discrepancies that we have seen, we have in turn begun legal investigations. But when the Guardia Civil went to seize the Unión Nacional records, all they were confronted with was many empty filing cabinets and piles of ashes in the party headquarters. All of the party's records from the last election have simply gone up in smoke.\n\nClearly, this was to hide their illegal activities of voter fraud, and to prevent the police and government from taking legal action. They have managed to hide their network of agents and saboteurs seeking to destroy our nascent democracy through fire and smoke. While we don't have any hard evidence, an officer of the Guardia Civil, speaking anonymously to the press, revealed our discovery. This has led to denunciations in the newspapers, and in turn the anger of the Iberian people. The UN is scrambling to respond to this incriminating act."
 IBR.753.a:0 "Where there is smoke, there is fire."
 
 IBR.754.t:0 "Inconclusive Evidence Found" 
 IBR.754.d:0 "We've audited the polls, and due to the discrepancies that we have seen, we have in turn begun legal investigations. But when the Guardia Civil went to seize the Unión Nacional records, we were overwhelmed with the sheer amount of paperwork that the party had given to the police. Teams have been working around the clock to sort through the files and determine if something, anything illegal or incriminating has been discovered. So far, the answer is... very little. Maybe some of the entries in ledgers could be seen as possible evidence of voter fraud, but there is nothing solid or definite, and no 'smoking gun' that can unravel the whole mystery. What we have will help us, but it's not enough.\n\nThis is disconcerting, to say the least. Either the UN has managed to keep a massive voter fraud scheme virtually under wraps, or, much more concerning to our government, the UN has much more support than we realize. Neither scenario is promising for the Iberian Council."

 IBR.755.d:0 "The old Madrid headquarters of the Falange on Alcala street was imposing, its entire front side emblazoned with a massive red yoke and arrows symbol, the emblem of Franco's movement. Director General Aramburu made a mental note to order his men to tear the thing down once they had taken the building from the last holdouts of the Unión Nacional. Sitting in a bulletproof car across from the building, he radioed the order to begin the operation.\n\nThe building was stormed quickly, with no casualties. It seems that any of the Falangists who remained had chosen to surrender rather than make a last stand. Hearing that the coast was clear, Aramburu exited the vehicle, and headed through the front doors to the building. Entering the lobby, he found his men detaining several Falangists in military uniform, on their knees with their hands cuffed behind their backs.\n\n"Aramburu, you traitor," one of them spat, looking up at him. The Director General did not recognize him. Perhaps one of his former subordinates in the Civil Guard. "What is the meaning of this? This is private property. You have no right to be here."\n\n"I am here on orders of the Minister of the Interior and the Court of Auditors," he replied, ignoring the disdain of the prisoners. "You are to hand over all documents pertaining to the last election so that they may be submitted as part of the government's review of the election results. Where do you keep your files?"\n\n"Burn in hell," the Falangist scoffed, a look of disgust across his face. "You will get nothing out of us."\n\nAramburu sighed. He had hoped to avoid such unpleasantness.\n\n"Take them away," he said, turning to his men. "And scour the building. Their files should be here somewhere.""

 IBR.756.d:0 "The blaze of photographers flashbulbs and the shouting of questions as uniformed Guardia Civil officers lead the accused Unión Nacional officials into the Madrid courthouse that would serve as the stage for the most consequential trial of our young democracy. We are certain that the UN has committed voter fraud and conspiracy against the state.\n\nThe trial will last many days, perhaps weeks, as prosecutors present their evidence, the defense tries to handwave it away or call out flaws in their opponents' arguments. It will be prime television to a populace divided, with nationalists believing that we are simply punishing the UN for having the audacity to contest elections, or that of the supporters of the Democratic Salvation Coalition are infuriated that their votes may have been stolen from them, and many, many more wait to make their final judgement.\n\nBut many already realize that old habits die hard, and the efforts by the nationalists to rig the elections to turn out in their favor must be punished to the full extent of the law if democracy in Iberia is to mean anything."

But even more supporters of other parties are on the streets as well, believing that the elected government is on the verge of being overthrown in a coup, leading to clashes between the two groups on side streets throughout Madrid. Guardia Civil and police are doing their best to maintain control, but some looting, arson, violence, beatings and arrests are occurring as well.\n\nTo make matters worse for our government, Caudillos Franco and Caetano have sent a joint letter to the Democratic Salvation Coalition that we should resign our positions immediately, and to turn power over to "the rightfully elected government of the Iberian Union," meaning of course, the Unión Nacional.\n\nBut we know full well that the UN has committed voter fraud.

As more and more evidence is brought to light in the trial of the complex vote rigging scheme that the UN undertook, the masses are coming around to our side, and acknowledging that, well, maybe the UN did something wrong. Even the Caudillos have gone silent, perhaps realizing that they were backing the wrong horse. Or, more likely, that it would look really bad for them to stand in the way of democracy and the law.\n\nSome diehard supporters of the UN maintain a lonely vigil outside the courthouse, but they are outnumbered by the police and counter-protestors that support our effort to maintain the rule of law. At the start of every morning, the number of UN protesters continues to shrink from the previous night's numbers, showing that even they must realize that they are on the losing end against democracy and freedom."

First and foremost, the big monopolies that had been set up will be disbanded, to establish competition in the economy, which will drive down prices and increase wages. The restrictions and bans on labor movements have been lifted, which will give the workers a say in how they are to be treated by their employers. We will also institute a minimum wage pegged to the yearly inflation rate, so that all workers have a chance to make a living.\n\nIt will take more laws and many more years of work to fully decorporatize the Iberian economy, but this is a first step."

First and foremost, the "national spirit formation" and "housework" subjects that many a young Iberian had grown to loathe over time will be ended entirely. In line with that, the portraits of the Caudillos will no longer be placed in every classroom, schools can now no longer raise the national flag at the beginning of the week and take it down at the end, college students are no longer required to sign an oath of allegiance to the state, the daily prayer and allegiance to the state have been removed.\n\nBut the biggest concern will be that of the subjects that are taught. While mathematics and science will be less affected, there are some that will need to be overhauled: for example, we will encourage more diversity in the reading materials in both Spanish and Protugese classes. History, however, is the biggest issue. The new law sets up a non-partisan board of historians and academics to rewrite the history textbooks, to provide a more equal and balanced subject for our students to learn at all levels of education. While we can still take pride in Iberia through the study of history, we must also recognize that we had done bad or terrible things in our past, and must acknowledge them."

While most of the law deals with the minor details to ensure that elections are fair, some of the most important aspects of the law is simple to understand: an impartial, non-partisan group will be in charge to provide the ballots, the ballot boxes, and set up polling places, as well as educating the public in how the elections work. The parties themselves will be banned from the polling places: no party posters, campaigners or materials will be allowed within 50 meters of any polling station. Guardia Civil officers will be present to oversee the voting at all times, to ensure that the ballot boxes are not tampered with, and at the end of the voting, three Guardia Civil Officers, chosen from outside the district that they are stationed in for this day, will take the ballot boxes to a secure location to be counted and verified.\n\nNow that a strong and enforceable election law is in place, the Democratic Salvation Coalition has announced that they are resigning, dissolving the Iberian Council, and new elections will be held."

But unlike under the dictatorship, where the steely faced policemen were there to intimidate the voters to make the right choice, now they are there to scare away those that would try to tamper with the election, and to ensure that the voting is free and fair.\n\nMany other Guardia Civil officers are stationed across the Union to keep an eye on the rallies and parades, to ensure that no violence comes to pass. The head of the Guardia Civil gave explicit orders: no violence of any kind, by any party or group, is to be tolerated. If an agitator is trying to rile up the crowd, they are to be arrested. If a mob starts to form, they are to be broken up. If anyone tries to hamper anyone from voting, they will be charged with voter fraud and taken into custody. There will be no repeat of the last election.\n\nFor soon, millions will go to the polls, and will freely and fairly, choose the next leader of the Iberian Union."

The atmosphere upon entering the conference room was rather jovial, the room littered with small groups of dignitaries hunched in different corners in deep conversation, raucous laughter reaching even outside making the regular guests chuckle. Upon the last official entering and the stewards closing the door, the mood became more professional, the Americans quickly making the official OFN stance regarding the Iberians' request. An audible sigh of relief was heard from the Europeans as the discussion then shifted onto the minutia regarding the Iberians' rights and duties as a fully fledged OFN member.

In the most recent summit hosted in Iberia itself, more specifically the region of Cataluña, a fascinating subject was raised that our delegation had not considered before the meeting, as we had expected just discussions on military and diplomatic matters.\n\nLa Canadiense, one of our state run electricity providers that came into our hands during the great European economic slump of the 50s when Belgian and Canadian private investors panickingly sold their stocks and assets to us seemed to be considerable interest to the Iberians. Seemingly the Iberians planned to surprise us with their proposals to buy the assets, based in the region we were currently in, right at the end of rigorous discussions on other more pressing diplomatic matters as to take advantage of our desires to leave the sweltering conference room quickly.

The piece of paper more importantly however stated in simple terms that the Iberians were ready to begin negotiations on officially entering the OFN as a key strategic ally in Europe. The decision that now has to be made, and it wasn't just his to make but other OFN members would follow suit, could be described as a key turning point in history.

Disappointed civil servants were in the process of abandoning the plans that had been made well in advance for the diplomats' arrival when an important notice was passed onto all ministries within the Iberian governmental structure. The Americans had sent an official letter, cordial in tone, declaring that due to vital strategic considerations when analyzing the European situation, Iberia was currently not able to be accepted in the OFN, a blow that struck hard considering the steadily improving relations between our nation and the democracies of the world. A major caveat was included in the letter however, Iberia would be allowed to join in a limited capacity as an OFN Observer. [ROOT.GetLeader] viewed the offer of the letter with more gratitude than many of his pessimistic ministers. The option to become an observer nation to the alliance would deepen ties across the Atlantic over time and perhaps lead to another chance for the Iberians.

A possibly very lucrative enterprise considering the strength of a Europe still shrouded in darkness and a protective far East. It however would not come without danger as the Germans have proven themselves in recent decades to not be very sensible folk, especially when reacting to foreign made stimuli.

Instead of sending a diplomatic delegation of their own to visit our splendid homeland and continuing to foster better relations, the Americans have merely sent us a letter of appreciation. It contains a "warm" thanks for our efforts, but seems to contain little else for our analysts to go on. Seemingly the OFN still views having closer relations with our nation as a security hazard considering our close proximity to the slowly strengthening Fortress Europe.

 #IBR.715.d:0 "During the euphoric German mania that seeped postwar Europe, one of the most damaging projects the National Socialists undertook was the building of the Gibraltar dam, a project doomed to fail with the foundations of the German economy being built on forgotten lies and empty promises. The consequences have been disastrous for the Mediterranean, the Union of Iberia included. It's economic growth and capacity shrunken by the failed construction project. With Iberia's democratization and diplomatic thawing, we have seen the former pseudo-fascistic bastardized nation align itself closer to our strengthening alliance of free nations. In one of the more recent diplomatic summits which included representatives from the European state, the issue of the dam and its incomplete nature were raised and discussed at great length. Considering our current foreign policy that favors closer ties to Iberia a considerable investment into the completion of construction could mean long term returns for us but also more importantly a more economically powerful dependent ally in a region of great strategic importance. However, there is always opportunity cost. The money could be used well in our own national economy and vocal, influential nationalists might consider the move unfounded and unnecessary causing political instability."

 #IBR.716.t:0 "The OFN Says it Won't Help With The Dam" CUT
 #IBR.716.d:0 "Our quite reasonable suggestion at a recent diplomatic summit in America with OFN members on needing investment for the incomplete Gibraltar dam has been rejected outright. The economic possibilities that this project could have had for our nation are very considerable, the thorn stuck in our side could finally have been removed to unlock previously unimaginable possibilities for trade and electricity production. Therefore this is an extremely disappointing development considering our huge efforts to get closer to America and its allies despite the fearsome dangers it could bring for us from other European states less inclined towards the capitalist bloc. This betrayal will not be quickly forgotten both by our government and the Iberian people, who have found out via an unfortunate media leak. Since we cannot really retreat from our current foreign policy direction this has just reduced several key strides made so far. Hopefully our relations can improve relatively quickly so we can get back on track for solving other issues with the OFN."

 IBR.726.t:0 "American Advisors Arrive"
 IBR.726.d:0 "American advisors have arrived to assist our military. Now that they are here, the question is how to best involve them with the military. They will fit in any role we place them in, but there is still uncertainty to the degree they will be integrated with the military. We could place them in the general staff, which given their loyalty to us could be helpful, as well as the larger benefit they could provide to our military. If we were to keep them as separate advisors, it would be less controversial.\n\nThe population of Iberia is rather divided on this move, so we will need to make a decision with the opinions of the public in mind."

The Americans are a bunch of rowdy, loyal probably-not-fascists, who have no interest in letting our government be destroyed. By embedding the Americans in the military, we have secured several pairs of eyes and ears within the general staff. They have no interest in feeding us false information, so we can trust their leaks and rely on them to know what the general staff is planning."
 IBR.727.a:0 "I see why the Americans like their military so much."
 
 IBR.728.t:0 "Iberians Approve Of Less American Involvement"
 IBR.728.d:0 "The people of Iberia often have many wishes and desires, but on rare occasions all of their interests line up to create an easy political move. As it so happens, most of the people in the country are conservative minded. They are hardly xenophobic, but by-and-large are wary of outside influences, which they see as subversive.\n\nBy keeping the advisors on the sidelines and truly only advising, as we have, we have reached a situation that only benefits us. More reformist minds are pleased by our efforts to court the Americans, while those wary of outsiders are happy that we have kept them to the sidelines, where a would-be subversive cannot do as much."

 IBR.722.d:0 "Since the establishment of the Iberian Union shortly after the Second World War, its relationship with the Reich has been one marked by cold distrust and perpetual tension.

As one of the largest nations in Europe, both by population and GDP, Iberia could prove an invaluable partner in spite of our troubled past.\n\nIberian diplomat Alberto Franco Nogueira has presented a proposal for a Non-Aggression Pact between Iberia and Germany.

With access to this valuable material cut off, its general pricing has fluctuated significantly, causing widespread economic downturn among many countries in the process.\n\nUnfortunately, the [Root.GetName] was not spared from this, as a majority of its oil was imported from abroad. At the same time, as the situation escalates, nations with large stockpiles either refuse to sell any of their precious petroleum, or spike its price to extremely high values. Another disadvantage brought about by this oil shortage is the departure of several foreign businesses operating in Iberia alongside the mass frenzy of investors, panicking and selling their stocks before it's too late. This has led the [Root.GetName] to experience nationwide cycles of worker lay-offs, mass unemployment, and incurment of large amounts of debt. The government has announced plans to devote its remaining resources intensely in order to quickly solve the immediate problems, but the entire situation still remains uncertain."

I know these rat bastard separatists better than you, and I know them well enough to tell you this won't be the end of it. Do you think we can survive another Barcelona? I don't, Antonio.

Not everyone has a house, and some lack the means to gain one. Even worse, some do - but they live in squalor and filth. It is true that we provide housing already, but our programs are not sufficient. I would propose intervention into the housing market, with the specifics to be worked out later. It is our duty to make sure the people of Iberia do not want when we could provide."\n\n"But we can't provide, can we?" responded another councilman. "For all the comprehensive programs you and your bunch keep proposing, you never seem to stop and consider the budget. Well, we're going to consider the budget!

 IBR.4012.t:0 "The Question of Colonial Citizenship" 
 IBR.4012.d:0 "A growing movement in the congress has finally found itself sufficient support to debate colonial citizenship.\n\nIberian citizenship is granted automatically to anyone who has a parent with Iberian citizenship - at face value, it is a simple policy. However, it becomes significantly more complicated once one factors in other processes, such as colonial residence. The natives are considered non-Iberian, and denied citizenship. Effectively, they are denied any of the benefits one would gain from citizenship.\n\nA clique in the congress has argued against this policy, for several reasons. Some find it unjust to deny the natives citizenship, since they lived on the land before our settlers, and others oppose it for more practical reasons. They desire to create a "collaborator" group within the native populations with which to sabotage the others, or simply to ease administrative strain. The end result is the same: to give all African natives Iberian citizenship.\n\nTo say this argument experienced significant pushback is an understatement. Opposition has been fierce, with a great many wishing to maintain the status quo. The settler groups wish to keep the situation as it is, as the current laws work very favorably for the Iberian settlers. Ultimately, it is still the call of the Caudillos."

Despite their claims otherwise, it is glaringly obvious that they are upset by the fact that natives will no longer be treated as second-class citizens, and the new legal parity has upset those who took their supremacy for granted. The word of the Caudillos is still supreme, and it seems about time that they be reminded of the finality of the government's decisions."

It seemed as if the move would be a political expense and nothing more. To everyone's surprise, a group of natives showed up, counter protesting for the government. While the assembly did not come to blows, it came very close as law enforcement dispersed the protest.\n\nEven though this was a spontaneous action, it is representative of sentiments within native populations. We have been formally thanked by several native organizations - through the same channels as the settlers, in what seems to have been spite - for our decisions to extend citizenship."

 IBR.4015.d:0 "Tensions have reached an all-time high as Iberian mainlanders, furious with their lack of legal primacy, have resorted to less-than-legal methods of intimidating nearby colonials. Bands of retornados, armed with makeshift weapons, have started to hunt down and beat colonials they find vulnerable. This escalated when the natives started to fight back, creating what were quickly nicknamed "brigas repentinas", for their spontaneous and violent nature. As all incidents do, these fights began to escalate from two or three to as many as ten to fifteen on each side.\n\nIt has escalated again. After the murder of a retornado by a colonial native, riots have broken out in several major cities around the colonies.between both.

Their conversation eventually leads them to the great question: what were they in for? All present had the same reason, the "disruption of common decency", but they all knew they were in for protesting the new citizenship laws. They were eventually split up, incarcerated for their deeds.\n\nSights like this had become very common, at least for a small while. As the Guardia Civil intervened, they arrested a large number of rioting settlers. Following the show of force, most of those remaining surrendered. It seems like they won't be complaining about citizenship again."

Regardless, it never paid to be unaware. He read the paper itself, expressing yet more legal provisions and regulations that, ultimately, just added up to common sense and basic decency. His silent musing was interrupted by the clicking of cameras, the flashes providing a harsh incentive to keep looking down. He supposed that nobody would be unsure of how the paperwork worked.\n\nThey found him again as he took the picture for his ID card, forcing him to keep the artificially widened smile on for even longer than he ever wanted. Better that than to frown for the cameras, he supposed.\n\nThe day came when the ID was ready to be received. Swamped by the press for what was undoubtedly an important day, he did his best pretend-to-want-to-be-here smile and held it up for everyone to see.\n\nSomeone asked him, "How does it feel to be the first native to get citizenship?".

A few slaps, a couple of punches, but the two were held back by their advanced age.\n\nYet again, the council was in stunned silence. The army representative suddenly stood up, almost dragging the Axencia agent out of his seat.\n\n"We need to stop them before they hurt themselves!" The officer turned the agent to the door. "Find a phone, call the Guardia Civil."\n\nAs the Axencia representative ran off, the military man turned to the rest of the council. He needed to lead them, too, it seemed.

The two began fighting one another, presumably to figure out who would help their preferred Caudillo. It seems the spirit of pugilism was contagious, since most of the other council members had gotten into miniature brawls of their own.\n\nKnowing there was nothing he could do, the officer sighed and walked to the door. He figured that he could watch for the Guard and also keep an eye on the Caudillos. He hardly had to wait for the Guard, as several officers walked in a few moments after me made it near the door.\n\nThe situation was easily explained with a sweep of the hand - a good most of the council was fighting itself, and a handful were trying to pull people off of one another. It only took one person to stop the Caudillos from fighting, simply pushing the two old men apart, and the rest of the council took several minutes to stop. Most had the sense to stop once they saw the Guard arrive, however.\n\nThe Guardia Civil dispersed the meeting, and sent everyone away with mostly bruises and scrapes.

He didn't seem to be dead on closer inspection, merely unconscious, but those few moments allowed all hell to break loose.\n\nThe soldier beheld the true nature of the discussion, as the entire council dissolved into anarchy. Man fought man, and although nobody seemed to be using weapons, they sure did zealously swing their fists. Nothing he could do about any of them, his mind quickly thought, so he did the one thing he could.\n\nIt was very easy to break up the Caudillos, simply a matter of prying apart two old men. Then, he kept the two away from each other until the Guardia Civil arrived - a tense few minutes. The Guard did much more to break up the meeting than he could, seemingly absorbing the hostility of the rumble and using it against the council men.\n\nAfter an eternity of fighting, the final damages were tallied. A large number of members had been arrested for their brawling, and the Caudillos were sent to their homes to stew for a while, until the event was behind them.

The system is decentralized, and the regional courts can run around as if they are independent!" He quietly hoped that didn't seem too monotone. "Iberia can only fulfil its promise of unity when all elements of the country are united as if they were never separate. Our courts are no different. Are there any questions?"\n\nSomeone, to his dread, had a question. "How would we best integrate these courts? Centralization should only be attempted if we can ensure it does not go poorly. Therefore, I want to hear your ideas on the matter."\n\nOh no.\n\nIn an act of divine providence, someone was able to interject and answer the question, moving the pressure away from him.

Because of its position, it is coincidentally a very important institution to keep loyal. The faith of many leads them to believe the Church, and if the Church is friendly to us, then so will the congregations follow. Some would argue that this is not a good thing.\n\nThere has been an argument that the influence of the Church - its monopolistic control over education, religion, and in many ways the thoughts of the faithful - is too great. The same groups arguing this propose that the Church's influence be checked, so that Iberia is not dependent on its loyalty.

Were he a sensible man, he wouldn't have abandoned his poached egg and toasted bread for the letter apparently rushed to him from Madrid, but unfortunately for him he was a politician and such sense was not allowed in this profession.\n\nBright eyes quickly scanned the letter, absorbing both the written word and the unwritten intent behind them all at once. He stood from the table as he reached the end, his mind already turning over the newfound information. According to the letter, the Shadow State was storming into the French rump state and to no one's surprise, the French were receiving the worst of the fighting. The French had been more or less a non-factor for over a decade, unable to maintain control of much of the country outside of Algiers itself. That's why they were here in Oran after all, and the Italians on the other side of the garrison.\n\nBut the letter was much more vague with its actual orders, a necessary tactic to maintain plausible deniability should it somehow fall outside of Iberian hands and cause a scandal. That didn't matter though, they wouldn't have sent him this letter without knowing what he'd do once he got to reading it, and already, he was deep in thought.\n\nA spin, Iberia needed a spin to justify the acquisition of Algeria. While, yes, militarily occupied by both themselves and Italians, it was still legally French, and they weren't in a position to simply take the rest of the country by storm. After all, if they did that, they'd be fighting Italians, not the scarecrow army of the French State. So what excuse could they conjure up that would prevent the Italians from intervening?\n\nHe sat there deep in thought for some time, running through the scenarios in his head. It was clear that whatever scheme was cooked up, they'd have to work with the Italians directly to achieve it.

But in these modern times, it seems like every rock, every blade of grass and every grain of sand is owned by somebody, somewhere, and no one was interested in selling. The world was as small as it was ever going to be, and no one saw value in losing their corner of it.\n\nThat's why when the Caudillos called the greatest military and diplomatic minds of Iberia together to discuss plans for the French Colony of Algeria, they came not with vague ideas and concepts, but with papers, with maps, with briefcases and books worth of schemes. This was an opportunity that they all knew they'd never again see in their lifetimes, a chance to be known as the conqueror- through guns or through words- of Algeria.\n\nGenerals came with grand campaigns and elaborate war plans, some even going as far as to invade Tunis and Libya should the Italians stand in their way. Diplomats cracked open briefcases to reveal grand schemes and plans to buy or swindle the Italian half of Algeria out from beneath their feet.

A limited war, but with the added benefit of looking towards the white French colonials in Algeria for support, and the creation of a cooperative government with them in the process. The Kaúlza Plan, as it has been called since he first presented it to the Caudillos, calls for open warfare in Algeria to simultaneously drive out the Italians and pacify the natives all in one fell swoop. The generals have rallied behind the Kaúlza Plan, and already believe that Salazar will support them.\n\nMeanwhile, among the Diplomats, Adriano Moreira's plan had proven to be the most attractive. Rather than approaching the Italian government directly- which would require a great deal of expense to acquire the Italian half of the region- he proposes that Iberia should instead approach the Italian Oil Giant, ENI. If they can convince ENI to support the Iberian claim to Algeria in exchange for a generous deal on oil development in the region, ENI could in turn put much more intense pressure on Italy to accept the Iberian claim.

 IBR.4105.d:0 "It was mid-day when Salazar entered the meeting room. Normally they wouldn't time a meeting so oddly, but Franco had requested he enter once he had fully collected his thoughts on the Algerian issue, and not one moment earlier or later. Sadly, what this meant was that Franco had to dedicate nearly the entire day to waiting, for whenever his counterpart finally got around to attending. He was thankful, then, that they showed up shortly after lunch.\n\nAs expected, Salazar got to talking as soon as he closed the door behind him.\n\n"I had to see everything, but I've made up my mind- Algeria needs to be secured. At any cost, it doesn't matter, we need to guarantee the retornados a home." Franco began to open his mouth to respond, but Salazar snapped at him first. "Don't start about pragmatism to me, not about this. Those retornados were exiled from their home once already, I would rather die than let them be kicked out again, and so soon after the first time! Arriaga's plan will guarantee them their home, and he'll make sure those Italian bastards recognize it!"\n\nFranco half-sighed, half-grunted in annoyance. "I can't fault you for being passionate about your people, but you are refusing to see the larger picture. We need peace in Algeria. A war will win them the land, maybe, but then where will you be, when they all die fighting for it? What good would it do, Salazar?" Salazar started a response, getting out perhaps half a word before Franco interrupted him. "Whatever we settle on, just remember. It needs to be unanimous...""

He spared a glance to his colleague - who was more focused on the plans before them - before returning his gaze to Kazula and Moreira, who seemed more concerned with shuffling through their things. Eventually, they both prepared to present, but Kazula was mandated to go first.\n\nHe spoke loud, with a boisterous tone that showed his total confidence in his plans. He didn't have any formal charts or flashy models, but simply passed out two pieces of paper and laid a map out on the conference table, a map of Algeria. He detailed the situation (as he saw it), then carefully explained how they could swipe the rest of the country from the Italians. To this end, he also explained the contents of the documents he passed out - they were manifests, of the equipment they'd require, optimistically, to get the job done.\n\nOnce Kazula finished, it was time for Moreira to present his plan for Algeria. During the war plan briefing, the politician had taken the time to properly set up a presentation, though his delivery left some to be desired. He explained his plan, how working with ENI could win Algeria, and of how to make deals situated to look desirable to them. He pointed out the resources required, and how to best use them. With a style of utilizing as little words as possible, his side of the meeting concluded remarkably quickly.\n\nAs both sides had finished their presentation, the Caudillos spoke their verdict. While they both made designs to sell their plans, what the two didn't know was that the Caudillos had both already decided. They told the two, in their back-and-forth speech style, that..."

Attentive anticipation turned to curiosity, and from there to excitement all in the space of a paragraph, as Jardim found himself unable to suppress a laugh. A brand new job, specially for him, as soon as he was finished with his tenure in Algeria. Even better, they were going to pay him for work he wasn't yet doing! Today was going to be a good day, he was already sure.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Iberia proper, there was no laughing, for the "top brass" Jardim was going to join found the entire affair much less amusing.

 IBR.5000.d:0 ""I come before you today with a message containing a stark warning, it is your choice, Iberia's choice, whether to heed this warning or to succumb to the detrimental consequences otherwise. We have emerged victorious out of a dark age, some may call it our golden age, but they are either selfishly devious of nature or misinformed. This dark age gave forth the idea that a centralised self sufficient economy was needed to maximise output. Now two important things are to be noted here ladies and gentlemen. The time that this idea emerged under and the results wanted, both inextricably linked, are a product of that dark age. Can anyone here explain to me the need in this atomic age of requiring a war economy geared towards output instead of growth and the welfare of citizens?"\n\n"I come before you today, professing the warning that this era of mindless economic policy has to stop before we fall behind the rest of the world and are eternally forgotten as a union of two of the world's most decadent empires. We must reform, and the reform must be in the direction of freedom. It is precisely economic freedom which ultimately gives people freedom in their daily lives. This, Iberians, is what we will strive for.""

 IBR.5001.t:0 "The Privatization of Government Assets"
 IBR.5001.d:0 "Not shortly after Ullastres gave his well received speech the market-centred new state apparatus kicked into gear, its mission to slowly dismantle itself for the good of the country and less obviously itself. Many of the state run industries which had been under the jurisdiction of multiple government ministries, like the defense or interior, were beginning to be packaged and repurposed to be sold to Iberian private investors who had slightly different goals than their state counterparts. As conservative and falangist protests are springing up around the nation, none large enough to be of immediate concern, the market was beginning its impersonal processes, valuing the prices for the various new products that had just been added to the selection of supply. How this reform will play out only time and the 'invisible hand' can tell."

 IBR.5002.t:0 "Privatization Efforts End in Disaster"
 IBR.5002.d:0 "It seems the protestors, in their vehement and often ridiculous sounding arguments, had found some kernels of truth. The privatization effort of multiple state industries, which had been running in the red or generally been a pain for the state, produced unwelcome circumstances in the new more market-oriented economy. At first it seemed as if the state would be running a loss selling capital at a price below the rate expected. This did not bother us, as the main goal was to stimulate the economy and not exploit these sales. Yet as time went by, it seems that private investors were not quite as accustomed to the new Iberian economy as Ullatres had hoped. It was not long before many were asking for subsidies to provide lucrative contracts to the state instead of working on the market. Even worse, it seems that others read some loopholes in the sale agreements and were selling them to foreign investors. It may be necessary for the state to intervene to correct certain market failures..."

 IBR.5003.d:0 "An acceptable amount has been gained from the recent privatization of state firms, yet it should not go unnoticed that the expectations of the pessimistic conservative elements of our nation were certainly far exceeded. With a decent stream of revenue from leases and direct sales public spending can even be revamped, if only slightly. However even more importantly the Iberian government's move has stimulated the invisible hand of the free market to begin to work its magic with the concepts of demand and supply, something which in the previous era had almost strictly been adhered to only to state needs."

 IBR.5004.d:0 "The 'Miracle of Madrid' they called it, yet this ignored what truly was an awesome display of Iberian entrepreneurship and commerce that rather should be known as it rather should be known as the 'General Iberian spring'. With the privatization of state firms from multiple struggling ministries at the behest of the government, a strong spike in economic activity has occurred, mostly obviously in the private sector. The investors have not let the old capital go to waste in the slightest and are letting mismanaged assets finally come to fruition, being exploited to their full worth for profit and dividends.

To some, even more importantly were the economic reforms guaranteeing Iberia as a haven for free marketers in a continent of state organised economics. The difference in bringing about prosperity between the two forms of economic management are starting to show effects, even in the short term.

To see its power one must look no further than the renewed prosperity and might of the USA. A giant awakened, almost towering over the other great power regimes. Why not emulate this? Yet we have to be careful, this cannot be thrust onto our people without consideration of the lack of liberty in Iberian culture. How can such a powerful tool be given to a citizenry who still in parts respects the empty promises of demagogues whether on the right or left? This has to be a slow process, one guided by our party as we have Iberia's future at the core of our mission, not personal advantage. This is our mission from God, to infuse the culture with individualism and its accompanying responsibility.

This was an important event as it could mean a further consolidation of power for the government, enabling them to push through reforms at a quicker rate while guaranteeing their effectiveness on the ground. Hence it was extremely important for the party that this event would go in their favor. Some critics have stated that the government is putting too much attention towards these elections and pivoting away from other pressing issues of state however official statements have repudiated this harshly, labelling some of the hit pieces against them as disinformation."

 IBR.5007.d:0 "Since these upcoming regional elections are vital in securing a strong base in local areas for the party and to ease in reforms it is necessary to develop a coherent, popular posture on dealing with social issues. The most important of these being the political status of women and minorities due to the stability issue of the union which greatly affected the concept of the Iberian identity. We can however not just limit ourselves in the social sphere to this as our nation is not just plagued by a hovering identity crisis. Once the range of issues and their importance have been made clear, we next need to actually choose our stances. Should we appeal more to the Conservative portions of the country, who naturally hold great sway in elections from the despotist era, or should we rather target the liberal elements who mostly congregate in the urban areas."

Weighing up the positives and negatives of the two options makes one realize the precarious situation Iberia truly is in; were we to go with the more market oriented approach we may risk conservative elements of the populace and business world at the very least acting non compliant while not pursuing the free market approach may leave our economy lagging behind ultimately in the global market."

This ultimately will give us enough political capital to begin to try to push through reforms on a local level, but we will still incur heavy costs and have to compromise. These are a necessary part of the ebb the flow of promises that we have to make the electorate.\n\nThe experience still has taught us something though as we now know more about what will appeal to this strata of the populace for future elections.

 IBR.5010.d:0 "A great shock, both for the party itself and many establishment figures, hit Madrid today as results from the recent election started to filter in. The PRD has made significant gains in Conservative areas of the nation, something that despite the large amount of propaganda dedicated to the campaign had seemed impossible. It was initially planned and predicted that a small entry point could be made, from which the party could begin to expand their influence. This may now not even be necessary anymore, as with these results future policy changes will be far easier to implement and likely will not receive any sort of major protests. Consolidation will have to be carried out with due diligence, as now losing what had been gained would be a great smear on the party, even on the national level."

Yet despite wishful thinking nothing changed between numerous inspections of the election results. The party had been unable to make major gains in liberal areas, something which had seemed to be a guarantee considering their normal platform. Had there been too many policy concessions to appease conservatives? Had local dignitaries been unaware of the actual electoral mood? All questions that would need to be answered if the party can continue to try to govern and bring Iberia forward into the brighter future they have envisioned. Despite this roadblock likely taking some time to get over some officials cite the gains as an achievement nonetheless and something to be built on. This may be true but did nothing to raise sullied moods."

These were very important to the party, despite their almost ensured support, as future policy would be built upon their backing and any sort of electoral challenge could now be squashed with their votes. However as most dignitaries celebrated, some of the higher level party members were already in deep conversation on the topic of liberal expectation and conservative moderation. Policy changes would certainly come across differently in the two opposing camps. Finding a balance between the two as not to antagonise either to any greater extent was vital both for the stability of the party and the nation."

 IBR.5014.d:0 "A Liberal thorn, or perhaps further left, was wedged into the soft flesh of party complacency. Because of course the Iberian people are a Catholic one but, under foreign influence and internal oppression, views on certain social issues have radically altered.\n\nIt should have been a peaceful, normal working day with hurried economic activity in the second largest city of the Union. Instead many major roads in Barcelona are blocked by throngs of people protesting for something they have no right to, divorce for any reason. This cannot stand; sedition like this spreading among the populace would shift Iberian politics out of control. Hence the protest must be countered in such a way that is discredited, not merely broken up. The message must be killed, not its messengers. Perhaps some counter protests may do the trick, organized by our friends in the Opus Dei to show the true will of the Iberian people against these hooligans."

 IBR.5015.d:0 "The numerous men of cloth and their countless supporters have succeeded in their mission to drive out heretical thought from the still impressionable minds of the Iberian people.\n\nOpus Dei's large rally in Barcelona ran into the initial divorce protestors on their second day, and was easily able to drown out any influence that could have been enacted on the people's psyche. Their success has allowed the administration some much needed breathing room. The insistence to win hearts and minds instead of using brute force to quash the social revolt has been a clever move to save face with the more left-leaning elements in the country and in the PRD support base.

 IBR.5016.t:0 "Counter Protests Prove to be Ineffective" 
 IBR.5016.d:0 "The effort to create an effective counter protest by the government has been foiled. Not only was the intended outcome of reducing the credibility of the original divorce protest not achieved, but many liberals have also taken issue with government policy considering promises made in local elections. Finding the link between the counter protest organised by the religious followers and the current administration had not been a hard job as speculation regarding the connection between the two groups had been running rampant since the initial swearing in of the party.\n\nA multitude of marches and other forms of protest have begun to erupt around the nation, mostly confined to the larger cities, that condemn the administration of forgoing their promises to maintain strong relations with Catholics and conservatives alike, playing the game of politics instead of staying true to their word. Crackdowns are already occurring, luckily with minimal violence, but the whole affair has left a stain the government may not ever be truly able to clean."

It was unannounced, causing worry from those who believed it to be an emergency address. Luckily this was not the case; rather the president had taken it that this would be a good time to reiterate the importance of Catholic Church in the lives of every Iberian. Using a politicians tongue and expert hyperbole he went on to make his statement for around twenty minutes, delving into history and its lessons for modern society, drawing parallels between godlessness and chaos. Finishing not too soon he also mentioned Opus Dei in positive terms, giving those he presided over the advice to seek out their support in case of emotional distress or a lack of faith.

Iberia has become a beacon of freedom on the European continent, a bright light in the dark swathes of authoritarianism. All that had to be done was to create more economic freedoms for the people, to allow choice where previously had been mandate. After all how could it all be managed from the top down? The party was not God and neither was this his kingdom.\n\nClearly not everyone was as eager to accept this new opportunity for the union, some had to have their faith reinstilled, often just by positive social reinforcement. On other occasions the vigilant Opus Dei organization was always ready to help. However they have seen the light now, the way forwards into the harmonious society that will be representative of God's will on earth."

 IBR.5020.d:0 "Ullastres stepped forward to the podium, waiting patiently for the gathered ministers and journalists to quieten down before speaking. "The state of the various governmental institutions that were inherited from the dark era of the Caudillos is in dire need of reform. There will be no capability to transform the nation into a stable and prosperous union of equals without, and excuse the metaphor here," he winked almost cheekily while a few laughs were heard in the auditorium, "a great flood to uproot the former constitutional mess of the botched unification."\n\n"The autarchical nature of the old economic and even state policy is best fit for the intolerant hermit nation we once were. We were not listening, we were drawing back into ourselves. Well ladies and gentlemen, I say no more!" He stood back for a moment, again waiting for the applause to subside. "Clearly we will require great expertise for such a task, yet I am confident our new government is up to the challenge. We are also very fortunate to have amassed a significant amount of ties to experts in various fields of the private sector who recognize that it's in their interests to support the recovery. Therefore, do not fret; children of this great country, the nation of Iberia will stand strong and proud, a rock of liberty in a sea of tyranny! There shall be no harkening back to a great era once lost, we will forge our own, right now, that those who will come after us will imitate for eternity to come."

 IBR.5021.t:0 "Advice From a Trusted Friend"
 IBR.5021.d:0 "Following what has already been established as a keynote speech in Iberian political history the new president of the Iberia, head of the reformist market liberals, has seemingly been hard at work establishing the groundwork for the grandiose promises he had made. His staffers have rarely seen Ullastres leave his office with only few people coming to visit, one of these however being the founder of the religious organization Opus Dei, Josemaría Escrivá.\n\nThe man of God has been rather frequent in his visits, often carrying large briefcases overflowing with charts and other assorted papers. Clearly Ullastres had made good on his previous statement about consulting private sector experts to help in forming government policies that will move towards greater economic liberalisation of the nation. Relying on the Catholic likely proves the president's will still play to the traditional base despite his widespread reform plans."

 IBR.5024.t:0 "Formulating an Anti-Corruption Strategy"
 IBR.5024.d:0 "Citizens of Iberia were greeted today with unsettling news. A government probe has discovered that local institutions around the nation were infested with crooked civil servants who were funded by businesses and private interest groups from the previous era. Their goals were still unclear but their treachery was obvious. Only by chance and skill of the investigators had this scandal been uncovered as judges and other lawmen had covered for the traitors. Even more menacingly it seems that this corruption and nepotism was not just restricted to the various regions of the peninsula but rather had even made its way up to the national level.\n\nNationwide people began to match on the streets protesting against this outrage, calling for the government to intervene. And intervene it shall, but what should be focused on first? The political establishment that had secured and furthered the crookedness of the numerous businessmen who helped fund them along the way?"

 IBR.5025.d:0 "With the rampant corruption that had been recently uncovered by government investigators the many options on how to deal with the situation now lie on the table for Ullastres and his party to consider. The choice to be made is not a simple one with both sides bringing hefty negatives that will weigh heavily on the shoulders of the administration. This should not be a surprise however as no disaster of this scale is likely to reap many positives. Not even when the old seats can be filled with those loyal to the new Iberia. The more benevolent option is to continue monitoring the traitors and try to reform them, only seeking to eliminate those beyond saving and who have done the most damage. The effectiveness of this is unclear sadly, hence may harm long term goals of the government. Mass arrests on the other hand will make sure that the system can be rebuilt, fashioned into a more effective state devoid of the taint of the of the past. Yet this will not go without consequences when caving to the public. A hard choice will need to be made. "

Riot police clad in armour, kitted out with shields and other equipment that would speak of a serious riot began amassing in the main streets of cities all around the peninsula. Even small conservative rural towns were not spared of this treatment either, rather they seemed to garner the most state attention.\n\nShortly after noon it became clear why, in many of the locations that were covered large mobs began to assemble, waving placards and posters decrying the government crackdown on conservative and falangists, painting them to be one of political sabotage. Having had time to set up and gain advantageous positions the police was able to control the protests and keep most of the planned marches peaceful. A great strategic victory for our government that even the press praised highly.

The head of Opus Dei, Josemaría Escrivá, who had been making his way home after the meeting with president earlier in the day had been shot by a lone assailant while climbing into his car. He had been quickly rushed to the hospital, but his condition at this point in time was unclear. It was likely that the would be assassin was a falangist unhappy with the current political situation. The gears were already beginning to turn even before the staffer could finish, Ullastres considered the possible assassin list and motives, considered reprimands, considered consequences.

In his momentary weakness the president stepped forward, stumbling almost, to the side of his friend. He almost shrieked when suddenly Escrivá's eyes snapped open and he gripped Ullastres' arm tightly. "Come closer," he whispered gravely.

 IBR.5404.t:0 "Slashing Fuel Subsidies"
 IBR.5404.d:0 "The previous provision of fuel subsidies to certain sectors of the economy had been justified upon the grounds that it was a necessary component for industry to grow and hence should be provided to an extent by the government to help Spain compete abroad. Even prior to the crisis this policy had been deeply criticised by members of our government who argued that all it was doing was wasting precious resources which would have been allocated more efficiently by the market. The crisis has given these arguments further impetus, throwing even previous defenders behind the idea that reform was needed. In order to adjust to the crisis, we hence need to ensure that the little oil we can salvage for the economy is allocated to the sectors of the economy that need it. Hence only those that can pay full price and highly demand it should be able to claim it."

The extreme free marketers continue to hold by the mantra that the only good market regulation is no market regulation. A choice has to hence be made, do we support slight reform and possibly compromise upon our ideals or do we hold steadfast and run the risk of letting the crisis further tank the Iberian economy?"

They now demand that interest payments on government debt have to be moved forwards in order to safeguard their other investments. Our state should only be a simple night watchman, providing law and order to ensure uncompromised movement of market forces. For us to accumulate debts is a sin and represents failure. We likely should hence pay them back now.\n\nYet we are completely in our right to withhold on these payments. The previous payments have all gone according to procedure and we are on target to effectively deal with our debt in the near future. The demands to pay back now seem almost preposterous. To deal with both the crisis and these payments could result in terrible economic consequences. A decision has to be made."

Moving swiftly onwards Ullastres attended to the matter of complaints over government action. Conceding that certain actions, no matter whether their intention was aimed towards the greater good, negatively had impacted some parts of the population. Directly addressing those who were currently employed he promised that with the eventual upcoming upswing in the economy there surely will be a place for them to return to. He however did not apologise. Staying resolute he argued that the policies of the government had been a necessary countermeasure to prevent the crisis from deepening further and critically affecting the economy. With the reforms the newly restructured economy, which now would be able to gain even more from free market efficiency, would emerge from the crisis stronger and more durable to future shocks. When the good times come with this development so too would the benefits trickle down to the public. Finishing with a sheepish smile he added that in time the populace will thank the PRD for what they have done to save the Iberian economy."

 IBR.624.d:0 "Regionalism was the scourge of Iberia. It had been that way all the way back to the Reconquista, when the peninsula had been divided amongst half a dozen warring kings. For centuries regionalism was allowed to fester until it became a sagging boil that exploded into two devastating civil wars. Now, with democracy restored and the sensible administrators of the Alianza Popular in power, Iberia had a once in a millenia opportunity to put aside regionalism once and for all. Jorge Verstrynge knew this. His enemies in Congress did not.\n\nFor almost an hour now they had been causing a scene, the parliamentarians of the Unión Republicana and the Partido Renovador Democrático, berating the government in the strongest possible terms over its opposition to the autonomy of the regions. Verstrynge had listened to their outbursts quietly, allowing others from his party to respond to their cajoling, but he was growing tired of the antics. Taking the next opportunity to speak, he rose to the podium.\n\n"Fellow Deputies, I have listened intently to the intervention of those opposite. And I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed. It is as if those opposite have forgotten all the events of the past 40 years. How separatism fueled the divisions of Spain and tore it apart in civil war. How Iberia mere years ago was plunged into the fires of seperatist insanity, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. Well, we here in the government have not forgotten the dead! We have not forgotten the debt of blood that Iberia owes to the martyrs who died for its liberty and unity against separatists and extremists alike! No, we will not allow you to once again fan the flames of separatism that have torn this nation apart. We in the government will chart a new course, one towards a strong, united Iberia!"\n\nThe opposition howled in indignation at Verstrynge's fiery retort, and the debate raged on and on."

 IBR.625.d:0 "Iberia was, and always would be, a unitary country, ruled from the center. The victory of the Alianza Popular had made sure of that, and President Manuel Fraga Iribarne wanted to make sure everyone else remembered it. Regionalist hysteria and terroristic separatism would not be tolerated in the new, democratic Iberia. He knew that the sooner that everyone, including the troublesome separatists themselves, understood and accepted this, the better off everyone would be.\n\nThe new law just passed by Congress made that very very clear. Defining the rights and duties of Iberia's regions, the legislation practically ended all pretense of political autonomy, leaving them more as symbolic institutions than actual levers of government. A large portion of people would undoubtedly be very angry. The opposition were practically livid. They would all get over it eventually.\n\nYet there was little point rubbing salt in an open wound. The separatists would be offered a few small symbolic concessions, things that might be of some importance to them, but of little real significance to the unity and security of Iberia. What did he care if the Catalans and Basque wanted to speak their own languages in private? Or perform their own little national dances? Such things harmed no-one.\n\nHe would of course anger the hardliners in his party and those further to the right, but that was inevitable when charting a course away from the ruinous, divisive politics of the past regime. Franga knew that he was in a unique position to finally solve the issue of the regions once and for all, and forge a democratic and truly united Iberia.

The blue sky stretches overhead unto the horizon, and beneath its azure canopy a man in ragged, old-fashioned peasant's clothing heaves and grunts at the back end of an old iron plow, muttering curses at the stubborn ox hitched to the front. "Move, you old bastard!" bellows the peasant, swinging a leather whip at the beast's hindquarters. A nobleman on horseback, dressed in rural finery, chuckles and canters forth, giving the ox a whack with his riding crop and finally setting the mound of muscle in motion. The ox gives a guttural bray, lifting its head from grazing and continuing on its arduous journey across the field. The peasant smiles and raises a fist in triumph, drawing cheers from the large crowd of onlookers seated nearby. A camera clicks, capturing a memory of the past come back to life.\n\nOf course, this is no 16th-century farm, but the first annual 'Rural Roots Festival', designed to honour Iberia's rural past. Held on a warm day near Madrid, the festival has drawn tens of thousands so far with many more expected to arrive from as far afield as Catalonia and Portugal. The peasant and nobleman are just two of many historical re-enactors who have been tirelessly entertaining and educating the crowds. Beside the entrance to the main performance field stretch triple rows of stalls, numbering in the hundreds; many a well-off farmer has travelled up from Andalusia and Extremadura to hawk prime produce, jam, wine and honey. The citizens of Madrid, so used to the greys and browns of urban life, are spoiled for choice and clearly dazzled by the charm and diversity of the countryside's gifts.\n\nAs the day draws to a close and the sun dips towards the horizon, sleepy children are herded home, many tightly clutching toys and curios hard-won in traditional games. More than one farmer, who mere years ago was struggling to make ends meet, fires up his truck and sets off for home with a load of empty crates and a bulging wallet. As earnings and attendance figures roll in, a local council member smiles - this year's budget will be nicely padded for once."

 IBR.628.d:0 "Schooling in Iberia has for decades been a stuffy, rigid business. Daily lessons in Latin, prayer at least once a day, and corporal punishment of children, all supervised by the Catholic Church. President Fraga was of the opinion that it was time for a change, if only to bring the country back into the 20th century. Whoever was given the job of spearheading the modernization effort would have to weather the storm of criticism from both the hardliners and the opposition liberals. Fraga would have to find a man of intellect and grit equaling the task.\n\nHe found such a man in Jose Luis Villar Palasi. Previously a minister in the old regime but now a supporter of Iberian democracy, Palasi was a soft, gentle man, unassuming and bespectacled. But underneath that veneer hid a towering intellect. Palasi was a polymath, speaking over 15 languages, and was known for his love of philosophy, economics, and law. And most important of all, he was a modernizing conservative, determined to bring the Spanish education system up to date with the latest trends and practices while maintaining its religious and civic character.\n\nPalasi's General Education Law passed easily through the Council, supported even by members of the opposition Unión Republicana. Its effects were sweeping and immediate. Archaic schooling practices such as Latin lessons were done away with and replaced with useful activities such as sports. Classes in religion would continue on and the Catholic nature of Iberian education would be maintained, but the influence of the priests and nuns would be curtailed in favor of educated professional teachers. Social science, philosophy, economics, and politics would be taught for the first time, and a unified system of standardized testing would ensure every student had a chance of going to university.\n\nAlready immensely popular, the reform has even won over some of the government's detractors, and made Palasi a household name."

However, there is a possibility that not everything is as it appears on the surface. A commonly held opinion within the party is that this upstanding moral character is too clean - and someone who strives so hard to appear honest is certainly hiding something. The train of thought that the Opus Dei is a fraud was something that was prevalent in far more places than ever expected, from a primary concern to a shred tucked in the back of their mind.\n\nIt wasn't hard to reach a consensus that something ought to be done, and so an audit on the Opus Dei was arranged. There was an issue, however. Because of their nature an investigation won't be able to hit everything in a reasonable time, and so to have even a chance of something substantial the investigation must be carefully directed. Suspicions are raised the most in two locations: their finances, and their political connections. Examining their financial connections is risky, as their threat is something any savvy politician knows, but if something is turned up then it could be decisive in discrediting the Opus Dei. Looking into their political connections could expose any ties with political parties that may be present, but if they have taken sufficient precautions then it's likely that nothing could be found regardless. Therefore, in order to maximize the odds of finding something suspicious, the investigators decided to"

 IBR.630.t:0 "The New Iberian Woman" 
 IBR.630.d:0 "President Fraga was not having a good day. For hours the Alianza Popular party room had been engaging in one of the most fractious debates of its short history, split down the middle on its approach to the government's policy concerning women's rights. Before now Franga and his cabinet had seen fit to avoid the question entirely, seeing it as a divisive distraction from the government's current legislative program.\n\nYet a small faction on the left of his party, led by popular journalist and writer María Victoria Fernández-España, had now raised the issue in the party room. Representing the small number of female Alianza Popular deputies, they were loudly calling for the government to encourage women to enter the workforce and break down traditionalist gender roles passed down from the old Iberian regime. Usually, Fraga would have been able to safely ignore them, but much to his annoyance, his secondhand man Jorge Verstrynge had already waded into the debate, backing the women. He would have to deal with Verstrynge's insubordination later, when this mess was over.\n\nThe hardliners were responding as they always did, suggesting that if the government conceded to the feminists they would soon be demanding abortion rights, the right to divorce, and the legalization of adultery, all fundamental challenges to the status of Iberia as a Catholic country. Their rhetoric had now begun to take on hyperbolic proportions, arguing that any movement of women into the workforce would undermine the Iberian family unit, the fundamental building block of Iberian society, thus resulting in social degradation and ultimately collapse.\n\nThe President had stayed out of it until now, hoping that the discussion would cool and they could move on to more pressing matters, but there seemed no end in sight. He would have to take the podium and intervene in the debate, lest the party tear itself apart. His word would ultimately settle things, with the center following his lead. As Fraga took the stage before his party, he set upon a course of action."

 IBR.631.t:0 "The New Penal Code"
 IBR.631.d:0 "Much had changed in Iberia since the days of the Caudillos. Democracy had been restored across the peninsula, new modernizing reforms were being passed almost every month, and the whole country was imbued with a renewed sense of optimism and hope for the future. Yet in the dark and musty courtrooms of Iberia, one felt transported back to ages past. Strict, archaic statutes, some dating back as far as 1944, continued to land a great many innocent Iberians in jail, while the courts were packed with apparatchiks of the old Falangist order.\n\nThe government's New Penal Code put an end to all of that. Hundreds of judges and other court officials associated with abuses under the Caudillos have been sacked, replaced with a new generation of young lawyers. A series of vital democratic reforms have been implemented, ensuring the accused the right to free legal representation and appeal, while also stripping the military of the right to try its members in secret military courts. Freedom of assembly and press are enshrined in law for the first time in decades. Jose Luis Villar Palasi, a legal thinker as well as an education reformer, has earned himself and the government much praise for his role in devising the new system.\n\nYet not everything has changed. Adultery, abortion, and divorce remain illegal, along with a whole series of other statues regulating sexual and social freedom. The death penalty will continue to be enforced for heinous crimes. The right for workers to associate in a union remains nebulous at best, and the police have as much power as they ever did.\n\nPresident Fraga and his party toe a fine line. Iberia must be free and democratic, its courts a beacon of fairness and equanimity on a continent gripped by extremist insanity. Yet it must also remain strong and just, ensuring the social and institutional fabric of the country, already so fragile in the aftermath of the Iberian War, remains intact."

Many knew he had served briefly in the old regime as Minister for Information and Tourism, yet few Iberians recognized his face in the newspapers, and even less knew what his voice sounded like.\n\nFraga wanted to change that. If he was to be the man who led Iberia into its future as a modern democratic nation, he had to be a constant source of inspiration and comfort. Yet so many simply saw him as just another collaborator. Speaking directly to Iberians in their homes via the radio, he could give them his side of the story.\n\n"Fellow Iberians," he said, beginning his address to the nation. "I am speaking to you today to address my role in the old regime. I say to you today, as I have always said and always will say, that I am for a free, united, and democratic Iberia. Yet I believe we must remember the chaos which engulfed our homeland in these past decades. The regimes of Salazar and Franco arose in situations of anarchy across the peninsula, when the forces of extremism threatened to bring civilization toppling down. They united to form Iberia when under attack by those same forces of tyranny. Without these harsh measures, Iberia would not exist, and I would not be here talking to you today. Despite this, the violence and brutality of the old regime was unconscionable, and many mistakes were made. Some will ask why I do not feel guilt for my involvement in the regime of Salazar and Franco. As any who was there at the time can testify, I advocated long and hard within the ranks of the regime for democratic reforms, at risk to my own career and self. If the end result is Iberia, secure and free as it stands today, then I say I would gladly do it all over again.""

 #A Catholic Nation
 IBR.5050.t:0 "A Catholic Nation"
 IBR.5050.d:0 "The Catholic Church has always had deep roots in Iberia, dating back all the way to the Reconquista. As a consequence the nations of the peninsula have historically been unparalleled champions of the Catholic faith, and Catholic orders of all stripes have played an important role in governance and politics. Democratic Iberia is no different, and a number of Catholic organizations play an important role in Iberian politics.\n\nOne such organization is the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei, made up almost entirely of laymen and secular priests not tied to any monastic orders. Though deeply religiously conservative and supportive of Church doctrine, they were ostracised by many Falangists in the old regime who believed that Opus Dei was a covert front for freemasonry. Since the fall of the old regime they have become increasingly popular for their role in various charity efforts and sponsorship of universities.\n\nYet recently they have developed some very controversial ideas. While they recognize that Iberia is and must remain a Catholic state, they have shocked many right-wing Catholics across the country, and their liberal-minded Jesuit rivals, by supporting efforts to expand the freedoms of religious minorities in Iberia. Their leader and founder, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás has argued in his most recent book that "pluralism is not to be feared but loved as a legitimate consequence of personal freedom," concluding with the slogan: "Long live students of all religions and all ideologies."\n\nThis turn has caused serious tensions within the government. With the question of religious freedoms being talked about openly on the streets, pressure is being put on President Fraga to take a side. Either risk losing the support of Catholic hardliners within his own party, or risk alienating a sizable portion of Iberian Catholics. A decision will have to be made, one way or the other."

 IBR.5054.d:0 "When the investigation began it wasn't sure what the Alianza Popular wanted to find. Perhaps it was some incriminating documents, or some other scandalous piece of evidence. Their conditions were strict - not many people approved of an investigation into an institution of the Catholic Church, and so it took a lot of compromising to even get an approval into order.\n\nFaced with only a small amount of time, hostile oversight, and overly stringent standards the investigation team was left with the shaft. Even if they didn't, it's hard to tell if it would make a difference. The Opus Dei were to set an example in everything they did, and the audit finds that they did just that. Patrolling their records sent one the impression of a freshly-sponged room, so clean it reflected back at you.\n\nIf anything, the most notable thing to be found in the results is this cleanliness itself - no other organization carries themselves in such a wonderful manner.

The reception to the idea of investigating a Catholic institution was received poorly, no matter the contents of their doings. As such, the only way even so much as a cursory glance could be approved was to compromise heavily, leading to a shackled audit. Therefore it was necessary to focus on one certain aspect in order to have any chance at a real breakthrough.\n\nTo our delight, pooling the resources into the investigation of the political ties of the Opus Dei has revealed a possible connection. It is a thread, weak and barely present, but nonetheless tangible. One of the main opposition parties, the PRD led by Alberto Ullastres, may possibly have a connection with the Opus Dei. Some even suspect they are nothing but their puppets! With this lead secured, what remained was to validate it by a rigorous investigation.\n\nThere are multiple ways an investigation into this possible political tie can be conducted. The easiest method would be to just conduct an expansion of the previous investigation, with formal support and a shield in the event of unexpected circumstances. However, this may not be enough. Attempting to go through legal channels, while sound, could allow for the Opus Dei to cover up any evidence they might have waiting to be used against them. To counter this a more illegal solution could be utilized, breaking into their headquarters and finding their documents before they could be hidden. It would be disastrous if word of this would get out, but the possible reward is far greater. How will we investigate this possible connection?"

Since they did not vote for a Spanish party, we have effectively lost the minority vote.\n\nOur recent steps to grant token autonomy to minority regions is the source of this damage. As opposed to just being grateful, they have instead been outraged that we did not give them more. Because of our unwillingness to grant them the mile, they have taken the stance that we do not represent them. The resulting protests, most likely egged on by separatists, have crippled any productivity the minority areas could muster.

Since the military has been as effective as they are, this is a difficult policy to justify. Why change the makeup of law enforcement if it works fine as is? Nevertheless, despite the grumbles the police had been on a fair track to being separate from the armed forces.\n\nMaking the case for this has become significantly harder as of late. As law enforcement has been transferred to civilian oversight, the police forces have gone rampant. Reports of brutality have risen significantly, and professionalism and morale have taken a nose-dive. With such happenings it is far more difficult to make the case that the military should not enforce the law, since they seemed to have kept a tighter grasp on the police.

 IBR.5060.d:0 "Ever since Franco seized power from the first Republic, the peninsula has had to deal with hordes of separatists, utilizing terrorism in their campaign for independence. This legacy of bloodshed has continued on to Iberia, and we have been shackled to it as well. Even though Iberia is a free republic now, many of these terrorists simply haven't gotten the point. In nearly every minority region separatism has taken a major hit, but still holds a monumental popularity among some segments of the people.\n\nMost of these people will never take any action to further the cause they support, but there are those who will go so far as to sacrifice their lives for a misguided campaign. Usually they're just arrested. This action, while effective, is not entirely sustainable. These terrorists will just remain in prison, until they are broken out by their cohorts and returned back to causing chaos on the streets. Only one thing can definitively rule out this possibility, and it is their death; but killing the terrorists brings on a whole new debate.\n\nHow shall the Axencia eliminate these people? The most practical option would be to just kill off anyone suspected of being a separatist. This could prove very messy, and is highly risky. However, it would eliminate all of them far faster. Alternatively, we could send in hitmen to eliminate them quietly. This has far smaller odds of causing a stir - after all, it's only a couple of criminals - but would take far longer to properly be rid of them all. Finally, we could back away from this plan and leave them be. Nothing wagered, and nothing lost. But nothing will be gained either."

They were off to the nearest prison, where the workers would be held until they could be proven innocent of the terrorism charges laid against them.\n\nIn regions all across Iberia, this had become common occurrence. Companies and buildings suspected of hosting terrorists were raided, and the suspects within removed, forcibly if need be. The Union was cracking down on separatism, and not even a single possible criminal was left. No stone went unturned in the pursuit of these men.

As he turned towards the local radio he reflected on how it got this far. One of his comrades had been arrested, and was able to warn of his danger. Since no man is to be left behind, a rescue needed done. It was easy to get in, and even easier to push the prisoners into a riot. Off their backs, anything was possible. Speaking of which, he needed to put this out to the world. The insurgent switched on the radio, composed himself, and began speaking about injustice and extrajudicial killings by the government.\n\nAccording to witness reports, an unknown insurgent group attacked the Carabanchel prison in Madrid, the most infamous prison in the capital, and released all its prisoners. With their assistance, they were able to massacre almost every guard and nearly managed to broadcast their accusations over the radio network. Thankfully they were cut off before such a thing could happen, and the public is none the wiser of the events that triggered their assault.

While not a first option, lethal force was to be used on anyone who overly resisted. Bringing in new guards would be an issue, but the local law enforcement and Guardia Civil could serve in their stead for the interim. In theory, the inmates would be pacified and back in their cells with minimal casualties, and in no longer than a couple of hours.\n\nIn this particular instance, theory was far detached from reality. By some unknown factor - though insider assistance is most likely - the ringleaders of the riot were not dispatched, and the special forces were pitted against a crowd of angry inmates hungry for their freedom. The prisoners were no match, and were eventually pacified. This took many more hours than originally estimated, and the bodycount was easily more than triple the original estimate.

Yet still, Fraga had not expected this much opposition, let alone at a cabinet meeting.\n\n"We have no choice," Jorge Verstrynge responded, taking point and showing Fraga why he kept him around as his second-hand-man. He really was quite invaluable in a debate. "The oil crisis has seriously depleted our treasury. If we don't raise taxes we will not be able to pay our debts. We are facing a sovereign default."\n\n"To hell with that," de la Fuente retorted, now turning and pleading directly to the President. "If we need more money, we have to find it elsewhere.

I guarantee you, Mr. President, that if we do this our own supporters will throw us out at the next election."\n\nFraga knew there was some truth to what de la Fuente was saying.

 #Confronting the Public Sector Unions
 IBR.5410.t:0 "Confronting the Public Sector Unions" 
 IBR.5410.d:0 "Licinio de la Fuente had dealt with many strikes. Such was the job of the Minister of Labour. And though he had been a Falangist in his youth, experience had now taught him that a softer hand was necessary in such situations. Driving the unions underground during the old regime of the Caudillos had only made matters worse, inflaming radicalism and posing the interests of the state against those of the working man. That is why he had been pushing for labour reform in the Alianza Popular government, trying to convince President Manuel Fraga to support his changes. So far he had experienced some success. The unions were no longer underground, and he could negotiate openly with their leaders, yet just enough of the restrictions from the old days remained that the state usually had the upper hand. Just how he liked it.\n\nBut the Oil Crisis and now the Public Sector Strike had ruined his plans. Forced to implement sweeping privatization programs in health, education, and even welfare and pensions to raise emergency revenue and cut down on bloated public spending, the government had now triggered one of the largest public sector strikes in Iberian history with tens of thousands of public sector workers demanding a reversal of the privatization scheme and the restoration of government funding.\n\nAs he sat in his office preparing to meet with the union leadership, de la Fuente tossed up his options. He could tell the unions they would not be getting a deal, and push ahead with his orders to enforce the privatization. He would almost certainly have to deploy the Civil Guard to crush the strike.\n\nOr, he could get on the phone right now and call the President. Up until now Fraga had respected his remit on labour issues. More importantly, Franga himself, while deeply worried about the economic crisis, seemed more concerned with avoiding further rifts within the government. De la Fuente knew that if he asked Fraga to moderate the privatization scheme, he might just acquiesce, if only to avoid a split. Whatever de la Fuente's choice, he would have to act soon."

 IBR.5411.d:0 "The President knew he would have to make this address count. The whole nation was in uproar over the oil crisis and the government's austerity program, now culminating in mass protests and a huge public sector strike. Meanwhile the economy was in freefall, unemployment was at an all-time high, and the state was facing financial ruin. If things did not improve, and soon, Manuel Fraga knew that he and his government would be facing catastrophe. Yet in the meantime, support had to be shored up. Speaking directly to the people, as he had done many times before, was his best and last chance.\n\n"Fellow Iberians," he began, addressing his countrymen in his customary manner. "As you are all aware, the country finds itself in the midst of a deep economic crisis the likes of which it has never faced. We in the government are well aware of the suffering this has generated amongst broad layers of the Iberian people.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government has pursued a policy of austerity, to make sure that the state, which protects and provides for all Iberians, continues to be able to function. These measures are temporary, and were employed with the greatest possible reluctance on the behalf of myself and the government. In this time of difficulty and struggle, we must all band together as Iberians, tighten our belts, and make sacrifices for the greater good of the country.\n\n"Many think that the threats to the security and peace of Iberia have disappeared in this time of economic crisis. They have not. Marxian extremism, totalitarian threats from abroad, and seperatist terrorism may yet return to Iberian shores in this period if Iberians do not remain vigilant and united. In the years of democracy we have built a new, modern Iberia. Now I am asking all Iberians to help defend her, to put the needs of the country and community first. If we all do our duty to Iberia and to god, we will weather this crisis and come out of it stronger than ever."

 IBR.5080.d:0 "Terrorism, liberalism, separatism. No one in Iberia could name a worse combination to conspire for the destruction of not just one nation, but an entire peninsula. Since anarchy and chaos are to be avoided at all costs, so too must their fronts. Never will the tendrils of death spread themselves over the Union, provided we play our cards right. In the same league is of liberalism. The adherents are misinformed, brainwashed into something evil by anarchists. Regardless, the how and the why hardly matter, beyond a reason to oppose their cruelty. It has to be handled with great care, in order to ensure the campaign isn't sabotaged. Every good crusade has a specialization, and there are two specializations that are practical for antiliberal use.\n\nThe most obvious path is to eliminate the corruptors at their core, and destroy the spread of influence by removing the people who spread it. This will have to be handled quietly, as any major disappearances could cause a major catastrophe if exposed. Alternatively, the influences could be quelled by a propaganda campaign. If we choose to use propaganda, there is no guarantee that the influence will be effectively countered. However, there would not be as much of a backlash from the campaign.\n\nResources are limited, so there is only the time and budget to do one of the two. The choice needs to be careful. Once a plan is chosen, there will be no going back on it."

 IBR.5081.d:0 "It was decided, though controversial, to defeat terrorist influences by use of propaganda. Drowning out their propaganda with our own, as it were. The specifics were simple in concept, but creating a robust framework to operate in was challenging. The propaganda would be vast, all-encompassing, and sustained for maximum effectiveness. Only one last hitch remained before finalization: how would this all be directed?\n\nThere is no denying that separatists can draw from areas outside of the regions they claim to represent - more than once has a non-minority been arrested for working with terrorist groups. Are they more of a threat than the minority forces of these groups? The resources behind the propaganda program are limited, and we cannot hit everywhere at once. We can target the individual minority regions, and cut off the main source of the terrorist manpower. If we so wish, the program could be put across Iberia as a whole. While it runs the risk of being less effective, it also provides a justification for having the propaganda elsewhere too."

It stands to reason, then, that eliminating the terrorists will choke out the sympathy for separatist groups. To do this, the organizations must be destroyed from within, in order to sabotage their effectiveness. However, Where will the infiltration begin? The groups in question have many tendrils, in many separate parts of Iberia. It is disappointing but necessary to realize that the Axencia lacks the resources to combat all of it at once. For anything to get done, attention needs to be honed in on one specific spot.\n\nOf the myriad of facets, there is one in particular that gains the attention of criminals: universities. The impressionable, young minds are perfect for propaganda. If we were to plant agents in undercover areas then we could catch separatists red-handed. A riskier solution is to attempt to break into the terrorist groups themselves, sabotaging them from inside. This may not work, but disrupting them before they can spread disinformation could make the difference. "

 IBR.5083.t:0 "Rebuilding Strength with Propaganda"
 IBR.5083.d:0 "Typically, it takes no special effort to display strength. A few demonstrations here, a showing there, and a little bit of tough words on top. These methods have withered away to nothing. A series of poor moves have delegitimized the strongman stance to the public, and so people have started to take it less seriously. They do not worry, because they do not believe retribution will not be applied to them.\n\nThe change in perception can be reversed by vigorous application of propaganda and other methods of spreading information. It will take time before the flippant disloyalty is corrected, however, and it will take many resources to do so."
 IBR.5083.a:0 "We are not weak!"
 
 IBR.5084.t:0 "More Resources to the AAS"
 IBR.5084.d:0 "Usually the Axencia is particularly resourceful, able to operate on a comparative shoestring. With great thrift, they are able to salvage old equipment and keep a remarkably low rate of object disposal. Because of this they do not usually get much attention, because they can work without it. Given recent circumstances, that has changed.\n\nThe thrift which so characterized the Axencia shortly before is gone. On average, they go through more equipment and more men than they have ever before. Since they are still operating on the relative shoestring of a budget they have always had, this means they have taken a nosedive as an effective force. While the new resources sent their way will undoubtedly resolve the issue, there will still be a hitch in operations. That disruption will not go unnoticed."
 IBR.5084.a:0 "We are not incompetent!"
 
 IBR.5085.t:0 "Reassuring the People"
 IBR.5085.d:0 "Normally no issue comes from the appropriate use of force. Fear is very adequate - it keeps people cowed, and removes much opposition by making them afraid to act against the government. Sometimes, however, it can go too far. Enforcers can become a bit too zealous, and carry out their duties with more than a little too much pleasure. This is when things go too far. The most pressing motivation to stop this is how it makes the government appear. When an over-use of force isn't reined in, it makes for a very bad look. It makes the administration of the Caudillos seem brutal, cruel, when in reality it is nothing of the sort.\n\nThis sort of happening is nothing new, but what is new about it is the frequency of its happening. It seems that more loose cannons, more shoot-first types have found their way into law enforcement. This will have to be corrected, with no small dose of 'information correction' to back it up, if the government is to maintain meaningful credibility."

 IBR.5086.t:0 "The Target"
 IBR.5086.d:0 "Liberalism in particular has been a great plague upon the Union's good, Christian society. Constantly advocating for tyranny, the rule of the masses would destroy the country. It is for this reason they must go, albeit with a heavier heart. Most are simply misled, brought on by their insidious ringleaders. What they want is more difficult to determine, but it can't be good. Liberalism will dissipate and the people will return to their natural way of thinking, if the sources are cut off. To cut off the source, the head of the snake will be removed. This is no snake, however, it is a hydra. Like any hydra, it has multiple heads, and only one head can be cut off at a time.\n\nThe intelligentsia are one of the most troublesome heads of this despicable hydra, and easily the most vocal. Their calls turn the populace away from their benevolent leaders, and silencing those calls will go a long way to bringing back the natural order. The intellectuals are very entrenched, so removing them is certain to cause an uproar. An operation with less risk is to target the downright treasonous elements of the government. These politicians are attempting to bring the Union down from inside its own administration. Removing them will fix any degenerate shifts the government might undertake. As well, they are not as popular as their intellectual cousins. It is also possible to target the terrorists further, who are in cahoots to help push the propaganda onto good citizens. Their defeat will evaporate the justification for the others, though it is not guaranteed. What head is going to go first?"

They are prepared to strike at the targeted group in question, ready to prepare a plan and eliminate them. So far, they have not been able to prepare beyond a basic level, since the Axencia lacks critical details. Namely, how they are to strike.\n\nSeveral general predictions have been drawn up, and the one approved will be what the Axencia uses to stabilize Iberia. The first plan was to use stealth in order to get things done. Accidents, assassinations, and all sorts would be used to eliminate without causing an uproar. While suspicious, it could be effective. Alternatively, others have advocated the use of a velvet glove - force is not strictly necessary, and the targets will realize that. Working with them while also making sure they know of the violence that could be leveled at them could be very effective, making collaborators out of rivals. Finally, some advocate for making an example out of dissidents. With the fear of reprisal, none will dare act out."

Near an almost serene villa in the Galician countryside, the reaper's orchestra prepares another symphony.\n\nThey were not native Galicians, they were born and raised elsewhere, but what mattered the most was where they were now. The name of the town was Danger, and they were right in the middle of it. Storms would occasionally roll through, and they brought nothing but clouds of gray and yellow. So long as you kept the doors locked, you could hope to avoid the worst of the storm. It was the job of the lookouts to keep an eye out for the storms, before they arrived. If you could spot them in time, then you could batten down the hatches and avoid the worst of it.\n\nThat is, until this time, when the storm brought the door down. There was no hiding this time, it was do or die. The front guards chose to die, as evidenced by the delay in readying their rifles. Most within opted to do, and the area was filled with the screams of man and rifle alike as the land collided head-on with what they had hoped would never come to them.\n\nWhen all was said and done, only some had chosen the third choice, don't. Their woe was to come later, with interest. The majority were dead, and none had escaped the trap. For such an adventure, there came a great prize: Documents, plans, and all other incriminating materials were seized.

Which is why their absence was so puzzling. Surely, there would have been somebody to object to his arrest.\n\nThere was a plan, rendered shreds. Guillermo had been tipped off about his imminent removal by the Axencia, and so devised what would have been the perfect way to cause a scene. His supporters would gather, and try to obstruct the authorities. The scene would force them to be ruthless, just as Guillermo had hoped, which would bring his cause to the light. He probably would have been made a martyr, but it would have been a victory nonetheless.\n\nThe politician clung to the hope that somebody would come to his aid, even as the chance for it dwindled to nothing.

To these bureaucrats, it was little more than numbers on a report.\n\nTo the agents on the field, it was still little more than the rhythm of death. The view on the ground was a bit messier, but even against all the mess it was still the same underneath, but with a few extra steps. Get briefed, go to the location, take down the door, always the door, then drag a fellow or a few more out kicking and screaming. It certainly wasn't lucky when they went down with guns blazing and tears of desperation in their eyes, but it was nearly welcomed. After all, familiarity breeds contempt, and there is no better familiarity than a job. Anything to break up the monotony was appreciated, no matter how violent.\n\nAll of it was to a good end, the stability of Iberia. Like a box carried by ants, it was much more firmly planted on the ground once the insects were properly squashed.

Tomorrow, he would share it all with his cohorts at the nearby university, and above all else he was excited for it.

He shuffled through his home to his study, and started to get worried when he could not find his writing. Surely it was on the desk, the author had left it just there.. He switched his lamp on, and looked around. It wasn't on the table, and he found it scattered on the floor. As he bent down to pick it up, he felt the arms of Axencia agents force him to the ground.\n\nThis was not the only major author removed from the public eye, and combined the group has taken a major hit to numbers.

For not being too firm, they have been punished with little to no change from their circumstances, and nothing but a spent pocketbook to show for it.\n\nMany of the officials in question took the bribes, with many promises of efficiency and work ethic in exchange for the unexpected bonus. Most of the many required some more, and some more, and some more... nothing was done, ultimately, and with an affinity for gaining last chances it was unlikely that anything would be done.\n\nEven worse, the recent failure to act harshly enough against the enemies of Iberia has turned the people against their once trusted government.

Fortunately the execution is much simpler than the planning, as every hitch is only a redundancy, designed to make sure that any unseen surprises do not upset the operation. Rarely used, the Axencia has grown complacent. Where there were once sophisticated plots to foil some terrorist safehouse, there is now little detail of use for the agents on the field. Where twisting, almost all-conceiving nets of circumstances and possibilities warned the operatives of anything that may befall them, one can only find a plan that is effectively a straight line in and out.\n\nThe agents on the field themselves have gone from shining examples to uninterested clerks with guns. Where creativity and quick-thinking once resided, now lies stubbornness and complacency. They are incapable of operating as well as they could, and many are in it to get paid and leave as opposed to keeping the Union together.\n\nIt's not like enemies of the state of all colors haven't noticed this as well. Agents have been foiled at every turn. Even worse, arrests have dwindled to dangerously low levels. The Axencia is becoming unable its main job in defeating terrorism, but also in assisting with other critical covert operations.

Not to say that everyone participated in such a scheme, but those seemed to frequently lose the tug-of-war with those in it for the money and those who took an unusual happiness in throwing a wrench into the process. They were so engrossed in their debates, in fact, that nobody seemed to notice the guards locking the doors.\n\nSomeone turned to leave, enraged by some comment angled in his direction. He tried the doors, and attempted to open them even harder when they did not open. The council member was prepared to argue with a guard nearby attempting to shoo him back to his seat.

It was like a tug-of-war, but now both sides were tugging. The Caudillos would present a problem, the Council would suggest solutions, and attempt to hold them up under scrutiny. The Council would present a problem, and the Caudillos would present solutions.

It is extremely pleasing to hear that you take our concerns about the future of Iberia seriously and will see to it that the fifth column and the agents of chaos won't bring ruin to the nation through this process. You can count on us to help in any way we can to see to it that a great calamity does not occur.

These men know better than to further directly challenge our authority, it was ourselves after all who stopped the renegade Falange some time ago, but that doesn't mean they will not scheme against us. These dinosaurs of yesteryear may not look like much but they are heavily experienced in the political game. Some noise is likely to be created amongst the most zealous and hard-line in the faction but the rest will likely bide their time, waiting for an opportunity to trample on the process.\n\nIt is quite likely that we will not be able to rely heavily upon the conservatives as their support for the process dips with their lack of faith in us. Whether this vitriol will remain the tantrums of old men or morph into something far more seditious and dangerous remains to be seen. What is known however, is that the old guard is not happy and likely won't take this decision lying down."

The history of this issue is seemingly everlasting, it has become ingrained beneath the very skin of Iberia. Many have died fighting for and against the ideals of the separatists but a radical option of paying heed to the separatists is now available. So too, is the option to shut them out once again.\n\nOn the one hand, listening to the separatists and giving them a real Special Regions programme would perhaps allow for the future of Iberia to remain stable and whole in the end. Terrorism would hopefully eventually cease and the needs of these people will be placated within a deal we could hopefully reach with them. On the other hand, giving any sort of leniency to their demands may set the dominoes off and foresee to the balkanisation of Iberia. Whatever decision we make we are bound to upset someone. But we must do whatever's best for the future of Iberia so disaster does not strike in these world changing times."

Time and time again the despots, the monarchs and the governors of Iberia's past had ruthlessly crushed separatist dreams. In response the separatists turned to politics by way of the gun and a seemingly everlasting cycle of violence began to grip Iberia. Now, however, the cycle may just be starting to crumble.\n\nWith a promise of listening to the regionalists and considering their demands for a real Special Regions programme, the separatist movements have now been forced to take the process seriously. A real breakthrough may arise from this, it has been enough to make any hard-line separatist zealot think twice about any would-be terrorist attack. While the issue is certainly not been put to bed, a clear expression of confidence in the process has been given by the regionalists. By proxy, this means some confidence has also been given to this governance.\n\nHowever, this decision may come at cost. There are many in Iberia who would rather die than see the nation break up into pieces. Indeed, some may believe that this olive branch to separatism will hasten this. Of course, this is nothing but the delusions of staunch paranoia but we must be weary. Not only of the separatists but of those within our own governance as well."

We completely and utterly reject their demands that would have seen Iberia crumple into a failed state.\n\nThis has of course not gone down too well with the separatists who were sticking their neck out talking to the government in the first place. Now it seems we're back to the usual cycle of terror. The more militant and radical elements of the various separatist movements have apparently been "proven right" by our response and more attacks are likely to follow. Let them come we say, for we have faced them down once before and will do so again. The separatist may cry and stomp their feet but they will not tear apart this great nation.

Believing that the process apparently needs a "qualified voice" to speak up on certain matters, they have sent in a number of proposals that they seek to bring to the table. One such proposal they are particularly pushing is the improvement of civil liberties for Iberians.\n\nOn the outset, these proposals seem all well and good but God knows what these people are truly after. One thing this process cannot allow for is the fifth column to arise once again. It occurred once before and it took the strength of an entire nation and a sea of blood to stop the fifth column antagonist. That being said, it could be worth placating these people if we are to embark on real reform in Iberia.

This matters little though, for the process requires the means of all qualified voices in Iberia. The Opus Dei are to be welcomed on board and bring a hopefully healthy element to the Congress.\n\nThe Opus Dei have of course been nothing but grateful of the opportunity provided to them by the Iberian government. This gratefulness has been showcased by their entrenchment of support for not only the process but also the government as well. The technocrats will certainly have to prove their usefulness as the Congress will soon evolve into its most crucial stages. In any case it is hoped that the technocratic expressors will bring something new and fresh to the table."

This technocracy is simply the scourge of uncontrolled liberalism disguised and thus, the Opus Dei have been put in their place once more.\n\nThis calculated decision has not gone without its consequences though. Any hopes the Opus Dei had in the government and the process has been slashed considerably. Any support we could count on from the technocrats has near evaporated but, we have done what we must to keep Iberia safe and secure from the ills of liberalism once again.

 IBR.5109.d:0 "The situation in Iberia today is far removed from the past and these testing times have clearly influenced Iberian political society. For example, it has become a common belief within certain sections of the Iberian government that the nation is under an existential threat from the forces of terrorism. It has been alleged that Bolsheviks and separatists have ran rampant in the recent past, beseeching our great nation with the horrors of urban warfare. There has thus been a clear worry that the current process will not only not stop the terrorist threat, but also increase it as instability grows in the nation. It is through this worry that the military and its most staunch supports have stepped into the limelight.\n\nThe military very clearly want to have a voice in the current ongoing debates. They, of course, claim they only wish to do so in order to stave off the threats of instability and terrorism. The more cynical amongst us however, deem that they only wish to do so in order to keep hold of their power and stop any sort of reform to the armed forces. Their intentions certainly seem to be wholly political rather than mere love for the nation, Iberia of course having a clear history of military involvement in political affairs. This occasion seems no different but we could put a stop to their meddling in an obvious showcase of our commitment to reform. That being said, capitulation to the armed forces may be necessary in order to stop any separatist threat or leftist plot."

Resignations and walkouts soon followed after the tantrums which all had one clear message. A glaring lack of faith in this government to deliver any "meaningful" democratic reforms.\n\nBut why should we pay heed to these flabby and naive liberals. It would seem from this kicking and screaming that the liberals would rather our nation succumb to socialism, separatism and subjugation than to give the armed forces a deserved role. These men are amongst the most principle among us. They bravely did what was necessary once before to send to Bolshevik menace packing and put separatist notions back in their desired place. So sure, the liberals may be unhappy with our decision but the nation will be thankful for our decision to bring the heroic military fully on board."

Incensed that such a snub could occur, the army has "expressed its deep disappointment that such a decision was taken" but so far that has been all they have done. They have been clearly stopped where they thought they could succeed; the yes men of previous administrations have evidently made them arrogant towards us. Now that they have been told no, like an opulent child they cry out against the rational choice. They will now need to reconfigure but this gives us more than enough time to figure out how to truly sap their power if need be through this process.\n\nHowever, this decision has also irked the military's conservative backers who have likewise expressed a definite voice of a lack of confidence in ourselves and the process. It's plain to see they don't have what it takes to stop Iberia from falling in on itself, so latched onto a past that no longer exists, but it matters little.

In order to envision a truly democratic reformation process, it has been recommended that the final debates should be broadcast to the whole public to show transparency and a genuine commitment to democracy. All in Iberia, be they rich or poor, Spanish or Portuguese, conservative or liberal will be able to watch the most important debates and no doubt voice their opinion towards the results.\n\nThis huge spectacle could have drastic ramifications. While it may show the government has faith in its people and shows an attempt at making a connection with them, it could also cost us dearly. Should the debates go smoothly we have little to worry about, but if they end in disaster then God knows what the consequences will be from the public.

Opus Dei's liberal allies have helped along with this process which could change the very nature of the future Iberian regime. For decades the nation has been ruled by strongmen and their hegemonic grasp on civil society. Now, that power could be broken as the right of the individual look to be ratified under these reforms.\n\nThe reforms are no doubt drastic, a total overhaul of the former principles of Iberian civil society. The reforms are sure to find their antagonists in the army and the conservatives but for now the reforms seem to have the momentum of a runaway freight train.

Would it not be so, that this complete uprooting and overhaul of Iberian civil society would leave us weak to the scourges of separatism and the fifth column threat? The Council it seems is certainly of this same opinion, with an agreement recently being reached concluding that there is no need to quickly make any sweeping changes in regard to civil liberties. The antagonism of the conservatives and the army would no doubt have reached dangerous heights if the Council as to embark on such an all-encompassing reform. Drastic measures are to be left aside as compromise, it is hoped, will be the theme of the debates.\n\nOf course, certain liberals and Opus Dei sympathizers do not quite see the drafting of these scaled back reforms the same way as the majority of the Council. There are cries of a deliberate shut down at an attempt of real reform and the scuttling of a chance for Iberia to become a new society. This view though is as utopian as it is naïve, these liberals are far too narrow sighted to see the larger threat any drastic reform could deliver to Iberia's doorstep.

The liberals have held their ground in the proceedings though, coming straight back at the conservatives and condemning them as "tired-out tyrants only looking to keep the Iberian people down and themselves afloat". At one point the debate looked so viscous, it was a surprise chairs were not thrown between the two competing sides.\n\nIn the end, there appears to be a considerable amount of pushback from sections of the Iberian pollical class against these reforms.

This paranoia has previously led to the lack of any self-determination or minority representation in the Iberian sate. This though, could be about to change.\n\nWith the usage of their cunning political skills and dextrous tactics, the regionalist faction in the Council have managed to gain sizeable momentum behind their attempts to pursue a Special Regions programme. The programme would result in a real and new change for the Iberian political system, with far greater autonomy being granted to Iberia's minority regions. The success of the regionalists can surely be attributed to their strong connection to the dreams of autonomy.

It would be a surrender to the terrorist pest, it would see the emboldening of political violence and it would be the end of a project we worked so hard to build and make a reality.\n\nIt soon became all too clear to the majority of the Council that the regionalists had a hidden agenda of unabridged separatism and their proposals of a so called "Special Regions" programme needed to be shot down with haste. However, the regionalists and their wishes could not be just disregarded at will. This is a new Iberia after all. So, it was the Council's preference that token autonomy would be the solution to the minority question.

This, it appeared, was precisely what happened when the militarists gave their response to the regionalists proposals.\n\nThe militarist reply was lengthy, brutal and uncompromising. Militarist, after militarist, arose to shout down the regionalists calling them "terrorist sympathizers" and "the hideous face of separatist treachery, hidden behind a suit and tie". Man, after man, gave speeches that stated that "Iberia would never give in to terrorism" that "the nation would remain strong in the face of separatist terror" and "would smash down the terrorist instead of succumbing to it".\n\nThe regionalists were, of course, appalled by these allegations and threatened a walk out due to the tirades of the militarist faction.

In a brazen statement to the rest of the Council, the conservative faction voiced that the proposed reforms are completely unacceptable because Iberia is only the union of two countries and there cannot be any real special status for other "groups". With complete disregard for the demands of the regionalists, the conservatives stated that "Iberia is indivisible and immortal and will not play into the hands of little pests with grandeurs of nationhood."\n\nAs was expected, the statement received an immediate kickback from the regionalists who called the conservatives out over there "blatantly offensive and callous remarks".

 IBR.5125.d:0 "The Iberian pollical elite set themselves up with an enormous task to hopefully reform Iberia, using a series of debates as part of a determination process to decide the future of the country. The results were, unfortunately, less than spectacular. While the friction in the debates was not exactly overwhelming, it was still enough to undermine any sort of strong consensus that was hoped to be established.\n\nMany in Iberia would have hoped for a solid vision to emerge at the end of these debates but with a lack of agreement in certain key areas, the results are less than pleasant. It is unfortunate that the chance for change or consensus was not truly grasped here but we must plod on, for it is the future of our nation at stake here.\n\nWe may not of got our desired outcome from the debates but Iberia and its government will need to endure. These are testing times and to give in now would be an act of great treachery. The results may have been disappointing but they have not condemned us to ruin yet. We shall go on, and hope to establish a future solid consensus somewhere later down the line."

 IBR.5126.t:0 "An Omnishambles Through and Through"
 IBR.5126.d:0 "It was once the word on the streets that a great change was coming to Iberia. People had started to talk about freedom, openness and a new start. It seemed as though after decades in political purgatory, Iberia could re-emerge from these debates as a fresh forward-thinking ideal, that could unite people in its spirit.\n\nThis, to say the least, has not occurred. In fact, quite the opposite has befallen upon Iberia. We have been made to look like coños in front of all our people. The constant bickering, the blatantly unhealthy clashes and the lack of anything even resembling a consensus has stifled any hopes that this process first brought about. A clear lack of any sort of resolution has been emphasised by critics of the talks, along with the constant fighting that accompanied the debate proceedings. Now, the message being passed around the public is one of failure and disdain. It seems the incompetence displayed here has made the public even question our legitimacy not only to pass change, but to even keep Iberia stable.\n\nThe lack of any clear vision for Iberia's future is deeply concerning yet we must find a way to press on. A different strategy is needed and new ways of thinking may have to emerge or confidence in the Iberian mission could fall to a dramatic point. Press on we shall, but we now have quite the hurdle to overcome."

 ##Honor The Family
 IBR.689.t:0 "The Madrid Families Festival"
 IBR.689.d:0 "An unfortunate fact of the modern world is that many, even within Iberia, have forgotten the importance of a morally righteous family. To help remedy this issue, a great festival was organized in Madrid, celebrating the Iberian family. It seems to have worked, too - crowds of thousands attended, from Madrid and areas across the country. The festival began in the early morning, with all present taking part in a great mass dedicated to the concept of the family, and of its virtues. The schedule was designed to resemble the cycle of life, and to that end the first third of the event - from morning to noon - was dedicated to the children of Iberia.\n\nChildren played games and activities designed for their amusement, all while being lectured on their importance to the country. The parents were not left out, and were able to pass the time by taking advice on the best kinds of "family equipment" to raise children with.\n\nThe midday was directed to the parents, with several hours of speeches about the importance of their role in the family. There weren't enough guest speakers to cover the entire time, so most had to draw their speeches out as long as possible.\n\nFinally, the ceremony came to an end with a celebration of the elders. After stressing the importance of respect for one's elders, the most important elders of all - the Caudillos - personally performed the closing ceremony."
 IBR.689.a:0 "It is remarkable, how such a small bond can cause such great things."
 
 ##Glorify Women's Roles 
 IBR.691.t:0 "Iberian Woman Appreciation Day"
 IBR.691.d:0 "A woman must fulfill her roles in society, for a society to function. They were noble jobs, and to help emphasize their importance and nobility, it was decided that an entire day be dedicated to the appreciation of a woman's importance to society.\n\nThe main bulk of the event was organized through the efforts of the Sección Femenina, with Pilar Primo de Rivera leading the event in Spain and Cecilia Supico Pinto representing it in Portugal. The event was celebrated by recollection, contemplation, and faith. Speeches were delivered by the government representatives in each city in the Union, planned to give two final ones in Madrid and Lisbon respectively. Special masses were held in cities across Iberia, where the priests were able to explain the importance of the women's role in bearing and rearing children, securing the next generation of citizens.\n\nThe festivities were cut short when several self-proclaimed 'feminist organizations' started marches in cities across the union, ruining the celebrations through disruption. Even though most protests were successfully halted by police actions, the protests in Madrid and Lisbon proved volatile enough to necessitate evacuating both representatives."
 IBR.691.a:0 "Such a nice day! Not even the protests could change that." 
 
 ##Maintain The Social Window
 IBR.5130.t:0 "Hierarchy and Society"
 IBR.5130.d:0 "Society requires a hierarchy. Human nature dictates that there must be a pyramid at the center of every state - at the top the leaders, and below them the decreasing rank and increasing size of the lower classes. This is how any good state functions, and Iberia is no exception. In order to show our appreciation for these natural laws, we must incorporate them into many of our daily actions. The only question is how.\n\nThe degree to which we recognize the fundamental laws of hierarchy will make a great difference. If we desire to have more heavy-handed dealings, we may enforce this idea formally. If not, then we may simply encourage the populace to follow it while doing so ourselves."
 IBR.5130.a:0 "The aim of this state is to reinforce them"
 IBR.5130.b:0 "It is a nice idea philosophically"
 
 ##Maintain Our Economic Policies
 IBR.5131.t:0 "Maintaining What We Have"
 IBR.5131.d:0 "The Opus Dei has once more petitioned our government to pursue economic reform. Their incessant requests have turned out to be rather persuasive, and regardless of if it was out of a desire to quiet them down or of genuine conviction, a not-insignificant amount of the government has turned out in support of their economic reforms.\n\nThe Opus Dei, backed by their government benefactors, wish for us to move away from our policy of economic autarky and instead conduct a decisive shift to a more open free market model. Should we listen to them? They have drafted a plan to make a gradual change to their preferred economic model, but for all their posturing we still don't have to oblige them."
 IBR.5131.a:0 "More autarky, not less"
 IBR.5131.b:0 "There will be a measured transition"

 ###Right Branch
 
 ##Release The Pressure
 IBR.5132.t:0 "Restructuring Unfair Systems"
 IBR.5132.d:0 "While some things are not actually problems, it would be downright stupid to assume that there are no problems within Iberia. Taking these smokescreens and assuming they are the case for every reported issue would be a straight line to the death of Iberia. The minority regions of Iberia face problems and unjustified oppression, rooting from issues designed to suppress them as a people. These systems will need to go.\n\nIn order to make sure the minorities do not get preferential treatment, we will need to determine the extent to which these systems need to be revised. We could probably relieve most of the anger against the government by some token funding, though some more may help keep the complaints away better."
 IBR.5132.a:0 "Do what we can to rectify these issues"
 IBR.5132.b:0 "Allocate some funds, but not too much"
 
 ##Walk The Line
 IBR.5133.t:0 "Toning Down the Rhetoric"
 IBR.5133.d:0 "Look at our older speeches, of the language used, of the way the documents refer to things. Our language is causing problems. The way the Caudillos speak in public appearances, the way the state press prints reports, above all else it is inflammatory. This tone inspires unrest, as it creates the perception that we are wholly uncaring of their presence.\n\nIf we were to drop this language, then governing the country will likely become easier. We will find many more agents and supporters where we would have once alienated them. Would it be better to drop this language entirely? It would be more work for a benefit that would be around the same as just cutting some of it, which would force less change onto the status quo."
 IBR.5133.a:0 "No more inciteful language "
 IBR.5133.b:0 "Anything too explicit is off limits"
 
 ##Find Out What They Want
 IBR.5134.t:0 "Results of the Investigation"
 IBR.5134.d:0 "After much delay, corruption, and red tape - all of which is now resolved, for the investigation's sake - the investigation into the minority regions was finally completed. We took careful polls and encouraged that opinions be submitted, and carefully compiled them into various categories of complaints or opinions. Once we had filtered out the low-quality or obviously terrorist poll responses, the results were, to put it lightly, less-than-ideal.\n\nWith their wants and desires firmly on record, we can start to take actions to resolve them. However, the question still stands about how much we should hold ourselves to these resolutions. If we are totally set on fixing the issues, publishing the findings publicly would serve as a motivator, as they would expect us to fix them all. Were we to keep the results private, then we could do as much as we please and call it the necessary amount. "
 IBR.5134.a:0 "Have these findings published"
 IBR.5134.b:0 "This might hurt our reputation..."

 ##Presidents for Life
 IBR.5135.t:0 "The Presidents' Speech"
 IBR.5135.d:0 "The radio crackles to life. The man on the other end, in a voice so monotone it would take practice-honed talent, announces the beginning of a speech. The Caudillos had something to say, and it was urgent enough that it could not wait to be scheduled. With this in mind, most of Iberia had tuned in to listen to the two leaders speak.\n\n"Citizens of Iberia," spoke the two men, their voices so alike once they spoke together. "We have decided that, following careful discussion, we are no longer simply Caudillos. We have been named the presidents of the Iberian Council, a position which we additionally will hold until further notice."\n\nThe Presidents spoke some more, sometimes swapping the speaking position, of topics that were far less related. Finally, they finished. With the long announcement concluded, everyone present in Iberia found themselves forming an opinion. When everything was said and done..."
 IBR.5135.a:0 "Iberians welcome their guidance!"
 IBR.5135.b:0 "Most Iberians look to be on their side"
 IBR.5135.c:0 "Their words did not seem to rile up the people"
 
 ##Localize the Legislatures
 #you get this event if you've already been a bit nice to minorities
 IBR.5136.t:0 "Power to the Regions"
 IBR.5136.d:0 "At the time, it seemed like centralizing the bureaucracy in the two capitals of Iberia - Madrid and Lisbon - was an excellent idea. There was a Union to be kept together, after all, so why wouldn't the heads need to know what the arms were doing? As it turns out, trying to figure out what all the arms were doing, our many flailing arms, has caused Iberia no small amount of grief. The bureaucracy is frequently swamped, and trying to keep up with the many requests piled on it has caused it to fail to actually accomplish anything in a reasonable time.\n\nBecause of this, decentralization is our best option. If we were to hand more powers to the provinces, they could handle their day-to-day affairs on their own, as well as easing the present social tensions. While they will not be federalized - we are not liberals, after all - giving them a bit extra power will ease the central administration's workload. How much would be best to give them?"
 IBR.5136.a:0 "Decentralization is the goal."
 IBR.5136.b:0 "Limited power, but power all the same."
 
 #you get this event if you haven't been nice to minorities
 IBR.5137.t:0 "Power to the Regions?"
 IBR.5137.d:0 "Iberia has had a questionable relationship with minorities. From Franco's oppression to our paternal watchmanship, the many minorities around the country have more than likely developed a resentment of the Union. If we were to give them the option, then, they would nearly certainly split away from our state. Are we really sure people like this should have more power? The threats to our national security could be intense.\n\nOf course, if we give them some limited power, then the minorities could be sated a small amount. Giving them too much would kill the Union, but a token level of power would serve to stop any complaints that we are oppressive. Still, there is always the option to disregard what they think..."
 IBR.5137.a:0 "Local legislatures, but limited power" #this means the same as IBR.5136.b
 IBR.5137.b:0 "Actually this is all mainly rhetoric..."

 ##Representation For All Iberians

 #you get this event if you've already been a bit nice to minorities
 IBR.5138.t:0 "A Fundamentally Broken Political System"
 IBR.5138.d:0 "Iberia has been on a shaky footing ever since its inception. Through well intentioned but misplaced policies, decisions made more to sate egos than to help the country, and corruption so thorough it would make president Nixon blush, a country has built its foundations on sand. Some of the decisions the Caudillos made, though sensible at the time, are better off reversed. It seems like the only way to save the Union, is to open up some more politically.\n\nWe need to do something politically. We have our best chance at saving the country by increasing its representation and making those present eager to participate. There are a number of tabled reforms we could pass, though thoroughly overhauling the system could work even better for our ends."
 IBR.5138.a:0 "A thorough overhaul is in order"
 IBR.5138.b:0 "Let us get through the tabled reforms"
 
 #you get this event if you haven't been nice to minorities
 IBR.5139.t:0 "Improving Representation in Iberia"
 IBR.5139.d:0 "Iberia has run just fine ever since the Presidents opted to merge their countries. There have been a few hiccups here and there, and the government is not without its problems, but they have been moved on from and fixed, given time. This is the nature of the Union - it is never perfect at first, but can improve to be near it given the right attention. Some do not get this, and these people, often minorities, will agitate for our destruction. We need them to be silent.\n\nThe best way to silence these pests is not the stick, but rather the carrot. By passing some limited political reforms, we could go a long way to bringing dissent down to acceptable levels. How much would be best? We could work through a backlog of tabled reforms, or simply target the most critical policies."
 IBR.5139.a:0 "Start working through the tabled reforms" #this means the same as IBR.5138.b
 IBR.5139.b:0 "We should probably focus on the most important ones..."
 
 ##Keep an Eye on Elections
 IBR.5140.t:0 "Surveillance for the Greater Good"
 IBR.5140.d:0 "Democracy is all well and good as a system, but sometimes it can produce unfavorable results. Above anything else, an election's primary purpose is to legitimize the regime in the eyes of the people, and if we allow ourselves to be voted out then it fails to accomplish that. We need to ensure that the people - or enough of them - vote for the right choice.\n\nWe will be deploying agents to most major polling stations, and there they will establish themselves and keep a very close eye on the voters. In addition, wire-tapping of election workers is to be conducted with state of the art technology purchased from the United States. Our electoral plans depend on enough information being revealed through constant surveillance. Hopefully, the systems already in place will not obstruct us."
 IBR.5140.a:0 "Let us hope this works out..."
 
 IBR.5141.t:0 "Everything According to Plan"
 IBR.5141.d:0 "Of course, what we wanted done to polling stations was not necessarily legal. If we were to blatantly compromise a perceived anonymity, and even more through breaching legal protocols and precedents, it would create an impressive stir among the public. The matter required sensitive handling, and no small amount of work from our bureaucrats to ensure that our aims were implemented correctly and the laws budged to make them legally bulletproof.\n\nWe should have never even thought of doubting our bureaucratic strength. Loyal to the Presidents, and with a skill to match it, we now have careful observation firmly established over most polling places, allowing us some influence over how people vote."
 IBR.5141.a:0 "Now, about those voting booths..." 
 IBR.5141.b:0 "All in a day's work" #option which shows up in all other cases

 IBR.5142.t:0 "Stronger Electoral Control"
 IBR.5142.d:0 "In a society like Iberia's, it is the duty of the stronger leader figures to guide the lesser masses. This hierarchy is known by all from the lowliest janitor to the Presidents themselves, and the average people accept the guidance of their betters. It is not only accepted, but even desired that the state provide a basic framework for people to do their civic duty within.\n\nThrough this unspoken consent to provide direct help, many facets of the polling stations - including the voting itself - are under our influence. We have the ability to control the ballots themselves, and by combining this assistance with our previous surveillance, very little will happen during an election that we do not know about. The public supports this move, and thanks to that it will be able to last for a long time to come."
 IBR.5142.a:0 "It's harder to do something about the turnout rate..."
 
 IBR.5143.t:0 "Attempts at Monitoring Elections Blocked"
 IBR.5143.d:0 "It would be a bad idea to simply declare our elections monitored. By taking such a decisive course of action, and in the process break many established norms, we would set ourselves up to alienate many who would otherwise support us. Setting up surveillance on most polling stations around the country would be a delicate affair, leaning mostly on the competence of our bureaucratic services to ensure that things are as they should be. If they are not swayed, then we cannot do anything.\n\nGiven the current results, the bureaucrats do not act with Iberia in mind. Unable to actually deny our requests, we have fallen victim to the timeless political maneuver that is not actually doing what we desire. They claim that they cannot make progress in surveillance due to complications in protocol and paperwork - conveniently leaving out how they are responsible for most of it - and even create more when they can excuse it. Political surveillance, it seems, is further from our reach than anticipated."
 IBR.5143.a:0 "Really? Perhaps their budget needs some surveillance as well."

 #A means through which to guide
 IBR.5144.t:0 "A Plan for Election Results"
 IBR.5144.d:0 "Ultimately, an election is an event where the people decide who they think should be in charge of a country. This can be very good for us - the majority wants us, after all - but that same system is a double edged sword. If we were to be voted out, unlikely as it is, then we would be in the uncomfortable position where giving up power would be expected. It would be a nightmare, so we will need to make sure the sleep is sound.\n\nMost of the troublesome parts of democracy can be avoided if we place the people in an advisory role, allowing their decisions to guide us but not order us. Then, we can claim all the benefits of public support and none of the drawbacks of losing it. If we are confident in our support, then we could just allow elections to proceed unimpeded."
 IBR.5144.a:0 "The people's decisions should ideally be binding"
 IBR.5144.b:0 "The people guide, but do not rule"
 
 IBR.5145.t:0 "The Party Question" 
 IBR.5145.d:0 "Iberia's newfound reforms has set many important precedents in its political scene. Dissidents speak more freely now, and ideas that would have been met with hostility are now simply points to be considered. The reformism has brought an entirely new dimension to the business of policy, as anyone with a lick of political sense can see that the environment is definitely changing. One of the new issues buzzing around is that of political parties.\n\nDo we really want more political parties? Iberia has been run by a single party - the National Union - ever since its inception. The argument has been made that allowing the creation of new political parties may be just what the country needs, as their limited dissidence will do wonders towards discharging much pent-up tension. Could these parties be what Iberia needs to save itself?"
 IBR.5145.a:0 "Iberia benefits from multiple parties"
 IBR.5145.b:0 "That is one step too far..."
 
 IBR.5146.t:0 "Presidents Speak in Favor of Parties"
 IBR.5146.d:0 ""After careful consideration, we find that Iberia must evolve to hold more political parties than simply the state. We not only condone the creation of these political organizations, but as Presidents and Caudillos we will take steps to assist in the creation of more, for the good of Iberia..."\n\nWithin mere minutes of the announcement, Iberia found itself in an uproar. The Caudillos, of all people, supporting a multi-party system? It was ridiculous. As it later happened, this event proved the fertilizer for the Iberian political scene to blossom, as the endorsement from the very Caudillos themselves led many to flock to political parties. Democracy had a new vigor now, stronger than it ever would have been otherwise."
 IBR.5146.a:0 "Everyone comes around to it eventually."
 
 IBR.5147.t:0 "Internal Transcripts Leak"
 IBR.5147.d:0 ""Don't you think a non-binding election would cause an uproar we can't handle?"\n\n"Who cares what the people think? What will they do, vote us out?"\n\nLike all internal meetings, transcripts were kept of the entire meeting. The subject of democracy did not come up just once, but several times - and frequently in the same fashion. One would bring it up, and then another would deride the very concept. It would be quite damning, were it not a private meeting.\n\nLike all things best kept private, it didn't stay that way. Our bureaucrats, whether by incompetence or malice, have managed to have our internal transcripts leaked to the public. Before, we had a level of plausible deniability, but now we don't even have that! The public is angry at our approach, and there's nothing to suggest it will subside."
 IBR.5147.a:0 "Idiots!"
 
 IBR.5148.t:0 "Protests for Binding Elections"
 IBR.5148.d:0 "The people of Iberia have turned out in force. In crowds of thousands, protestors march through the cities of the union. In smaller numbers, these same protestors also march through the countryside - presumably to join their urban brethren. It is everything the Guardia Civil can do just to keep these protests from exploding into riots.\n\nThese protests are in response to our recent meetings, nicknamed the "autocracy admissions" by the media. They are protesting for legally binding elections. We cannot disperse crowds of this magnitude, there are simply too many to try it without starting a true revolution; our only hope to keep the status quo is to ignore these protests for long enough that they fizzle out. When this happens, nobody knows."
 IBR.5148.a:0 "Find some meaningless scandal to throw at them!"

 ##Allow the parties to grow

 #if presidents speak in favor of parties
 IBR.5149.t:0 "Moving Towards a Multiparty System"
 IBR.5149.d:0 "Even today, the word of the Presidents is supreme. As they say, then so it shall be done. Their will is law. So when the Presidents decided that Iberia needed a multi-party system - a real one, not a sham democracy with a controlled opposition - then it was decided then and there that Iberia would have itself a democracy. No matter the surprise, or the confusion, orders were orders.\n\nDrastic reforms are being written up, and are only a rubber stamp away from approval. The old laws, limiting Iberia to only one effective political party, will be repealed as soon as possible. With the new political diversity, Iberia is well on its way to becoming a democracy. This is a very big step, big enough to catch the eye of many within and without the government."
 IBR.5149.a:0 "Change is coming to Iberia."

 IBR.5150.t:0 "The Rise of the Parties"
 IBR.5150.d:0 "For a long time, Iberia has had no formal political parties. Crushing restrictions have choked them out, leaving nothing but a few fringe groups to organize underground, where they were by and large irrelevant. With the new reforms, other parties are finally beginning to form, diversifying our political scene. They are young, embryonic, and inexperienced. This could be an opportunity like little else.\n\nAgainst our apparatus, which is finely tempered by the rigors of political life, these new parties would have little resistance. If we were to actively campaign about them, then we could keep them weak and marginalized. However, we would be seen as more legitimate if we allow them to grow and become relevant entities."
 IBR.5150.a:0 "Tell Iberians that competition is healthy"
 IBR.5150.b:0 "Campaign Against Them"
 
 IBR.5151.t:0 "The Party Growth Slows"
 IBR.5151.d:0 "It was well known within the government that the parties would eventually stop growing. No-one could attract a universal appeal, and once each party found their entire base, they would plateau. The only question was where - would they be irrelevant, would they be present, or would their combined strength be enough to challenge, or even topple, the regime? Few could provide a definitive date, though it seems like they won't need to.\n\nThe new political parties have started to grow at a slower pace, and with the rate steadily declining they are set to likely plateau in a short period of time. It seems our advice on competition was taken to heart, but not so much so that we face overwhelming threats. What now?"

 IBR.5152.t:0 "The Party Growth Slows Greatly"
 IBR.5152.d:0 "We have had our plan succeed, not quite beyond our expectations but certainly optimally. We have campaigned against the other parties in Iberia, exposing their faults and flaws to the public. It has worked. The other parties, unable to put up a competent resistance to a real campaign, have mostly folded and do not attempt to counter our media - not that they could regardless. Their growth has slowed dramatically, and it looks like they will plateau far lower than the extent required to challenge us. With this taken care of, what should we do next?"
 IBR.5152.a:0 "The strategy worked, we can relax"
 IBR.5152.b:0 "Strike them while they are weak!" #note that this option is not always visible, reflect that in the event
 
 IBR.5153.t:0 "Propaganda Perceived as Weak"
 IBR.5153.d:0 "When we first ordered a campaign in place against the new political parties, we were assured they would be squashed. Our political influence was strong and enforced by veterans, surely there would be no failure. All they needed was a little bit of time to work their magic. As it turns out, we should not have trusted these men with government positions.\n\nThese men are veterans of politics, but it turns out that this means nothing but their time present. They have turned out an incompetent, disconnected campaign. We put our trust into these people and the most they could turn out was pitiful, obvious propaganda that failed to appeal to even the lowest common denominator!"
 IBR.5153.a:0 "Let's see if their successors can do better."
 
 IBR.5154.t:0 "The Party Growth Increases"
 IBR.5154.d:0 "As if a failed campaign wasn't bad enough, things have gotten even worse. The propaganda itself has been turned into a selling point by opposition parties, who have taken its disconnected, out-of-touch rhetoric and proclaimed it a reason to oppose us. The public seem to have caught on very easily to this particular piece, for the opposition had a much better campaign staff than we did.\n\nWith our inexperienced new employees, we are unable to stop or reverse this change of events. The parties are growing even more than before - and they are drawing even from our base of support."
 IBR.5154.a:0 "Really?!"
 
 IBR.5155.t:0 "A Final Blow to the Opportunists"
 IBR.5155.d:0 "Finally, Iberia will be freed from organized dissidence! There are many opportunists in the country, full of arrogance and greed. They thought that they might be able to take over the country, now that we have shown openness and tolerance to them. Whenever they are presented a potential opportunity, their first thought is to take advantage of it, rather than showing gratitude. This blind, heedless political opportunism will prove to be their downfall.\n\nThis time, there is no openness and tolerance. In our most genius move yet, the new openness is a trick. We will use it to lure the vultures out, promising a wonderful political carcass, and now that they have taken the bait, sweeping in for their opportunity, we will destroy them. They will not see it coming, as they are arrested and their movements destroyed while they are still vulnerable. Iberia will be saved!"
 IBR.5155.a:0 "Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good crackdown."
 
 IBR.5156.t:0 "The Parties Crushed"
 IBR.5156.d:0 "It is done. The dissident opportunists have been crushed. They were so caught up in their insidious plots to destroy the country that they never saw our crackdown coming. Their greed kept them blind until the last moment, where the ringleaders only realized the error of their opportunism once they were being driven off in handcuffs by the Guardia Civil.\n\nThe Presidents's control over Iberia is secure once more. These parties will never be a threat again, and their movements will wither and die like a bird without its wings."
 IBR.5156.a:0 "I'm not sure what they expected."
 
 IBR.5157.t:0 "Parties Slightly Weakened, but Relevant"
 IBR.5157.d:0 "The parties have not been defeated, like we wished. Despite our efforts to find and arrest the ringleaders, and otherwise sabotage their efforts, nothing has proved as effective as intended. This is not due to any particular resilience on their part - they were still taken by total surprise - but due to our own poor planning. Due to several regulations, technicalities, and plain legal obstruction, we could not entirely remove the opposition's political influence.\n\nIn any case, it is certainly not a defeat for us. They are still weakened, unable to exert the influence they could previously. Our actions may have given them a few more supporters than before, but what does that matter when they can't leverage them?"

After being sent to disperse the protests in Madrid, a tense standoff developed as the crowd refused to back down. When ordered by the Caudillos to break up the crowds by force, the men of the Guardia Civil openly refused, lowering their weapons and parting for the masses. Similar events have transpired in almost every city in Iberia, and now the Guardia Civil stands idly by, its men openly fraternizing with the protestors, as the mob swells larger by the hour.\n\nThis insubordination cannot stand. The mob must be put down with an iron fist, lest the situation tumble even further out of our control. This incipient revolution must be killed in its crib, even if it means drowning the streets of Iberia in blood.

Pleading to the soldiers not to fire on their fellow Iberians, the masses, having adopted flowers as a symbol of their cause, placed them in the barrels of the soldier's rifles. Thus the Carnation Revolution was given its name.\n\nMoved by the compassion and bravery of the protestors, the soldiers defected en mass, joining their brothers in the Guardia Civil. The military officers followed suit. Within a day of the army's deployment onto the streets, a coup of left-wing officers was launched, storming the Palace of El Pardo and the São Bento Mansion and placing both of the Caudillos of Iberia under arrest. The revolutionaries immediately announced their intentions to hold free and open elections as soon as possible.\n\nMillions across the peninsula rejoice at the restoration of their hard-won democracy and the dawn of a new, free Iberia.

Sporadic scuffles broke out across the square.\n\nThen someone fired a shot. In a panic, the Guardia Civil opened fire on the crowd, shooting indicrimantely into the protestors, some of them with machine guns.

Members of the Guardia Civil are being killed on sight, government buildings are being looted and burned to the ground, and everywhere, men are arming themselves. Meanwhile, in the regions, separatists are organizing openly, taking advantage of the chaos to prepare for open revolt against the central government. Civil War is in the air.\n\nMeanwhile the Caudillos hide in their palaces, impotent before the coming storm, gathering around them what loyal men will fight to defend the old regime.

 IBR.5416.d:0 "Caudillo of Iberia, President of the Government, Champion of the Last Crusade and Hispanic Heritage. Francisco Franco had many titles, styles, and accolades. "Lord of Meirás'' was the least well known of these, and for good reason. Franco liked to keep his summer manor in Galicia out of the way, far from the prying eyes and endless churning politics of El Pardo, the Madrid palace where he usually held court. Here he could rest, and conduct his business in peace.\n\nThat is why when reaching out to Opus Dei, he invited them to Meirás, where the hardliners in the Falange could not be a nuisance. The regime and Opus Dei had a complicated relationship. They were loyal Catholics, but their internal secrecy had always spurned on claims from the more inquisitorial members of the Falange that they were a front for Freemasonry. In a country where membership to the Freemasons was illegal, the mere suspicion was reason enough to keep Opus Dei at an arm's length.\n\nBut times were changing. The Oil Crisis had sent the Iberian economy into a deep recession, with nobody in the government quite knowing what to do about it. Franco was in need of new blood, advisors up to date with the latest economic theories. Opus Dei had amongst its membership many fine economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. Technocrats, disinterested in the petty politics of El Prado who could deliver results and reform the economy on a new, sound basis.\n\nWorking with Opus Dei and its members would have its consequences. The Caudillo knew he would have to put his foot down, stamping out complaints and protestations from Falange ideologues before they could even be voiced. Either that, or the three economists would have to carry out their work in secret, presenting their plans to him at his frequent visits to Meirás. Either way, he was a Caudillo of Iberia, and where he chose to go, Opus Dei, and the Falange, would follow."

 IBR.5417.d:0 "Caudillo Franscisco Franco watched as his bodyguard reached into his holster, drew his pistol, and fired a single shot into the head of the horse. The beast fell to the ground unceremoniously and died. Out on his customary morning carriage trip around the grounds of the Pazo de Meirás, his summer palace, one of the carriage horses had slipped and broken its leg. Pitying its pained cries, the Caudillo had ordered it shot. When he was younger he had rode about the grounds himself on the very same horse, yet even that small pleasure had been stolen from him by age.\n\nDuring the carriage ride back to the Pazo de Meirás, the Caudillo once again thought over the National Economic Stabilization Plan presented to him by his new team of economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. The technocrats' plan was ambitious, proposing a fixed exchange rate, raised interest rates, increased foreign investment, significant cuts to public expenditure, and privatization of key industries. It was exactly the kind of new, pioneering reform that Franco believed the struggling Spanish economy desperately needed.\n\nYet it would also be controversial. The plan went back on decades of economic orthodoxy, doing away with the official policy of National-Syndicalism under which Iberia was neither capitalist or communist, with class struggle abolished and the worker and the capitalist both serving the interests of the Iberian nation. State ownership of industry, national economic independence, protection of the worker: the policies of National-Syndicalism were one of the great legacies of the War of Liberation against the communists, or so said the ideologues of the Falange. To give it up would be to relinquish the power of the state over economic policy and invite pernicious foreign influence into Iberia.\n\nFranco himself was loath to undermine it, at least publicly. Perhaps some compromise would have to be found, in which the National Stabilization Plan was only partly implemented, leaving National-Syndicalism largely intact. But perhaps, like a horse with a broken leg, it simply had to be put down."

He already knew that it would tell him the same thing that their reports had been telling him for weeks: Extend the timelines.\n\nWhen the oil crisis had begun and the government implemented its new economic policy, many promises had been made. Promises that the austerity would only be temporary. Promises that ordinary Iberians would not bear the brunt of the cost for the crisis. Promises that the Caudillo and the Iberian state was there to take care of them. Promises that they seemed more and more unable to keep as the days went by.\n\nThe whole program had been framed in a series of timelines, with several major austerity measures to be lifted when the allotted time was reached. Yet after months and months, the Iberian economy had only marginally improved, with Unemployment was still high and investor confidence stagnant. And all the while, the deadline for the end of the austerity measures was approaching.\n\nThe technocrats had been telling the Caudillo for some time now that their liberalization program needed more time for its effects to be felt, for the economy to start turning around. They had begged for the timelines to be extended, but up till now Franco had refused them. How would he look if he went back on his sacred word to the Iberian people. But now things were coming to a head. He would have to make a choice: betray his word, or risk economic catastrophe."

Now, standing uncertainly alone atop a house of crumbling cards, he wished the former technocrat was beside him. He had always had a clever comment ready for a situation like this. Franco could almost hear the faint whisper of his voice.\n\nYet he was alone, sitting in a large conference room surrounded by empty faced bureaucrats and lackeys who he could not rely on for critique or sound advice. What did they know of the severe strain put upon the union by this precarious situation? What did they know of the Portuguese people's mournful cries and the significance these held for the future of this nation? It was on him to now hold Iberia together in the face of an ugly and unrelenting world. Hopefully alongside him someone to bring the joys and rigor of ruling back to the old man's heart.\n\n"Brief me again on the two candidates." The almost hushed murmur made many, even those sat close to the usually imposing military man, lean in to listen intently. A short pause followed, as the room was unsure of who should speak first.

His senior staff had been excited at the opportunity to now further centralize the regime, ensuring maximum control of a population he might need ready for war. Or worse.\n\nYet Franco knew he needed more than a figurehead to keep Portugal loyal within the union. His final choice had been the scholarly Marcelo Caetano, a protegee of Salazar who had already lived a long life inside the world of politics. His moderate reformer stance may be an issue that could offset the stability brought from securing Portugal, as hardliners may see him as a step too far in the wrong direction. It would be a difficult matter even for his eventual successor to contend with. He sighed. This was not a world that readily embraced the language of hope anymore."

Yet with his age he may soon follow his former political rival into the grave. To leave the task of maintaining a stable Iberia, following Spanish centralization, to someone not of his own caliber was dangerous. Hence someone of similar leaning was needed, someone who would be easier to work with and who could be trusted with upholding Portugal's half of the union once he himself would be dead. By suggestion of his advisors António da Mota Veiga had been chosen for this role. A capable and ruthless politician who had enough experience in Portuguese politics to be an essential asset.

The silence ate deeply into the confidence of all those who faced the Caudillo. Then he spoke, outlining a plan both rational and extremely dangerous. He would assume sole leadership of Iberia and prepare in grooming a successor who would lead a unified state against the dark forces on their doorstep. None of the bureaucrats could see the slight nervous twitch in the left hand of the Spanish dictator, and even if they had done it likely would have only been pushed onto his age."

Pillars of society like the church could not be forgotten in a historic event such as this.

Hands reached out to grasp hold of him as others were swatted away by the countless security personnel which guarded the extended walkway. Admiring the effort of the Spanish Caudillo in quickly preparing such sumptuous courtiership of the Portuguese capital, he climbed the hastily erected marble stairs to stand beside the aging former general. Not exchanging a single word with Caetano, Franco stepped forward to the microphone.\n\nHis speech, a strange mix of honorable remembrance for Salazar and a desperate call for unity managed to arouse some excitement amongst the masses of Lisbon's gathered. Caetano noted the slightest hint of a satisfied smile on the old man's face upon his retreat to the back of the stage. Now it was his own turn to step forward. He braced physically against the intense din as he quickly shuffled the notes for his speech. Words of reform, moderation and an ease of tensions on the half peninsula were almost lost in the raucous applause that followed. Did he detect a hint of jealousy in Franco's eyes when they left the stage together? No matter, he had done his part and he had done it well."

'Is this true,' he bellowed at the nervous man who had stepped back in fear of being in the way of the Spanish Caudillo's ravings and flying spittle. Hesitantly pointing at the briefing he had just brought prior to Franco's explosion the aide excused himself and quietly left the room.\n\nWith both his hands holding his head steady, Franco began to quickly read the report that the National Institute of Statistics was about to publish publicly. His choice as successor to the role of Portuguese Caudillo, da Mota Veiga, was being accused of possibly being involved in a corruption scandal. Further details could not be given yet as the investigation was just about to get under way. The accusation however stood there on the paper, bold and strong. The aging Caudillo groaned; it was not as if Iberia had not been facing enough problems as it is. Now what had been considered as the safe choice for the replacement of Salazar was in the process of letting him down more than his old rival ever had."

 IBR.5187.t:0 "Evidence Surfaces"
 IBR.5187.d:0 "Despite Franco's quick handling of the press it seems the corruption crisis surrounding his choice for the position of Portuguese Caudillo has its own ways of expanding in magnitude. A regional paper from the north of Portugal has published a document from the National Institute of Statistics detailing how da Mota Veiga had seemingly purposefully adjusted some numbers to increase the level of funding received from the central government for a town he had property in. Despite the newspaper's relatively neutral coverage the significance was still damning.\n\nReports of da Mota Veiga arriving at Franco's residence following the publication's release were circulated in national papers. The reasons were however censored well this time, with reporters praising the level of cooperation and unity between the new leaders of the Union. With the issues facing effective censorship in Iberia it is not known how aware the public is of the still unfolding scandal. One thing is for certain, the new administration has a long road ahead before it can begin to govern successfully."

The reality was looking starkly different.\n\nDocuments had been flooding, not just from the Institute investigating Salazar's successor, but other government branches and institutions. Under da Mota Veiga's watch an astounding number of statistics regarding Portuguese fiscal policy had been entirely fabricated. Now Franco's choice had been forced to explain himself on a daily basis as more and more information kept reaching the Spanish Caudillo's desk. Serious doubts were beginning to be raised within the upper echelons of Iberian politics as to whether da Mota Veiga could even be suitable now considering the vast amount of money he had lost the Union. Some analysts have gone so far as to claim that the losses have hit Spain in particular, further deteriorating the situation behind closed doors.\n\nFollowing a week of discussions with Franco, eventually da Mota Veiga was forced to stand in front of the national press and proclaim that his inauguration would have to be delayed due to personal reasons. Ignoring the rushing torrent of questions washing over him, the now disgraced politician stepped back from the podium to be assisted away by Spanish security guards."

There was only another day until the plaza which had been prepared so carefully for the inauguration of da Motta Veiga as Portuguese Caudillo would be filled with to commemorate his own appointment. Something which weeks earlier had been decided against by the Spanish Caudillo. He continued to watch him, now wondering whether many would come to watch at all. The local police could surely procure some 'willing' spectators but what did it matter. The damage had been done.\n\nFranco had put his name behind a man destroyed by the most astounding corruption scandal Iberia had faced in its miniscule history. The public, despite being force-fed lies and half truths about the situation, had been able to receive enough real information from local papers and intuition to recognize the significance of the horrible blunder which had occurred at the locus of power in Iberian politics.\n\nFinally turning away from the worker who had by now cleanly removed da Motta Veiga's name, Caetano wondered how long and how much work it would take to scrub away a misdeed from a nation's consciousness."

 IBR.5190.t:0 "A Message to Iberia"
 IBR.5190.d:0 ""My fellow countrymen, we stand united in our deep sorrow at the loss of the great Caudillo Salazar. His friendship and wisdom were great assets in our ruling of this eternal Union of nations. The memory of the work he has done to promote the ideals of Iberia shall live on forever. Now however I stand alone, having to face the gargantuan task of managing without him. I ask you, my brothers and sisters, to assist me, to support me now that I and this Union are in the greatest hour of need."\n\nFranco sat in front of the cameras and microphones rigidly. One could sense the excited energy in the air, almost as if a single spark could set it all off. The crew assembled and working to broadcast the now sole Caudillo's message to his people around Iberia often throughout his speech looked at each other tellingly. Hidden smirks and grins were exchanged. The Spanish dictator almost couldn't contain his immense glee; he was abuzz, with every sentence of his long speech reminding of the bombastic public speaking his hated enemies in the Reich used to practice. Despite the message proclaiming extraordinary measures in uncertain times in a similar vein in which the Union had first been announced, the significance of the political reality that was hidden behind Franco's words were not lost on those watching and listening. The Union was now solely governed by a Spaniard from Madrid. The consequences of this are still uncertain."

Reactions were muted to the extent that public officials deemed that Salazar's death had created a temporary culture of mourning across the Union. The more capable ones however recognized the phenomenon for what it was. The calm before the storm.\n\nFirst signs of protest in Portugal were quickly squashed by authorities. Initially it was solemn and quiet marches in the larger cities that could be dispersed at the first sign of police presence. However, as the days wore on the marches did not stop organising and in fact began to grow considerably in size. Soon they also began to take on a much more radical tone as people began to bring along signs and sang traditional Portuguese songs. Again, authorities were called in to deal with what senior Spanish officials started to call an official show of defiance against the Iberian state. This did not the stop marchers either as their numbers continued to swell and their actions began to negatively affect the economy. Arrests and show trials were not putting off those who were now calling for the formation of an independent Portugal, free from Spanish oppression. Local officials and newspapers began to stop toeing the line officially mandated by an increasingly nervous Madrid. State oppression began to become visible as sweeping arrests were made and curfews began to be set in place."

An unofficial strike has been called with many government workers simply staying at home or joining the continuous marches through the towns and cities. On top of this ministers and high-level officials were handing in their letters of resignation, citing an inability to work for an administration they did not believe in.\n\nThe newspaper censors were working restlessly as most major and minor publications within Portugal were reporting on this mass desertion from the Iberian project. They could not however censor the foreign observers effectively who had begun to spread seditious rumours that army units were amassing at the former border.\n\nAll the while Franco watched his empire burn and crumble around him. His hard work uniting two peoples, his grovelling to Portuguese officials, his compromises while Salazar was still around. All for nothing now that he had made one bad decision. He would be damned though if these traitors would crush his ambitions without a fight. So, he stood over his desk like Nero, singing maniacally in his head as more news of sedition reached his office, waiting for the rot to burn and the just to take their righteous place afterwards."

Yet surprise filled their faces as it was noticed that they had not been the only ones to show disrespect to the council.\n\nAs the Portuguese began to whisper amongst themselves the door opened again and the aging Caudillo marched in, taking his seat at the head of the table. Looking around the room shortly he coughed and began to speak, only to be interrupted by a Portuguese member of the council. The Spaniard's eyes virtually bulged out of their sockets in rage as he waved for the man to continue. Denouncing the inability of the council to restrain the Caudillo in acting against the virtues of unity and shared responsibility upon which the Union had been established, the Portuguese rattled down a list of condemnations to which all his fellow countrymen of the council had put their names to. Even if the council had no real power in stopping the power-hungry Caudillo, they could at least show their discontent. If looks could kill, then the speaker would have turned to ash. The Spanish dictator was not pleased. He however motioned for the remaining topics of discussion to now be addressed, an irony not lost on the poor man who would soon never be able to see his beloved homeland again."

Some of the more friendly Spanish members had attempted to make conversation with their Portuguese peers only to be rudely ignored. The air was heavy with tension as everyone waited for the final participant to arrive. Strutting into the quiet conference room Franco immediately observed the small pin badges on each of the Portuguese members' suits. He laughed inwardly at the ineffectual sign of protest. Wearing pins of the Portuguese national flag would not change their situation in the slightest. The Spanish Caudillo now held total control after all.\n\nSitting down he observed that his bones creaked slightly; hoping that no one heard he quickly went on to highlight the sessions agenda of topics that needed to be addressed, putting a high stress on foreign policy issues. In the middle of his monologue however, all the Portuguese members of the council stood one by one. As Franco and the Spaniards looked on aghast, they began to slowly filter out of the room without making a single noise. Finally, Franco stood, his face ablaze in fury as he ordered them to immediately return to their seats or have their privilege of advising the Caudillo forever forfeited. A few grimaced as he went on to claim that Salazar would have been ashamed at the childish foolery they were now acting out. Yet none of them even turned to acknowledge the Spanish dictator. Sitting back down and grumbling to himself, Franco made a mental note to pass on all of the traitor's names to the police."

 IBR.5195.t:0 "Caetano's First Day"
 IBR.5195.d:0 "Following the grand inauguration Caetano quickly delved into administrative work, attempting to gain an even clearer picture of the situation Iberia was finding itself in. Knowing the problems facing regional representations he recognized his own important role, not just as a competent replacement for Salazar but also in being a figurehead of Portuguese interests in the Union. He was able to ingratiate himself effectively with the members of the Iberian Council. Caetano figured that despite their seeming lack of power in opposing Caudillo decision making that they were still extremely important in the process of smooth governance. If an issue were to divide the two dictators it may also help to gain their support to overwhelm Franco's arguments.\n\nThe first day was over, a flurry of meetings and paperwork to establish his authority behind the closed doors of government in the same way his inauguration had cemented his standing on the international stage through foreign press coverage. A small rest in his new office finally allowed him to clear his mind slightly. He looked out of the grand windows on a bustling Madrid, still heaving with activity despite the late hour. Pleased that he could now begin to shape the direction that Union would take in the future he smiled happily. Important work had to be done and he was prepared for it."
 IBR.5195.a:0 "A bright future ahead?"

 IBR.5196.t:0 "Caetano's First Day"
 IBR.5196.d:0 "The inauguration ceremony had not been an easy affair. Franco's introductory speech had drawn hefty criticism from both the crowd and papers afterwards as being disingenuous and displaying an inability to face the mistakes of the regime. It set the tone for Caetano's speech after, as many had already left and those who remained only seemed to be half listening. Dejected the new replacement for Salazar had left early, only quietly answering a few questions from the press before slipping off.\n\nHis first day in office was no better as there were still arrangements underway to change the administrative structure in order to erase the last remnants of da Motta Veiga's preparations. Assembling his staff from a pool of trusted and effective civil servants he knew, Caetano could at least start working on healing the ills of the Union. Not surprisingly the scandal had exacerbated many of the issues he would have needed to deal with anyway. Separatists took Franco's first appointment as another sign of Spanish oppression and incompetence, blaming the federal government for not being a truly representative body. Many Spanish, both in government and in the public sphere, however painted da Motta Veiga as a rogue Portuguese agent, a symbol of Portugal leeching off and abusing its position within the Union. Then there were the financial issues which had been incurred by the scandal; the sheer amount of administrative work to first establish the losses and their consequences and then to begin to remedy them was a mountain which seemingly grew exponentially. Yet the reformer had not entirely lost his spirit. No matter how dire the situation may seem with an effective work ethic and constructive solutions anything was possible. And so, he ended the terrible day with the hint of a smile, he was now part of the solution that would transform the Union into a better place."
 IBR.5196.a:0 "A step in the right direction?"

 IBR.5197.t:0 "Touring Iberia"
 IBR.5197.d:0 "Population centers all over the half peninsula were surprised by the unannounced visits of the new Portuguese Caudillo Caetano as he was making his way around his realm. Only briefly notifying his Spanish counterpart Caetano shortly after establishing the bureaucratic framework for his administration, he set out to tour Iberia. It was necessary to gain a more complete picture of average life and to assess the extent of the divisions were politically unstable for the nation.\n\nOne of the stops he made was in the border city of Badajoz, situated on the left bank of Guadiana river and extremely close to the unofficial Portuguese border. Caetano's motorcade drove through the city making a stop at the bullring, a site where according to regime dissidents the Spanish Nationalists had murdered 100s of Republicans. Choosing to only take a small security detail Caetona then made his way around the streets on foot. He was recognized very quickly, and crowds began to form, following his walk and cheering him. Once he was at the town hall, he requested for a desk to brought out which he sat behind. Motioning for the onlookers to come forward he instructed his security detail to pick out a number of individuals to line up in front of his new desk. He then began to question them in a friendly manner, taking the time to get to know each of the ones picked. Listening to their concerns he made a few notes and asked for their personal opinions on the regime. As none would answer openly he again wrote down a few notes and then made his way back to the bullring.\n\nNewspapers around the country began to follow his journey, documenting each visit and guessing where he would turn up next. Dubbing the event 'Caetano's grand tour' it quickly went down into Iberian conscience."
 IBR.5197.a:0 "A commendable effort."
 
 
 IBR.5198.t:0 "For the Good of The Union"
 IBR.5198.d:0 "It almost felt like continuity. That was the beauty of effective reform. In the critical eye of the public Caudillo Caetano had already taken great efforts to ease his transition into power without hitches. His numerous visits and attempts to understand the mood and problems of localities around the Union had given him impetus to carry forth his ideas and display them proudly to the various councils and to his Spanish counterpart. It was not his will he was representing but that of the Iberian people. Not only had he effectively positioned himself in his new role, so the general populace supported him, but he also had managed his staff and administration well. This had given him the support of many in the civil service.\n\nHe now stood at the pinnacle, admired by many and without the ruinous taint of scandal. Caetano was positioned to be a unifying, stabilising figure in Iberian politics. His reluctance to immerse himself in the cheap power politicking that Salazar and Franco had been engaged in was refreshing to those in higher office. Seeing a change from trying to gain relative gains over one another to working for the absolute gain of the Union made Caetano one of the first true Iberians. Not a Portuguese nationalist but a product of the ongoing integration between two historic nations. Under his rule the future began to look a little brighter."

 IBR.5199.d:0 "The report in front of him was brutal, its official emotionless tone managed to cut as deeply as the most realistic prose. The dictators blood began to boil with anger as each word further compounded the disgusting treason the report was spelling out. It painted a stark image of a vengeful chaos that had engulfed a city. A small glimpse at what the union could soon look like if the crisis was not handled effectively.\n\nFranco's message to the nation had been received by many in Portugal as an address to the Spanish people, not to the united Iberia. In protest they had held civil rallies which had just invited the Caudillo's harbingers of order. Retaliation was the only order they managed to establish. Lisbon rose in a violent uproar. The previously civil marches now turned violent as police and security forces began to be driven from key parts of the city. Like other revolts it even inspired many of those who were ordered to quell it to join it. Public services and other semblances of normal life had been abandoned in favor of opposing Madrid.\n\nThis delicate political climate required conformity, it was not simple to craft a state out of the fresh corpse of another. Of course, the sheep would not understand. In situations such as these a strong guiding hand was required to guide them back to their pens, to bliss and safety. The Caudillo was the right man for the job. In his eyes at least."

Discussions in the advisory council were bleak as two camps had clearly formed.\n\nThe moderates, arguing to be more in touch with the plight of the Portuguese people, recognized the need to restore order and set an example for the rest of Portugal but also not inciting more revolts by establishing martial law and sending in more men. The hardliners on the other side set forth a clear plan of action, almost like a military campaign, in order to not let the revolt turn into revolution. Both sides debated heavily while Franco listened, every now and again shushing one speaker to hear an argument particularly in line with this own thinking. His considerations lasted long, not even being revealed in the space of the meeting. He initially had the plan to converge on Lisbon with the full might of the state behind him, but deeper thinking was required to not be too rash in the decision making. Finally, he had come to a conclusion."

His eyes widened as he saw a menacing column of armoured cars and crowd control vehicles rushing towards the main road, not slowing until people began to scream and back away. As the cars began to disperse the equally armoured Guardia Civil troopers the long line of protestors halted and moved further away. Orders were being barked as the soldiers began to surge forward. Again, people began to scream, this time the whole march was affected. The crowds began to disperse quickly in all directions as the troopers hunted down those defiantly staying or unfortunate enough to be stuck in the middle of the tumult. Within a few hours the guards had established a semblance of control over the city, quickly taking control of vital buildings such as local administration buildings and communication centers. The revolt had effectively been squashed, this time without the iron hand of violence being necessary."

Yet, despite the initial surprise caused as the soldiers swept into the crowd in full riot gear, they would not disperse. Rather than making room for the Guardia Civil troopers protestors began to throw rocks and bottles, hurling abuse and slogans all the while. As the soldiers barked orders the crowd even surged forward, closing the distance and attempting to disarm them. The situation continued to deteriorate as shots rang out. No one had been harmed yet it had the same effect as if the protestors had lost a number of their own. The shouting and violence worsened, forcing the now embattled soldiers to retreat back to their armored vehicles. Cheering the retreat of their oppressors the protestors began to continue their march only to soon be assaulted by even more riot police, this time far greater in number and with crowd dispersal tools.

Yet that order was hated, now no longer associated with true representation but oppression. As the riot police arrived onto a square which the march was passing through, events quickly began to take a bloody turn. Protestors surged forward with makeshift weapons, trying to mob the surprised security forces and seal off their route of escape. They had however not expected the guards to have real weapons with live ammunitions. The first few shots rang out managing somehow to even surpass the din created by the discord. Dazed for a few seconds the protestors stopped in their bloodthirsty vigour, standing almost entirely still until the first screams rang out. Then the next shots plastered the human mass forcing a frenzied stampede in all directions. The riot police switching back to non-lethal weaponry drove the last few demonstrators out of the square only to find that a good number of them had been killed in the commotion.

His training had been brutal and fear inducing but to now be in the position to translate that into a real-life experience terrified him far more. Finally, his armoured car stopped, and the sergeant barked the order for all to rally out. After a long, silent ride with tinted glass windows the sun blinded the young recruit for a short while while the incredible noise of the demonstrators halted him in his tracks. Then, however the adrenaline pushed him forward to stand alongside his comrades, facing off against a wall of seething flesh. He could see the anger visible in their wide-eyed glares and was glad that his face was hidden behind a mask. Suddenly the mass rushed forward. In a panicked flurry he drew his gun. Time froze. The mass abruptly became irrelevant as his entire focus was now on the young woman before him who he was aiming at. No older than he was himself she however stood defiant, inching forwards until her forehead rested against the cold steel. With a start she threw her hands up in an attempt to grab the gun, yet the recruit was quicker. The shot was startlingly loud and the young security man drew in a sharp breath. Time began to move again but now too quickly. All around him his fellow Guardia Civil companions began to shoot too, peppering the now utterly frenzied demonstrators. Yet the recruit could not fire again. His gaze never left the lifeless form before him. Taking no notice of the carnage around him he knelt down and took of his helmet. Putting his gun to the side of his head he whispered a silent apology.\n\nThe massacre in Lisbon was legendary. Once the crowds had broken out into savage rioting, orders to fire at will had been given. This bloody day for Portugal is likely to hold deep political charge for a long time to come."

The conviction with which they had started their demonstrations against Spanish centralization within the Union structure slowly evaporated day by day with the constant harassment.\n\nOne side had to break eventually and as it was the Guardia Civil's duty to make sure that it would not be them the result was that protests finally weakened.

This has resulted in conflicting messages for the forces on the ground who now cannot truly trust those above or effectively deal with those below. A senior officer has in this confusion written a memorandum asking for clear measures to be put in place to put the protestors in their place. In his eyes by allowing the protests to continue any further the state is running into the danger of the shouts for representation changing into ones calling for emancipation and freedom.

Important speakers and those who were vital in rallying more people to the cause seemed to be missing. In the vacuum a number of other protestors took to the limelight, attempting to rally the demoralised marchers back to the cause.

It has even become clear to foreign observers that the regime in Madrid has become incapable of dealing with the Lisbon uprising. Some of them, those who view the new government with distaste, are even claiming that the protests are gathering such strength that soon the world could see the rebirth of the Portuguese nation from the carcass of Iberia.\n\nHaving to focus on balancing the fine scale of maintaining good foreign relations and quelling domestic unrest has indeed allowed the protests to grow to an unprecedented scale.

This has translated into a number of members of the political class also passively resisting the newly instituted transition of power.

Given the timing, many expect the Spanish dictator to only really approach one topic of discussion. Many are however unsure as to what his decision ultimately will be.

The rest of the hall was silent in shock and contemplation. Some even openly looked disgusted.\n\nA list of the likely candidates to rebel had already been conjured up prior to the members leaving the hall. Security forces around the Union were ready to move in once the targets seemed likely to revolt. Only a few hours after all the officials had left, did the first begin to show signs of abandoning the regime. However, as the officers moved in, more and more dispatches were sent from headquarters. It seems a larger than expected number had decided to resign their post and publicly declare their condemnation of the new government. Once the wave started it did not stop. Politician after politician took to the press and podiums, forcing the crisis-laden state apparatus into near exhaustion. The fallout of this could not be effectively contained. It was clear from the outset that many officials, especially the Portuguese ones, had favored the more collected and dignified Salazar. Yet this crowd now merged with politicians from all over the Union who called for a representative Union or none at all. Seemingly Salazar's ghost could not stop haunting the Spanish Caudillo.

It clearly had been abandoned by its flock. The dictator struggled to get his attention back to the papers before him on his desk.\n\nResignation after resignation. A majority of the council had decided that this would be the point to make their principled stand. They were nothing but spineless cowards still in the pocket of a dead man who now couldn't even give them favors or patronage anymore. He had expected that a few would follow their revered master but not this many. This rump council would take weeks to replenish with men who were both loyal and of the same technocratic stature as their predecessors. More work to add to an ever growing list.\n\nFranco turned again to the bird. How he longed to be as free in his now seeming solitary existence. Instead each ally that betrayed him now added a new weight to the shackles he had hoped would be removed with Salazar's demise."

Loyalty to a regime which had managed to stand against the recent tides of history? Certainly, some of the politicians had to have enough pragmatic bones in their body to recognize the futility of questioning the legitimacy of the Iberian regime. The fear provoked by the looming threat of the state apparatus? The officials certainly should be most aware of the power it could exercise. Promises of patronage and favor in exchange for unquestioning obedience? Officials did make the greatest lackeys.\n\nThe reasons did not matter, what did were the results. Only the most extreme Salazar loyalists refused to conform to the new reality and treasonously resigned. Their actions and fates would remain unbeknownst to the public and most of their colleagues. The majority of Iberian politicians have decided to remain loyal following Franco's reform of the Iberian regime. They could bring much needed immediate legitimacy and strength to resolve tensions with certain identity groups of the wider populace. Whether the current obedience would remain true longer than the foreseeable future was yet to be ascertained."

Not only had the Portuguese officials decided to follow their recently deceased figurehead's constant desire to impede progress, but now also many Spaniards had thrown in their lots with them.\n\nFollowing the rejection, Franco's office door seemingly was not shut for a few days. The Caudillo desperately tried to convince leaders of cliques and interest groups to disavow their previous declaration. To many, the lack of success appeared to drive Franco insane. Once the last name on his list had also sworn to never cooperate again unless Franco allowed the old balance to be restored, he realized that he should have been harsher with these traitors. Salazar had poisoned their mind with his ceaseless obstructions holding back Iberian greatness. Even beyond the grave his dirty fingers could not help but meddle in state affairs.

He could not trust many of his underlings to undertake such important meetings on his behalf, continuing to push himself as he knew the end result would give him what he so desperately desired.\n\nA clique he thought he had placated with promises of patronage and other concessions now again rallied against him. Officials and politicians within the rotting carcass of the previously representative Union government were calling for even further compromises to be made in order to limit Franco's power. He had believed that these opportunists would resign themselves to the flow of events once they recognized which way the winds were blowing. The Caudillo was astoundingly mistaken.

Little did they know that this was one of the few designated private spaces for politicians and officials of the Iberian government to meet and discuss ideas away from prying ears. Despite the wonderful weather all of the outside tables had been folded up and the heavy curtains had been drawn. Inside three stone-faced men sat and smoked in silence.\n\nThe Portuguese of the group stubbed out his cigarette and broke the tranquil peace. 'You know this is just a ploy for him to silence our opposition?'\n\n'Obviously. That doesn't mean we shouldn't accept the generous offering of the Caudillo. The man still has the power to make us disappear if we don't cooperate,' his bellicose Spanish counterpart shot back.\n\n'He is pushing the Union into ruin, the masses of Portugal will not follow him willingly and I suspect even if we concede many of our colleagues will continue resisting,' came the cynical retort.\n\nThe last member of the group raised his hands slowly to calm his two friends. 'You sadly are both right. And this is exactly why we cannot risk action right now. If the masses were to lose their potential leaders before the spark could be properly ignited, then Franco would win. We cannot allow this.' His companions considered this shortly but then began to nod in agreement. 'Good. Let us see how much we can draw out of the old man. Our acceptance will ingratiate us further with him also.

Was he too old to carry on his mission alone? Was the world changing quicker than he could follow?\n\nThe questions continued to plague him as he absently minded started to chew on his finger nails. This should have been his hour of glory; the Iberian people should have united behind their hero of unification against the outside threats and internal terrorists. Instead he faced a horrible mix of resistance and selfish toadyism wherever he looked. He however knew he could not resign from the task now; history did not favor those who lost nerve at the precipice. Steeling himself up, he stopped chewing on his now miniscule fingernails.

 IBR.5217.d:0 "Once there was a Union of peoples, united by sentiment and shared values. Driven together by necessity and external forces. Strong through stability and harmonious cooperation. That's what Iberians have told themselves and attempted to believe. It seems their faith was not strong enough.\n\nHistory is an anthology of different stories which humanity has told itself to live and work together. Some in this pursuit alienated others to ensure greater cooperation between initial participants. One of these particular stories is that of nationalism. Now this story was in the process of tearing another apart. The Iberian Union, fundamentally flawed since its conception through the contradiction of its insistence upon equal representation, now stood ready to collapse by political and ethnic tensions. The suppression of minority groups throughout the peninsula by the use of state bureaucracy and force has given rise to an ugly hatred of the political structure in place.\n\nMore severely for the health of the Union however was the gambit played following Salazar's death, by an opportunistic Franco to centralise power upon his own person and hence Spain. Many parts of Portugal had in reaction seen economic standstill, and in some cases open rebellion with Lisbon still in flames. The whole region being in lockdown only further catalyzes the fervor of those who believed more in one story than another. Belief, such a strong tool for the betterment of a society, now stood for the unfortunate disintegration of a union of people."

 IBR.5218.d:0 "The realization hurt deeply. What seemed an opportunity too golden to be forgone, now had developed into a crisis quickly spinning out of control. Caudillo Franco had seen his Portuguese counterpart's death as the chance to finally shape the Union to his will and bring it out of the crippling instability that constant debate and vetoes had brought. Believing that his people would welcome the idea was a given. After all it promised progress under the steady direction of a man who had led the Spanish nation out of tremendous turmoil.\n\nHad he been naïve? Of course, Salazar still had many of the Portuguese in his pocket, able to make them dance to his tune from beyond the grave. Neither should it have been surprising that the useless politicians and officials that lined the vast bureaucracy of Iberia would fear for their positions and promptly oppose him. Rather than being localised, the crisis laid bare nationwide opposition and highlighted structural issues which years of political squabbling had not effectively remedied.\n\nFranco knew he now had to swallow his pride or commit political suicide. Before him lay the options for the replacement of Salazar. Only one would now be able to sate the feverous opposition to the regime of Madrid with his calming and reformist politicking. Caetano shall be the next Portuguese Caudillo."

If we were to just plant it down and expect everyone to accept it, then we will create significant unrest.\n\nThe reception of the law will be all propaganda. How we spin the law will have a drastic effect on how it goes with the populace. It is a matter of national security, of course, but against whom? There are two groups who may pose an obvious threat to Iberia - the backroom plotters, seeking to conspire their way to collapse, and the thugs on the streets, trying to intimidate good citizens.

They contend that the deportations are very effective in removing traitorous elements, but that enough are not deported to render the benefit moot. Any enemy left, for example, is a possible terrorist. Leaving them in an accessible prison is just asking for a breakout - and then there would be two in the bush, instead of one overseas.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that many overseas prisons are already at capacity with dissidents.

Along the way, he hears some stories - a misspoken word, participating in a march, genuine terrorism without the proof (but they'd never mention it by a guard). Then they were escorted off to their new cell, where the cold meets its old friend.\n\nAll over Iberia, similar circumstances occur. Men and women are arrested for whatever offense, then only held for a few days before being deported overseas. They are effectively nonpersons, disappeared from everyday life.

Even though keeping so many prisoners of such a type close together is dangerous, the extended guard presence has deterred any resistance.

They had been filled past capacity and didn't get a moment's extra notice for it!\n\nThe prisoners noticed this too. Every day, the ratio of guard to guarded grew larger, far beyond safe levels. As the number increased, so did the unrest. As incidents increased, punishments became increasingly severe for increasingly minor offenses, as a small few tried to cow their numerical superior. No matter how much they asked for aid, none was able to be provided.

Their frenzy wasn't enough to stop the prisoners, armed with stolen weapons and numbers to beat the guards by a large amount. While some put up a fight, it was only a handful of hours before Tarrafal was in the hands of its former prisoners.\n\nIt appears most guards are dead, having been slaughtered. Those few that remain have been taken hostage, as the terrorists attempt to bargain their life for another.

What they saw was long and bloody, oftentimes bloody enough to give the floor and walls a new coat of paint. Many prisoners were holed up, and the process to get them out was incredibly destructive.\n\nBy the time the prison was Iberian once more, Tarrafal hardly resembled somewhere people would live, let alone a containment area. Combined with the prisoners who surrendered, a hasty provisional prison had to be established.\n\nEven though this was an embarrassing sight, the worst to be caught by the media team was one last prisoner, who had managed to catch a squad by surprise. Screaming one last cry, he killed several men before he could be brought down himself. It is already obvious this man will become a martyr."

From here it is a propaganda battle between Iberia and the separatists, a competition to mobilize the populace in their favor.\n\nSo far, the separatists are winning.\n\nLarge numbers of citizens around Iberia, particularly in minority regions, have been mobilized by dishonest publications and pushed to take to the streets. They have been infiltrated by terrorist agitators, which are constantly pushing anti-government messages. It will turn into a riot if it continues on much longer."

It would take a strong effort from the Guardia Civil to stop the rioting advance. On the other side of the city street...\n\nThere was nothing resembling a strong response. They had shields, sure, and they were organized, certainly, but the Guardia had nothing else going for them. Greatly underfunded, they did not have the means to acquire the necessary equipment. No matter how hard their fighting spirit, they simply did not have the means to defeat the protestors. What was a riot soon became a battlefield, and what was a battlefield soon became a rout, as the Guardia realized they couldn't keep up the fight.\n\nThis did not only happen in one isolated street in a city. All over Iberia, the Guardia Civil lost battles with the rioters, as the situation grew large enough to become totally uncontrollable. The public faith in the Caudillos has been deeply shaken by their inability to maintain peace and order, and with how bold separatists are growing this is only the beginning of our troubles."

Of course, this was before they were more than doubled by the military bearing down on them. When the tank crew defected in exchange for a lighter punishment, the rest didn't take very long to go with them. Lines of arrested traitors were paraded through the city by their loyalist counterparts, using every scene as a show of strength for the media. It truly was an impressive scene to behold.\n\nMeanwhile, those within the Cortes were much more resilient than their outside defectors. Perhaps it was a revolutionary zeal, or maybe just the confidence that the Cortes provided them. They stood, with every prod towards them declaring that they would not fold except with the acceptance of their demands. It could have been that they expected this, or more likely they had raided the stored provisions the building held. The revolutionaries waited for several days, refusing to be smoked out. More persuasive means couldn't be utilized, since killing the councilmen was a risk - and it would be a disaster if it happened.\n\nAs the situation stagnated, the environment grew more uneasy. What would this do to Iberia, everyone wondered? Could this be a death blow, or a sign of horrors to come? It seems this concern pierced up to even the Caudillos themselves, for the men surrounding the Cortes were given a simple order, to be carried out how they pleased. Straight from Franco and Caetano themselves, it was said."

 IBR.5319.d:0 "Isto remata hoxe - this ends today. It was a very simple order on the surface. The mutineers needed gone, and the Cortes needed to be freed today. The only weapons left that would for sure end the siege were the big guns. Very destructive things, sure to cause collateral; but collateral damage was excusable for the sake of sticking to orders.\n\nThe soldiers went in no holds barred, yet they found their opponent ready for them. Fighting on to the last man, the Cortes was totalled after the last mutineer was pronounced dead. It took several hours to tally up casualties, and worst of all was that many councilmen had been found on the list of dead. Too many. Their bodies could be hidden, but with time their deaths could not be.\n\nThe hamfisted attempt at salvaging the situation had only made it worse, with the damage to the Cortes a monument to resistance, emboldening the separatists with the hope that their struggle was not in vain. They struck at who was not slain in the siege, and without their loyal middlemen the Caudillos had next to no influence, nor the information needed to stop what was about to happen. Their control had faded, and Iberia was quickly beginning to slip the leash."

 IBR.5320.d:0 "Despite our efforts to bring Christian spirit back to Iberia, the attempts to establish further zeal have failed. Or, more appropriately, it has worked too well. We have managed to play up faith to such an extent that many religious groups have taken us totally to our word. Of course, while this is normally not a bad thing, it is a very good idea to back up the rhetoric with some token concessions. We have neglected to do this.\n\nMultiple religious groups across Iberia have criticized the government for hypocrisy, such as how we have neglected a faithful education, even though we have emphasized faith in Iberia. This has brought the more religious sects of the population towards a critical angle of the Union, and it will take some time to repair the sentiment."

Because they are the future, the youth of Iberia are effectively an investment. Like all investments, we have the capability to make a great profit off of placing resources into them. The primary way to do this is their education.\n\nIf we take the initiative to give our students political education, we can effectively control the way they see the world - lasting or otherwise, the legacy will leave a deep mark. Of course, we should still aim for an effective control of their education. We could push the youth into organizing in politics, mobilizing their support to help Iberia.

They were flanked by cavalry, who ambled alongside the marching troops. Madrid's streets were very busy all day, even through midday, as crowds watched and journalists sought to record the scene and take plenty of photos.\n\nAfter everything was said and done, it seems that the parade has left an impression on many. The population, already riled up, was pushed into patriotic fervor, and the entire event seems to have become a very positive memory.

On televisions all across Iberia, the parade is broadcast live as the military showcases its might. Not harming this, of course, were the news reporters - they had found a particularly flattering angle, and enhanced the parade beyond regular levels using their PR trickery. Not a single thing went wrong all parade.\n\nOf course, the separatists are not terrified by this display, but it has definitely knocked some sense into them. By reminding them of what they are up against, they will think twice before trying to challenge it. The public itself is greatly impressed. It will be some time before people stop speaking of how impressive the parade was."

If an event would cordon off so much and use so many resources, it was fair to imagine that they were using them all effectively. Of course, it was also fair to reason that quantity was being used to offset quality. The only way to tell for sure was to see the event itself.\n\nAs the soldiers marched down the streets of Madrid to the scrutiny of regular people and journalists, the latter proved true. Despite the flashy ceremonial intent, the execution proved less-than-ideal. The lacklustre performance seems to have encouraged separatists, and they have started to use the poor use of resources by the military as a piece of their rhetoric."

The way we will do that is by reinforcing state media broadcasts, as to ensure our information is the only out there. Our message is the most important part, as we must direct our media outlets in order to actually affect anything. There are two options:\n\nWe may direct our attention towards mobilizing public attention, to inspire them to act in ways beneficial to Iberia. Were we to make use of public mobilization, it would likely come in handy when attempting to garner public opinion regarding public events. Alternatively, we could make use of subtle propaganda. By nudging perceptions slightly here, and doing so again there, we could slowly turn public support away from concepts we do not support. As well, there is also a third option. Since the media workers are for the most part differing in their specialties, it stands to reason that both could be done at once with the proper resources. What will it be?"

It is an ambitious proposal, for sure, but if it is done right we may be able to potentially take the best of both worlds. Our propagandists are unsure of something, however. They are unsure of how best to execute two campaigns at once, and since we are the ones to suggest it, they also want to know how we expect them to operate. We could combine the two, mixing subtle imagery with inspiring tactics to create a system that could rile up the public without them even knowing it.

Worse than that, some parts of the population have latched onto the failed experiment, wanting it and much more from the government. They demand democratic institutions, unaware of what discord they would sow in the Union. Separatists have joined with them, using their underground networks to attempt to amplify the message of the foolish.\n\nIn order to save Iberia from itself, we need to convince the people that these ideals are misguided and wrong. The unclear part of the solution is how. It would be most obvious to launch a grand national campaign, garnering the support of the people and turning it against liberal forces. We need to be careful - if we were to allow such a movement to proceed on totally unhindered it would quickly turn on us. This is why an alternate solution is on the table: It is possible to try a covert approach, infiltrating rebellious media and using it to broadcast propaganda. Either way could work, it is only a matter of choice which could synergize better with our current strategies."

Franco stared on, locking his gaze to the camera directly in front of him. He leaned in once again, speaking into the microphones more.\n\n"I do not expect you to know the intricacies of politics, and you ought to be unconcerned with them- the Iberian nation requires all hands to be focused on their role, and you ought to do your part. I beg you, fair citizens of Iberia, to allow us to do what we must! We are going to save this country, and with you all, we will make sure it is never torn apart again!"\n\nThis was not the only speech held across Iberia, and Caetano was sure to do his part, too.

 IBR.5331.d:0 "On, and on, and on, continued the campaigns. It was constant, in the form of radio programs, television PSAs, posters, speeches, and even more tactics besides. It was all designed specifically to rile Iberians up. Only together could they achieve victory, said the rhetoric, and many seemed to take the propaganda well. For every piece of material, it seems that even more people were inspired enough to take to the streets.\n\nIn every major city in Iberia, crowds of people have taken to the streets, in grand public demonstrations of support for their Caudillos. They are standing up to democracy, so they say, and countless citizens attend rallies to show their dedication. Very little police action has been necessary - in fact, more law enforcement have been forced to quell overzealous supporters than public dissidents.\n\nAll this, however, is mostly among adults."

It only grew more intense, but no matter what, the campaign seemed to do nothing. Perhaps it was in how it was delivered, maybe the planning, but no matter what it seemed to utterly fail at truly riling up the public.\n\nNobody seems to be taking to the streets in defense of the Caudillos, roads are usually unoccupied by anyone but those in transit, and rallies rarely attract anyone but their usual crowd.

The children and teenagers apply for youth organizations, standing proud and happy at the idea of their energy being expended on proper life skills, and discipline, rather than some rebellion that will get them nowhere in the long term. University students and others of their age come to rallies and separate themselves from their adult counterparts.

Children and teenagers avoid their appropriate youth groups, banding together to show their rebellious spirit was not correctly tamed. Even worse, students in universities have mostly turned against the Union. Acting with hostility to law enforcement, they have found that hiding in shells of hatred was not enough. They have taken to the streets, showing up to rallies to counterprotest. The students try to yell louder than our supporters, seeking to drown out any show of support they can. The Guardia Civil cannot stop them as easily, as both sides are aware of what firing on young adults would look like.

There are several media sources across Iberia - regionalist, separatist, and otherwise treasonous in attitude - that these would-be rebels get their information from. They refuse to get their news anywhere else, so we cannot reach them regularly. Therefore, we will need to get onto the dissident networks. This is the plan - we will infiltrate the worst offenders and slowly shift their perspective on the Caudillos, under the pretense of fairness.\n\nIn slowly changing the information given, we will deprive the worst rebels of evidence in their arguments and change the minds of the more malleable. The people will love us, or they will hate us without reason."

Posters are cleaner on average, with vandalized contents reaching an all-time low. In public, those identified as potentially troublesome have appeared more genuine in their praises - it no longer seems coerced. Undercover operatives have corroborated with similar reports. In more private settings, where open opinions tend to flourish, the worst examples of rebellious thought seem to have cooled considerably, with arguments frequently muddying the waters.\n\nThe Caudillos are starting to be seen in a more understanding light by even their dissidents, at least the reasonable ones,and these people have become less inclined to disagree. This success has only been reported on middle- and older-aged adults. How it will come off to the younger sections of Iberian society is yet to be determined."

Designed to rile up those who watched it, the emotion elicited would then be redirected into support for the regime. Unfortunately, nothing has gone to plan beyond that.\n\nInformants have reported that the "special dispatches" used to rile up emotion have been perceived as ridiculous, taken as satire or as humor by most dissidents who watched it. Lacking in subtlety, the propagandized reports have failed to shift opinion. It is unlikely we will get another chance at this, and we have failed to garner more support."

They do not have much in the way of definitive proof, however the ways in which younger citizens express discontent - such as vandalism and seditious humor - are reported to have declined. More concrete, probable dissident organizations are reported to have plateaued or even declined in membership. The youth have gotten tired of their treason, likely thanks to our influence.\n\nAll together, the conclusion is that our subtlety has paid off. Because of our effort to specially tailor the message to the youth, the younger Iberians have taken the bait perfectly. Our regime has grown to their liking, with nothing but a coat of paint to bring them along that way."

Waiting for further reports would show the desired trend. Normally this would be so, if somebody had fabricated reports or things had worked as desired. As the results filtered in, and nothing seemed to change, it finally became obvious that something wasn't working. Once the clerks had stopped looking for success, they instead began to look for answers.\n\nAfter much research, they found, without surprise, that the younger segments of the population weren't very interested in our influence. This didn't solve why, to the displeasure of the Caudillos. Facing some proper consequences for failure, the informants have discovered that our influence wasn't popular with the young because it wasn't compatible. "

There is prosperity and happiness, and morality to keep it all in place." Franco pauses. Some scarce applause comes from the crowd, until people realize the speech isn't concluded. Once it dies down, Franco looks at his fellow Caudillo. Caetano glances around, before speaking himself.\n\n"It has come to our attention that some- traitors have sought to destroy Iberia. A democratic deep state, dedicated to instituting mob rule. From that mob rule, they will create bolshevism. They think that they can simply destroy Iberia, but that is not so!

 IBR.5341.d:0 "Following our speech against the democratic elements of our government, there have been a number of incidents in the government. Several officials, some definitely rebellious, some unexpectedly so, have begun to make a scene by resigning. Normally this isn't an issue, as they can simply be acknowledged and then sent on their way to irrelevance. This will likely not happen this time. Usually, protesting officials take the form of lower clerks or bureaucrats, gears so caught in the machine that nothing happens from them leaving it.\n\nThe resigning cabal is significantly higher in rank than usual, which could give their protests much more credibility.

The man himself is formally dressed, with clothing that seems perfectly designed to simply melt into a crowd. The reporter does his best to hide the concern on his face as he brings the microphone back to his mouth.\n\n"Well, that... is something, yes. One last question: Do you have anything left to add?"\n\nThe official takes the microphone. "I, uh, think I do. Don't listen to Franco. He is, well, quite simply a snake. He'll stab you in the back and, uh, my message to anyone listening is to get him and the other one gone."\n\nThe interview concluded not long after the final statement, as one damning statement after another found their way across Iberia.

 IBR.5343.d:0 "In Madrid, protests were contained early by the overwhelming police presence. In several other cities, the government was not nearly as fortunate. Protests had sparked up, spurred on by the damning comments against the Caudillos, as thousands of people rural and urban alike had taken to the streets in order to defy the government. As the demonstrations were victim to attempted containment, they quickly devolved into plain riots.\n\nThe flash riots took several days to put down. More than that, during that several days democratic ideals had been planted into the populace. Not from any deliberate strategy, but in opposing the government they had come to support what it detested most - democracy. There are now many calls for further freedom, the protection of whistleblowers, and many other liberties that were only conveniences before, but were now mandatory.\n\nThe odds are significant that now, with a populace more conscious of politics than ever before, solidifying our control will be nigh-impossible. Any moves to remove dissidents will be met with outrage, for it seems that most people are more in favor of no Iberia than not getting their way."

They placed him in handcuffs and walked him out of the office, as his coworkers watched on with stupefied amazement.\n\nSeveral others were walked out with similar stories - picked up by uniformed men, charges read to them, and then walked to some form of transit, from which they were driven off to somewhere unknown. This wasn't the only place this had happened, either. Countless individuals were removed and imprisoned in what had quickly become, for them and the ones who had signed the warrants, a purge."

Several major officials - and many lesser - are detained and walked to a vehicle, surrounded by camera men and reporters from several different news networks.\n\nThankfully, no reporter ever got in earshot of a rebel, and any dissenting opinions were talked over by guides.

Forced to defend himself, against fabricated but numerous evidence, he was stuck in a losing case. Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence was the testimony of his coworker, who was able to corroborate many of the bureaucrat's conspiracies.\n\n"I do not know-"\n\n"Do not lie to the court!" snapped the judge."We have documents in our possession proving that he was an accomplice in all of your crimes!"\n\n"I sentence you, Enrique Velasquez, to spend the rest of your life in prison in order to atone for your mistakes."\n\nSuffice to say, Enrique would not be without company."

Firstly, we would like to apologize for the way we were forced to carry it out. However, you, the people, must understand that these steps, while harsh, were necessary to save the Union..." It was perhaps one of the longest and most winding speeches yet, both Caudillos speaking the same words - as Franco was broadcast to Portugal, and Caetano was broadcast to Spain.\n\n"...Finally these matters have been dealt with, and the security of Iberia is nearly assured. All it takes is one last thing: You, the people, the brave citizens. You must help us walk to the future, and with your help we may enter an era of prosperity." At the rallies themselves, applause.

If you allow elections to let your regime's policy goals flip-flop all over the place, then you'll never get anything done but secure twenty more years of bickering. Without strong central figures, nothing could ever get done. With these men to assert their visions, a country will know what to expect. A stable, unchanging, uncompromising, vision.\n\nAnd that is exactly what Iberia has! Under the firm hand of the Caudillos, Iberia will be able to pursue a consistent policy. The twin rulers of the Union have cemented their positions in charge, and so will now be able to lead Iberia on to their other goals. Nobody may dispute their directives now, and that is the way all effective governments should be."

This, is one of those issues."\n\n"These people are the sort to demand one concession after another, then have the gall to attempt to separate from the Union, as if this is some charade they can just opt out of!

Of course, not everyone in the Union felt the same, but those who truly cared were in the minority. No major events occurred, and the streets of the country's cities remained the same - only men and women going about their day.\n\nIt seems that, following the successes of Tarrafal, dissidents are afraid to protest, fearing their own incarceration.

 IBR.5353.d:0 "Nearly as soon as Franco had concluded his speech, Iberia had found itself in yet another uproar. Crowds of angry nationalists took to the streets, encouraged by their coverage from an ever-fickle media. Attendance surged far beyond what was expected, as a day-long riot evolved into a multiple day affair.\n\nMotivated by the overseas debacle, "Remember Tarrafal" became a rallying cry, a phrase upon which the rioters based themselves upon. Despite having the arms of a crowd of people taking to the streets, they also had a fight on their minds, and they easily found that fight against the Guardia Civil. The riot was not fully contained until several days after, and by the time the last head was given a taste of baton the damage had been done - several minority cities had been victim to rioting, looting, and a whole host of other nasty consequences."

Their attendance numbers, however, were hindered by the media, who were collectively wise enough to suppress the demonstrations well enough to stop them from gathering anyone from non-urban areas.\n\nThey were by all counts rowdy, perhaps even wild for crowds their size, but it was no matter, for the Guardia Civil has dealt with worse. The protests have drawn out many who would otherwise oppose the Caudillos, and arresting them for such a relatively harmless crime will nip more serious offenses in the bud."

Without their aid, we would be nearly blind to the actions occurring in areas such as Catalonia. This by itself, however, is not their only use. These collaborators also form the backbone of our bureaucracy, not only supplying the state with information but processing it too. We should, of course, reward these men and women for their deeds in service of Iberia, but an issue of more uncertainty is the method we will go about making use of our collaborators.\n\nThese people have worked with the state for many years, and as traitors have long since been weeded out we will never have to doubt their loyalty. There is an issue, however - these people are mostly despised by the natives of their regions, and might have grown complacent in their positions. We could use a potential solution to this by recruiting new collaborators, whose fresh blood could transform their regions into something more productive. Of course, as with any new recruits their loyalty would be uncertain.\n\nWho are we going to work with?"

While this would guarantee loyalty, it may not provide us enough manpower to keep things functioning. Therefore, we could let more than just the most trusted individuals participate in higher echelons. While they could get more done, we would need to be more careful of their influence in the government, and what consequences could occur. How are we going to go about this?"

Regional autonomy has to go, as for maximum effectiveness we must subjugate all of the peninsula to the will of the central government. Only total control will suffice, for anything less would allow them to slip the net. There is a hitch - not everyone in Iberia realizes this, and separatist terrorists would stop at nothing to turn this entire turn of events to their advantage through trickery and deception. Our objective is to make up for that.\n\nWe could play the political game, and use our agents to cut out slack in the regional bureaucracy. This way, we could prepare it for anything thrown at it, offsetting any terrorist gains with gains of our own. However, we could also use our collaborators to challenge the gains themselves, using propaganda to convince the populace that what we are doing is totally beneficial.\n\nThere's only the time for one, so we have to make a choice."

Our collaborators are masters at the political game, and assigning them to fix the bureaucracy was a wonderful idea. Knowing how to navigate the cutthroat political scene has served them well, and using that experience they have sorted out many issues facing the regional administrations.\n\nThe system is much more efficient. While we didn't offset any potential terrorist gains, a large amount of time and effort that would have been spent wrangling with local politicians has been freed, allowing us to direct ourselves to more valuable efforts.

Ultimately the best way to progress is through experience, as nothing hones political ability like trial and error.\n\nOur new collaborators, fresh faces and new blood, lack any meaningful political ability. Against the cynical bureaucrats of the regional administration, these agents have been mangled by the political games and, between them, have frequently left humiliated or worse-off than when they began. As a result, the bureaucracy itself has suffered. Cliques have remained as they were, efficiency has not been increased, and even though this worked before we now strain under the weight of slack our system cannot afford to have."

If people don't trust an outlet, then they will take nothing of what it says as truth. However, we have had no such issues so far. Our new collaborators, new faces with believable stories, have been received far better than expected.\n\nThanks to their ability to really provoke a crowd, the new collaborators have seen stunning success in singing our praises. While some have noticed the cynical nature of the campaign, we are making headway towards shifting the perception of Iberia. It is truly remarkable how well the new recruits can bring regionalists to lower their torches, a feat which our old guard could never hope to replicate."

 IBR.5361.t:0 "Disappointing Propaganda Campaign"
 IBR.5361.d:0 "If you want propaganda to be of any use, you have to make sure the outlet is popular and trusted. This is most likely why the public didn't receive our campaign - they despise the sources of information as corrupt, useless, liars. It was more than likely a mistake to direct our collaborators to disperse propaganda.\n\nKnown thoroughly by the inhabitants of their given regions to be puppets, their hostility to the Union was directed towards the informants. Lacking credibility, their propaganda has failed to inspire nearly anyone who was not already supportive. We have gained nothing over the terrorists and have effectively just wasted our time."

 IBR.5362.d:0 "Finally, our objective is bearing fruit. The law to bring regional autonomy to an end, nicknamed the Regional Law, is having its specifics negotiated now. While some of the other provisions may vary, the most important - the total subservience of regional administrations - is guaranteed to be included. The voting itself is ultimately a formality, but it is sure to pass with a strong majority.\n\nWhile the voting itself is secured, the whole area is on heightened security during the procedure. Hopefully nothing will go wrong, but if it does it would be disastrous. Not only external, but we need to be on heightened alert for any internal dissidence."

We cannot stand by while the Union attempts to slaughter its constituent peoples..."\n\nA manifesto was released to the media, sent to the government, and leaked in several public areas. This manifesto, written by a cabal of officials who consider themselves "democratic", launches itself on a never-ending tirade about democratization and resistance - a pleasant fiction, but it is laughable to ever even believe such a thing would happen in Iberia.\n\nOf course such actions from officials is treason, but they have naively signed their names within the manifesto.

To the cameramen, they explain: these are traitors to Iberia, charged with attempting to sabotage its unity through treasonous media. They have already been sentenced to death.\n\nWhile this was certainly a good show of force, it fails to be anything else.

There's not much else to focus on other than him, contained in an empty room.\n\n"I was there when they drafted the new law, and as a representative I was able to add my say in. On my honor, this bill has been made with your best interests in mind- or at least, with due consideration to them."\n\nMany representatives are featured on separate broadcasts, with each region being treated to its native collaborators.

They readied to break riots, to be the rocks upon which threats to common decency were smashed against. Nearly every city in the country saw a similar build up...\n\nBut when the time came, nothing happened. There were a few protests, a few crowds of angry citizens that must have been less than a hundred each. Against forces prepared for many more, they were shattered. Nobody of note has objected, and with time it will all be but a memory to be forgotten. Not even Franco, who had hoped for a minimum of unrest, could have predicted how smoothly it proceeded.

When the Regional Law was being passed and broadcast over television and radio, the Guardia Civil swarmed the streets, hoping to preempt their opposition.\n\nThey did, to an extent. As predicted, many took to the streets - some rural, but most urban. It took several hours for the first riot to be snuffed, through the others carried on with such fierce separatism that the regional governments were pushed to the edge in dealing with them. The situation seems to have stabilized, thanks to the collaborators, who were able to stop the worst using their insight into their respective regions."

 IBR.5368.t:0 "Backlash Growing Out of Control"
 IBR.5368.d:0 "Everyone knew the Regional Law would near-definitely raise nothing short of hell on Earth in the minority regions. It was for this reason the Union was so generous with supplies - everything the regions asked for in order to shore up the Guardia Civil, no matter the request, was given to them in abundance. Even more of what they asked for was granted, and some of what they didn't, such as Guardia Civil from regions who had no threat of separatism. The collaborators, trusted as they were, were put to work figuring out how best to stop dissenters. After all, nobody knew the regions quite like the informants, whose insights could place the Union one step ahead of its detractors.\n\nPerhaps there was sabotage, or maybe there simply weren't enough informants to work on intelligence. No matter the cause, the local Guardia Civil was victim to a shocking revelation, as they prepared to move to stop regionalist dissidents; They didn't have what they needed to work effectively. Depending so greatly on a relatively small number of collaborators, there just wasn't enough insight to get ahead of protests. As such, the Guardia has been on the defensive ever since the protests started, which had now turned into riots. It will take a long time to get rid of their stain."
 IBR.5368.a:0 "Not good..."
 
 IBR.5369.t:0 "Low Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5369.d:0 "There remains one all-important matter beyond the in-the-moment rush of protests and riots: The lasting backlash. No matter how well you stamp a rally, it counts for nothing if you can't stop them after the fact. This is a very difficult affair, requiring the dedicated work of administration to keep ahead of the opposition - the only way to stop backlash and lasting opposition is to stop their growth before it can begin. Hence, the administrative importance of being able to outpace them.\n\nThankfully, it seems we have totally succeeded in that regard. Our administration is strong and nimble, with the lethal slack cut out before it was able to kill us. As well, we have enough skilled, trustworthy collaborators to keep it that way, as they all put their masterful abilities at the pointical game towards chasing out corruption and inefficiency. Any meaningful backlash has been snuffed out, but some has still slipped through the cracks."

 IBR.5370.t:0 "Sizable Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5370.d:0 "What matters much more than snuffing out protests is making sure they create no backlash. Here, the real art of silencing dissent shows herself. Containing a protest means nothing if it has left martyrs and an opposition willing to take up the cause the next chance they get. It takes a strong bureaucracy to handle the backlash - it is of critical importance they have the size and scale required to outpace the opposition, no matter how large is necessary, for it is a war of scale.\n\nThis war is one we appear to be losing. The bureaucracy is not large enough to keep up with what is demanded of it. The enemy is gaining pace, capable of sowing dissent and spreading its rebelliousness to previously uninvolved citizens. It is going to leave a legacy of opposition, which will take far longer than any single protest."
 IBR.5370.a:0 "I suppose it could be worse.."
 
 IBR.5371.t:0 "Great Opposition to Regional Law"
 IBR.5371.d:0 "If you cannot stop the following outrage, then there is no point to even trying to snuff out a protest. It is an art in its finest variants of execution, as backlash is snuffed out before it can even blossom, and martyrs are eliminated while any still spouting rebellion are silenced. There is a process - the bureaucracy must snuff out the backlash, in order for it to truly go away. To do this, the administrative capacity must be greater than what the dissidents can put out.\n\nIt is not. It is totally insufficient for the purpose we require it for. Dissident is growing nearly unchallenged, and with the way it is growing it will not matter how well we suppressed the initial reaction. We should not mention what has slipped through the cracks, but rather what has slipped through the holes. Our administration has totally failed us."

 IBR.5372.t:0 "Voting on Regional Law Bombed!"
 IBR.5372.d:0 "As the day carried on, the deputies assembled to vote on - and pass - the Regional Law that was going to take Iberia by storm. The Guardia Civil had been deployed en masse to the minority regions, as the Union was providing everything they needed in anticipation. With the new equipment came even more gear than requested, and officers from non-separatist regions - unquestionably loyal - to help use them. A storm had been prepared for in all places possible, including even the chamber of deputies. Three guards had been assigned to thoroughly search all non-representatives, so that nobody could sneak in a device designed to hurt the representatives during voting.\n\nThis made it all the more shocking when a bomb was detonated during voting. A remarkably high-yield explosive, as evidenced by the building being judged as "unsound enough to warrant an evacuation", though the chamber was not irreparably destroyed. Two of the three guards were killed, with the third remaining steadfast and performing the evacuation order.\n\nThis is an absolute disaster. Somehow a separatist organization has snuck in contraband, even through all of the security precautions. Though no councilmen were hurt, it is shocking that they still managed to sneak through the security precautions. More surprising, however, is that the perpetrator is still unknown - usually by now a group finds some way to claim responsibility for an attack, using it as a point of pride in their propaganda.\n\nNobody has taken responsibility."

He speaks of democracy, of how the country ought to be free. Once he has found himself enough support, he breaches the most sacrilegious topic yet: Independence. No country ought to exist under another that would eras-\n\nThe Guardia Civil arrived, swarming on the scene like angry hornets. Over a megaphone, an agent speaks of a crowd, and of how they ought to disperse before they are arrested, or worse. He was not nearly as effective at speaking, until the Guard brandished their weapons. Most had the sense to leave, while those that didn't found the agent's promises true.\n\nOf everyone we let in, many were terrorists. This is a total disaster - we let in far too many people, and we didn't have the capacity to totally vet them all. Some were separatists, and not all of them made gestures grand enough to get themselves arrested.

It seems as if everyone who was out to protest has lost their steam, with most returning home and those remaining easily subdued and detained. As the crowds left the streets, the Guardia Civil was far more capable of stopping separatist plots, slowly dragging the nation back from the brink. Only a short while ago, a well-placed plot could have destroyed the country. Now, we are back in a situation where it will take more than a scheme to obliterate Iberia."

Tear gas is being thrown back at the Guard, several groups are getting physical, using improvised weapons to attempt to compete with riot gear. Most worrying, however, is that the men sent in have been shot at, as rifles and pistols are being confirmed as being used against them.\n\nThe situation is primed to only get worse as time goes on, as separatist support seems to do nothing but grow.

While this would normally be an object of no concern, recent events have brought to light the downsides of having such an excessive number of languages present in the country.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that attempting to run administrative procedures through several different languages will only end poorly, as important descriptions are lost in translation and unnecessary strain is placed on the system as it has to cope with translating to this and that and this dialect and that sublanguage, when the entire process could be a fraction of the difficulty by simply printing in two languages - Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nThis would have its drawbacks, however. We are still currently running the government on Galician, and suddenly shifting over may have consequences. Not to mention that the unrest generated by simply swapping formal languages may outweigh any gain we could create. For this reason we could make a few concessions as a transitory stance, but segments of the government may not approve. "

Using careful rhetoric, the collaborators were able to soften the message for relevant populations.

 IBR.5382.t:0 "The Archbishop of Madrid speaks to the People" 
 IBR.5382.d:0 "Casimiro Morcillo González, the newly consecrated Archbishop of Madrid, delivered a speech to a large congregation of citizens. Unusually for such an event, it was broadcasted over the radio and live over television.\n\nHis Eminency spoke first of the power of faith, of how a common religion can bind its believers in friendship, solely by the power of the cross. He spoke of union - as Iberia joined together, its people must also come together to work for a better country.\n\nHe addressed God's plan. Nothing happened just for the sake of happening. Rather, everything that happens was a part of God's greater plan, and so anyone who came on hard times had to have faith, for everything would work out in the end, as planned.\n\nGod, he says, put strong men on Earth to guide the weak, to serve as teachers, stewards, and mentors. These strong men are agents of God, and so it is His desire that the same faith be placed in them as is placed in Him. The Caudillos are some of these strong men, and so they must take absolute power. The country must have faith in them, he reiterates, for they will guide it in the correct direction.\n\nHe ended his sermon with a call for prayer. During the sudden silence, many were left to wonder just what this would all mean for Iberia. "
 IBR.5382.a:0 "God bless his soul."

 IBR.5423.t:0 "Responses from Iberian Homes"
 IBR.5423.d:0 "It has not been very long, yet we have already received enough complaints and responses about our new policies that we cannot count them all in a short time. However, it was easy enough to take a small sample of complaints and interpret them instead. If they are at all representative, then our new policies are unanimously disliked.\n\nPeople do not appreciate our austerity measures. Given our status as a rich, western country, in this day in age it is unfathomable to most that they might need to use candles instead of other sources of fuel. They do not understand the value of oil, and want to keep wasting it away. We could divert some oil to civilian usage, which would alleviate most of these complaints for a time. However, we do not have much oil to spare, so we must decide whether using some of what little we have is worth getting people to shut up."

 IBR.5423.b:0 "Divert some of the oil their way"
 
 IBR.5424.t:0 "Problems with Food Distribution"
 IBR.5424.d:0 "We have gotten people to cook less. It took shipments of food that do not require cooking to the areas around the country, but we have managed to mostly wean people off of food that needs oil. We have drafted a plan, detailing how to feed the country. There are regular food shipments, of fixed amounts, to areas around the country. We do not send more, and we do not send less. So far, it seems to have worked.\n\nSome of the rural areas are complaining that they do not get enough food delivered to eat. They say that our shipments were not enough to distribute, so some have gone hungry. While it is possible that we miscalculated the shipment amounts, it is infinitely more possible that they have not yet learned to ration. Everyone in this country was instructed to eat what was necessary, and perhaps the issue is that they are eating more than their fill?"
 IBR.5424.a:0 "We have to stick to the plan"
 IBR.5424.b:0 "Send it where they are complaining"
 
 IBR.5425.t:0 "The Pains of Virtue"
 IBR.5425.d:0 "The people of Iberia ought to see the silver lining in their situation. A time like this is absolutely perfect to devote themselves to their faith. With the perfect circumstances to fast, and keep along with one another in monklike contemplation, there is no time like the present to truly follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Surely, they would be closer to God if they followed an ascetic lifestyle like Jesus Christ.\n\nHowever, it seems that people have refused to accept this opportunity for religion. According to reports, a growing number of citizens have grown displeased with austerity. Yet more complaints still have come in about the daily lives of many politicians, who have neglected the burdens of faith for proper political aptitude. Why should we compromise, when the souls of Iberians are at stake? Perhaps, this time, the soul of Iberia is at stake too..."
 IBR.5425.a:0 "They will get used to it in due time"

 IBR.5426.t:0 "The Rain Never Stops" #this is the event for iberian wars flashpoint for despotist union
 IBR.5426.d:0 "A new atmosphere had come over Iberia. Where the oil crisis once created uncertainty, there now lies another emotion. Slowly, the collective wonderings of what was to become of the country faded, replaced by a growing resentment of what had become of the country.\n\nHorses plodded through the streets, as burnt wax and hunger returned to Iberia. They were a modern country, right? If they were, then why did they need to regress to such horrid depths? This resentment grew into anger, once they beheld the lives of their betters. The politicians and the generals still lived lavish lifestyles, as if they had stolen all of the people's goods to use for their own. From this anger, Iberia began to decay.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the situation degraded. Terror attacks grew more constant, shielded from retribution by a populace with nothing left to lose. Tensions between the government and the people grew, the perceived injustice too great to bear. Society is ripping itself apart, and it will only take one strong shock to send the entire country tumbling down."
 IBR.5426.a:0 "God help us."

With the price of oil still high but coming down, the economy still needs time to recover and rebound. But all citizens can breathe a sigh of relief that the worst is over.

 IBR.5427.d:0 "Despite the efforts to sugarcoat it, to twist the words to make it seem better than it actually is, or just to ignore it, the numbers simply don't lie. It's become clear that the effects of the Oil Crisis will be felt in Iberia for some time to come, as we are in the midst of a slow recovery. While spokesmen say that the economy is recovering from the lows of the Crisis, the skyrocketing unemployment rate, and the astronomical price of gas shows that there will be more pain in store for Iberia. The price of oil is still stubbornly high, which will retard our efforts for economic growth and prosperity for a very long time to come. Economists are already speaking of slow growth, perhaps even a recession due to the government's failed plans and lacklustre initiative. We can only hope that the events will defy the current trajectory at this point, and brace for a persistent and long downturn."

 IBR.5500.t:0 "Axencia Finds Uptick in Separatist Activity"
 IBR.5500.d:0 "The icy cold frost had descended upon the tranquil little town during the early morning hours. Not even the steadfast bakers or milkmen had started their gruelling shifts when a small group of blackclad figures descended upon the quiet streets. Their efforts would spell a very different morning for the generally peaceful townspeople.\n\nAlong the stark granite walls of the police station and mayoral office a message of defiance was painted in a horrifying shade of red, a message to be received all around the Union. News of it quickly made its way up the large chain of bureaucracy that defined the Iberian government and landed right in the hands of the security apparatus of the AAS.\n\nElsewhere, similar messages had also begun to appear, whether graffiti, sloppily designed posters or other illicit publications. One thing was certain, a wildfire had been set, with opposition to the regime becoming visible on the streets and walls of Iberia. While some within the Axencia little more than youthful delinquency in the propaganda, others see a dangerous movement in need of stamping out."

 IBR.5501.t:0 "Basque Teenagers Caught Vandalizing"
 IBR.5501.d:0 "News of another display of separatist activity has been relayed internally by the Axencia. A pair of rebellious youths had had the audacity to attack the Bilbao AAS branch office with rocks and other small missiles while chanting freedom messages, in the process smashing multiple windows and allegedly even causing minor wounds to a female secretary. The teenagers, both believed to be of the age of 14, were immediately apprehended at the scene to be taken in for further questioning. The precedent that this attack could set for more daring dissatisfied separatists is yet to be seen."
 IBR.5501.a:0 "Disgraceful display of our education system."
 
 IBR.5502.t:0 "Teenagers Die in AAS Custody"
 IBR.5502.d:0 "The ashen yet calm police chief slowly descended down the cracked stone slabs of the station, with every nearing step to the grand oak entrance doors increasing the blasting cacophony of voices and screams outside. With a quick pause and steady breath he opened them to the unwelcome greeting of harsh camera flashes and unintelligible questions. Raising his hand to try to soften the din he went over the message he had to relay again, already gritting his teeth in anticipation of what was to follow.\n\nThe tragic death of the two youths who had vandalized the AAS Station in Bilbao only to be arrested immediately on the scene was a travesty. Local police had been due to transfer the delinquents into custody to await trial only to find both had died under mysterious circumstances while being detained by AAS agents. Without having the full consequences in consideration the transferring officers had contacted the family of the deceased soon after. If word about this incident spreads, its initial ripples have the potential of turning into full shock waves, ready to incite social devastation upon the already teetering Union."
 IBR.5502.a:0 "You fools, what have you done?!" 
 
 IBR.5503.t:0 "Riots in Bilbao"
 IBR.5503.d:0 "The lazy summer sun warmed the already cracking roof tiles of a town in total uproar, creating an almost amazing contrast to the chaos on the streets of Bilbao. Large mobs had gathered with numerous posters and signs decrying the supposed injustice committed against the two recently deceased youths and their families. Their angry march had taken them right into the arms of waiting riot police who had seemingly little sympathy with protesters while they quickly dismantled the gathering. Numerous ringleaders and those who resisted were arrested without delay, likely not helping a situation that already was beginning to influence the national consciousness."
 IBR.5503.a:0 "Order must be restored."
 
 IBR.5504.t:0 "AAS Infiltrates Large CNT Cell"
 IBR.5504.d:0 "To say that she looked shifty was an understatement. Quite frankly her whole body felt oddly out of place walking down the shoddy wooden stairs to the hidden cellar entrance. Letting her eyes flit momentarily onto her guide just behind her she was again taken aback by how innocent and normal these people looked. He could have maybe been a school teacher, likely actually was; academia was starting to be filled with these people. The pair stopped at the heavy door blocking the view of what sounded like a relatively large meeting room, larger than what you would expect to find under a regular storefront. Without further thought the undercover AAS agent let herself in.\n\nWith this extremely fortunate infiltration of a large anarchist CNT terrorist group the government security agency has been able to finally map out further plans of revolt and also gain insight into their high morale. With the pyrrhic victory of government forces it should come as no surprise that the rebels feel emboldened in future actions. Their movements will continue to be monitored."
 IBR.5504.a:0 "A lucky catch. "
 
 IBR.5505.t:0 "AAS Infiltrates Small CNT Cell"
 IBR.5505.d:0 "Standing secluded at the sidelines of the clearly rushed and poorly executed meeting it became obvious to the undercover AAS agent in how much disarray the CNT terrorist cell he infiltrated really was. The profusely sweating and overweight leader of the small group rushed in almost 10 minutes late, excusing himself with hushed whispers about how dangerous it was these days and the extra precautions he had to take. At the sight of this walking disaster the security man let his cover slip for just a brief instance, smirking with glee, only to resume his half bored normal state. His reports in recent weeks had been enlightening to the agency. The state of the CNT had been heavily affected by the news of the decisive defeat in Barcelona, recruitment was at an all time low and the situation within active cells was not much better. It would however be foolish to dismiss the terrorists yet, and so the AAS agent continued to participate in this dark comedy."
 IBR.5505.a:0 "They are growing slowly, at least."
 
 IBR.5506.t:0 "Thousands in Lisbon Protest Spanish Dominance"
 IBR.5506.d:0 "A great chatter rose from the cobbled streets of old Lisbon, many windows opened with jubilant people leaning out and cheering the seething mass outside onwards. Yet this was not a parade, nor a military march; were you to listen closely to the deafening cacophony of these proud Portuguese you would realize that this in fact was a strong statement of resistance. Incessant shouts of 'long live the Republic' and 'remember the last union' erupted every few minutes to the great dismay of state press that had gathered along the cordoned off sides of the protest.\n\nThe Portuguese will not tolerate subordination in a union originally formed out of desperation. Franco's iron fist likely will neither help quell nor hinder their capacity of opposition. In fact it may even bring rise to something else entirely. With other separatist action also springing up around the country the stability of the union is at threat on a fundamental level if reform is not enacted quickly and effectively. "
 IBR.5506.a:0 "Our great future is now uncertain. Madre Dios. "
 IBR_cauinfo_francolisbon_big_tt:0 "This appears to be caused by §wFranco's overwhelming influence in the Union§!.\n"
 
 IBR.5507.t:0 "Hundreds in Lisbon Protest Against Spanish Dominance"
 IBR.5507.d:0 "Banners of resistance wave lazily in the soft Lisbon breeze, as a few hundred anti-Union protesters gather to voice their opposition to Portugal's continued participation in the Iberian Union. The rally is small, barely gathering the attention of the local residents trying to enjoy the holy day after the usual weekly Sunday Mass. The few officers that are standing loosely around the dwindling mass of angry voices snigger every now and then to each other.\n\nYet the significance of this event should not be underplayed. A new and more significant separatist faction has now been added to the already brimming list of previous problems concerning autonomy in the union. This issue will need attention in the long term to make sure that it will does fester from a small localised infection into a great epidemic."

 IBR.5508.t:0 "Smugglers Detained at Asturian Port"
 IBR.5508.d:0 "Local authorities in the port town of Avilés today discovered a cargo ship had a secret compartment behind its normal transported goods holding a variety of small arms and ammunition. With social tensions currently very high anyhow due to separatist tensions this discovery may even spark enough controversy to lead the union on the long descent downwards into civil war. We therefore have to sort this situation with minimal press coverage and wider government interference. It however is unknown where this transport had originally come from which opens entirely new questions as well, the Breton crew which we had questioned extensively gave us no further information except for backroom contacts and intermediaries which look to lead nowhere. Perhaps a mystery we will never solve."
 IBR.5508.a:0 "We find ourselves in dangerous waters."
 
 IBR.5509.t:0 "Basque Terrorists Arrested"
 IBR.5509.d:0 "Through the valiant efforts of a loyal citizen of our glorious Union the security forces were today able to arrest a dangerous group of Basque separatist terrorists in Bilbao. An elderly man who lived in a rather rundown apartment block on the outside of the city had seen multiple suspicious looking men enter the rooms next door and heard them shout and sing rather incriminating things throughout the space of a week. With due diligence he had informed local authorities who quickly came to the scene to discover the group had been plotting an attack in the city center. Interrogation later showed the terrorists had been affiliated with the ETA. With this heroic effort we have saved many lives and guaranteed slightly better stability for our nation." 
 IBR.5509.a:0 "Only through the efforts of our police heroes." 
 
 IBR.5510.t:0 "AAS Successfully Raids CNT Cell"
 IBR.5510.d:0 "Across from the innocent looking shopfront, up high on the roof of a secured apartment block lay a dormant sniper, his scope rested on the entrance of the closed store. In the darkness of the chilly summer night he could make out the shadowy figures of his comrades making their way silently to all the possible entrances and exits of the terrorist hideout they had discovered. Finally the call was given and he watched them storm in, hearing the faint noises of panicked shouting mixed in with a few silenced shots over the radio and across the street. After 5 minutes the street went silent again.\n\nThe successful AAS raid on an earlier infiltrated CNT terrorist cell has brought great spoils, both in terms of information obtained after interrogation and material loot. The anarchists had amassed a good amount of material for their planned attacks on our union. This victory will be forgotten by history, as a sacrifice of equally keeping the devastation that could have been perpetrated out of more important books."
 IBR.5510.a:0 "A swift yet groundbreaking victory for our security forces."
 
 IBR.5511.t:0 "AAS Botches Raid on CNT Cell"
 IBR.5511.d:0 "A scramble on the creaky stairs as a pair of unruly teen brothers rushed down to quickly get to the door, their mission of joining the commotion outside fortunately not foiled by their angry mother chasing them. When they emerged, they immediately began to mingle into the large protest amassing outside. Just one of many around the nation, and these were only the peaceful responses to what had now become a national tragedy.\n\nA few days prior the AAS had botched an important raid on a CNT terrorist cell in Axencia that had previously been infiltrated. Yet due to faulty intelligence the anti terrorist forces arrived at the wrong location, opening fire on innocent civilians. The news quickly spread despite government involvement to cover up the situation. Our nation may be hurting for quite some time after this incident."
 IBR.5511.a:0 "A terrible situation."
 
 IBR.5512.t:0 "The Rise of a Portuguese Separatist Group"
 IBR.5512.d:0 "The unabating whispers of the AAS's informants speak of new, disturbing developments. Separatist agitation has begun to ramp up in Portugal of all places, previously thought of as being the one region of the Union not plagued by petty nationalism. Yet now signs show an increase in leftist organisational and political activity, coalescing around the demand for an independent and socialist Portugal. The forces of the Portguese left seem to be abandoning their differences and uniting across ideological and party lines, something that the Spanish left was not able to do truly 20 years ago during the Spanish Civil War. A single name and banner has been appearing around the cities in the form of anti-Iberian posters and other propaganda: The FSLP, the Socialist Front of Portugese Liberation. These developments will have to be closely monitored and dealt with before anything too drastic can happen."
 IBR.5512.a:0 "A ghost from a faraway past across an undying border."

 IBR.5513.t:0 "Something Amiss in Asturias"
 IBR.5513.d:0 "Catalonia and the Basque countries, both essential regions of our union, yet infested with terrorist and separatist groups, have begun to be a serious problem. The AAS is working tirelessly, scrambling after every hint and possible lead to track these terrorist groups. Rooting out this dangerous disease is however proving to be less of a simple operation and rather a self perpetuating cycle of reciminiations and violence.\n\nSecurity agents in Asturias have uncovered a particularly bizarre phenomenon. It seems that the growth of armed separatist groups has not simply been a product of Iberia's tumultuous political situation, yet had been spurred on by the arrival of more and more illegal arms shipments at Asturian ports, divied up to support small local groups as well as those further across the nation. Interrogation of the smugglers has so far failed to reveal much more about the situation, though it seems increasingly obvious that outside forces are helping spur on the speratist radicalism inside our borders. Investigations will continue."

I do not understand them, and I probably never will. Iberia is a beautiful country, and when you bring the entire peninsula then everything only gets more beautiful. I can see why my colleague is so proud of his mandate now."\n\nFranco allows himself a smile, almost even a chuckle, before biting it back down to continue speaking.\n\n"We ought to be united as one country, indivisible, until the Pyrenees! These separatists- these terrorists wish to break apart one of the greatest natural states to exist on God's Earth! I come to you all today to beg you, do not allow these monsters leeway. They are just that, monsters. If they have even so much of an inch, they will take the mile from you at gunpoint.

 IBR.5521.t:0 "Disturbing News Regarding The Axencia"
 IBR.5521.d:0 "It is no secret in government circles that the Axencia has been in on some unpleasant times. Agency performance is down, and reports have gotten progressively less detailed as the whole organization seems to be sputtering to a standstill. At least they have for the most part been attending to an adequate number of separatists, and are generally passable enough to let be.\n\nThat is, until distressing alerts as to the true function of the department surfaced. The whistleblower is very anonymous, and the information traveled through very tight channels to make sure it was not intercepted. The levelled allegations are very serious, of extreme corruption, rampant nepotism, and a system designed to keep it all from leaking out. The most disturbing implication of all was the suggestion that some reports are faked, meaning the Axencia is not as effective as hoped.\n\nThis is clearly a very serious issue, and making sure it is resolved - if there is something to resolve - will be a high priority. The first question is where to start; there are many facets to the Axencia, and only one can have sustained scrutiny. It may be the fault of a horrible administrative class, which cares only for their own pockets. The military cannot be ruled out, however, as they have very close ties with the organization. No matter where the corruption might be most concentrated, if the rumors are true then both parties will share some level of blame. The investigation has to be very careful. Who is the most likely group of perpetrators?"

There are many unpleasant trends leaked by an unknown whistleblower, hinting at a trend of nepotism within the Axencia. Though the rate at which new information is being leaked is almost unbearably slow, the leaks in question are verifiable, which has brought much more into question about the scope of the corruption than first anticipated.

 IBR.5523.d:0 "Some time has passed, and in that period even more evidence has come out as to the actual day-to-day operations of the Axencia. Waiting time between the shreds has been long and excruciating but as time progressed they became more and more substantial. Now, there is a case to be made. Much of the evidence is not totally verifiable, but enough circumstantial pieces of evidence have come together to make much more than a coincidence. There is clearly something afoot, even if it is not as bad as accused.\n\nThis is something to be taken very seriously. If we take the wrong steps, then it could very well happen that any leads we could have will be squandered under the boot of a corrupt official, covered up and prevented from reaching the higher-ups eyes, one way or another. More investigation is needed, and it needs to be determined where this investigation will be directed. It could be put towards the bureaucrats directly, using force and coercion to force the information out of them. This could go badly, but it has the best promise of results. Alternatively, more subversive methods could be applied to glean information from suspects. No matter the decision, it will need to be handed with tenderness."

Between the two unquestionable fields was an endless number of conditions, terms, and other minutiae that bureaucrats were so good at forcing into the spotlight, choking anything of necessity with minor detail after another.\n\nPitted against such resilient enemies, the Caudillo was tested in a way he hadn't been for a long time. No men were to die today, but words fought and killed just as well in their place. Finally, after the product of many hours work, a deal was created, agreed upon by both Franco and the officials he wrestled tongues with.

When pressed on why they were able to give no end of justifications, the most common of which was their views on other departments. They did not ever get terms like this, they argued, so there was no reason for the Axencia to get them either. For every term they were able to find a similar argument, of how no other organization ever got a deal of this sort.\n\nIt took every part of Franco's persuasive ability to stop them from walking away entirely with their ill-gotten gains. The bureaucrats were unresponsive to a deal, and to even slightly interest them it was required to budge on many terms. It is likely impossible we will get a good deal out of them, but the Caudillo will put up a strong showing regardless. Strong enough, as it happens, to attempt to compromise on many of the issues.

His persuasive acumen is one to be admired, however, and managed to salvage the best out of a less-than-ideal situation. Engaged in a contest of words, each side presented issues and tried to split down the middle until they found something to both their satisfactions.\n\nThe end result was the birth of a deal, created not to satisfy both camps but to make both the bureaucrats and Franco agree.

At first, it was just gear, weaponry, and all sorts of equipment made for the military, put to use in a conflict more relevant than nearly any other. The general staff began to request for joint programs with the Axencia, in order to "better teach them how to use what they were given."

With recent circumstances, it seems that the decision to intervene and keep it around in spite of that was a wise idea.\n\nAxencia operatives have grown better equipped by orders of magnitude, and military equipment that was once rarely seen except with privileged agents is now commonplace. They have demonstrated adept knowledge on the operation of the equipment, and the reports show a large increase in captured separatists.

New hubs, safehouses, and resource routes have been raided, detaining all within. Information extraction efforts have skyrocketed in quality, bring news of networks we weren't even aware could exist.

This was not the case. The partnership is nearly identical to the way it was before, where funding would go in, and nothing would come out. There has been nearly nothing tangible to come out of the equipment transfer or the training programs, and when pressed it would always require more funding, or more time, or some other similar excuse.

The information he has provided cannot be verified, but it appears to be consistent and suggests unfortunate implications for the state of the partnership.\n\nGiven the depth of the information, it has been recommended that the superiors in the Axencia be alerted to this turn of events, and their claims verified or rejected. Additionally, it could be used to question the extent of their involvement in the corruption that plagues the Axencia.

Presenting records showing a much cleaner record than suspected, they conceded that there were some small inefficiencies, but nothing of the sort which was being leveled against them. As well, they also called the legitimacy of the accuser into question, stating that an agent with 'something to hide' probably did not have genuine allegations.

If that one person can be found and the information brought out of them, then the entire audit could be flipped on its head. There is only one issue, and that is finding the man in question. Two methods have been determined, and each is roughly equal to one another, so a final authority is needed to decide between them.\n\nThe first method is to just take a group and bluntly inform them of what we want from them. We will lay out the allegations, present the evidence, remind them of the consequences of this crime, and how they may receive amnesty if they cooperate. While it runs the risk of galvanizing those interrogated into not speaking, by reminding them of the consequences, some may be more inclined to cooperate.\n\nThe second option is to attempt a more subversive strategy, and instead of just asking directly to instead deceive the accused. We may get what we want out of them by using false circumstances, and luring them into making a mistake. Even though the whole thing is dependent on someone slippin up, it makes for something much more subtle than the alternative. Only the best will be put to it regardless, but which plan will be used?"

It was full of documents, photos, and even a testimony.\n"You are involved in a corruption scandal, and you know it, and we know it too. Why not give yourself up now?" Examining the reaction on the bureaucrat's face was enough. He had him. "Besides, I'm sure you know what happens to enemies of the state... Unless, of course, you cooperate. I'm a very reasonable man, and I can tell you don't want to have a bad end."\n\n"Okay, okay! For amnesty, I'll tell you. What do you want to know?"\n\nMost denied their involvement outright, but when faced with the proof that showed their involvement without a shadow of a doubt, some changed their tune. For promises of amnesty and to be let off the hook, they will corroborate the investigation and its reports. Enough so, to bring definitive credibility to our cases.

If they are suspicious, then they may be malicious and deceive us. Something will need to be used to justify the lure, and for that we will need to come up with a pretense.\n\nSince there is a routinely scheduled inspection coming up, it would be possible to replace the usual corrupt, ineffectual administrators that man it with loyal agents, who would interrogate bureaucrats about the minutiae of daily operations in the Axencia. No-one would know any better, and since it is only a small modification to what they are used to, they may still answer honestly - as it was already set up so that they do not compromise any of the information we need to know. Some may not fall for it, but others certainly will.\n\nAlternatively, though it may cost much more, would be to set up a celebration to commemorate their successes. This could be used as a front to ask them compromising questions, and for the promise of money they will certainly fall for it. It will be easy to set up, and if anything the hardest thing will be finding a victory for them to celebrate. Which plan will we put in place?"

Don't take it personally, it's just that people can sometimes slip through the cracks. I'm going to ask you a few questions, okay?"\n\n"Okay."\n\nThe bureaucrat was nothing if not cooperative, and he seemed very relaxed.

On top of it all, a large bonus was offered to a number of randomly selected employees, by means of a raffle. All it took to be entered in was to make sure they were caught up on their work. So he did, and his name was drawn. He was escorted off to a side room by a clerk, who held up a check, for an immense sum of money.\n\n"So, I heard you were good at keeping up with your work. That's great! I have your bonus right here, nearly fully prepared. Now, some people like to try and fake their reports to get rewarded for nothing. While I don't think you're the sort to do that, I need you to answer a few questions, to make sure you know what you're doing. First, you need to describe to me your day-to-day operations..."\n\nManuel wasn't listening past there. His eyes were locked on that check, and everything he could do with the money. Though he still kept the ruse up for a while, he was so fixated on the bonus that he wasn't entirely aware of when he went through the less legal sides of his daily work, nor did his interviewer care to alert him. Eventually, Manuel got his money, and left as the clerk was alone to evaluate his findings.

There was going to be a deal before he left, Franco explained, or else there would be Hell to pay.\n\nThe leadership did not feel the same way. To them, the evidence was unsatisfactory - they thought much of it circumstantial, and many of the testimonies misinterpreted. Additionally, they did not think there was enough evidence to validify the circumstantial testimonies. Above all, they found that the problem Franco was presenting was nothing like what he had made it out to be. Regardless, they did concede that there was an issue, and that they would make a deal pledging to solve it.

Even though he put the best of his dealmaking ability to the test, it simply wasn't enough to create a sufficient arrangement.\n\nWhat he was able to arrange was enough to stop the worst excesses of the Axencia, and create something that was arguably functional, but he was unable to stop it entirely. For the most part, the money crossed hands under the table, from governmental coffers, to the unhelpful clerks. There was no denying that what was in place worked vastly better than it did originally, but that did not mean much.

Begrudgingly, they accepted the evidence, and their role in the situation. The Caudillo had the upper hand at the bargaining table. He dictated terms to them, and they were forced to agree.

There appears to be such a vast amount of corruption that it is acting like a cancer, sapping the strength of its host. Even worse, the military seems to be spurring it on, putting an emphasis on their pockets before their country. It is, quite frankly, sickening. Making enemies and fearful men out of the military is never a good idea, and so threatening them cannot be a good idea either. Alternative methods need to be applied, and the only question is what kind.\n\nThere are very many obvious suspects, of whom have dubious track records and a less-than-stellar character. The common link between them is that most are involved in the Axencia-military joint programs. It would make sense to investigate them primarily, for if anyone were to want to leech off a government program, it would definitely be them. Alternatively, there may be some higher planners to investigate. Many officers are schemers, and so it is possible that one is involved in these unscrupulous deeds, besides the obvious ones.

It also so happens that those that struggle to meet expectations frequently are the most closed off, offering little insight into just why exactly they could be doing so poorly.\n\nAs these programs are ultimately subordinate to the final word of the military command, of which is willing to do as we say, it would be possible to just order them to open up, and share their financial records in particular. They couldn't object to the formal chain of command. This is only if we want the documents now, of course. As possible as it is to have their records now, it is just as possible to wait, and let them show their hand while we gather more information.

We have waited for a greater opportunity to present itself, and now just that has occurred.\n\nInvestigation into those directly connected with the most corrupt of the Axencia-military joint programs has uncovered some very incriminating results, and between what can be found of them and the testimonies of current and past coworkers, even more information has come out to further prove our case. As time has gone on, more and more evidence that can be utilized has been recovered, regardless of its source.

As it turns out, it was correct, and so he became a new informant. He had two simple requests in exchange for working with us: that his identity be kept anonymous, lest someone carry out a reprisal against him, and for a pardon for his crimes.

For quite some time, accusations have been building up against many of them, with most pointing the finger at nearly all of them combined.\n\nInformation and allegations have come from all sides. Some are from disgruntled former employees, others from the wronged seeking comeuppance. At least one, as not all of them describe their relationship, was of a current employee knowing he will be caught, and offering evidence for a pardon. Even though they have been entirely unresponsive to these, their build-up has finally caused The Rots to crack. They have admitted to some wrongdoing, and to that end will be willing to make some concessions in exchange for terms that are 'yet to be negotiated'. We have brought them to the negotiating table."

Both were willing to make some concessions to their goals, but for the most part they were irreconcilable. One should never say they didn't try, however, as both were aware some sort of deal was necessary, and they tugged it towards their favor.\n\nDealmaking and speech were put to the test. It was a duel of words, and were it physical it would have gone down in history as one of the greatest battles to be fought. Its duration was of a similar stature, taking several hours before a final arrangement was reached.\n\nNo matter how hard he had tried, the Caudillo simply did not have the upper hand in this session of Iberian Negotiations - that is, glorified arguing.

When the first day of questioning ended, there was still nothing to be found for results.\n\nA few hours later, a suspect finally broke. In almost exaggerated fits of tears, he described that he knew where some evidence could be, and that he had some paperwork he thought would help. All he wanted was to be spared, and to go home to his family. He directed the location of these documents to his interrogators, hidden in his office, in a very particular location. A few men were set out to find these documents, and verify their legitimacy. Unfortunately, what they found was very worrying.\n\nThe documents uncovered were very explicit, and the information they contained was damning. There were certainly money transfers happening, the volume of which matched the funding reported missing by other clerks. When examining these documents, a surprise had come up - the money had been routed through another department to wherever it had gone. This department was the Policía Armada!

Regardless, in our zeal to end the investigation it does not seem like we evaluated our evidence, and so it would be a sound idea to do so. There are some very particular quirks about the Policía Armada's documents that prove them to be very unique.

The shock and confusion was legitimate after all. While they are also probably corrupt, they are for sure not involved in this particular case. We were played for fools by those corrupt bureaucrats!

We have had nothing on them since.\n\nIt was reasoned that the bureaucrats, if they had plans to create false documents, were for sure guilty. Because of that guilt, it wasn't unreasonable to assume they had the real documents somewhere. If that evidence could be found, then there would be a bust like no other, and there would be wrath the likes of which could rival what was delivered to separatists and other terrorists. All that would take was the proof, and so the proof was what they scoured for.\n\nHomes, offices, personal accessories, nothing was spared the combing of a lifetime. Nowhere was spared, and none of the locations searched had the documents. Even with a triple check, they were nowhere to be found. It seems that there will be no finding them. Given the time it took to complete the investigation into the Policía, they probably destroyed the documents at the time. If we had kept surveillance on them, then it could have been stopped before it happened. Without that paperwork, there was no evidence, and with no evidence there could be no purge."

There was talk of corruption, bribery, and all-around unprofessionalism from within the joint programs, elaborating on these issues in such a way that left nothing to imagination.

The obvious choice would be the Policía Armada,who is notorious for maintaining a fierce rivalry with the Axencia in the cutthroat political environment. Since they are so hostile, it could be reasoned that they both have incriminating information on one another. Taking this information and applying it could be a great boon to investigation efforts, and they would be glad to hand it over for the sake of a rivalry. Alternatively, there are the units who have partnered with the Axencia. Responsible for much of the equipment and all of the training, they are very closely associated with the agency.

They were going to see if they had absolutely anything on the Axencia-military joint programs, and if they did they would share it with the government immediately. Since this is a total audit, it will probably take several weeks for them to finish. The department is remarkable for breaking records in efficiency for sorting through paperwork, and with such a motivator they will probably be even more efficient than normal.

Their documents had been very well sorted, and so it was very easy to comb the relevant section to find what they wished to find. The rest is still ongoing, but they had found what we wished for them to locate. We would be informed if they come across anything else that was out of place.\n\nOn investigation and verification of the documents, the designs check out and do not appear to be forged documents. Going off of the information contained within the papers, our suspicions seem to be true. The Policía Armada had located the exact transaction, and it took just one look to see that something was off, and just one more to see what was being done wrong. With this information, we have the case we need, and all we need to do now is to act on it."

 IBR.5575.t:0 "Collaborating unit Provides Proof"
 IBR.5575.d:0 "After placing an inquiry with a unit closely involved with the training and equipping of Axencia operators, it seems we have a definitive lead. They were reluctant to oblige at first, not appearing to wish to so much as acknowledge our request. That is, until Franco himself ordered them to investigate the case. They answered our call very quickly following that, and said they would look right away for evidence. The unit's officers tripped over themselves to provide a vast amount of information, of which seemed legitimate enough at a cursory glance. They were also able to hand over the most valuable proof of all - financial records.\n\nThe Caudillo was quizzical, what would push them so far if they were otherwise unwilling? Again, they were very quick to respond: they were the military, and Francisco Franco was their Caudillo. Their loyalty to him was unquestionable, and they were pleased to show an opportunity to demonstrate it. If he needed anything else, they would be able to provide."
 IBR.5575.a:0 "How odd... but we will not complain."
 
 IBR.5576.t:0 "Confronting the Accused"
 IBR.5576.d:0 "The evidence was ready, prepared in totality for a meeting. Franco had ordered the investigation to commence, and he insisted that he would see it through to the final steps. Even though the initial reaction was downright derisive, the Caudillo was fully confident that the next time he brought it up it wouldn't be ignored. He had an ace up his sleeve - and it was evidence. Acquired by other means, the evidence was summarized and placed into a folder, creating the nail in the coffin of his rivals of negotiation. Countless testimonies, records, and especially the financial audits created the basis for this powerful document, and he was going to milk it for everything it was worth.\n\nFranco will not stop until he gets the terms he desires, harsh contracts designed to stop any more money siphoning from happening ever again. He will place every last bit of his persuasive ability in to make sure of it. The bait is already set, as the date marches closer to the meeting which will surely doom his opponents."
 IBR.5576.a:0 "Best of luck!"
 
 IBR.5577.t:0 "Policía Armada Documents Fabricated"
 IBR.5577.d:0 "The negotiation was going forward as anticipated. The generals were skeptical, despite the Caudillo's best attempts to convince them otherwise. They seemed impatient, so Franco played his master stroke, and slapped the folder full of Policía Armada findings on the table. It would be wonderful to see them recoil. Now he would wait for them to re-\n\n"Señor, you are aware these are fabricated documents, right? There is a man in the Policía that frequently does this. I can recognize his trademark anywhere, his statistics are always the same." To Franco's shock, the general spent the next few minutes utterly dismantling Franco's arguments, leaving him with nearly no ground to stand on. Even worse, he was slightly embarrassed by it all. Regardless, he was able to talk some way to something, with the generals conceding that something would be done to rein in corruption, but that the issue was nowhere near as bad.\n\nThe first thing the Caudillo did was order the particular bureaucrat - whose identity he had been informed of - executed. In hindsight, perhaps it wasn't a good idea to trust such quick findings. Total investigations take much longer, and that it was finished so quickly should have been a red flag. This should have been expected out of a department that despised the Axencia; for more resources these lackeys would do absolutely anything."
 IBR.5577.a:0 "Anything is much larger than we thought."
 
 IBR.5578.t:0 "Harsh Terms Accepted by Military"
 IBR.5578.d:0 "The negotiation was going forward as anticipated. The generals were skeptical, despite the Caudillo's best attempts to convince them otherwise. They seemed impatient, so Franco played his master stroke, and slapped the folder full of corroborated partnership information on the table. It would be wonderful to see them recoil. Now he would wait for them to react to the findings. Franco saw it as it happened - impatience turned to alertness, and from there to fear. It looks like this conspiracy was a bit deeper than he thought, and now in the best way possible.\n\nBy applying the threat of punishment, the Caudillo was able to ply a very advantageous deal with his generals, much harsher than what he had intended originally. The corrupt partnership programs would be adhering very strictly to this new policy, or else the generals in charge would be taking most of the punishment. After all, they would be the ones enforcing it. If they couldn't, then it would be their necks on the line. The Axencia-military partnership will not have any more issues regarding corruption."
 IBR.5578.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 IBR.5579.t:0 "Unit points finger at Policía Armada"
 IBR.5579.d:0 "In order to find the direction of the funding that seemed to disappear within the Axencia, it was opted to ask one of the units that worked with the program, whose corruption was liable to be less than the usual within the agency. Their response was sluggish, but when pressured by the Caudillo they finally gave a response. The leadership was certain they could find documents about what was wanted out of them, but it would take time.\n\nEventually they did present some evidence pointing us in another direction, as well as some testimony of their own. The Policía Armada and the Axencia had been nearly at war for a long time for resources, and so the former had decided to take budget from the latter. The money is being redirected through the Policía Armada, and into the pockets of their leadership and the officials who stand by it. There is no time to waste!"
 IBR.5579.a:0 "Confront them, now!"

 IBR.5580.t:0 "A Weak Deal on Joint Programs"
 IBR.5580.d:0 "While less than ideal, what we had was enough to at least get something done. Despite Franco's persuasive ability, there ultimately wasn't enough concrete evidence to effectively pin down his opponents. The Caudillo was never the sort of man to give up if he couldn't secure a total victory, so instead he opted to push for the next best thing - a slightly weaker deal.\n\nUsing what he had, Franco was capable of placing pressure on his suspects. It turned out to be enough to bring the criminals to skip the formalities. In exchange for their cooperation, they were given leniency, and put towards creating a larger case. That same larger case was enough to bring the real masterminds to heel, and a deal put in place to stop their efforts. It isn't perfect, full of compromise and middle ground, but it is better than just letting them run amok."
 IBR.5580.a:0 "Well, anything has to be better than what we're fixing."
 
 IBR.5581.t:0 "AAS Still Struggling"
 IBR.5581.d:0 "After an investigation into the Axencia's practices - and who or what was causing them - it seems like there was no reason to conduct it. The evidence found, if it was found, was frequently inconclusive and gave the appearance more of a taunt, as we had nothing concrete to work on. Since there was nothing but gut feelings to conduct business on, it follows that there was no business that we could conduct without an innocent being affected.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems our culprits feel the same way. Since we had no arrangement to bind the culprits, they were allowed to run free. Much of the worst has continued unabated, and separatists have taken advantage. There are certain runarounds to the system, and without a reform to patch them up they have grown better-known, and commonly exploited. Most terrorists now run circles around the Axencia, and the only silver lining is that they also seem to have grown complacent."
 IBR.5581.a:0 "What does it matter if nobody is willing to take advantage of their complacence?"
 
 IBR.5582.t:0 "AAS in Dire Straits"
 IBR.5582.d:0 "There is no end to the misfortune of the Caudillo! Nobody was able to be found to assign blame, not even a likely suspect. It was the perfect crime - and the Axencia was the perfect victim. No examples could be made, regulations were undercut, and in the end nobody took the fault for their actions.\n\nWe cannot apprehend ghosts, and what we have brings our culprits to just that: ghosts. Without so much as a stray intern to put up to the firing line the suspects have no reason to stop what they're doing. We know they are in the joint programs, and somewhere within there are our suspects. They have grown wary of our audits, and the chance to apprehend them has passed. Things are deteriorating quickly and it's only going to get worse from here..."
 IBR.5582.a:0 "How much is it going to get worse? I'd have thought we've already hit rock bottom."
 
 IBR.5583.t:0 "Franco's AAS, a Public Mockery"
 IBR.5583.d:0 "In many ways, it has turned out the Axencia is remarkably similar to the military. If you were to place them together, they would seem the same in every way that counted - that is, they are both as corrupt and nepotistic as one another. Ranks are filled with the friends of those above them, money exchanges hands freely, and the situation has devolved into something horrific. It has become a saying that you cannot get anywhere in the department without a loose wallet, and the encouragement for being promoted has become the ability to eke a bit more out of your underlings. Cliques are commonplace.\n\nFunding goes in, and undoubtedly mostly goes to the pockets of the corrupt. Agents are poorly trained and have access to even worse equipment. The terrorists of Iberia cheer, for now they can work nearly unimpeded. The public groan, for now they have to work with an agency clawing and striking blindly in an attempt to justify its presence. Franco's role in the whole affair isn't forgotten either - he was the cause of it all, and many know it."
 IBR.5583.a:0 "So it did get worse."

 IBR.5584.t:0 "AAS Officials Deeply Corrupt" #salazar/council in charge
 IBR.5584.d:0 "Some time has passed, and in that period even more evidence has come out as to the actual day-to-day operations of the Axencia. Waiting time between the shreds has been long and excruciating but as time progressed they became more and more substantial. Now, there is a case to be made. Much of the evidence is not totally verifiable, but enough circumstantial pieces of evidence have come together to make much more than a coincidence. There is clearly something afoot, even if it is not as bad as accused.\n\nThis is something to be taken very seriously. If we take the wrong steps, then it could very well happen that any leads we could have will be squandered under the boot of a corrupt official, covered up and prevented from reaching the higher-ups eyes, one way or another. More investigation is needed, and it needs to be determined where this investigation will be directed. It was suggested to put it towards the bureaucrats directly, using force and coercion to force the information out of them. This path is sadly untenable with the political situation as it is, despite the possibility of great results. More subversive methods will have to be applied to glean information from suspects, a strategy that will have to be handed with tenderness."
 IBR.5584.a:0 "A less confrontational approach is needed"
 
 IBR.5585.t:0 "AAS-Military Program Corrupt" #salazar/council in charge
 IBR.5585.d:0 "With further scrutiny on the programs between the Axencia and the military, the absent documents have been discovered. In a string of connected discoveries, much more evidence - albeit circumstantial in nature - has been revealed. All of these coincidences add up to a near-certainty, and the documents, involving payment and financial management, only make the case even worse. Something has to be done.\n\nThe odds are that the case isn't as deep as expected, but in the off chance that it is worse then it needs to be properly examined. To this end, a route of investigation is necessary. Every option needs to be carefully considered, or else any chance at reform will slip out from under us. The general staff responsible could be directly interrogated, but the current political climate of the Iberian leadership would not allow such bold action. With coercion off the table, we could try simple questioning tactics, and use underhanded strategies to slip a confession out of someone."

 IBR.5700.t:0 "Workers Protest for Tariffs"
 IBR.5700.d:0 "Today in Madrid, thousands of farmers have joined in protest on the streets outside of the Iberian Council chambers for a third straight day. The issue that joins these farmers in protest is a recent announcement by Caudillo Franco, detailing government plans to ease and lift tariffs on all economic sectors. The government states that the continual abolishment of tariffs will encourage the international market to engage with Iberia, and will spur international investment into the Iberian economy over the long term. The farmers, however, remain unconvinced.\n\nFurthermore, the farmers are not alone in their protest. Many employees from the manufacturing industries have also turned up to express their displeasure with the removal of tariffs, arguing that the influx of cheaper foreign imported goods will force Iberian industries to make layoffs, and might even entice local industries to emigrate."The Caudillos put my livelihood at risk. My family has for eight generations survived off our humble farm. But now, cheap, imported, tariff-free foods will soon flood the store shelves. How are we to compete when I can hardly sell my produce?" questioned Reyes Gallego. He inherited his family farm just outside of Madrid two decades ago, but like many Iberian farmers in recent months, he has been struggling to make ends meet. With Iberian consumers likely to prefer the cheaper, imported goods in stores, many farmers such as Mr Gallego question how they will remain afloat.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to make any comment on the protests as liberalization measures continue to be passed. Government spokespersons have, however, stated that the Iberian administration remains enthusiastic about the economic opportunities that will be presented with increased liberalization."

 IBR.5701.d:0 "Demonstrations in cities across Iberia endure, as tens of thousands of unemployed workers take to the streets across Iberia. Following radical liberalization policies, favoured by the Opus Dei and technocrats within the Iberian Council, many manufacturers have laid off their workers, citing an inability to compete with the influx of tariff-free foreign goods. As the demonstrations continue to grow in size as well as in intensity, violence has become inevitable. Last night in Barcelona, altercations between protesters and police escalated. Following several hours of clashes, the city of Barcelona reports that 7 police officers were injured as well 58 protestors, with one police officer currently in critical condition.\n\nAs unemployment continues to rise, many call for the repeal of free trade measures and the re-introduction of tariffs. Several industry leaders have criticized the Caudillos for what they call a "brazen, radical, and irresponsible" approach to economic liberalization. The Caudillos, however, show no indication at halting these efforts, as they continue to further the liberalization programs.\n\nAs a result of the continual demonstrations, the Opus Dei have released a brief public statement, which reads: "The public may rest assured that any and all measures of economic liberalization which have been proposed and conducted within recent months have been carefully considered. Many methods currently being deployed within Iberia are tried and proven methods, in which we place our fullest confidence. The temporary setbacks currently experience are to be expected with a radical shift, but we assure the public that soon Iberia shall reap the benefits of a prosperous and free economy.""

 #Falangist Economic Backfire Events

 IBR.5702.t:0 "Cause for Concern?" #DOESN'T FIT CURRENT TREE
 IBR.5702.d:0 "Economic reports from this quarter have begun to arrive, and the trends are concerning. While initially the heavy investment in the armaments industry spurred growth in both the mining and manufacturing sectors, this growth appears to be approaching a plateau. The initial surge in job creation in mining and manufacturing has nearly come to a complete halt, as generous government investment into the armament industry continues to rise.\n\nWhilst Caudillo Franco continues to praise the apparent economic improvement through his Falagnist policy of state control, arms production, and autarky, many analysts have since decried these policies as an economic disaster in the works. Franco fervently opposes the recent concern, however, as government investment in the armament-related sectors continues to rise.\n\nDespite troubling economic indicators, public confidence in the Iberian economy continues to rise, as unemployment continues to slowly drop. Many wonder; is there truly cause for concern?"

 IBR.5703.d:0 "Within recent weeks, the reception of Franco's economic policies has been less than positive. While the Iberian economy saw some initial success with the heavy autarky measures and investment in armament production and supporting industries, fortunes have been reversed. The economy has since taken a swift plunge. With a large production of armaments and no end buyer, industries have been forced to curtail production to avoid the accumulation of unsaleable armament stockpiles. With the curtailed production came layoffs. Thousands of factory employees found themselves without work in a matter of days, as well as thousands of those working in commercial transportation and mining, as the demand for raw material plummeted.\n\nMany of the unemployed have taken to the streets, protesting the economic policies implemented in recent times. Many of these protestors take aim directly at Franco himself, blaming the Caudillo for the fast declining economic situation. With each passing day, the protests grow in size, with the largest of the protests in Madrid reaching a reported peak of 20,000 participants. As production continues to plunge by the day, it is believed that these anti-Franco protests will only increase in size, as more and more Iberians are put out of work."

Many of the signs read phrases such as "End autarky now!" and "Kill the arms industry, not our jobs!". Franco begins to speak, and the roaring and chanting of the crowd steadily dies down, as they await what the Caudillo's address.\n\n"Countrymen, I know what gathers you all here today. Fear. Fear for your future. Fear for your present jobs. Fear of change. I speak to you today to dissuade those fears. As a nation we have made vast progress in every facet of our society. Great progress! Yet, no progress comes without struggle. This is what we see in our economy today. The comings of great progress. Yes, we must face small setbacks, as we do currently. I do regret that many have to bear the brunt of these setbacks. Yet, it is necessary. Do not be afraid, my fellow countrymen, for golden times lie ahead!" as Franco concludes his speech, the crowd once again erupts into anti-Franco slogans and agitated chatter, much to Franco's dismay. Franco quickly exits the podium behind a well armed police escort and swiftly evacuates the scene of the protest.\n\nAs the economy continues to plunge into freefall, factories and supporting industries continue to lay off workers and outright close down. As hundreds of thousands now find themselves without work, many businesses in the commercial sector have now begun to face a steep decline. The hardships aren't limited to the cities, however. Many rural towns relying on local mining industries now find their men without work, as the economic squeeze is felt outside of the cities. Unrest grows as many of those out of work are unable to find new jobs, and find themselves compelled to join in protests against Franco's economic policies."

All members of the assembly, be they economists, journalists, or simply admiring citizens, have gathered for the same reason. To witness Salazar's announcement upon the next round of economic reforms. Salazar stands confident as the congregation vibrates with a tangible approval.\n\n"Ladies, gentlemen." Salazar began. "We have seen some difficult times together. As a nation, we have struggled with disunity, and as well as with our economy. We have hardly been experiencing a golden age. However, I am proud to confidently say that after much effort, our situation truly looks to be improving. That being said, I am not a man to halt at minor improvements. No. I believe I would share the nations' approval in saying that we should stop no further than absolute success." With that remark, the crowd erupts into an approving cheer, as the flashes of the cameras endure. As the cheers die down, Salazar goes on at length to detail the next round of imminent economic action.\n\nWith the implementation of Salazar's economic policies now proceeding in full force, Iberia's economy has begun to make decisive improvements. With this comes the benefit of increased public approval for Salazar, as many attribute Salazar to the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities. While the reforms remain largely in the preliminary stages, the public approval indicators are remarkably favourable."

Industries both new and old continue to prosper, and the demand for employees is at a several decade high. As a result, unemployment continues to plummet. The newspapers praise the current economic success as an Iberian economic rebirth. And they all recognize one man, one catalyst for this national boom. Caudillo Salazar. Salazar's fervent and unending struggle to embrace the status quo and undertake responsible and careful economic management was nearly defeated at several turns, yet he did not falter. Not when opposed by the Spanish Caudillo, and not when the skeptics of the Falangists and Opus Dei pushed their agendas of radical reform.\n\nBut even Salazar did not foresee the economic upswing that Iberia now enjoys. While through the loan-fuelled investment growth was confidently predicted, the current figures of economic growth far surpass any projections. As a further benefit, approval ratings of Caudillo Salazar, collected by various newspaper media outlets, show to be as high as seventy percent. Truly, nobody could have anticipated a better outcome."

 #Franco Morocco
 
 IBR.6000.t:0 "Making an Entrance?"
 IBR.6000.d:0 "Morocco, a place of great significance to the proud Spanish Generalissimo, the place where he began his arduous journey to rescue his beloved nation from the grips of communism. Yet, now the land he once had known like the back of his hand, where he had once conducted extensive military exercises with his hardened veterans, has greatly changed. It had been over 20 years since his reconquista of Spain, enough time for the German instability and the new Iberian wedding to leave its toll. Franco considered that a proud showing in Morocco may prove his legitimacy and reign in any unruly colonial officials, but he had also always been a man of simple action, not a bombastic dictator like those two men who had helped him cross the narrow sea. Should he perhaps arrive quietly and get straight to business?"
 IBR.6000.a:0 "Roll out the red carpet."
 IBR.6000.b:0 "Avoid the limelight."
 
 IBR.6001.t:0 "Meeting with Local Leaders"
 IBR.6001.d:0 "Franco's arrival in the north African colony has reinvigorated local Morrocan elites into pushing for further autonomy while maintaining Iberian suzerainty. The argument for this is simple: having a puppet state will allow the Iberians to better galvanize resources from the area, whether that be manpower, labor or natural resource extraction. Yet giving any form of concession to the Africans may be met with ridicule from European neighbours. Italy in particular could see this as a sign of weakness and could then push for a strengthened presence in the Meditterenean. However, the flustered Spanish strongman has to make a decision now, the men before him waiting eagerly for a response. Prestige or a decline in efficiency?"
 IBR.6001.a:0 "North Africans should have more autonomy."
 IBR.6001.b:0 "This land is Iberian."
 
 IBR.6002.t:0 "Meeting with Settlers"
 IBR.6002.d:0 "The Iberian settlers in Morocco have met with Franco today in Ceuta, and after Franco delivered a heartwarming and praiseworthy speech, the settlers unceremoniously bombarded our great Caudillo with their grievances and troubles. Over the course of several hours, it became clear that the settlers were agitating for more subsidies from the Iberian government to lessen the burden on them. They agonised, in painstaking detail, the hardships the face in trying to settle the arid deserts of Morocco, from worthless and parched soil in the hinterlands to lack of any honest work in the cities. While it will place further strain on the Iberian economy, it may be advisable to promise them more financial support, even if it is just to keep them quiet and loyal. Either that, or some token and inconsequential gestures to appease them for the remainder of Franco's visit are in order."
 IBR.6002.a:0 "Promise to increase funding."

 #Salazar Military
 
 IBR.6003.t:0 "What to Wear?"
 IBR.6003.d:0 "The old man's face reflected not just the weakening capacity of his tired and overworked body but also his inner fears. As he stared deeply into the mirror, looking for small imperfections just like with his paperwork, he began to brush away a small crease that he must have forgotten to iron out of the military uniform he was wearing. The uniform of the Iberian army. How could he defeat his greatest fear, militarism as personified by his Spanish counterpart, if not by at least trying to shape into something less threatening if not possibly useful? However it spoke against his entire nature and persona he had so carefully crafted over the years. After all was he not the moderate to Franco's delusional grandeur? The question now is should he try to become more of an iron fisted dictator, at least for show, or stick with his usual statesman appearance?"
 IBR.6003.a:0 "A uniform will impress them."
 IBR.6003.b:0 "Stick with the suit."
 
 IBR.6004.t:0 "Several Generals Visibly Offended"
 IBR.6004.d:0 "The grand entrance of Salazar's new persona was about to begin. An important meeting with several key generals of the Iberian armed forces concerning new doctrines and logistics was the perfect place to practice asserting the characteristics of the man he had emulated. As the grand oak doors were opened to the stiff yet resolute Portuguese Caudillo all heads turned to inspect the new entrant. The accompanying soft murmur began to eat at the now very uncomfortable aging statesman as he began to make his way slowly to his seat. A quick scrutiny of the bitter looking faces of the men he was about to address told Salazar all he needed to know about how his gambit had transpired. None would speak out against him openly but his image had now been tarnished considerably."
 IBR.6004.a:0 "Damn it."
 
 IBR.6005.t:0 "The Speech Begins"
 IBR.6005.d:0 "If there was one thing Salazar could always fall back upon it was his eloquence and strength at public speaking. For all his animosity towards Adolf Hitler he still admired his ability to mesmerize and work an audience. The seasoned Caudillo walked slowly towards the podium, all eyes in the room again on him, with the only sound heard coming courtesy of the din of the living city outside the steadfast walls of the palace. As he stepped up to the wooden rostrum he looked down briefly at the collection of notes he held in his hands. He was surprised to see them shake slightly. Age was beginning to get the worse of him. He quickly recovered again, placing both arms first across his chest while surveying the assembled men and then onto the podium itself. He had gained their fixation, and it was time to begin."
 IBR.6005.a:0 "Begin with a promise of further resources."
 IBR.6005.b:0 "Start off with vague platitudes."
 
 IBR.6006.t:0 "On the Issue of Minority Groups"
 IBR.6006.d:0 "The next topic was an uncomfortable one for him to address considering the room he was in. No matter how this would be played he would likely lose. He sighed to himself briefly, then began his tirade against the terrible terrorism that has swept the Union. How these so called freedom fighters dared to undermine the much needed stability of the Iberia, not caring in the slightest about the consequences on real people living their ordinary lives. Clearly these dastardly scum had to be expunged from the nation like the parasites they were. Yet how was this to be done effectively when most of them came from minority groups which currently still enjoyed the protection of the Union? The question of how to approach the next part of his speech was not an easy one for the old man. Should he push for a harsher policy towards minorities in order to safeguard national security, or take a more moderate approach, in the process likely losing a hefty amount of political power to his more hardline Spanish counterpart?"
 IBR.6006.a:0 "They are terrorist sympathizers. A hard line is needed."
 IBR.6006.b:0 "The terrorists do not represent these people."
 
 IBR.6007.t:0 "Transcripts from High Command Meeting Leak"
 IBR.6007.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar had to experience the repurcussions of the largest political flounder he had ever commited following his address on the importance of minority groups in regards to quelling terrorism. Seemingly someone in the high command had committed absolute treachery by leaking his radical views on how to tackle the issue to the public. The poor display had managed to make its way around the country at a terrifying pace despite the best efforts of state censors. Considering the vast majority of the Iberia supported a tough stance on national security due to recent developments in global political affairs he possibly could still spin this to reduce damage to some extent. Yet the views of those minority groups he had talked so poorly of could now not be changed anymore, he had betrayed them for which his political career would bleed heavily."
 IBR.6007.a:0 "A blow to Salazar's popularity among minorities."

 
 #Salazar Church
 
 IBR.6008.t:0 "Salazar Enters Sanctuary of Fatima"
 IBR.6008.d:0 "It was a crisp, clear morning in the Portuguese municipality of Ourém. The white marble running all around the Sanctuary of Fatima reflected the morning sun's brilliance, bathing the plaza in warmth and light. As usual, Salazar's modest motorcade arrived early, and the Caudillo of Portugal found himself with time to burn before his appointment with the Portuguese bishops. Waving off his bodyguards to permit them a cigarette break, Salazar squinted up at the gold-plated cross atop the spire of the central cathedral as he pondered how to go about his discussion with the bishops. It had been some time since he had dealt with the clergy directly, despite their major role in the Estado Novo. Would they be simple, honest men like the ordinary priests he had known growing up, or illustrious and regal figures representative of the Church's wealth and power? What approach would best speak to them, and win them over?"
 IBR.6008.a:0 "Salazar talks about how he once considered becoming a priest."
 IBR.6008.b:0 "Focus on the issues."
 
 IBR.6009.t:0 "Muted Reactions to Personal Anecdotes"
 IBR.6009.d:0 "If Salazar was hoping to find some kind of personal connection in his story of how he ultimately DIDN'T become a priest, he was sorely mistaken. Clearly the bishops had no interest in hearing excerpts from his biography when there were serious matters to take care of. Gritting his teeth and kicking himself mentally by the end of the meeting, Salazar was several shades redder and looked a few years older as he marched back to the limousine afterwards, having gotten nothing out of the discussion besides an embarrassing anecdote about himself."
 IBR.6009.a:0 "Perhaps they were expecting a more substantive conversation."
 
 IBR.6010.t:0 "Bishops Warm Up to Salazar"
 IBR.6010.d:0 ""I had no idea, Senhor Salazar." Bishop Anselmo had said, clearly impressed. "To be so personally invested in the church at such a young age was rare even amongst my own generation. Though you were surely called by God to your vocation, I feel the Church is diminished simply by its inability to count you amongst its servants." If that wasn't the sound of successfully charming his way into the confidence of some of the most influential men in Iberia, Salazar didn't know what was. Despite his age, the chauffeur noticed a confident energy in the Caudillo as he took his seat in the back of the limousine and opened up some light reading.\n\nThe bishops, too, parted ways with Salazar feeling decidedly more relaxed about dealing with the Caudillos in future. Franco had been so... coarse, despite his faith and good intentions. Their own quiet, charismatic countryman was far more agreeable and clearly a reliable brother in Christ. A cordial smile, it seemed, answered far more of their questions than a stack of government pamphlets."
 IBR.6010.a:0 "Salazar has clearly gained trust from the church."
 
 IBR.6011.t:0 "Attempt to Bring up Issues Fails"
 IBR.6011.d:0 "Even Salazar felt himself sweating a little under the collar as the bishops stared at him, stone-faced and dull-eyed. He couldn't tell whether they were annoyed or just plain bored. Whatever the answer, there was little in the way of mutual exchange, with the increasingly weary Caudillo mostly just talking "at" them rather than "with" them. The longest response to any of his statements had been "Yes, Senhor Salazar."\n\nAfter the meeting, as he stood out in the hot sun dabbing at his creased forehead, Salazar found himself grousing out loud to his bodyguards about how obtuse and unhelpful he found these meetings with the clergy. "I'd never get stonewalled by old Father Pedro!" he exclaimed."
 IBR.6011.a:0 "Perhaps they think some bounds have been overstepped."
 
 IBR.6012.t:0 "Bishops Agree With Several of Salazar's Opinions"
 IBR.6012.d:0 ""Which is, of course, why regional particularism is such an issue for us. Regardless of how the people feel about their own nations, we cannot risk a breakdown of the state, as happened to Spain during their civil war."\n\n"Of course, Senhor Salazar," replied Bishop Manuel. He turned to his colleagues. "We are in agreement then, brothers? No support for our regionalist friends?" He was met by a round of nodding.\n\nSalazar smiled broadly, his shoulders finally relaxing. "Then I believe that's everything for today, your eminences. If you'll excuse me, I am due to return to Madrid within the next few hours and must keep to schedule. My secretary here will answer any further questions you may have," he said, gesturing to the cheery-looking, dapper young man beside him. "Until next time, my friends."\n\nScore one for statecraft. Get the right words out there, and men of the cloth are as pliable and easy to understand as any man in the street.

 IBR.6013.t:0 "Choosing a Stage"
 IBR.6013.d:0 "In order to better address the economic situation in Iberia, the Caudillos have opted to host a discussion for business leaders in order to encourage cooperation with the government. Because of his talent for speech, and the predominantly Spanish makeup of the business leaders, Franco was the obvious choice for the job. Hosted at the Westin Palace hotel in Madrid, the function was primarily for business leaders, and brought to their attention specifically. Even though they are the main target, it is not yet too late to hold the speech in a public area.\n\nThere are two locations that are most easily secured for a summit, the main stage of Westin Palace or in a private undisclosed location. Hosting the speech somewhere more private will be an easier job to secure, as well as allowing for only the businessmen to be present. That way, they can be better catered to. The only threat there is of leaks. Alternatively, the speech could be made public, for a larger crowd. This will eliminate any risk of someone compromising secure conversations, and will prevent any unpleasant accusations about the loyalty of the Caudillo. It will cost more to secure the public location, and the speech will have to be broad in tone. Otherwise, some groups could be lost by catering to others. The obvious choice is to..."

 IBR.6014.d:0 "A location has been selected, announced, and set in stone. Franco would be speaking to a large audience, and marketing his ideas to the public, and not just businessmen. This is no time to forget who this is dedicated to, however- just because the speech is more public doesn't mean it isn't for businessmen first and foremost. To this end a new strategy must be devised. No speech is complete without posturing, and can be ruined with the improper application of it. It needs to be decided how the Caudillo will present his ideas to his audience, as to best ensure retention among the businessmen.\n\nThe first, and most obvious, tone is to take that of someone in favor of a free market. It is sure to win over many business owners, as the promise of an environment suited to them is one tantalizing enough that they are sure to be lured in. While this may anger some elements of the government, these can be mostly mitigated by taking a more conservative position on businesses. Alternatively, it has been proposed to take a tough stance on corporations, asserting authority over them. If there is anything they will respect, it is a leader that is willing to take executive authority. What form will the Caudillo's tone take?"

 IBR.6015.t:0 "Making promises?"
 IBR.6015.d:0 "More easily guarded, a private setting was the obvious choice to hold a speech at. Only the higher echelons of businessmen will be actively attending, amounting to a small group. This will make the situation much less formal, allowing for a few targeted incentives to be made. With the public not watching, making assurances becomes far easier, and much less risky.\n\nOnly, it is a conscious choice to make these assurances. If one were to promise to the business leaders that the Iberian economy would get just a touch more free, it could go a long way towards getting their attention. These reforms will nearly ensure their support, if the trouble is taken to address them. However, making what is essentially a bribe for political capital is frowned upon. If it were to be found publically, then it would create new issues. Therefore, the speech could be made vague and simply assuring the targets prosperity and growth. This will not make any particular friends, but on the other hand it would mean the speech would be mostly bulletproof politically. Is the risk worth the potential gain?"

The summit itself seemed to be winding down, and as it prepared to end and everyone to go home, something of interest occurred. A group of highly influential businessmen, introducing themselves by rank, have shuffled their way into Franco's notice. Introducing it by scraps and pieces, they construct an offer for the Caudillo.\n\nCorporate profits are fair, but they are not as fair as they could be. The Iberian government has the means to fix this error, and they may do so very easily. All it would take is recognition of the superiority of the companies in question. Since they are more powerful than the rest, then they ought to be better appreciated for what they do to the country. As it would happen, some of the resources Iberia would save by helping them could be used as reciprocation. It is an easy decision, they say. All that support, for just a little bit of favor..."

Someone present at the meeting between the Caudillo and the council of businessmen took a recording, and has only leaked it a few days later. Anonymously shared, it is hard to tell if the guilty party was a traitorous guard or a man hiding a recorder in his suitcase. Who did it matters little now, as they cannot be readily found.\n\nWhen it was leaked, it was especially directed towards the press. Being the predatory vultures they are, they took the bait and published it sky-high. Now the information cannot be stopped, so the whole country is scrutinizing Franco for his seeming corruption. Most crucially are the intelligentsia, who feel betrayed that a leader would resort to such hypocritical means for little of actual value. The bureaucrats feel the same way as well, drifting more towards Salazar - who is seen as a far more upstanding example of a politician."

 #Salazar Intellectuals (Book)
 
 IBR.6018.t:0 "The Genre"
 IBR.6018.d:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar has recently finished writing his first book after over thirty years of political experience, first at the head of the Estado Novo regime, and now as one of the Caudillos of Iberia. During this time he has surmounted many challenges, both political and personal in nature, and he has drawn on this wealth of experience in creating this masterpiece of Iberian Literature. Painstakingly dictated to his secretary over the course of several months, the first draft is ready to be composed. Salazar however has yet to decide what to keep and what to cut from this unwieldy transcript, ever so diligently copied out and perfected by his assistants.\n\nTwo directions to take the book in have been suggested to him by his close associates, that of a manifesto of his own political beliefs, or an autobiography of his personal struggles during his life. Salazar himself has expressed that a political statement to guide the Iberian people would be an apt legacy for him to leave behind, but the idea of an inspiring personal epic appeals to him greatly as well. With the Caudillo remaining indecisive, and papers continuing to pile up on his desk, it may be pragmatic to convince him to make a final decision. What should it be?"
 IBR.6018.a:0 "A manifesto of Salazar's political philosophy."
 IBR.6018.b:0 "An autobiography detailing Salazar's personal struggles."
 
 IBR.6019.t:0 "The Content"
 IBR.6019.d:0 "With the genre of the Caudillo's new book having been decided upon, Salazar's secretary and his assistants have religiously prepared suitable extracts from the initial transcript over the course of a few weeks, every extract having been chosen for its particularly inspiring and powerful advice, vivid descriptions of Salazar's experiences or Salazar's enlightened political philosophy. Salazar has so far been delighted with the choices presented to him by his assistants, but has yet to decide on specifically what he wants in the book, whether it is to be a personal and heartfelt book, aimed at imparting Salazar's enthusiasm and advice to the reader in order to rouse the Iberian people to greater things, or to be a ceremonious and authoritative text containing Salazar's prescriptions for society, aimed at safeguarding the Iberian state, guiding the politicans of tomorrow and preserving the legacy he has painstakingly worked to build during his time in office.\n\nEither way, the Caudillo doesn't seem to be rushing to make a decision, and the book has taken up enough official time as is. Salazar should be encouraged to choose the passages he wants to include in his masterpiece post-haste, as not only do state papers lie on Salazar's desk unread, and urgent bureaucratic work left untouched, but the second Caudillo Francisco Franco himself is becoming concerned with Salazar's apparent idleness. A decision must be made."

 IBR.6020.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 IBR.6020.d:0 "Now that the Caudillo has decided on the specific contents of his book, he has one final decision to make before this paragon of Iberian literature can be sent to the printing presses. A conclusion has yet to be written, and Salazar is torn between concluding that it will be the educated elite that will guide Iberia towards a bright and proud future, or that it will be the common Iberian toiling away that will bring about a golden age for the Iberian people.\n\nWhile favouring the intelligentsia would most likely cement Salazar's book as his magnum opus and possibly increase the loyalty of the intellectuals to the Caudillo, concluding that the common people will determine the future of Iberia could help to foster wider support for the regime, as well as cynically generating a larger profit for the publisher and himself to pocket. Salazar however is more concerned with its popular reception than what a few jumped up toffs think, and while it will be a difficult and lengthy series of arguments needed to convince him of the political benefits of dedicating it to Iberian intellectuals, it may be expedient to make him see this point of view. Alternatively, letting Salazar have his way is surely the quicker route to publication, and more importantly, back to work for Salazar. What should he be convinced to conclude the book with?"
 IBR.6020.a:0 "A declaration that the educated will guide Iberia towards a great future."
 IBR.6020.b:0 "A declaration that the common Iberian will lead the way towards a great future."
 
 IBR.6021.t:0 "Intellectuals Impressed by Salazar's Manifesto"
 IBR.6021.d:0 "Salazar's political manifesto has been met with great acclaim within the intellectual community since being published, as the wise ruler expected it would be. His work received not only favourable reviews from Iberian literary groups and authors, but also internationally his book has also been received well, especially in neighbouring Italy, and to a lesser extent in America, with most copies having been bought by a minority of NPP members. The only frankly minor criticism voiced by the intellectuals is that it might be a little too high brow for the masses, but that doesn't seem to bother Salazar, who appears to be content with the other praise he has received.\n\nUniversally, his theories and guidance have been praised as comprehensive and well thought out, with the rhetoric and ideological dogma usually found in political literature to be mostly absent. Iberian scholars agree that it has a clear vision for society under Salazarian ideals, and some have even written to the Caudillo to express their support for the society envisaged in his book, an occurrence that greatly pleased him. There has yet to be a particularly critical or scathing review of Salazar's work, most likely because the ideas and content are simply indisputable of course, not that there are any other reasons for no one speaking up. Overall, Salazar is incredibly pleased with himself and the book he has worked tirelessly to create, and now he can finally focus on official work once more."
 IBR.6021.a:0 "Recognition from the Iberian intelligentsia is highly appreciated."
 
 IBR.6022.t:0 "Salazar's Book Gets Lackluster Response"
 IBR.6022.d:0 "Much to the dismay of Salazar, his book has been a complete flop both domestically and internationally! No intellectual of significance anywhere, let alone in Iberia has commented positively of his work, with it most commonly being described as "confused, unfocused literary mess" by the Iberian intelligentsia. Not only have intellectuals described the book as a muddled and tangled web of political ideas and personal experiences, but they have also said the ideas included are vague and difficult to digest and the experiences are particularly tedious affairs, and at some points painfully boring to read through according to one particularly scathing reviewer. The common Iberian has also found the book hard to engage, citing many similar criticisms that the intellectuals have expressed, though quite often in much coarser words. Francisco Franco of course has endorsed his fellow ruler's work, though it seems more out of professional courtesy than for its own merit.\n\nPoor sales and a bad reception make it unlikely for the publisher to agree to a second production run of the book, and Salazar is reportedly distraught to see the sale price of his work in shop windows be struck down lower and lower as the proprietors try to make at least some return on their purchased stock. For now it seems, Salazar's career as an author has come to an abrupt end, and the Caudillo has been left greatly disheartened and bitter by the whole affair."

 IBR.6023.d:0 "Only a week after being officially published, Salazar's new book has sold out. Demand for his inspirational personal epic has far outstripped supply, and a second production run is already being organised to cover the shortfall in copies. Reportedly, the personal perspective of the book and its inspiring life advice has found a receptive audience within the lower and middle class, and a newfound respect and sympathy for the premier has been fostered.\n\nNot only has the Caudillo's office been inundated with letters of praise from across Iberia, a whole series of spontaneous patriotic celebrations have broken out in Portugal. Street parties complete with overhead banners and fireworks have clogged Lisbon's streets for several days now, having quickly assembled after the last copy sold out in the city. The same phenomenon was repeated across several of the larger towns, and while some have suggested that this was not entirely natural, Salazar has dismissed these hearsay accusations and is content to bask in the popular acclaim being afforded to him.\n\nFellow Caudillo Franco also has apologized in private to Salazar over his misgivings about his publication, after acknowledging the increase in popular support for Salazar. The success of his work has far surpassed Salazar's own private expectations, and what he initially self-proclaimed as a masterpiece is now undoubtedly regarded as a cornerstone of Iberian literature by popular decree."

Official statements, however, hail the proposed events as a turning point in Iberia's current political and economic fortunes, dismissing the criticism as pointless fearmongering.\n\nThe elderly dictator's first visit would be to the education ministry. In the run up to the day lobbyists have been arguing for more funding to increase Iberian standards of education both in order to help the national economy while providing better employment opportunities and to help the Union better compete on the global stage.

Terrorists, anti-unionists, nationalists, and republicans have forced us to the very edge of life and death.\n\nFranco sat silently, frustrated but knowing that it needed to be done. He could no longer maintain that same optimism he once had. No matter the memories he had along Madrid, with Portuguese and Spanish troops fighting alongside to fend off the foreigners who were holding the very core of the nation as hostage, no matter the memories of bonding, the smiles and the cheer from everyone from Cádiz all the way to Navarra...\n\nIt had to be done. And so, it would seem, Portugal would leave the Union on the 1st of April. For a country he so loved would part itself into the sea, like a pearl, never to be grasped and held against the bosom of the Spanish nation, never to be forced to meld through whatever artificial dams would force them together, for it would be the last time the sea would ever kiss the sand, it would be the last time Iberia could be whole.\n\n"Goodbye, and for all that it is worth, I am sorry.""

The body was quickly removed for an autopsy and burial, but the knowledge of his death managed to quickly escape the circle of secrecy that it was intended to remain in until the Iberian government can come up with an official story. Already, numerous underground forces within the Union are mobilizing, and worrying rumors of sedition within the Portuguese state have come to our attention.\n\nWith keeping the beloved Caudillo's death a secret being no longer an option, Iberian authorities must put all of their resources in play in order to keep the Union stable. Already, tanks have been spotted moving down roads in Lisbon, and martial law has been declared in several regions in Portugal.\n\nCaudillo Franco and Salazar's designated successor, Marcello José das Neves Alves Caetano, have already condemned any forces conspiring to take advantage of Salazar's death, but it does not appear that this will provide a conclusive end to the political chaos in Portugal. It appears that the only thing left to do is crack down as hard as possible, and divert every possible resource to ensuring the Union stays together."

While news of rioting and upheaval are coming in droves out of the region, Lisbon has entirely ceased communications with Madrid.\n\nThis however sadly was not the only concern. Other groups which had previously been hostile to the Iberian government have also taken this opportunity of crisis to break out in rebellion. Insurgents have been reported in a variety of Spanish cities. Their goal, unlike the Portuguese call for representation, was not entirely clear.\n\nIt was obvious to the Caudillo that Portugal would have to be suppressed on a large scale, but now even his own nation was wasting away around him. Traitors in his own ranks were making themselves visible. Previous Iberian loyalists who had seen their chance to change the system through working inside it had also lost hope when Franco had refused to cede ground to the opposition. Realizing that now the superstructure they had wanted could only be achieved through other means they as well have taken up arms against the new dictatorship.

On the other hand, the Portuguese team argues that this very reason, the disproportion of military industry, means Portugal should get more equipment than Spain, since Spain could quickly make up the difference once Iberia is no longer on the map.\n\nBoth teams have been arguing about this matter for days now and if the government wants to make sure Iberia is gone before the end of time, it seems like it must intervene and force a decision; since no team is willing to reach an agreement."

While there are many who would use the instability to advance the cause of their own ethnic group, there are also plenty of loyal citizens who wish to keep our union intact.

Usually, these are mere blips on the radar, but sometimes something extraordinary comes from it, like the shared Conquistador pride, or the fact that both the Portuguese and Spanish have a hatred for Moors.\n\nAnd sometimes...these attempts end in disaster.\n\nIt all started off as a well meaning collaboration between the Lisbon and Madrid art guilds, in the hopes of producing a piece of art that symbolized the unity of Spain and Portugal. After some deliberation, the artists agreed that their project would consist of a giant mural displaying what they hoped to be "Iberia's new national animal". Taking the Spanish bull and the Portuguese rooster as pieces of inspiration, the artists slaved away day and night to create a masterpiece.\n\nUnfortunately, when it was finally unveiled before a crowd two weeks later, the reactions were less than stellar. The finished product, which for some reason ended up being a mixed up amalgamation of rooster and cow body parts with seven pairs of horns and at least three heads, immediately earned the ire of the entire nation that they were trying to appeal to. Described by onlookers variably as "an abomination", a "piece of vomit-inducing graffiti that wouldn't pass in an American art school", and "proof that Jesus died in vain".\n\nTo make matters worse, the "Iberian Chimera", as it has now been dubbed, was leaked to the international community, where in many countries it seems to have caught on immediately.

We can return to El Prado now..." Franco stared down at his personal orderly as to indicate any further insistence on the matter would get him re-assigned to the Western Sahara. Fearing the television cameras had caught the change in his facial expression, the horse-bound Caudillo turned his face to the sky.\n\nAs the funeral march crossed the Iberian internal border, the expressions of grief became more intense, entire towns went out to see the coffin of the man who had determined Portugal's destiny for forty-two years. Carmen had told Franco that riding on horseback for the 500 km would be inadvisable for a man of 75, but he did not care. Once they reached the late Caudillo's hometown of Vimieiro, Franco remembered reading about his appointment as finance minister at the last page of a newspaper in 1926, receiving his congratulations ten years after, fighting with him over Spanish intervention during war, negotiations over the union, his calming him down during the Atlantropa disaster. Franco's heart sunk in a way it had not since his youth. Now, however, was not the time for that.

Great united struggle against the red subversion... decent and hardworking man with a sense of humor."\n\nFranco could not stop himself from thinking about the man: He had been his rival, a massive pain whenever he got any of his holier-than-thou ideas through, that was for certain. He could feel his skin being burned by the intensity of the camera set-ups at the cathedral as he moved on to finish the speech.\n\n"But most of all... " The Caudillo sniffed ever so quietly, as the sentiments overwhelmed the carefully practiced emulation that he'd adopted, and his real, squeaky Galician voice took control.\n\n"He was my friend."\n\nNo-one outside Iberia paid much attention to what he said, talk in the foreign media was all about speculating on what sort of ailment he was suffering from for him to be wearing his characteristic sunglasses indoors."

 #AAS Operative Chain

 IBR.3101.d:0 "The countryside outside of Girona was unremarkable. With golden fields below, and gray, cloudy skies above, two absolute colors clashed, occasionally interrupted by the passing landmark. Guillermo was not the one driving, and the case he had been set on was light enough to only take him and his partner, Alejandro. The AAS undercover vehicle could feasibly fit four more people, though there were not going to be that many arrests.\n\n"Rules of contact?" asked his partner loudly.\n\n"Possible nonviolent, talk first, violent, shoot first, use careful discretion. This is possible nonviolent, so keep our guns holstered and allow the senior agent - you - to do the talking." his partner snickered. "What?"\n\n"Oh, nothing, Guillermo. It's just funny to see you new agents so diligent about textbook shit."\n\nAfter a while longer on the road, the two men found themselves at their location. A man, printing newspapers out of his garage. Not only did he clearly engage in the act of unauthorized self-publishing, the newspapers were also in Catalan. They most certainly were printed as separatist agitation - even though neither Axencia operative could read the language, they were sure all the same. The two men took several copies of the newspapers, destroyed his printing press, and drove off with the agitator in handcuffs.\n\nWhen he came home that night, Guillermo reflected over his first day as an AAS operative. The agents at the office would handle the case from now on using their evidence and testimony, but the process would be parallel to the traditional justice system. Such was the decree of the Caudillos following the horrific Battle of Barcelona. Despite its flaws, Guillermo understood the necessity of the measures, and promised himself he would do what he could in the name of justice going forward."

 IBR.3102.d:0 "The two Axencia operatives walked into the San Sebastián elementary school, their boots thumping on the floor as they walked. Guillermo had a gun, though he kept it holstered. Drawing a gun in school would be a disaster. His partner, Alejandro, the senior agent, was carrying a truncheon. While arresting someone as they were teaching a class was poor timing, they had been ordered to bring the man in as soon as possible.\n\nThe two men entered the classroom. "You are under arrest for nationalist agitation," said Alejandro, repeating his mantra in a practiced monotone. He had no sense of subtlety. As his partner wrestled the teacher onto the desk, handcuffed him, and struggled him out of the door, it fell on Guillermo to cover for the children.\n\n"Ah..." he looked at them, stepped towards the door, and gave them a small speech. "Your teacher was a Basque separatist! That means he tried to destroy Iberia. Look out for anyone who does the same!" His words were drowned out by the sounds of thrashing and screams from the hallway outside the classroom.\n\nAs they led the now bloodied and bruised man out of the building, Guillermo stumbled on a doorframe, falling down the steps of the entrance. "What the hell? Pay attention to your surroundings, clumsiness could be the end of you some day!" The junior operative, still in a daze, picked himself up and apologized.\n\nOn their way back to the station, Guillermo stared out the passenger seat of the AAS undercover car. The children. Their faces of horror watching someone they knew being removed by force. Their fear hearing the pounding and screams from the hallway. He had skimmed the teacher's profile before the mission, he was no violent criminal. He did not deserve this.\n\nBreaking the silence, his unfazed partner began to chuckle..."

 IBR.3105.d:0 "Every few minutes, Adolfo could hear gunshots in the distance. His city was on fire, and sandbags lined the streets below his apartment just as it was 26 years ago. The world was different then. Adolfo had once seen a great future for the Iberian proletariat, an almost sacred struggle against the Fascists and Monarchists who sought to destroy the meager progress the Republic had made. But now, as the CNT once again faced off against Nationalist soldiers in the streets of Barcelona, he understood that that dream was dead. Perhaps, in another world, the Revolution could have succeeded. But not in this one.\n\nAdolfo opened his closet, removing a small pile of clothing to find a small latch on the bottom. He opened a secret cache, memories of decades long past. There was his 'Tigre' rifle, the weapon he had used in his first and only kill. A weapon he had imagined he would use many times again resisting Francoist domination after the fall of the republic, but never did. He moved the rifle slightly to reveal an old black-and-white photograph underneath it. There he was, on the left hand of the image. A few inches shorter than the other young men with him. His facial hair had not yet grown in. He was holding his rifle and smiling. With him were four comrades, all of whom he remembered well. Ramón, who could make anyone laugh even at the worst of times. Shot by a sniper in January of 1939. Manuel, a brilliant student and equally brilliant fighter. Told Adolfo he was running away to France and was never heard from again. Sara, the girl with glasses that he could not help but imagine one day marrying. Captured by the Francoist regime shortly after the war, and never seen again. Asunción, the childhood friend that had convinced Adolfo to take up arms. Also captured and never seen again. What had his battles really accomplished? And what did the young revolutionaries in the streets now expect to happen?"

Some of the older men have shared the stories they've heard about the Rif War, the oppressive heat, the constant threat of fighting a foe which seemed to disappear like ghosts into the desert sands. We are lucky the Italians don't seem half as skilled as the Rifians the Legion fought so long ago.\n\nWe are continuously on the move, watching the emptiness for any sign of FLN or Italian activity. Combat comes almost as a relief after days of patrolling the desert, but the worst of it happens when we fight alongside our Pied-Noir allies. While they may be able soldiers, their brutality, and treatment of those unlucky to fall enough into captivity is something that I will never be able to forget.\n\nI look forward to the day when I can leave this blasted desert. Our unit is supposed to be rotated out within six weeks at most, hopefully in time for our anniversary. We will be on the offensive soon and I will not be able to write to you for some time. I promise to do everything in my power to ensure that I make it home in one piece.

Whatever upgrades the Federal Government might have afforded for the old cruiser, they would not make up for the fact she was built to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Her 203mms might scare unruly natives, but they certainly would not stand up to anything the Italian navy had to offer. Saturnino tried to relax, there was little risk of attack while in Oran, where his squadron was well under the protection of coastal batteries.\n\nThe captain eyed the Portugese landing ship two hundred meters to his right with increasing anxiety, hoping that it would deliver the last batch of tanks to the expeditionary brigade so he could get on his way back to Gibraltar. Ironically, he thought, the LCPL was a former Italian ship - one could tell by the design. That idiot Salazar bought it second hand, and the seaman was sure the Caudillo had paid more than it was really worth. Nevertheless, it got the job done, and the last Ibíce was rolling out its cargo hold and into the dock within thirty minutes, albeit in reverse. Saturnino, satisfied with his job, gave the order to leave the port...\n\n"Mi Capitán!" The anxious engineer's screech couldn't mean anything good, he could feel it in his bones. "We... thought it was an error, but the Cervero has picked up the same signal." Looking at the radar screen from afar, Saturnino spotted the approaching blips. "Shit."

Remember, hit the landing ships, don't waste your bombs on... shit." It was already too late, Martionetti and Frigerio were on a vector straight towards the Canarias, and their FIATs sped right past Lombardi's. Unsurprisingly, he could not reach them by radio. "Technical difficulties, my ass." Once they return from the raid he would get them court-martialled, their insubordination could cost the entire operation.\n\nStruggling to keep his composure, Captain Saturnino was fixated on the black puffs that perpetually missed their targets, if ever so slightly. By now, the 203mms had been aimed, but the plane's approach was too difficult to... two of them were breaking off. The captain threw himself at the cruiser's intercom, virtually stapling his hand to the "talk" button while holding his binoculars with the other. "Gunnery Officer Perez... RANGED SHOT AT 200 METERS steady... ELEVATION 36°... steady." He could spot the muzzle flashes from the Italian's 20mm cannons, and soon, the ship's hull was taking their lead. It was inaccurate at that range, but it might make a lesser captain keep his head down. No, not him, not a de la Hidalga. "NOW." The main battery went off in a heap of powder.\n\n"FRIGERIO YOU FUCKING IMBECILE." Lombardi cried in desperation as the airman's left wing was destroyed by shrapnel from the Canarias. Marionetti managed to pull out, but sure enough, he passed over the dock and an Iberian MANPAD disintegrated his plane within a few seconds.

"Never was a good trade for it, not after we turned thousands of our boys into buzzard feed," Franco grumbled.\n\n"It" laid next to the liquor bottle obtained from Salazar's private stores: a piece of paper, letter size, office-white and pristine but for intricate calligraphy at its center flanked by two crests. Salazar bore no children - but Franco swore he entered their office cradling the treaty's cover page like it were his newborn babe.\n\n"Now now," Salazar replied, "don't be so harsh on yourself that you'd overlook victory for small defeats. Iberia has won its greatest war since the Anti-Bolshevik Crusade. Algeria has been made whole, its Iberians made safe by those men. Our faith paid off in spades, Francisco; what's not worth celebrating over some wine?"\n\n"Speaking of faith." Franco paused to quaff from his glass. Warm, sweet wine blazed a path from palette to stomach. "You've been heaping plenty on the French madman and his cohort of thugs."\n\n"Show me someone who said he did nothing to win the war for us and I'll show you a liar.

What light was cast against the lurking shadows gathered around Salazar's tremulant, hunched back came from incandescent cathode ray tubes flashing grainy Technicolor images and transmitting grainy noise at Iberia's two most powerful men. One choked a sob as a rocking chair swayed him back and forth.\n\nThe other lit a cigar. Tiny embers and speckles of ash struck out against the blue glow of breaking news cascading from La 1's high rise offices in Madrid. Pleasure yachts and cruise liners alike cramped with huddled, panicked refugees from bow to stern. Docks along Iberia's new coast creaking under tonnage above and beyond what they were rated. Riots in Barcelona, Lisbon, Córdoba. Mutinies. All washed past the caudillo as a waterfall's torrent rushes past an outcrop. He was a cliff wizened with age; conflict only polished his edges to their old sheen.\n\nIt was these edges which Franco breathed out in smoky wisps. "Though I believe we could have reasoned with the Italians," he said to no one. Had the caudillo not glanced to his right, he would not have caught Salazar turning rigid for a split-second. Franco stifled a sigh. Time for Plan B.\n\nA calloused hand nudged his Portuguese colleague back to their dimly lit office, earning him baleful, bloodshot eyes atop heavy purple bags. Franco jerked his head at the TV screen. The Spaniard's next words fell like a rockslide: grave, gravely, and to the point."

"I've been wondering why for a week now," he grumbled. Raising a withered fist in the air Salazar continued, "Then I remember only I gave more than a damn about Algeria in this Godforsaken country-!" Threadbare tendons and brittle bone cracked against varnished hardwood, and the Portuguese strongman cursed as he cradled his self-inflicted injury close to his chest.\n\n"And I wanted Andalusians for my Morita. Can't have everything in the world, so she settled for a car." Franco turned back to the TV set, just in time for the special program RTI devoted to the armistice and the establishment of the Mandate of Algeria. That newsmen can now present their scripts in moving screens mere moments after worthwhile stories unfold - it always amazed the old Spaniard whenever he entertained the thought. "The same goes for the Italians and our citizens in the new Mandate, just with a little more trust. They don't like terrorists any more than we do."\n\n"We're caudillos, Francisco. Requisition a pack of asses and the Guardia will have them herded outside the Cortes by noon."\n\nThe broadcast droned on while Franco considered his reply.

Nonetheless, from an adjacent hall, Empar beamed, dashing toward the opening. Her son was finally back from his weeklong fishing expedition out in the salt wastes of Costa del Azahar. Without a thought, she pulls him into as much of a deep embrace as her aging arms can manage. However, as she is about to gush about her pride in him, she looks into his eyes and only sees disappointment, bitterness, and despair.\n\n"Diego!", a cracking voice full of joy rang out at the far end of the hall, either unaware of the somber mood or not caring, just happy that his brother's back.\n\n"Hey, José...", Diego forces his chapped lips into a pained smile as José's sprouting legs come sprinting toward the doorway, launching him into an even deeper and more suffocating embrace. "How many hauls did you catch this week?", he asks, prompting water to come flowing back out of Diego's eyes.\n\n"Three", he finally croaks as his throat swells up. Three hauls. Twenty years ago, his father would have caught three hauls in an hour. Every month, it seems like the sea runs further east and her yields grow worse. At this rate, they will run out of money to pay expenses and be evicted from their dying village within the year. Empar gazed forlornly at the rows of empty villas outside and the endless expanse of white, dusty earth where the Mediterranean used to be.

 IBR.3114.d:0 "The Palace of the Cortes could be an eerie place. Footsteps echoed off the wall, and the palace was empty. A creepy sort of empty. Minister of Agriculture Rafael Duque could only hope that nobody watched too closely as he entered the chamber late and took a seat in the front row. The chamber felt almost like a lecture hall, recalling old memories from the years just before the Union's founding.\n\nHe looked around the chamber. Caudillos Salazar and Franco, and another man whom Duque could not quite remember the name of, were seated at the front of the chamber, facing the council. Seated on the front row were 7 other Portuguese ministers and 8 Spanish ministers. Besides them in the second row were 14 men whom he either knew poorly or did not recognize at all. Among them were Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, General Agustín Muñoz Grandes, Professor José Sánchez Asiaín, and industrialist José Manuel de Mello. In total, 2 Caudillos, 16 government ministers, and 14 representatives of Iberia's most important economic, security, and academic interests. Them, and whoever it was sitting beside the Caudillos.\n\n"Good evening, gentlemen." began that man, standing from his seat to speak from the podium. "I, Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel, am pleased to inaugurate this first session of the Iberian Council. The honorable Caudillos, Francisco Franco and Antonio Salazar, have honored me with the title of President of the Council."\n\n"The terrible attack on the Municipal Palace of Coruña has demonstrated the vulnerability of the Union in its present state. As we develop proposals for the future course of Iberia, our Caudillos shall have the time to carry out their executive duties. By lending advice to the Caudillos, we ensure cooperation between Portuguese and Spanish officials and coordinate the policy of the Union. At this time, I recognize Caudillo Salazar, who will deliver remarks on the situation in the Far East."\n\nThe first Council Session lasted for 5 hours, as Salazar held a blunt, strategic discussion on Portugal's stolen colonies in Goa and Timor. In the meeting Salazar was free to discuss the world as he saw it, ordering councilors to develop plans to achieve his vision. Democracy this was certainly not, but even councilors more sympathetic to reform were pleased with the streamlining of the government decision-making process."

They sat in two chairs on either side of the podium, each embroidered with the Coat of Arms of their respective nations.\n\nA few seconds passed in near silence, then Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel emerged from behind the curtains to take the stand. "Assembled Officials, Ministers and Soldiers, Peoples of Iberia" he began, "By the joint mandate of Caudillo Franco and Caudillo Salazar, I, Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel, am honored to call to order the first session of the Council of the Iberian Union!" Loud Cheers filled not only the Palace Chamber, but residences across the peninsula, as men, women, and children watched and listened to the heavily publicized proceedings live on television and radio.\n\nValcárcel praised the Union for its success in preserving peace, stability, and security, over the past several years. At the same time, he acknowledged the problems that had come to plague Iberia--political gridlock, a slowing economy, and rising tensions. The council, Valcárcel explained, had been designed by the ingenious Caudillos specifically to solve these problems, to foster a greater sense of Iberian brotherhood, and give the common people a greater voice in their governance.\n\nFranco was ever diligent in perfecting the management of Iberia's economy and its government institutions. Salazar had valiantly taken to work to protect Iberia from foreign threats following the callous betrayal by Iberia's supposed Italian and Turkish allies. Valcárcel himself was to be the President of the Council, tasked with organizing and conducting the proceedings, serving as the primary representative of the Caudillos.\n\nThe speech would last for only around twenty minutes, but would be ingrained in the collective consciousness of the Iberian people for years to come.

 IBR.3116.d:0 "Franco stood before an anxious audience, few if any of whom felt comfortable knowing that they were now involved in the response to the worst act of terrorism in the history of the Union. "Gentlemen," he began, "I will not lie to you. We were unprepared for this week's attack. Our intelligence community failed to recognize the scale of the planned operations, and our police and military were not ready to make a decisive and immediate response. We cannot allow any attack like this to happen again.\n\nWe have long known that a small underground CNT resistance persisted ever since the liberation of Catalonia 25 years ago. This morning the Iberian Intelligence Center prepared a detailed report on documented acts of homicide, assault, and arson linked to the CNT, showing that in the past seven years CNT violence has been increasing yearly. The failure of our government to recognize and react to the rise of this terrorist activity is damning. It should not have taken a tragedy as severe as Barcelona to formulate a response.\n\nIn addition to their comprehensive review of CNT activities since the Union's formation, the Intelligence Center has identified several extremist organizations which have escalated their activity, emboldened by the CNT's actions in Barcelona. Already last evening, a security officer was attacked in Bilbao by a 23-year-old extremist Jimeno Inchausti. In his interrogation, Inchausti admitted that he had not worked alone, but was part of a network of Basque-separatists calling themselves 'Euskadi Ta Askatasuna'. Between 1950 and 1963, only 15 murders could be linked to extremist groups besides the CNT. However, in just this past month, no fewer than 7 such acts of violence have taken place--4 in Navarra, 2 in Portugal, and 1 in Asturias.\n\nIt is all but certain that these terrorist groups will expand their resources and intensify their activities in the coming months. Increased funding and supplies will need to be provided to our military and intelligence services to identify and eliminate these groups. Eliminating terrorism needs to be the primary goal of all government officials, and all actions taken must consider potential effects on terrorists' ability to undermine Iberia's unity.""

"Councilors, we are engaged in a struggle for the very spirit of Iberia. For the union to survive, your service is urgently needed. Caudillo Franco and Caudillo Salazar have ordered new legislation to provide the Axencia Anti-Separatista the power and resources necessary to fully eliminate the leftist threat. Iberia cannot afford a government divided by factionalism or language, by politics or geography. Her council must stand united against terrorism!\n\nEven as they applauded, many councilors were deeply nervous. Never in the history of Iberia had so many people been tasked with as important a task to complete in such a short timeframe. Murmurs filled the Palace after Valcárcel's speech.

In this role, Fraga will lead a remewed, more organized effort to combat extremist propaganda.

I give the floor to Don Fraga."\n\n"Thank you, my Caudillo," began Fraga, "Good evening, gentlemen. As we attempt to bring an end to terrorism in Iberia, the terrorists have adapted new tactics, and new strategies to win over those vulnerable to their messages. In Girona last week, a group of CNT members briefly hijacked the city's largest radio station, preaching absurd anti-government conspiracies to thousands of people. Our battle against terrorism is just as much a battle against propaganda, and if we are to succeed in our mission we need to organize and expand our own media outreach efforts. The terrorists' propaganda is specifically designed to inflame regional tensions, and speak primarily to disaffected young men."\n\n"If we are to succeed against terrorism, we need to target their recruiting grounds. The new Ministry of Information will devote the majority of its efforts to the regions and cities where terrorists are most active, with media messaging focused on reminding people of the great things the Caudillos have done for them, instilling fear in anyone who would think to oppose our security forces, and removing the 'mystique' of terrorist groups, turning them from subjects of fear and fascination into subjects of disgust and mockery.""

As the only Basque economist on the Iberian Council, Mariñelarena had frequently involved himself in discussions regarding the growth of terrorist activity in the region. He held the controversial belief that, though the Basque Country overall was among the wealthiest regions in Iberia, the rapid economic changes in the past decade were nonetheless significant factors in the growth of separatist extremism. As Valcárcel concluded his introductory remarks, he listened carefully to hear the full details of the bill Manuel Fraga, newly appointed Minister of Information, was about to introduce.\n\n"Gentlemen, I am pleased to report that in just this past week, the Axencia Anti-Separatista uncovered and destroyed a large ETA weapons cache near Vitoria, and arrested 12 terrorist plotters in Tarragona." Fraga paused while his audience cheered. "Though the seizure of weapons and arrest of conspirators are vital to the Union's security and these recent victories are significant, our media efforts are just as critical. A cache of ten thousand guns means nothing without as many terrorists to hold them, which is why I am putting forth a bill to increase funding to the AAS Information Office by 50%, to enable the AAS to purchase radio and television ad-space at greatly a reduced price, and to initiate a thorough review of the history textbooks used in secondary and tertiary schools to identify and remove Separatist-sympathetic content." Even before Fraga gave the specific details of this bill, the loud applause made it obvious to everyone in the chamber that it would pass overwhelmingly. In the end, only five councilors of the 480 present voted Nay: All hardline conservatives objecting to what they perceived as a 'soft' and useless method to combat terrorism.\n\nMariñelarena joined the applause, and voted in favor of the bill. But though he both publicly and privately supported the bill's aims, he was frustrated. He already had to worry about paranoid conservatives suspecting that he was sympathetic to the separatists on account of his origin. There was only so much he could feel comfortable suggesting that Iberia's economic policy contributed to radicalization."

Information Minister Manuel Fraga stood at his left, and respected Law Professor and councilor Torcuato Fernández-Miranda stood at his right. Strangers before the council's formation, these three men had become increasingly close in the past few months. Occasionally the three were spotted at a cafe together, and often they supported the same initiatives in the Council. Tonight, though, was the most blatant showing of their informal alliance. Ullastres began a speech which had been co-written by himself and the other two councilors.\n\n"In recent months, the efforts taken by our Caudillos, the military, police, and intelligence to combat terrorism have successfully crushed numerous plots. Nonetheless, public support for the regime has faltered in the face of disappointing economic growth, in addition to the lingering fear of terrorism and crime. If we are to maintain the goodwill of the Iberian people, it is vital that in addition to our expansions to the security apparatus, we expand our domestic institutions.\n\nThe small-scale poverty relief programs in the Iberian Union result in most of the unemployed suffering from poor living conditions, and in a handful of the poorest communities malnutrition continues to stain our Union. We are here today to introduce for discussion a detailed plan to combat poverty and expand public support for the government, while continuing to protect the status of the firms that form the backbone of the Iberian economy."\n\nOver the next several hours, the council discussed and at times debated over the viability of the new plans. While broad support could be reached for a few programs, particularly the proposed reforms to Seguridad Social, others proved highly controversial. At one point, an argument between Manuel Fraga and Rafael Duque became so heated that Franco himself intervened to bring the council back to order.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly likely that the next few months will see significant changes to Iberia's domestic policy, but exactly which changes will be made and which will be rejected remains unclear. In any case, after today's discussion nobody can deny either the existence or the significance of the collaboration between Ullastres, Fraga, and Fernández-Miranda, increasingly referred to by other councilors as..."

The Iberian council was still young, its members inexperienced, and the powers and limitations of the new legislature not entirely clear. Nonetheless, the Council prevailed through its first crisis, quickly drafting and passing legislation to better combat terrorists wherever they were to be found.\n\nThe Iberian Council has been tested, and it has passed its test. Few still doubt that the new legislature could solve at least some of the problems facing the Union. Perhaps, then, it is no surprise that mere weeks after Barcelona several members of the Council's reformist faction have launched initiatives to overhaul various elements of the Iberian legal system and government policy.\n\nThe "Ullastres Plan" and "Fernández-Miranda Plan", as they are informally known, have gained significant traction within the Legislature. Both plans are several hundred pages long, composed by dozens of authors, and advocate radical transformations to Iberian law and fiscal policy. The "Ullastres Plan" focuses on centralizing the government, rationalizing the administrative structure, and eliminating corruption, while the "Fernández-Miranda Plan" is focused on expanding social welfare, clarifying the definition and rights given to citizens, thereby ensuring the loyalty of the Iberian people.\n\nThe reform faction is all but unanimous in their support for both plans, and though no hard numbers are available, it is thought that somewhere between 30% and 40% of conservatives generally favor the plans as well. They have the backing of both Caudillos, and Manuel Fraga, a man respected by the council's reformists and conservatives, has emerged as a loud advocate for the programs. With such a broad coalition of support, there is no question that these plans represent the future of Iberian governance. However, the current plans are rough drafts sorely lacking in specifics, and seeing them transformed into actual policy will take months if not years of effort."

His plan, a plan for rapid economic liberalization and development was as bold as it was controversial. Salazar had been the architect of Iberian economic policy ever since the establishment of the Union; he would surely not reject his own ideas in favor of a radical change of course. But perhaps, Ullastres thought, Franco would be a little more receptive. If there was one thing Ullastres had learned in his years in government, it was that Francisco Franco was not fond of lectures. Their lunch meeting was one of fraternity just as much as one of politicking. But light gossip was not why Ullastres was there. "Caudillo Franco, you could be the face of Iberia's greatest economic boom. Economic growth has been slow, and the rest of Europe has gone to hell. What better time could there be to remind the Iberian people the kind of leader you are?"\n\nFranco already knew of the plan, at least in its broader strokes. "Alberto, we both know it isn't my ideas you'd be putting my face on." The Caudillo paused for a moment. "I'll think about it, Don Ullastres."\n\nUllastres left the meeting feeling somewhat disappointed. But when the council assembled a few days later, he was stunned. Franco gave a lengthy, passionate speech advocating the reform plan. Perhaps it was vainglory, perhaps a need to show himself as superior to Salazar. Perhaps a genuine change of heart, or perhaps part of a wider strategy. Both technocrat and anti-technocrat alike were surprised to hear what they now heard, but the Spanish Caudillo's words swayed many in the middle. The planned changes would be the largest that the Iberian Union had seen in its history."

The literate classes of Spain ought to be aware that their King had deliberately caused the recent recession, debasing the currency with disastrous consequences in order to enrich himself and his allies. The very tools the political elite deemed necessary to preserve the Spanish Empire were instead bringing only destitution and corruption.\n\nAlberto Ullastres could not help but imagine de Mariana smiling down on him as he organized his notes. Since the heady days of life as a university student, it had been his life's goal to see his country's economy liberalized. It is why he taught Political economy at his alma mater before he became an advisor to the Caudillos. It is why he encouraged fellow Opus Dei members to involve themselves in politics. And it is why he had done so much to convince Franco that he should be made Minister of Trade.\n\nThe battle over the future of Iberia's economy had been a protracted one, and the victory of the technocrats was by no means a foregone conclusion even just a few weeks ago. But with the backing of Franco and much of the Iberian intelligentsia, the technocrats undertook intensive lobbying efforts to persuade moderate councilors over to the reformist side. Despite considerable opposition, when the council was called to a vote, the 'National Economic Stabilisation Plan' passed 280-217. Ullastres was overjoyed, and took to the podium with great confidence.\n\n"Fellow Councilors! Today, we have placed Iberia on a path to great prosperity. Today we join those nations which, by virtue of free trade and competent governance, have afforded their citizens with the longest and healthiest lives, with the longest and most thorough education and the most productive workforces in all the world. We will work to ensure that our government operates with the greatest efficiency, that it may best serve the state and its people. Our industry will be both modernized and expanded to remain competitive in an ever-developing world, and our rural communities provided the resources they need both to feed our rising population, and live just as well as their urban countrymen.

Everyone, from the most ambitious reformist to the most ardent conservative could support efforts to modernize agricultural equipment. Everyone could support measures to ensure that lberia's weapons manufacturing be expanded to better deal with terrorism. Everyone could support modest decreases in business taxes to ensure continued growth.\n\nSalazar was always confident in his economic program and steered the Portuguese councilors to unanimously support what was essentially the continuation of the last decade's agenda. Most Spanish advisors agreed, and the sort of debate over economic policy Salazar feared may happen did not manifest.\n\nThe new economic legislation passed by the Caudillos today is not headline news. Its provisions are in line with previous policies. Its changes to taxation affect only a small percentage of Iberians. It does not call for sweeping changes in government expenditures. It is, however, hard to dispute that its changes will be of benefit to the Iberian nation.

With the support of all but a few dozen hardline conservatives, these measures were largely uncontroversial. The same could not be said of the recent economic discussions. For months, reformists and conservatives had argued over the direction of the Iberian economy. With the failure of both the Opus Dei and the Falange to win the hearts and minds of the council, the future of the Iberian economy has fallen to the Council's moderates, supported by Caudillo Salazar.\n\nThe Caudillos recently returned from a secretive business summit in the Algarve, the transcripts of their discussions not having been made public. From what information the press could discern, after hours of discussion with Iberia's most influential and powerful businessmen, the Caudillos have agreed to a moderate reform plan balancing the needs of various sectors. Most changes are aimed at expanding and continuing to protect Iberia's heavy industry, while gradually liberalizing most other sectors of the economy.\n\nToday, Caudillo Salazar stands before the podium and delivers a speech before the council. "Friends, councilors, and citizens of Iberia: In the past fifteen years our union has given its people an unprecedented standard of living, far healthier, happier, and wealthier than anyone could have imagined. Still, there is much work that remains to be done. I recently toured the northeastern areas of Portugal where I grew up. There I saw wheat fields, dry after only a few rainless days due to poor irrigation. I visited a once bountiful fig orchard which had been ruined by a beetle infestation. I visited a vineyard which had truly marvelous wine, but its grapes were smaller and fewer in number than those from Italian or French wineries. The problems facing Iberian agriculture speak to the problems affecting the economy as a whole. Though our economy is stable, growing, and among the largest in Europe, we have the potential to achieve even greater success. I stand before the Council today to announce Iberia's path forward, a path which will meet the needs of all Iberian industries as we march towards 1970. New government policies will be used to expand vital industry and promote trade both domestic and international. The tax code will be streamlined and rationalized, and emerging opportunities brought about by new technology will be explored.""

Whether on the shores of Morocco in the Rif War, the hills of Andalusia in the Civil War, or the prairies outside Leningrad in the Second World war, whenever he was met with crisis, he succeeded. In this most recent battle, one of words and minds rather than guns and planes, he expected no different. Franco had long been a supporter of Autarky, and with the Spanish Caudillo's great influence Grandes and other Falangists could weave their way back into the highest echelons of political power. Franco gave his support, and so did the wealthy industrialists set to benefit most from autarky. Following prolonged discussions, Franco and Salazar announced they would sign a new economic plan drafted by the Falange with only minor modifications.\n\nAlberto Ullastres made an attempt to delay the proceedings. "Our economy is nearly stagnant! Corruption and trade restrictions are strangling our ability to grow and to compete with our rivals. We cannot enact a reform package so gigantic the day it is released! Caudillo Franco, we need further time to conduct a full review of how this plan will impact investment, manufacturing, and poverty rates." His voice was shaking, his desperation obvious to all in the room.\n\nGrandes interrupted, "Was it not the Falange that had predicted that the Spanish Republic would suppress its right-wing critics? Was it not the Falange that had saved the Spanish nation from liberalism, communism, and anarchism? Was it not the Falange that kept Iberia free from German or Italian domination? And was it not the Falange who highlighted the threat posed by regional separatists? So tell me, Don Ullastres, why do you believe that the Falange ought not be in charge of economic policy?"\n\nUllastres was at a loss for words. Was Grandes trying to push forward a plan without even giving the Caudillos the time to read it in full? Maybe the Caudillos had read it, but if so why was the council not consulted until today?\n\nSalazar signed his name onto the proposal. The reform-minded councilors had suffered a great defeat.

When he published a scathing, widely publicized article condemning Italian foreign policy, the Caudillos had removed Piñar from office, one of many pathetic attempts to save the Triumvirate. When the council was established, Franco had offered Piñar a seat, and he accepted in spite of his opposition to the legislature's very existence. The Triumvirate had fallen apart, an inevitability in his eyes. Meager attempts at liberalization in previous years had failed to grow the economy as promised, and done everything to enable terrorists.\n\nAs the attention of the Council turned away from Constitutional matters, a war of words broke out between Reformists and Conservatives on the direction of the Iberian economy. The push by Piñar and his allies for a return to Falangist economics garnered considerable praise and voracious opposition both in the public and in the Council. Those calling for a gradual, moderate approach to economic policy reform quickly found themselves forced into either Reformist or Conservative camps. With Franco's heightened influence and endorsement of the Falangist plan, the hardliners of the council led by Piñar were reinvigorated.\n\nBlas Piñar's ideological struggle was one waged with backroom meetings and quiet bank transfers just as much as any noisy speech before the Council, but it was the vote today that would prove either his final victory or ultimate defeat.

He would be lying to himself if he claimed to have never imagined being Caudillo one day. Through the 1950s he had been among the most prominent politicians in Salazar's circle, and his inclusion in the Iberian Council was obvious. There he had made close personal connections to a variety of Spanish leaders, men like Manuel Fraga and even Caudillo Franco himself.\n\nAlong with Alberto Ullastres, he spearheaded the reforms to Seguridad Social that passed a few years ago, and he now hoped to work on other gradual reforms to Iberian policy. In the weeks leading to his appointment, he had his doubts whether Franco would select him, but trusted that his political connections and close friendship with the late Portuguese Caudillo would boost his chances.\n\nYesterday, Caetano was inaugurated as Portugal's new Caudillo. Today he would meet with the Council as Caudillo for the first time. It felt surreal walking into the same chamber as every other meeting, and taking a seat at the front of the chamber rather than his usual seat with the Portuguese ministers. The empty seat between Inocêncio Galvão Teles and Alberto Franco Nogueira spoke to just how much the situation had changed in so short a time.\n\nValcárcel called the council to order, and introduced Caetano to a council already well acquainted with him. Cheers, some more enthusiastic than others, echoed through the chamber. Even at this meeting, a meeting ostensibly dedicated to his inauguration, Franco spoke substantially more than Caetano, and Caetano substantially less than Salazar had at most prior meetings. This fact was not lost on anybody. On a day that Marcelo Caetano had hoped to showcase his willpower and capability, he instead appeared as little more than a lapdog for the Spanish Caudillo. Was this new chapter in Iberia's history to be marked by Caetano's ambitious reforms, or was it to instead be marked by Franco quietly putting Portugal under his thumb?"

At the beginning of Salazar's tenure, fewer than 1 in 3 Portuguese children could read. Most elderly lived in destitution. One in seven infants would not live to see their first birthday. But under his wise and benevolent guidance, on the eve of the Iberian Union's founding, 3 in 4 children could read, all elderly citizens were provided pensions, and infant mortality had been cut in half. His bold initiatives as Caudillo of Iberia saw great reduction in poverty, have ensured that every single child is taught to read, and cut infant mortality in half once more. No man goes hungry in the streets. No child is denied their right to an education. Iberians live 10 years longer on average than they did a single generation ago.\n\nToday, our nation is left watching the ships, as we mourn the passing of one of the greatest leaders in living memory.

To even a casual observer, Franco appeared the leader, and Caetano appeared as little more than his meek servant.

Those who had hoped that the council may be used to push for reform were downright terrified to hear Franco compare them to the CNT. Was this the beginning of a purge?

Now he had succeeded, not with violent revolution or a destabilizing coup, but through peaceful reform. No longer would the masses cry out with rage for want of a voice in government.

Iberian Democracy was stillborn, and its parents mourned their horrible loss.\n\nNeither Manuel Fraga nor Alberto Ullastres could deny that the dream of a politically and economically liberal Iberia was dead. Fraga's feelings on the matter were complicated, to say the least. He had always seen himself as a pragmatic conservative more than an idealistic reformer. The state may not be free, but there are always improvements to be made.\n\nUllastres had always been an advocate for the rights of the Iberian people to healthy, happy, and well-educated lives. Democracy was supposed to be the vessel to bring real change to Iberia. Without it, the masses could hardly hope to protect themselves from the regime's corruption and incompetence. He would remain on the council, working together with Fraga as a vocal advocate of economic liberalization, but it had been a painful loss indeed.\n\nTorcuato Fernández-Miranda, Minister-Secretary of the Movimiento Nacional, had been one of the longest serving Ministers of Franco's Spain, and had recently emerged as one of the best known and most powerful voices in the council.

His pained expression and stiff body made his feelings obvious, but he knew as well as anyone else that no amount of passion could save his life's work.\n\nA week later, Fernández-Miranda resigned his position. He returned to Asturias, where he had grown up, purchasing a modest estate in which he planned to spend his remaining years.

Ideological divides threatened any hope at a united opposition.\n\nNine men sat at a quiet private residence in Belem, Brazil. 4 were Iberian dissidents that had been quietly smuggled out of Cádiz. The others were exiles, 3 Portuguese and 2 Spanish, that had not seen Iberia in many years. All saw the rising discontent that had created Iberia's terrorist movements as an opportunity for reform.\n\nThe tension in the room slowly dissipated as the men discussed which content to include in their manifesto. Democratic rights and the legalization of opposition parties were obvious. But were there any parties too extreme to legalize? Should the Iberian Union be dissolved or maintained? Should the culturally distinct regions of Iberia be granted full autonomy?\n\nTo many of the underground dissidents in Iberia, the Belem Manifesto was hardly inspirational. It was too vague in its goals and too unclear in how they hoped to achieve them, and it tried to ignore the obvious question of whether Iberia should be a socialist state. But others saw something else: A consensus between liberal and leftist activists in Iberia, whose differences had previously prevented cooperation.

You can drag my ass through half the legislation on this planet, but you would not humor me with a game of chess?"\n\n"I do not want to play chess, Salazar.

 IBR.3137.d:0 "The two Caudillos had prepared their board. Salazar, given the choice, opted for black. Franco was playing white. Salazar was quite capable at chess - though he only bragged "a little" about it - and Franco had just enough experience to not need an explanation on the basic functions of the game. With everything prepared, the Caudillos began their game. The quiet of the office they had prepared, besides the ticking of a plain clock, provided effective for facilitating the contemplation of moves.\n\nFranco moved his first piece, f3. "Chess is lacking without ample conversation, if this is anything to go by."\n\ne5. "You would be correct," began Salazar. "If you cannot reminisce the game loses some of its appeal."\n\ng4.

"To think, if one little thing had gone differently, I might have been playing chess with another man." Qb5+-Nd7.\n\nFranco was silent for a moment. As that moment lengthened into several seconds, it became clear he was trying to figure out what that 'little thing' was. Finally, he moved a piece as he finally found what memory it was. Dxc5-e6.

 IBR.3140.t:0 "White and Black"
 IBR.3140.d:0 "As time progressed, it became clear that Franco would never find out if his improved results were the sign of a trend. Caudillo Salazar's untimely - and unfortunate - death had prevented the Caudillos from having another match. The Spaniard had arguably won his first victory by fluke, and now he would never have the chance at a hard-won triumph.\n\nEven though there were plenty of other things to remember Salazar by, the chessboard they played on held a special appeal; it was a hobby, limited as it was. It was far better to remember the old man for their games of chess, rather than by their many arguments over Iberian policy.\n\nFranco took some time to make one last examination of the chess board. It was a plain, uninteresting design - white-and-black pieces on a white-and-black board; he had set it up at the Portuguese Caudillo's preferred table one final time. He decided to never use the board again, so that the memories it provided would remain untainted."

His family and closest supporters sat either side of him, indulging in one of the finest lunches they ever had the pleasure of eating. Such a meal was one of the few occasions the leader could have a break from the repetitive struggles he endured. But the stress had been building up, he had been feeling worse every day that went by. He felt as if something had to give, that his relief could not last.\n\nAn abrupt, convulsive pain then seized him, and wrenched the fleeting respite from his troubled mind. He doubled down, coughing uncontrollably, breathlessly imploring someone to help as his body writhed against the ground. Shouts and screams of terror only added to the deathly cacophony.\n\n"Somebody see to him, he is choking, quick!" came a cry from across the table. Several aides heeded the call and rushed to dislodge whatever was caught in their leaders' throat. Yet, try as they may, not one of them could stem the coughing. It soon became clear that it was something far more serious; not that any of those present were willing to admit it. Eventually it all ended; the dreadful whooping faded into a whimper, and the old man rolled backward. He gasped until his lungs were filled with air, and relaxed his arms, bringing his hands away from his face. However, once he could summon the strength to open his eyes the fierce dread flooded back into him. His hands were wet with his own blood. The man could not hold off his fears any longer, he had to get out, he had to get help.\n\nAs he exited, he was followed by his advisors, who nervously expected the worse for Franco. Those who did not leave turned to his wife, who sat silent and still. Quietly pulling at the pearls of her necklace, she worried that her husband never would be the same again."

It would symbolize the country's united leadership and the people's achievements, chief among them the economic progress the two had helped to encourage. They would have it constructed in the heart of the peninsula, where all could come and stand in wonder at their accomplishment.\n\nUnfortunately, building such a monolith would take time, most likely several years, and would come at a substantial cost.

The workers were still too busy moving in, and he was sure there would be time enough for whatever ceremony Madrid was planning. Taking the elevator up to the top floor, he greeted a few of the workers before entering his new office.\n\nHe was not exactly sure what he was expecting, but a lavishly furnished office was certainly not the first thing that came to mind. Making his way to his desk, the director stopped for a moment to admire the view of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Dam. Taking his seat in the rather comfortable chair provided, the engineer kicked back and took a moment to appreciate the furniture, especially the liquor cabinet which he had made sure would be stocked up.\n\nThen he noticed it, an innocuous photo on the desk, a simple polaroid of an old man. Still, he had seen him before, he was sure of it. Wracking his brain, he took himself back; it was right when work on the dam began in the heady years of the '50s, he had introduced himself at a conference, Herman was his name, Herman... Segal? No Sörgel! The bastard behind Atlantropa. The director recoiled back, was this someone's idea of a joke? Who would want a photograph of the idiot who had destroyed the Mediterranean?

 IBR.30155.d:0 "It has been two weeks since the floods washed over Lisbon. The miserable outdoor evacuee camps have finally been emptied, and as Winter dawns over Iberia thousands of homeless people can at least be assured they will not freeze to death. However, the shelters are still no substitute for real housing. The food is bad, the bedding is stiff and uncomfortable, there is virtually no privacy, theft is common, and worst of all, multiple incidents of rape and child molestation have been reported. It will take time for the city to rebuild, and unfortunately, these shelters are the only place many Lisboans are able to live.\n\nThe emergency fund used to construct the shelters will run out in a few days. Extending funding will be quite costly. Alternatively, we can hand the task of administering the shelters over to city officials, freeing funds for use on other important projects."

The Axencia has now become aware of a particularly concerning conspiracy: Multiple FSLP members are using the shelters to spread anti-government, Portuguese separatist, and Communist propaganda. "J", a 18 year old male living in one of the shelters reported that two friends and one volunteer worker invited him for drinks, and after prodding him with several questions regarding his political beliefs, offered to invite him into the FSLP with promises of 'saving Portugal', and of obtaining higher social status.\n\nAfter contacting the AAS, "J" was signed on as an informant, and has provided us with a list of 11 other FSLP members, as well as revealing a plan to expand FSLP influence within the camps to foment a city-wide movement of 'minor sabotage' against the government."

 IBR.30158.d:0 "Living conditions continue to recover in Lisbon. Though the homelessness rate remains higher than before, most of the people displaced by the storm live with relatives in other cities, in shanty towns just outside the city, or in tenements within. Most buildings have either been repaired or demolished, and the scars of the destruction are fading quickly.\n\nWhile the housing situation improves rapidly, the recovery of employment has stagnated. Businesses suffered severely, with many factories and stores alike being badly damaged or destroyed entirely. Local government officials have been ineffective at preventing, and at times have even been complicit in, predatory lending that has forced business owners to choose between losing their businesses, or having their businesses weighed down by interest for years to come. Lacking any source of income, thousands of Lisboans now rely almost exclusively on government support to survive.\n\nFew doubt that Lisbon's economy will eventually recover, but even fewer deny that the current situation remains poor. Various advisors have suggested launching a stimulus program in order to accelerate Lisbon's recovery, however, such a program could be significantly more costly than any of our previous relief efforts."

People are increasingly questioning the state narrative surrounding the floods, seeing a corrupt and incompetent government brushing its sins under the carpet, rather than a heroic intervention to save the people of Lisbon. This is seriously harming public support for our relief effort."

They are here to protest against what they perceive as the negligent mishandling of the Lisbon Flood by the Iberian government; insufficient funding to relief efforts, corrupt officials exploiting vulnerable Lisboans for personal financial gain, and continued economic deterioration.\n\nThese are the largest protests Lisbon has seen in many years, and the unusual circumstances in which they are occurring has left advisors conflicted on what the optimal government response would be."

He was not making as much as he did at the cannery, but really, he was just happy to have a job at all. The weeks after the Flood had been hard, but even with his old job, old car, and old house gone, life was starting to feel normal again. Just the knowledge that his work might prevent future floods greatly motivated him, and gave him some sense of purpose. Sunset signaled the end of a productive workday. If only he still had a vehicle of his own, so that he did not have to walk a mile back from work. And if only the elevator were not broken, so that he did not have to climb three flights of stairs to reach his apartment.\n\n"Papai! Papai!" shouted his exuberant daughter. "Mom got me a new Mariquita!" Carlos exchanged a knowing glance with his wife. On some days, little Maria Francisca seemed to have been more heartbroken by the loss of her doll in the flood than the loss of their home. His work had paid off, his family had recovered yet another piece of their old lives.\n\n"She's been yapping about that thing all evening!" exclaimed his jovial roommate, embracing Carlos and patting him on the back. "You do good work." That was one of the unusual things about life after the flood. With so many homes destroyed, it was now common for individual apartments to be rented to multiple families. But Vítor was a pleasant man, someone who genuinely enjoyed the company of Carlos and his family. Carlos could once again listen to the same radio shows he did at his old house with his daughter. Life was never the same after the flood, life never could have stayed the same. But life did continue."

Loud arguing, barely muffled by thin walls, was now a constant. Then, the power went out. "Fuck! Again?" screamed a roommate.\n\nHaving to live with two other families in an apartment no larger than her old house ruined any hope Gabriela had had of returning to a sense of normalcy. That Senhor Gusmão was such a miserable man. It was better than the camp, at least.\n\nHer husband Carlos came through the door, smelling of the sea. "I might just strangle him some day." Gabriela chuckled. Her husband's dry humor was one of the few joys in life that the flood had not destroyed. "If the power comes back on, I have mackerel for us to share."\n\n"One of these days, can you reel in a drink instead?" Carlos smiled and sat next to his wife, wrapping his arm around her and leaning into her body.\n\nLife had not been so good after the flood. Gabriela often found herself wishing she were still a child, not having to worry about the awful apartment, and not knowing the pain of losing a home. But feeling her husband's embrace, seeing her son's smile, hearing her sleeping daughter's breath, those kept her moving forward. The city was recovering."

No electricity meant no heat, made worse by the wind that constantly leaked through the entrance.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Carlos de Almeida lost his home. He sat beside his wife Gabriela, in a shack that creaked with every strong gust of wind. Carlos was terrified that he had made a mistake while building it, and the roof would collapse onto them. At least here, he could keep some semblance of his dignity. Not long ago, Carlos could rely on a steady wage from his job at the cannery. Now, he helped neighbors build their own shacks in return for cigarettes or food. And what cigarettes he did not smoke, he could trade those for more food.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Maria Francisca de Almeida lost her home. She lay in the shack with her parents, exhausted as she often was, and sleeping at an hour she once had been filled with energy. She wet the bed again, to her mother's dismay. It had not been a problem before the flood. Now, there was scarcely a night it did not happen. Once, Francisca was filled with joy, and a thirst for adventure and new experiences. Now, she hardly ever left her mother's side.\n\nSeven weeks ago, Luís Maria de Almeida lost his home. In a way, his parents envied him. Too young to realize just how much he had lost. Too young to even comprehend where he was. But even he could feel the cold January air against his nape, and even he could sense that something had changed."

As cars once again roll down the streets, factories hum with activity, and fishing boats sail on the horizon, one may be easily led to believe that nothing terrible had happened here. But the people walk along sidewalks knowing that just a few weeks ago, they were covered in debris. They sleep in bedrooms they had never seen before that late November night.\n\n[?Root.IBR_lisbonflood_loss]. That is how many people the newspapers think have died. But who is to say what the true number is? Who became ill in the evacuee shelters and died, and were they included? How many committed suicide, having seen their lives fall apart so suddenly? What could have been done to prevent such a horrible flood? Is Iberia doing enough now to make sure such a thing never happens again?\n\nLisbon comes back to life, returning to its place as Europe's westernmost great city. But it is forever changed. The flood of November 1967 will forever be remembered as the worst natural disaster to occur anywhere in the Iberian Peninsula in over two centuries, and as a major test in the ability of the young Iberian Union to react to crisis."

As the papers will have you know, we have been in the thick of the fighting recently but rest assured, I'm still safe and sound. Which is more than I can say for many others. The Germans, and their Boer allies, are a much different breed of soldier compared to the natives and Italians we faced in Algeria. More motivated and better disciplined.\n\nWe had the last laugh though, rumor has it the Germans didn't expect much from a bunch of "Mediterraneans". What they didn't count on was Spanish and Portuguese discipline, bravery... and the Americans. Efficient, disciplined, and lavishly well-equipped, they are a formidable foe on any battlefield, and I'm glad they're on our side.\n\nI can't tell you where I am, and given how often we're on the move I'm not quite sure I know either. We sometimes set up in towns, often we are in the field, but the weather is friendly, and we're well supplied. Far better than Algeria. The people too are different, the natives are suspicious but not hostile and we can get along with them well. The Boers however, looked on us with hostility and disdain. They stare at you sullenly, insolently, or just look the other way.\n\nIt is a tragedy to see such a beautiful country be spoiled by war, but increasingly I'm unsure of our presence here. Rumor has it that Salazar just wants to impress the Americans to get the lost colonies back and is willing to spend Iberian blood to get it. Whatever the case, I'll try and make it back to you.

As the coasts of Algeria disappeared into the distance, the man wondered how much his birthplace had changed since he last saw it.\n\nPortugal was but a distant memory, a home he had left to pursue life overseas, lured away by promises of fame and fortune. First came Angola, a harsh exotic land. He had earned his living hacking roads from the jungle, carving plantations from the wilderness, and bringing civilization to an untamed continent. Until the Germans marched in and forced them out, while Lisbon stood by and watched.\n\nThen came Algeria, where he worked alongside his Spanish brethren, carving a place for himself and his fellow exiles, the Retornados. The desert was a harsh mistress, but he had managed until the War came and went, and he was once again without a land to call home.\n\nThe hours passed quickly, few of his fellow Retornados were in the mood to talk, hushed voices and whispered words, worried parents, and confused children. The only ones willing to speak were the soldiers, young, angry, and resentful, with too much to drink and too little to do.\n\nAs the coast of Portugal came into view, António didn't know what to feel. This was his nation, his birthplace, his native land. But as he stepped off the gangway and onto Portuguese soil, and on the journey back to his family home, all he could think about was how he was a foreigner in his own country."

However, this prediction was proven wrong when three SAM batteries were destroyed by gunfire from the Battleship Vittorio Veneto, and leaflets demanding the island's surrender were dropped by the Regia Aeronautica.\n\nGeneral Gutiérrez-Mellado, the brigadier in charge of Majorca's defenses, decided to fight. The first reports of combat between the two former allies came when troops from the Sardegna division that had invaded Paguera were met with stiff resistance by the 8th Federal Artillery Battalion, made up of stranded Portuguese troops. Although the initial assault was halted, the landing of an Italian tank company soon forced the Iberians back to Galatzó. Gutiérrez-Mellado ordered his own armor reserves to the front, but these were destroyed by air attacks.\n\nAfter a simultaneous Iberian attempt to recover the airport was defeated, it became clear that with more Italians entering Palma by air and the road from the west open to the Regio Esercito's tanks, any further loss of life was futile. Mellado signed an armistice with the Italians at 12:00 and was interned with the island's 3,000 defenders.

Whether out of respect for its Caudillo, pride in Union, or merely an excuse to take the day off, Lisbon's streets were filled with onlookers nonetheless. It would be at noon when the men of Iberia began their marching through the city's streets. At its forefront were the Colonial units, the Fuerzas Regulares Indígenas, and the Spanish Legion, self-assured and exuding confidence. Next up were the mechanized units of the Federal Army, foreign-made designs alongside domestic vehicles trailed behind the Legion on the route to Baixa, their attached infantry following in neatly ordered rows. In the rear was the Home Guard, Portugal's sons keeping pace with the finest of the Iberian Army.\n\nThe march would last for over an hour before they arrived at the city center, pausing for prepared speeches from both Caudillos, extolling the virtues and bravery of the Iberian soldier. The people cheered, of course, Salazar was still Lisbon's favorite son and Franco, well respect the position if not the man.

His maid María de Jesus, a woman too enamored with Salazar to leave his side despite knowing the Caudillo did not feel the same way about her as she did him, was his only close friend. While Salazar read a book in his study, María spotted up the bathroom in anticipation of guests.\n\nThis was a special occasion for the Caudillo. His older sister, Maria do Resgate Salazar de Oliveira, was visiting today, for the first time in four years. Salazar liked few people and trusted even fewer, but he never doubted his sisters.

His nieces had grey hair, and much more prominent wrinkles than the last time they met.

We are sending bodyguards with you, and they will remain with you at all times. The same goes for Caudillo Salazar."\n\n"Look, I don't want some, some ass-. Excuse me. I don't want anybody watching me while I'm god-damned sleeping.""

 IBR.3168.d:0 "Francisco Franco's magnificent 47-meter yacht cruised through Atlantic waters. This was a vacation of sorts, a few days to spend away from governing before the Malta Conference. No trip out to sea, thought Franco, would be complete without a great catch to commemorate the voyage. The Bay of Biscay had long been a hunting ground for whalers. Its deep undersea canyons provided a home for deep-divers, while fertile reefs provided for the shallow-sea-whales. And Franco would keep searching the bay until he found one.\n\nHours passed, and the sky turned orange as the sun neared the horizon. The wind was still and the water clear. Droplets of water sprayed in the distance, and for but a few seconds the back of an enormous sperm whale rose above the surface. "Arteaga! Maximum power!" As the yacht turned towards the beast its motor roared to life and raced forward. Rapid clicks, each as loud as shotgun blasts, had most sailors covering their ears. Not Franco. He had insisted: He would operate the harpoon, and he would not allow size, speed, or sound, to stop him. He rigs the weapon. Now just a matter of aiming. Good, she does not expect a thing, just hold still...\n\nBOOM\n\nThe explosive attached to the harpoon detonates, blasting water and chunks of flesh into the air, and turning the surrounding water red. The whale thrashed around, but it only worsened the bleeding. Franco now joined his men at the ropes, dragging the monster aboard as it made its final feeble movements. 10 meters long, and God only knows how many tons."

 #The Inspector Chain

 IBR.3169.t:0 "A New Case" 
 IBR.3169.d:0 "Small pebbles were thrown up as the police car rushed along the winding cobbled road which separated the outskirts of Valladolid from their destination. Observing the dancing shadows in the trees created by the headlights the inspector scoffed. Separating the estate from the edge of civilization more like. Quietly laughing at his own joke he noticed that the driver was looking at him through the car mirror.\n\n"Is everything okay sir?"\n\nSurprised at the genuine sound of concern laced into the question the inspector turned to face his colleague. "I was just thinking what a pathetic case this likely will be."\n\nThe inspector could see both disgust and surprise in the sergeants eyes. "How so? A young girl from a noble family has been reported missing!"\n\n"The social status of the family does not exceed the class of provincial nobility." Following this reply the sergeant raised his eyebrows questioningly while the inspector continued unabashed. "She likely ran away. Responsibility associated with being the eldest daughter, maintaining social etiquette, having no real free choice..." He could see the sergeant briefly nodding, but the rest of the journey was dominated by a leering silence.\n\nThe car was greeted formally as if the policemen were distinguished guests. Following a brief and fruitless discussion with the attending family members, the inspector went to search the house. Noticing no signs of forced entry or other indications of violent crime he tasked the sergeant with questioning the servants. After only two interviews the sergeant rushed back to the inspector.\n\n"Maybe you were right. It seems the daughter was close to one particular servant who also has not returned to work for a few days."\n\nThe inspector smiled weakly. He may have sated his ego but the girl was still missing."
 IBR.3169.a:0 "An opportunity to make a name for himself."
 
 IBR.3170.t:0 "Dead End" 
 IBR.3170.d:0 "For a simple case, the paperwork seemed to tower a little too high on the inspector's desk. Neither the missing girl nor the servant have been found, an embarrassment to the Valladolid Municipal Police. Looking at a particularly big pile of paper he sighed. Grabbing it he strode purposefully to the sergeant's desk who had accompanied him on the night of the investigation. He dropped the batch with a playful wink and continued past the seething officer towards an entirely different animal. Bracing himself he opened the glass paneled door to his superior's office.\n\n"Ah inspector great timing, I was just about to send my secretary. I have been receiving some rather pressing calls from the missing girl's family. Have you gotten any further with the case?" The overweight man sat in the far side of the room and observed the entrant with an unconcealed fury. Clearly he already knew the answer.\n\n"No sir." replied the inspector quietly.\n\n"That certainly is a terrible shame. The trouble is I cannot justify such high funding for the investigation anymore if this is the case."\n\nFor a moment the inspector's vision was clouded by a red mist as his body fell into the welcoming abyss of fury. "How do you expect me to produce any results? Do you even know how many people I have had to question and how much paperwork this case requires? You sit here making demands while I am trying to find two missing people!"\n\nThe fat man's fury finally erupted as he heaved his great body forward in his chair. "You have the audacity to stand up to your superior's decision making? Who do you think you are? You owe me your position. Go home and come back tomorrow with a different attitude or you do not have to ever come back to work again."\n\nWith this he shooed the inspector out of his office and reached for black phone sat at the corner of his desk.\n\n"I need you to open a behavioral observation file on someone."" 
 IBR.3170.a:0 "There was much work to be done."

 IBR.3171.t:0 "Barcelona or Bust" 
 IBR.3171.d:0 "The Sword of Damocles perilously balanced over the inspector's head since the start of the investigation and was now beginning to swing dangerously. His return to the office had been an awkward affair. The inspector ensured his time away had not been wasted; he managed to get a thorough profile of the servant. In this he finally had found a key lead, the man seemed to know a group of anarchists in Barcelona rather well. Upon his return, his colleagues, some of them friends, had watched suspiciously as the inspector paced towards his desk. Shifting a stack of forms away to create a clear space, he noticed a small piece of paper which instantly made his blood boil. The case was to be dismissed unless new leads were procured. Subduing his anger, he again thought of the servant and an idea began to materialize.\n\nThe lazy sun illuminated the streets of the great Catalonian city. The inspector had tracked the cell to a mediocre family restaurant in the old part of town. Entering, he worriedly observed how a giant of a man made his way towards him from the back of the room. Towering over the inspector he asked him for the time. The inspector nervously hunched over to look at his watch, instead accidently dropping his police badge. Both men looked at the floor and then back at each other. Without saying another word the man hit him square in the face.\n\nOnly with luck was he able to escape the brutal beating he had to endure in the shop, only to return to his superior grilling him back at the hospital. Spacing in and out of the meeting he caught a few snippets of the conversation. He had broken protocol and this time had been one step too far. One word he distinctly caught, however: fired. Even with the anesthesia he managed a weak smile and one last lucid thought: how lucky it was that he had left his files at home."
 IBR.3171.a:0 "He knew he would redeem himself."
 
 IBR.3172.t:0 "Broken House" 
 IBR.3172.d:0 "With each waking second the inspector could feel the dark bags under his eyes weigh him down more and more, as if they had been attached invisible weights. Staring up blankly he noticed his trusty desk lamp was faring no better than him; the three dead bulbs tumbled underneath already had varying layers of dust collecting on them. Sighing he leaned back to fully take in the chaos in front of him. The case papers seemed to have multiplied exponentially with his investigative work since the dismissal. Yet the solution was no closer, and it was infuriating him to no end.\n\nLooking at the photo of the missing heiress he felt a sudden chill as he imagined her calling out his name. He squinted hard at the picture only to notice the calls had come from behind him. His wife was in the doorway with a face of stone. Tick. Giving her sparsely any attention he turned back to his work. Tick. He could hear the thudding steps as she was coming closer, accusing him with every step. Tick. It did not sound real, his body felt so light he could have begun to float. Tick. As she drew nearer, he began to make out the harsh words that were spewing from her frightfully contorted face. Tick. Anger began to wash over the inspector, first the case, then the work incident and now finally his wife; it seemed nothing was willing to give him a break. Tick. As she grabbed his shoulder, he turned towards her with an expression of utter madness. Boom. The smack was sudden and without mercy, the inspector's wife stepped back reeling and clutching her reddened cheek with a look of abject horror on her face. Suddenly the world came back into focus. The inspector looked at his hand in disbelief as if it were a foreign body entirely alien to him. Across the room, now retreating slowly away from him, the same look was mirrored back. Yet it was not directed at his hand but his whole being. A quiet apology slipped loosely out of the inspector's mouth but as soon as it departed from his lips, he knew it would not be enough. He turned back to his work as the door to his study slammed shut. Not long after he heard the front door violently close. The case papers still lay on his desk."
 IBR.3172.a:0 ""Will they save me?""

 IBR.3173.t:0 "The Bottom" 
 IBR.3173.d:0 "The months after the fateful altercation in the inspector's study had been a blur. Each day he lost himself in the case as parts of his personal life quickly began to fall away. With no consistent stream of income, it came as no surprise that his house in Eastern Valladolid was soon repossessed. No less by the local bank, to which the inspector had been a loyal customer for many years. He would never forget the excitement in the clerk's eyes as he brought in the deed. The inspector had briefly searched for clues to where his wife had gone only to find the same results he had been getting with his case. He had felt a harsh jab upon this realization, something which slowly died away as he continued with his work. It had not taken long for him to find a new base of operations: his old school friend's house. The inspector had been lucky, the newlywed couple had two spare rooms prepared for when the house would become lively with the cries of children.\n\nSitting at his new desk he noticed a letter balanced on top of his case files. One quick tear and he saw the dreaded word he had prepared himself for: divorce. It should have been obvious, no one could get a legal divorce in Iberia. She had travelled abroad. The letter dug deep into his chest, past the ribcage and lungs straight into his heart. A new husband, far away in the distant former colonial lands of Venezuela. A job she finally was enjoying. His eyes began to blur as he read the next sentence. A child, not yet born, but soon to enrich the newly formed family's lives. Streams ran down his unshaven face, pooling on the case files in front of him. The inspector continued reading and soon his despair turned into white-hot rage. She was offering him a job at her new husband's steel factory. Did she feel sorry for him? Did she not realize the importance of his task? He grabbed a lighter and cigarette out of his pocket. With a swift movement he lit both the tobacco and letter. Throwing the burning mess out of the window in front of him he again returned to the case files in front of him. Nothing mattered now, only the case."
 IBR.3173.a:0 "There was nothing else left."

 IBR.3174.t:0 "Purifying Flame"
 IBR.3174.d:0 "The inspector's growing desperation had driven him to bribe some of his former colleagues to give him information on the case which the Valladolid Municipal Police had uncovered after his dismissal. With glee he received the news that the anarchists he had tracked and failed to properly confront in Barcelona had relocated to Asturias.\n\nThe night was still young with a half-moon slowly making its way across the dull night sky, yet the few streetlights failed to dispel the near darkness of the road where the hideout was located. With no security cameras installed no one noticed the dark shape dash around the house's exterior. A triple knock at the back door interrupted a particularly intense poker game between the two anarchists inside. Hunkering over to the door, the larger of the two turned back to his friend to complain about the last hand. Turning back, he looked into the shining eyes of a man filled with mad desperation, holding a wooden bat in one hand and a gas can in the other. The inspector managed to quickly subdue both men using the element of surprise, tying them to their chairs. Not willing to wait for other arrivals he woke them both ruthlessly with an ice-cold bucket of water and began his interrogation. When both men initially stayed silent, the inspector retorted by merrily pouring gasoline over the floor and furniture of the room. Soon the men began to talk. The servant had been a member of their group working undercover at the noble family, but had cut ties with the group back in Barcelona.\n\nBefore the men could tell him where the pair had hidden the back door opened again, this time revealing a group of surprised anarchists who took a moment to take in the scene in front of them. As the men finally dashed forward to free their comrades, the inspector drew his light and told them to stop. When they did not, he ran to the door and threw the lighter back inside. He heard violent screams and curses behind him being drowned out by the roaring of excited flames as he ran down the street. Turning for a brief moment he saw that all men had made it out and had given chase to him. He continued to run even after he had lost his pursuers. His legs carried him until he could run no further, collapsing on the ground he buried his face in his hands as he first began to hysterically laugh, shortly replaced by bitter tears."
 IBR.3174.a:0 "How far could this go?"

 IBR.3175.t:0 "A New Beginning" 
 IBR.3175.d:0 "Finally, the puzzle pieces were beginning to fall into place. A dissatisfied heiress of a minor noble family with no formal way of escaping her trapped existence, a former anarchist who had replaced the trappings of ideology with those of love and finally a group of relocating freedom fighters. Initially the ultimate question remained even with the acquisition of the anarchist's testimonies. He confirmed that the servant worked undercover for the anarchist cell while he worked for the noble family. But where were they? Had the pair moved with the cell to Asturias? Had they been hidden somewhere else entirely? If they had met with the anarchists in Barcelona why would they have continued moving further once the servant had left the organization, as the anarchist relayed during his interrogation?\n\nIt already put a great distance between the former reality the two wanted to escape. The inspector began to look through his files again, this time taking great pains to pursue the money which had been withdrawn multiple times from the girl's account. He took note of a particularly large and out of place sum, and moved his attention towards gaining a better insight into the property market of Barcelona.\n\nAfter months of anonymous calls and information perusal he finally had triangulated a small apartment which seemed to match both the time frame and withdrawal amount. He had found them."
 IBR.3175.a:0 "A chance at redemption?"

 IBR.3176.t:0 "Closure" 
 IBR.3176.d:0 "Unable to control his emotions the inspector sat in front of the files, in a house not even his own, and began to cry uncontrollably and bitterly. This case had taken everything from him. Everything he had ever held dear. His wife, his home, his job, his friends, and his pride. Now it was over, before him lay the address he had tracked the missing pair to. A small flat in Barcelona, nothing befitting a wealthy heiress, but he was sure it was a happy home, nonetheless. Picking up the receiver of the phone next to him he briefly stalled. Many thoughts crossed his troubled mind as he carefully considered his next action. With a grim determination he however finally entered the number he knew he needed to call. A chirpy voice answered on the other end informing the inspector that he was indeed speaking to the Municipal Police of Valladolid and then asked what it was he was calling about. Ensuring not to mention his name the inspector gave the information he had now worked years to obtain. All he could manage after the call was a long sigh.\n\nNot even an hour later the phone rang again waking the inspector out of his daze. With a jolt he sat up as he unmistakably recognized the voice of his old sergeant. What surprised him more however was what the man said next.\n\n"We want you back.""
 IBR.3176.a:0 ""Gladly, sir.""

 IBR.3177.t:0 "An End After All"
 IBR.3177.d:0 "Lying on the small unmade bed of his temporary home the inspector heard a quiet and cautious knock at the old door. Standing up he quickly straightened his clothes and went to greet his friend. With a pleasant smile devoid of any of the pity the inspector had become accustomed to over the past months his friend passed him a bulky package. Both men looked eagerly inside as the inspector began to tear at the envelope.\n\nA newspaper of the current day and a letter. Folding out the newspaper the inspector's eyes were quickly drawn to a red circle around a small article nearly hidden at the bottom of the page. With slightly raised eyebrows he read that the couple he had searched for so long had indeed been found in the place where he had traced them to. There however was no mention of the anonymous tip he had left, instead all the praise was laid at the feet of a former sergeant who now had been honorably promoted. Smirking sadly, he tossed the paper away to look at the letter. Instantly taken aback, he saw that it was from his former superior. The department knew that his work had been important in resolving the case. His old boss stressed that he had always known that the inspector would be able to resolve this terrible ordeal. Considering the current political climate and the serious breaches the inspector had committed he would not be able to regain his position on the force. The next part made the inspector draw in his breath shakily while the grin on his friend's face grew even wider. He would be rewarded with an attached check of 100 thousand pesetas, enough to help him start a new life. Unable to comprehend what he had just read he let the papers slip out of sweating hands.\n\nAs he stepped back the envelope spilled the last of its contents: the check and a one way bus ticket to Lisbon."

 IBR.3178.t:0 "There is No Use" 
 IBR.3178.d:0 "The torrential rain was beating down on the inspector's shoulders with such a strong force that it resembled the desperate cries and flails of a betrayed lover. He was alone on the street as all normal folk had decided to hole themselves up comfortably inside. Resolved as he was, however, he stormed towards the public phone box.\n\nInside he violently grabbed the receiver and was about to dial the number of the Valladolid police as he saw a strange happening outside in the rain. A couple, drawn closely together to escape the storm's fury, marched hastily past the box only for the woman to drop her purse in the gutter. Without so much as a second thought the man had leant down to fetch it back, in the process greatly muddying his wet clothes. The women gave him a peck on the cheek as they hastily continued along their way. Watching them for a few moments the inspector's mind began to race with new doubts.\n\nNoticing that the hand holding the receiver was shaking uncontrollably he gripped it with his other hand, only then noticing that it was not only water now streaming down his face. Redialing he began to think of nicer weather as a voice on the other side of the line began to speak. "South American Dreams travel agency, how may I help you?""

Working with those he had too, discarding those he did not. He had been steadily rising through the ranks, and within a few years he might have even made it to Madrid. He scoffed, it was all a pipedream now.\n\nThe Carnation revolution had toppled the government, sweeping into the power the weak-willed democrats and reformists with their misguided ideals. Now he was on the run, hunted and pursued by the very organs of state he once relied upon.

The iron-fisted rule of the twin Caudillos had long abused and suppressed the civil liberties and inalienable rights of the Iberian people. There was work to be done.\n\nLaw after law was brought before the Council, restrictions on public gatherings, limitations on the press, the suppression of political opposition, and dozens of other pieces of legislation. Fernández Miranda, Alberto Ullastres, and dozens of other long-serving reformists gave stirring speeches, occasionally even a lone voice or two of dissent emerged in the chamber.\n\nNothing came of it. One after another, the laws restraining Iberian society were removed by overwhelming majorities. Step, by step, repeal after repeal, the light of liberty grew brighter in Iberia."

The man sighed, he had brought them here, and now he had to keep them in line.\n\n"Shut up! Everyone shut up!" Mellado's words carried themselves across the conference room, silencing the conversation amidst the myriad of politicians and party leaders. "I don't care what your differences are or why you don't like me or anyone else in this room, but I'm the President right now, so listen up!"\n\nGutiérrez smirked, it was amazing what little yelling got done. "As you are all aware, I have invited you here to ensure that the transition to democracy is as smooth as possible. Which means all of you here need to stop campaigning."\n\nThe noise started to rise again, only to be smothered out once more by the President's voice.

Once we've done that, feel free to criticize me to your heart's content, but we cannot afford the instability which would result from all of you running campaign ads and public protests while there are still fascists clinging to whatever is left.

He'd just reignited that old debate, waged in every bar, café and schoolyard across Iberia.\n\n"Jaime! Pal. I know the man's just retired, but you don't have to exaggerate," said Juan. "Gento was good, no doubt. But Ricardo Zamora was El Divino! There won't ever be a star like him". He pointed at Pepe, the third member of the group, as he popped an olive in his mouth. "And you, don't you dare bring up Peyroteo".\n\nPepe laughed, and did it anyway. "Fernando Peyroteo was the best, my friend, much as it hurts. You have to admit it, even if the best wasn't Spanish. 554 goals in 334 matches for the Sporting Club of Lisbon, and another 15 for Portugal. No one has numbers like that."\n\n"You and your numbers," grumbled Juan. "Numbers won't tell you anything about a goalkeeper. Zamora practically invented goalkeeping, and he may as well have ended it! None will top him."\n\nJaime shook his head while signaling the bartender for another round. "You're both stuck in the past, same as everyone else. Neither of you even saw these guys play, they are ancient! And more importantly," he said, lifting up a finger with authority, "one was Spanish and one was Portuguese. Paco Gento you have seen, and he is Iberian: the best Iberian footballer of all time."\n\nThe argument would rage into the night over more cañas and tapas, across several bars, with no resolution.

 IBR.3184.t:0 "The New Curriculum" 
 IBR.3184.d:0 "The principal took his seat at the head of the conference table, seated with twelve teachers, all men aged 30 to 60, to discuss how the recent legislation would impact the 1972-1973 school year..\n\nFirst, three years of secondary schooling would be mandatory and free-of-charge for all Iberians aged 15 to 18, including girls, many of whom previously received only primary education. As the number of enrolled students was to increase sharply, classroom sizes would be significantly larger in the following years. Several teachers expressed their concerns, frustrated to be assigned so much more work for no increase in pay, but the principal assured them that this would be temporary as the system underwent its transformation.\n\nSecond, though schools shall remain segregated by sex, girls would now be entitled to free secondary education equivalent to that of boys, in recognition of their increasing involvement in the workforce. Girls would be educated in the arts, science, and even technical skills, to ensure that they could become productive workers and better raise their future children. As a boys' school, this did not especially affect the teachers' jobs personally, though a few shifted in their seats uncomfortably.\n\nThird, the very goals of Secondary Education were to be changed. No longer was the main goal of education to be to guarantee loyalty to the government, strict adherence to gender roles, and conservative morals. Rather, education would become the engine by which a new generation of professional workers and academics would be created. While 3 years of classes on Catholic ethics and religious study will be mandatory, the "Formation of the National Spirit" class for both sexes and the "Houseworks" class for girls have been axed entirely.\n\nThis final point proved much more controversial among the assembled teachers. It was one thing to provide free secondary education to all teenagers regardless of sex, but a different matter entirely to axe such important classes. What was the purpose of schooling if it would not preserve the Iberian family? And what ideas would these girls get into their heads?"

It was his first day working in Porto, at the regional office of the federal Ministry of Agriculture. In João's opinion he seemed decent enough, even for a Spaniard transferred from Madrid. That he was Galician and spoke acceptable Portuguese weighed in his favor.\n\nJoão was about to leave when another glance at the typewriter reminded him of something critical. "Carlos, do you know how to type HCESAR?"\n\n"H what?" asked the Galician, bewildered.\n\nHis new boss sighed. "The keyboard on the typewriter. In Spain you use QWERTY, here we use HCESAR. So you've got to learn to type, start over. And no, I am not getting you a Spanish typewriter, unless you want to take it up with Acquisitions. Now look, I'll teach you the important things. You'll notice there's no key for the number one, you use a lowercase L for that. There's also no zero, you use an uppercase O. For asterisks, you type lowercase X, then backspace, then a plus sign over it. And for the number sign, you just..." João's hands flew over the typewriter, manually setting the carriage to type two slashes over an equals sign, achieving '#'.\n\nCarlos nodded slowly.\n\nIn 1937, Salazar personally mandated HCESAR as the Portuguese typing format, and in life scorned any attempts at establishing an Iberian standard unless it meant HCESAR for all. After Salazar's passing and with an expanding federal bureaucracy, the government is beginning to discuss the problem."

Back then, just as the Republic crumbled, he never imagined he would be gone this long. In later years, after he was further forced to flee from France to Mexico, he never imagined he would be able to return. The return of democracy, flawed as he may have viewed it, finally opened that door.\n\n"The stewardess says we're getting close to Barcelona," whispered his wife Jacinta from the seat next to him. Picasso turned to smile and clasp her hand, but said nothing. He knew it was both an announcement and a warning.\n\nSure enough, within moments Picasso was able to see the Mediterranean on the horizon, glimmering under the sun. And right before it ran the new shoreline, that vast expanse of desolate land created by the dam. It stirred a deep repugnance in Picasso, and a chill ran through him. No amount of pictures could prepare him for the feeling of witnessing it in person, the sheer magnitude of Atlantropa's devastation. Even with some of the land put to use, it was beyond unnatural.\n\nThe artist settled back in his seat and rested his eyes, attempting to drown out his thoughts with the drone of the engine. Eighty-nine years coursed through his bones. They had seen him through a lot: his youth in Málaga, his establishment in Montmartre, the rise of Cubism, the strife of war, the Great Depression, his own depressions, all the friends he had made, all the women he had courted. Of late, the many lovely years in Mexico, of wine and good company in pleasant Acapulco. Nearly all of that - all those places, all those people - were spent and gone, vanished into time.

 IBR.3187.d:0 "Carolina, like many that morning, heard the news break on the radio: Pablo Picasso had died the night before, aged 91. Heart failure while hosting friends for dinner at his home in Sarrià, on the outskirts of Barcelona. Just like that, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century would never paint again. Trying and failing to think through the shock, Carolina acted on an impulse. She finished her coffee, grabbed her bag, and left home.\n\nOn the streets of Barcelona it seemed a normal spring day, the sun peeking into the tight cobblestone streets of the Gothic Quarter. Finding her way through the alleys, Carolina found the gates of the Picasso Museum already surrounded with flowers, lit candles, and a small crowd. She quickly bought her own candle from a passing vendor and laid it down. As the hours passed, the crowd would swell and spill all over the museum and the streets around it. Grand wreaths and floral arrangements would be set up, lone musicians and eventually bands would play, speeches were given.\n\nVigils of this sort, big and small, sprung up in Madrid, in Picasso's birthplace of Málaga, in Porto and Lisbon and across the world. For Iberia, he had been not only a great artist, but his return had marked a milestone in the transition to democracy, as if to confirm that it was not just their imagination that things were getting better. Carolina stayed in that vigil, which seemed more a celebration of life than a mourning of death, through to the afternoon and into the evening."

 IBR.3190.t:0 "The Death of Picasso" ##Exiled version
 IBR.3190.d:0 ""Picasso is dead," proclaimed the garrison commander, repeating what everyone had already heard on the radio. "He died last night, exiled in Mexico. He was a communist, and there are reports that his comrades will take to the streets. As his birthplace, Málaga is expected to be one of these hotspots. It falls to us to stop them".\n\nThe Málaga garrison of the Policía Armada raised their arms in salute, all clad in grey. Miguel, corporal, felt his heart swell. He almost wished there were an insurrection, that they might draw out the reds and crush them. There were few opportunities for glory in this town, he thought.\n\nThe reality was less than what he'd hoped for. Through long hours of patrol, the day proved painfully normal, and it was only later in the day that people began to timidly gather outside Picasso's childhood home, leaving flowers and lit candles. It was already dusk, the sun dipping beyond the hills, when Miguel's patrol finally saw some action in the blocks around the house. A band of giggling young men sped past them, running from another patrol that they had been hurling insults at. Most got away, but Miguel managed to bound forward and grab one by the collar with a gloved hand, making him shriek.\n\nPulling the him back to have a better look, Miguel found wide, fearful eyes on the round face of a boy, maybe 15 years old. The policeman sneered and snatched the papers the youth clutched in his hands. It was a poor catch, more trouble than it was worth to process. He chose to simply smack the boy across the head and tossed him back out on the street. "Behave yourself," he instructed, as the boy scampered home. If nothing else, Miguel had imparted a valuable lesson today. He glanced at the papers he had confiscated, some black-and-white prints of Picasso's artworks. Stretched limbs, deformed faces, meaningless shapes. Hideous. Miguel ripped it up and continued the search for communist agitators."

 IBR.3191.d:0 "The tiny cup of tea shook in Manuel's hands as he lifted it to his lips. The shaking had started at some point of his more than 20 years of captivity in Timor. Maybe halfway through, but it had only become noticeable for him when he held a glass and watched the liquid slosh around, spilling over the rim. It took willpower and concentration to drink from his mother's tea set without making a mess, and Manuel took almost as much satisfaction from mastering his hands as he did from the tea.\n\nThe set was the same his mother had owned before he left for the Portuguese colonies, good porcelain painted with blue glazing, in the style of azulejos. It had been her most valued possession back in the 30's, and only brought out on special occasions. Much in the living room had not changed. The photos on the walls, the furniture, the little figurine of Saint Anthony upon the cabinet.\n\nMany other things were different, of course. His father died of bowel cancer in 1957, he had been told on the way to Lisbon. His mother was old, deeply wrinkled, her hair stark white. His siblings were now about as old as his parents were when he had left. The change that he expected to be the most dramatic was the fact that his country no longer existed. Except it did, in a sense, and he felt no great difference living in Iberia than he had in Portugal.\n\nHomes had television sets, and the cars and clothes were all strange to him, but in the end he was drinking tea from the same tea set, under the same roof, in the same city with the same streets. It felt as if the places and the people he once knew had been replaced and were now pretending to be his Portugal. Manuel knew it was silly, but the feeling could not be erased any more than he could stop his hands from shaking."

A master of ceremonies stepped out on the stage.\n\n"And now, respectable audience, I present to you: Castañuela 70!" he proclaimed with a flourish, each word more triumphant than the last. A dozen performers followed him on the stage as the band started back up and the actors broke into song.\n\nIn the span of ten minutes, the crowd began to chuckle, then giggle, then roar with laughter and applause as the play hit them with one ridiculous sketch after another. It was a rambunctious, merciless parody of such topics as private property, advertising, television, imperialism, family, sex and the rich. The crowd found it to be vibrant, joyful, and as hilarious as it was transgressive. Just a year ago such a play would never have made it through the censors. The atmosphere was thrilling, as if the audience was collectively indulging in their favorite guilty pleasure.\n\nCritics had been right: Castañuela 70 was unlike anything ever presented in Iberia and, despite the denouncement from conservative sectors, it appeared as if Iberians had an appetite for precisely this kind of comedy."

The act was committed by a group of falangist youths, who answered with angry cries of "Arriba Iberia!". As the play continued, it was interrupted with further cries and insults against the actors and the crowd, and the troupe were forced to stop the performance when fights broke out. Guardia Civil were called to break up the unrest, dragging away the people they had identified as communists.

Now, with the release of his newest studio album "Mediterráneo", singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat has undeniably become one of the country's major cultural exports, topping the charts across the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds.\n\nNicknamed "El Noi del Poble-sec" after the Barcelona neighborhood where he grew up, Serrat's particular blend of strident singing, nostalgic lyrics, classic guitar and orchestral backing band has captivated listeners worldwide. Tours throughout the Americas have earned him awards and televised performances in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, on top of his enormous popularity at home.\n\nAn early member of the so-called "Nova Cançó", a movement to revitalize Catalan music, Serrat is no stranger to politics. The son of an anarchist who was part of the CNT during the Civil War, the AAS had kept an eye on his activities since he first came to prominence in the mid-60's, censoring several songs in Catalan and others critical of the Caudillos. Since the turn of the decade, Serrat's politics appear to have mellowed out, and his singing in Spanish now draws criticism from Catalans that he has "sold out". Either way, he continues to sell out concerts across Catalonia."

Her outfit and hairstyle changed a bit over the years, but it had been this way every Sunday morning ever since she was a little girl. Her husband, on the other hand...\n\nAvelino Hoyo dipped a sweet roll into his coffee, savoring it as he lounged on the couch in his pajamas. Blanca loved her husband, she really did, but she did wish he would take Church more seriously. "Ave, get your clothes on, will you?"\n\n"Nah, I have a headache. I don't feel like going to church today."\n\n"Come on now, what will the neighbors think?"\n\n"Who, Jordi? He won't notice. Adelina? She's a bitch anyway."\n\n"Ave, watch your language, this is serious. What if the police chief finds out? He could become suspicious!"\n\n"So what if he does? I'm not doing anything wrong, unless drinking coffee or reading the newspaper are crimes now. The police don't care about this stuff anymore, it's not their job to investigate those who don't go to church."\n\nBlanca was irritated, but she remained silent. Her husband was right. No more was the Iberian State tightly bound to the Catholic Church. Avelino would not face any consequences for skipping church, except, perhaps, from the Lord himself.

Televisions had been ubiquitous in Iberian households for a while now, but with little to watch besides the news and subtitled American TV shows, no one show was anywhere near universally watched. Un, dos, tres is different.\n\nA huge ad campaign preceded the release of Iberia's first television game-show, and when the first episode aired on April 24th, it somehow exceeded the already high expectations of excited viewers\n\nWhere other shows have one theme and stuck to it, contestants in Un, dos, tres have three rounds. In the first 'Question' round, 3 couples compete to give as many answers to questions as possible without a wrong answer or repeating a previous answer. The winning couple gets to skip a round, while the two losing couples have to face each other in a second 'Elimination' round, in which contestants face physical challenges, of which the winners face the winners of the first round in the third 'Auction' round. Before that, though, an intermission with dancing, music, and sometimes comedy sketches, plays. The 'Auction' round has contestants participate in various gambling games for money and prizes, different games every episode. In the final part of the show, they would negotiate with the host for either cash or a final prize, ranging from worthless gag-prizes to luxurious prizes worth many thousands of pesetas.\n\nUn, dos, tres is made by and for Iberian audiences, with episodes filmed in Spanish but also dubbed for broadcast in Portugal. With the enormous amount of viewership the show has seen in just its first few episodes, Televisión Iberia is already trying to negotiate for episodes of the show with foreign subtitles to air elsewhere in Europe."

This once-quiet beach 6 miles north of Bilbao has become something of a tourist attraction in recent years. Travelling there requires no special planning, but nonetheless carries a certain aura of adventure. The Karlsson family had been quite anxious to travel there. Temperate enough that the summer sun was not too painful and the risk of sunburn low, but still warm enough that swimming was enjoyable. Surfing, too, if only they could figure out how to stay balanced on a board.\n\nBut it would be foolish to swim amidst the Atlantic waves after sunset, with nobody to see or hear you if you were pulled into the deep. And so, after many hours that had left the Karlssons satisfied and sore, it was time to return to the hotel. Yes, the hotel--where was it again? There were countless hotels in Sopelana, none particularly distinctive. Johann was beginning to regret picking an inexpensive hotel farther from the beach. Wandering on the streets, the Karlssons became more concerned as the sky turned ever darker. Finally, they caved in. It was time to get some help. "Hotel? Hotel?" Johann asked to someone he presumed was a local.\n\n"¿Si, cual hotel?"\n\nJohann tried to remember what the hotel looked like, and in his best Spanish choked out "Hotel. Aah.. blanca... blanca hotel, av farmaci! Blanca hotel av farmaci, y de grande calle. Saber tú?"\n\nHearing Spanish that bad was a bit frustrating, but Fernando had gotten more used to it with time. "¿Un hotel blanco cerca de la farmacia? Se llama 'Casa de San Isabel'."\n\n"Si, Muchas gracias!" Johann was relieved he could spend his night in a comfortable bed, in an air-conditioned room with his family. This, he thought, was the right decision. Iberia made for a perfect vacation."

Joan-Josep demanded.\n\n"Sit down. Now. Do as I say." said the officer, as he pointed his rifle directly at the old man. Joan-Josep complied, sitting down, filled with terror. "Don Comelade, is it?" The officer relaxed his arm, letting his rifle point towards the floor. "Is anyone else in this building?"\n\n"No sir."\n\n"Don Comelade, we have reason to believe that you or someone else in this building is involved in an arms smuggling operation for the CNT. I just need to ask you a few questions. Is there anybody else who lives here with you?"\n\n"No, my wife passed away three years ago."\n\n"Do you possess any weapons?"\n\n"No. Never once."\n\n"Thank you for your cooperation, Don Comelade. I will sit here with you while the Agency conducts a brief search. We will be done soon."\n\nJoan-Josep had heard of things like this happening to others before. Innocent people whose homes were stormed by the AAS. But Joan-Josep was not innocent, he knew it. The souls of those Nationalists he gunned down in the trenches of Aragon 29 years ago knew it too. Surely, he had nothing in his house from those old days. Surely, the AAS would not find anything. Surely, he would be safe. Minutes felt like hours, the agent watching over Joan-Josep offering only the heartless gaze of the White Terror. But he did not die that day. "Thank you Mr. Comelade. Apologies for the interruption, go on with your business." The agent stood up, and along with the other agents, wordlessly left. There Joan-Josep still sat, still petrified."

 IBR.3200.d:0 "In the early decades of the 19th century, after Portugal had ended its inquisition, hundreds of wealthy Jews came to the Azores. Free of the tax obligations on the peninsula itself, their businesses could thrive there. Thus, Porta Delgada became the beating heart of Portugal's Jewish community. But that was a century ago, and now, most of the Jews of Porta Delgada did not possess the wealth that their ancestors had. Most now worked for Catholic employers, facing the same problems that Jews everywhere had faced for centuries.\n\nLongshoreman Salvator Abohbot knew this well. His supervisor seemed to always suspect him of making mistakes, looking at him like he was a criminal. He had a penchant for screaming at workers for "laziness", but was especially aggressive toward Salvator. Everyone knew Salvator was Jewish, of course, his surname was a dead giveaway. And Salvator was not alone in suspecting that that was the reason why his supervisor was particularly hard on him.\n\nA few days ago, after Salvator and another employee received a particularly egregious punishment, the workers started talking. Their supervisor was a short-tempered and hateful man. He had no regard for their safety. Tomorrow, they were going to stop working. At 10:00AM, they left the harbor. Their supervisor screamed, declaring this an illegal strike. But his workers didn't come back. Instead, they went to the media.\n\nThe story spread, and by the next morning the dailies widely reported on the protest--and Salvator's explanation of what triggered it. Perhaps a censor had approved the interview without reading it, or didn't think it inflammatory, but that afternoon dozens of longshoremen, other workers, and Jews from across the city joined in a public protest. When police came to break up the protest, the situation escalated into a minor riot. Three buildings were torched, and more than 30 demonstrators, among them Salvator Abohbot, had been arrested. These are the largest protests that the Azores have ever seen, and they reveal long hidden tensions between the Jews, the Laborers, and the Employers, of Porta Delgada."

A brilliant tactician, a ruthless warrior, and a radical conservative sympathetic to the goals of Nazism. He led the Blue Division of Spanish volunteers in the Second World War, and marched into Leningrad alongside the Heer and the SS. In the aftermath of the war, rumors swirled that Hitler sought to overthrow Franco and Salazar to make Muñoz Grandes his puppet caudillo. Thankfully, Iberia remains free, and in the decades after the war, Muñoz Grandes served faithfully as one of Iberia's top military commanders and political advisors.\n\nA vibrant and lively man well into the 1960s, his health deteriorated rapidly in his final months. He went to sleep the evening of July 11th, and his heart stopped shortly before midnight.\n\nGrandes was a bonafide celebrity among the Iberian far-right, the Falange, and among Spanish nationalists, and they mourn his death with great reverence. But many other people are, truth be told, quite pleased to hear that the man is finally dead. They would not dare to say it in public, but the disdain Grandes held towards reform, towards even the barest deviation from his hardline conservatism, made him a symbol of everything wrong with the Iberian government in the eyes of liberals and reformists across the Peninsula. In the city of Málaga, some elderly residents recalled that he had led the army that slaughtered thousands of alleged 'Republicans', among them neighbors, friends, and family, in the bloodshed of February 1937.\n\nThe death of Muñoz Grandes marks not just the end of one of Iberia's most notorious leaders, but also serves as a reminder of the great age of many in Iberia's top leadership. Salazar also died recently, and Francisco Franco is 76 years old. What will the Iberian government look like in 10 years, or 5, or even just 1 year from today?"

Looking at his well-kempt appearance and semi-formal dress, nobody he met on the street would guess that he lived out of his station wagon.\n\nIf there was one thing Rafael loved about travelling from city to city across the Iberian peninsula, it was the food. Few other places on Earth could claim to be home to so diverse a set of regional cuisines, and a little while ago, he had heard of a culinary innovation in the city of Porto. Ham and linguiça between two slices of bread. Top slice covered in melted cheese, the whole sandwich covered by a spicy beer sauce.

A week months later, she was killed when a mortar struck the house. The weeks after were hard, the image of mother's blood-soaked, gelatinized face haunting her in both her waking hours and in her nightmares. The months after were hard too. It never stopped being hard after mama died, not even in 1971. She wasn't the only one to lose a mother. Far too many mothers died in the war. At least Ramira was lucky enough to have a caring husband to rely on, old enough to survive and rebuild her life, and one day raise children of her own.\n\nWhat of those less lucky, those left orphaned and homeless? What of the children and the infants? Ramira could never bring back her own mother, or any of the mothers of the children he worked for in the Auxilio Social. But she could offer a warm meal every night, a mattress to sleep on, a chance to learn the Gospels, perhaps, even, offer a conversation to a lonely boy or girl. Ramira joined the Auxilio Social because she cared for children and could understand their pain.\n\nA lot had changed in the decades since mother's death. The Nationalists won the war, and molded the Auxilio Social into an institution to provide for, educate, and indoctrinate, orphaned youths. After the Union formed, she was chosen to lead operations in the Portuguese city of Setúbal. And now, after the end of the Caudillos' reign, the new government had shuttered Auxilio Social entirely on account of its propagandizing. But Ramira wasn't going to stop living after her mom died, she wasn't going to give up working after Auxilio Social was dissolved.\n\nAfter receiving her husband's permission, Ramira purchased the Auxilio Social building. By soliciting donations and recruiting former coworkers, she would rebuild the Auxilio Social, at least in Setúbal. It would take a while to recover from the loss of government support. But as long as there existed death, crime, and suffering, there would be children in need. And that fact alone drove Ramira to keep working."

"Icíar!" she screamed in desperation.\n\n"Did you lose someone?" asked a middle aged woman whom Molina did not recognize, who had her own child in tow.\n\n"My daughter.

They have gathered to witness the final game of the Caudillos' Cup, and excitement is through the roof. This is sure to be the most widely seen sporting event in Iberian history, with over half of the population tuning in to witness the match by Television or Radio.\n\nThe Caudillos' Cup was founded in 1949, a tournament in which the 14 teams of Portugal's Primeira Liga, 16 teams of Spain's La Liga, and 2 Colonial teams have faced off. Though intended to promote Pan-Iberian pride, Portuguese fans have in recent years found themselves disappointed. The last time a Portuguese team won the cup was in 1957, and in every year since 1960, the Final has been played between 2 Spanish teams. Real Madrid is near universally agreed to be the best team in the country, having won all but 2 championship games in the past 10 years. However, Portuguese team S.L. Benfica has seen increasing success in recent years, and after defeating Atlético Madrid in the semifinals, now faces Real Madrid for the title of 1970 Champion.\n\nReal Madrid's star player Amancio Amaro had an excellent shot at the goal 4 minutes into the game, but it was successfully covered by Benfica's goalkeeper José Henrique. Henrique is one of the best goalkeepers Iberia has ever seen, and his ironclad defense held against Madrid's offense many times through the match. At 35 minutes, Benfica's António Simões scored a surprise goal, sending Portuguese fans, and for that matter Spaniards rooting for the underdog, into near hysterical celebration.\n\n71 minutes in, Real Madrid's Manuel Velázquez set up an extraordinary cross to Francisco Gento, scoring a goal and tying the game 1-1. At 73 minutes, a tragedy: José Henrique twists his ankle while blocking a shot. Benfica has lost perhaps its single most valuable player, with the much less experienced backup Manuel Bento taking his place. Madrid's offense redoubles their efforts, but Bento holds on. Tension builds across the nation as the game nears its 90th minute, and at 88 minutes, Benfica's António Simões prepares to head the ball. The ball ricochets off Simões' head, and flies toward the goal. Madrid's goalkeeper Antonio Betancort leaps to block it..."

Portuguese fans are absolutely deflated by the loss. In the aftermath, viewers and listeners of the Union are left asking themselves questions. What if Henrique had not been injured?

The small Iberian exclave of Llívia, with a population of only a few hundred, has now been inundated with no fewer than 4000 refugees. Border officials in the State of Girona have opted to temporarily 'contain' refugees in the exclave until receiving orders to either admit them into Iberia proper or deny them entry.\n\nSmaller groups of migrants have appeared at other border towns, and even isolated cases of Frenchmen illegally crossing the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains to enter our country have been reported. Immigration to Iberia is virtually unheard of, and Border Customs are not in any shape to handle a sudden crisis of this magnitude.\n\nSalazar generally believes that the Iberian government should work to guarantee the safety of the refugees, both due to moral concerns, and in order to improve the international image of the Iberian government. However, he shares Franco's concerns that leftist extremists living in France may take advantage of the crisis to infiltrate the country. After all, tens of thousands of Spanish Republicans who fled the country after the Spanish Civil War had taken residence in France.\n\nSalazar proposes to organize a small military taskforce to bring refugees to Lisbon as quickly as possible. From there, they may opt for sea transportation to another country, or opt to undergo a vetting process and obtain Iberian residency. Franco believes that this approach carries too many security risks, and instead proposes to allow only a limited number of refugees into Iberia, to be held in internment camps until they can be thoroughly vetted or until travel to another host country may be arranged.

How glad he was to enumerate the census at this time of year, rather than under the oppressive heat of the African summer sun. For 4 hours he drove his van southwards, into the heart of the Sahara. There were no roads here, only miles of indistinguishable dunes. Dunes could blur together, it was easy to lose your bearings here.\n\nThat was what Zdan was there for. He had grown up in this desert, and even more importantly, he was a native Tamazight. These were truly remote lands, nearly untouched since ancient times, few spoke any other language, not even Arabic. "Over there!" Zdan yelled, spotting through binoculars a stone tower peeking above the dunes. Pulling closer they found an old walled village: Aïn Chaïr, its sandstone buildings seeming more like something out of Medieval times than today.\n\nAs the Iberians approached, a small band of pastoralists prepared to depart the city. Their eyes widened at the sight of the mysterious machine now before them, the rhythm of its engine coming to a halt as Alfonso and Zdan stepped out. Trucks were unheard of out here, and most knowledge of Europe came by the tales of traders.\n\nAn elderly man approached the vehicle, turning to Alfonso and asking "Vous Français?" Jeez, it really had been a long time since any Europeans were out here. Zdan chuckled and said something to the man in Tamazight. The man looked confused and responded in Arabic. Zdan asked questions and relayed them to Alfonso. The band was a tribe of 46 men, women, and children. Most spoke only 'Tabaldit', a language that neither Alfonso for Zdan had ever heard of, a few of the men spoke Arabic or Tamazight to trade at the oases. It had been many years since any of them had met a European in person; they had not even heard that the French had left Morocco. Alfonso tallied every man, woman, and child, in the band that day. No matter how far away from the roads, no matter the climate, no matter what the language: All would be counted in the 1962 Colonial Census."

Following amazing discoveries in Italy's Adriatic Salt flats, Iberia's Naval Hydrographic Institute has approved a scientific expedition to Cabrera. What had once been an uninhabited island, laying along an ancient trade route between Iberia and Italy, became the largest peninsula of Majorca-Minorca. The site of a small military base, members of the public are forbidden to enter the peninsula, which has left its salt flats largely unmolested by treasure-hunters and ripe with potential for discovery.\n\nHidden in a graveyard of rusted fishing vessels, a typical sight on the salt flats, major historical discoveries were made. Two shipwrecks dated to the Punic era, nine shipwrecks from the Roman era, and two downed Luftwaffe fighters were found and extensively documented in the expedition. Scattered medieval artifacts were also identified, but are too badly decayed to provide any particularly useful information. Most wrecks carried lead ingots from mines in what is now Andalusia towards Mediterranean cities. But by far the best preserved is a Roman ship which sank around 400 AD. The nearly 2000 amphorae on the ship were all originally filled with fermented fish sauce, an extremely popular export from Iberia enjoyed by rich and poor alike across the Roman Empire.\n\nThe assortment of finds on Cabrera has produced enough research material in just the two months since its discovery to fill multiple volumes of text. This and similar finds across the Mediterranean salt flats are sparking a revolution in underwater archaeology, which now seems to be the main interest of spanish archaeology students and researchers alike."

In addition to horses, ochre and charcoal paintings of deer and bison have been discovered. One particularly odd painting appears to depict a sort of sea-monster, perhaps a whale depicted by an artist who had only heard stories of them. Most of the artwork, particularly those near the cave entrance, date to around 10,000 years ago, but small paintings found deep within its caverns are well over 20,000 years old: potentially the oldest artwork in Human History.\n\nIn addition to paintings, several harpoons made of bones suggest a society which both frequently fished and frequently hunted. Most impressive of all, an artistic or perhaps ceremonial item was found: A part of a stag's antler carved into a lifelike Goat's head.\n\nThis is not the first ancient cave discovered in Asturias, but the age and the complexity of the art here hints that the culture of early humans may have been much more sophisticated than previously assumed. Archaeologists are sure to study this cave for years to come."

Discovered underneath a farm estate in Albacete, dozens of rectangular stone bricks, four lion statues, and reliefs depicting various spirits and deities, were reconstructed into a 10-meter tall Mausoleum.\n\nThe size, design, and ornateness of his tomb indicates that the man once entombed there was the mighty king of an Iberian kingdom. "The King of Pozo Moro", as he is now called, is a mysterious man. Living in the late 6th century BC, the king would have likely had contact with some of the first Greek traders to come to Iberia's shores, the new trade routes bringing him and his kingdom great wealth. The artistic depiction of the gods covering his tomb are heavily evocative of Phoenician and Neo-Hittite influence. Unfortunately, he died around 500 BC, mere decades before writing was brought to Iberia, and no remains of his body could be found at the excavation site. As such, neither the size nor name of his kingdom, nor his identity, accomplishments, or lifestyle, can be determined.\n\nNonetheless, the discovery of the mausoleum has stirred great excitement within the archaeological community, being both one of the oldest and one of the largest artifacts left by the poorly understood ancient Iberian peoples."

Developing a love for tailoring, he showed astounding ability to turn dress designs into real outfits from an early age, and in 1919 founded a haute couture boutique. He had a talent for exactly copying paper drawings into real dresses, fitted perfectly to both the desire and form of his patrons, and soon his boutique developed into a small, regionally popular fashion brand. Ingratiating himself with the French fashion design community, he moved to Paris to escape the Civil War and to New York to escape the World War. His designs for Hollywood and Broadway stars made him one of the most famous and influential fashion designers in world history.\n\nWhat distinguished Balenciaga most from other fashion designers was his challenging of fashion norms, and of what 'fashion design' itself meant. At a time when 'high fashion' usually meant dresses to highlight the figures of tall, attractive young women, Balenciaga frequently designed for older women, short women, and overweight women. He made designs which hid rather than accentuated hips and breasts. His best known and most influential design was his "baby-doll dress" which mimicked the conservative and highly feminine appearance of dresses of 19th century aristocrats, but which did not require a corset.\n\nNearly all fashion lines today have been inspired or changed in some way by Balenciaga. His decision to retire and return to Iberia in 1968 signalled the end of an era for fashion worldwide, including in Iberia itself. Universally agreed to be the greatest Iberian fashion designer in history, news of his death made headlines worldwide, with hundreds of magazines publishing long memoirs to him and his work."

Deeply concerned, her friend recommends that she see a doctor, and to Adela's great surprise: The doctor tells her that she was, in fact, a he. At once relieved to know and frightened by its implications, 'Adela' assumes a new identity: Juan, and Juan must now navigate his way through a society that could not hope to comprehend his identity change. After facing many struggles, the movie ends with Juan obtaining a satisfying job, and marrying Isabelita.\n\n'My Dearest Señorita' has proved an unexpected hit among Iberian audiences, and has become the subject of great controversy. The movie's supporters praise it as a satirical work which highlights the absurdity of society's different expectations for men and women through an equally absurd story. Its critics deride it as a disgusting mockery of Iberian gender roles and relationships, especially objecting to the strong implication that Isabelita and Juan were attracted to eachother when he was still 'Adela.'\n\nBut to a small underground community in Iberia, the movie is something else entirely. To them 'My Dearest Señorita' is the story of a transgender man undergoing a transition in a society unable to view the concept as anything but delusion and perversion, and that its acceptance by mainstream audiences could only be achieved with such an overtly ridiculous plot.

'La gran familia', a film which premiered December 20th, is about exactly such a family. The film does not exactly have a singular story. It is more like a collection of many short films, each a snapshot into the lives of the family members. Though mainly comedic, these scenes also highlight the tensions of family life, such as the stress that teenagers face preparing for final exams, the immense anxiety characters feel when a toddler goes missing for several hours, or the yearning the children have to own a television, which their family has yet to be able to afford.\n\nSeveral commentators have noted the strong National Catholic subtext of the film. The father is a model of a family patriarch: Strict but not cruel, confident but not vain, hard working, and a devout Catholic. The mother is proud to have birthed so many children, is obedient to her husband, thorough in her housework, and instills in her children responsibility and Catholic morals. Several lines of dialogue seem to encourage the viewers themselves to produce their own 'familias grandes'.\n\nLa gran familia has enjoyed the best release of any Iberian Christmas movie in history.

Its opening weekend release sold over three times as many tickets as 'The City is Not for Me' did four years ago.\n\nThe story revolves around two men. One man's gynecology office is failing because he is so attractive that he makes his clients' husbands jealous. The other man's dressmaking business is thriving because he is perceived as non-threatening by his clients' husbands. This, the dressmaker explains, is because he pretends to be homosexual. The two men help each other to obtain one-night stands, but rumors spread that the men are, in fact, a gay couple. Hilarious situations ensue as their suspected abnormal perversions turn them into pariahs and threaten to destroy their businesses and personal relationships.\n\nConservative critics have criticized the film for its bawdiness, but otherwise, the film has proven uncontroversial.

The film tells the story of Julio, a 19 year old boy who moves from the country into Lisbon, feeling alienated by the city, isolated by his distance from parents, and anxious over his financial prospects. He begins seeing a girl named Ilda, but as Julio grows increasingly stressed and paranoid, their relationship falls apart.\n\nThe Green Years is critically acclaimed, already regarded as an artistic Masterpiece of Iberian cinema. The Green Years centers around Julio's attempts to find a place for himself in urban society, as well as the harsh realities of everyday life. It stands in contrast to more conventional crime or action dramas: Rather than providing the viewer with escapism, it forces the viewer to question their own lives and their own place in society, at a time when the very world seems to teeter on the brink of destruction."

 IBR.3227.t:0 "The Academic Crisis" 
 IBR.3227.d:0 "In 1956, Concerned that socialist beliefs were taking root in Portuguese universities, the Caudillos implemented restrictions on students' ability to organize on campus. This backfired, triggering sizable anti-government student protests. The anniversary of the first protest has come to be known as "Student's Day", and once a year, reform-minded Iberian students peacefully protest for greater academic freedom, trusting that their youth and high social status will deter police retaliation.\n\nIn the past four years, these protests have become more explicitly anti-governmental and radical in their demands. Thus, 6 weeks ago the Caudillos prohibited all Student's Day events indefinitely. While most would-be protestors caved to the demands, students at the University of Lisbon arranged a massive strike: As many as 70% of students have stopped attending classes and turning in assignments. They not only demand the reversal of the Student's Day ban, but for wider freedom of speech and organization on campus, and an end to racially and ideologically motivated restrictions on student admissions.\n\nThis protest received little attention at first, leading organizers to adopt a more extreme approach: A mass hunger strike. Over 1000 students filled the UoL's cafeteria, in the single largest protest in Portugal since Salazar took office. The protests must end, lest images of malnourished students appear in the press--or worse.\n\nBoth Caudillos favor the obvious option of sending police to detain the students for a few days and suck the life out of the protest. Some reformist advisors fear that this could backfire and lead to more outrage. Notably, current rector of UoL and former high-ranking minister Marcello Caetano has argued that most of the students' demands are reasonable, and acceding to those demands would weaken support for the other, unacceptably radical proposals. Other advisors bite back that giving the protestors an inch will only encourage more radical protests in the future.\n\nUltimately, however, the Caudillos would not stand idly by as their authority was challenged."

 IBR.3228.t:0 "Caetano Resigns in Solidarity with Protestors"
 IBR.3228.d:0 "The events of recent weeks have dramatically changed the culture at the University of Lisbon. The flame of liberty still burns in Iberia, however weakly. Reformist academics have been roused to action by the student protests, and now seek to continue the struggle for increased freedoms. Marcelo Caetano, a former close associate of Caudillo Salazar and the current dean at the University of Lisbon, has announced his resignation in protest of the government's repression of student expression and academic freedom.\n\nCaetano is something of a political maverick. In broad strokes he is supportive of the ideology and policies espoused by Salazar, but he is also an outspoken proponent of sweeping education reform. Though he was a prominent member of the Portuguese government during the 1940s, Franco's deep suspicions of Caetano and his intentions led to him being sidelined upon the establishment of the Union. While he continues to maintain a regular correspondence with Salazar and serves as one of his advisors in unofficial capacity, he holds no office and it is doubtful he will anytime soon.\n\nStill, as one of the only Portuguese reformers both liked and respected by Salazar, it is not unthinkable that Caetano might one day return to prominence."

 IBR.3229.d:0 "Colonial slavery began with Portugal. The first Portuguese settlements in Guiné became the first large slave depots for European colonists. For four centuries, tens of thousands of Africans were shipped every single year from Guiné to the colonies of the New World in chains. Colonial slavery also ended with Portugal. Portuguese merchants sailing from Guiné sending the final slaves to Brazil when that country abolished the trade.\n\nPortuguese administrators struggled to find alternative uses for the colony, ultimately coming to rely on modestly profitable peanut farms used to produce cooking oil. On the eve of the unification, Guiné was an economic burden. Peanut prices had fallen dramatically, and most farmers had returned to subsistence rice farming. The cost of maintaining control of Guiné far exceeded its profits. Businessman António Silva had owned successful cashew orchards in Goa, but his fortunes there dashed by the Indian invasion, in 1947 he began to build a new cashew empire in Guiné.\n\nIn the 1950s Silva successfully lobbied for high tariffs on foreign-grown cashews. He launched an extensive advertising campaign for his cashews across Iberia, and in 1956 turned his first annual profit. Enticed, various investors pitch in, and the cashew orchards greatly expanded by the end of the decade. As the second generation of cashew trees grow tall enough to produce fruit, in 1962 cashews are becoming cheaper and more widely available throughout Iberia.\n\nAfter consideration by the Colonial Budget Committee, it is agreed that native land may be expropiated for the development of new orchards, and Africans may have their sentences commuted by choosing to serve a half-length sentence in the cashew orchards. Now, Guiné prospers, more profitable than it was any other year post-abolition."

 IBR.3230.d:0 "Khadidiatou was no stranger to bandit raids. It had not been this bad even just a few years ago, but ever since the Amadou Gang had acquired trucks, Southern Mauritania had been a low-grade war zone. Militiamen now guarded the outskirts of the town of Aleg. Years of raids had turned the Aleg Militia larger and more experienced. Usually the Amadous picked easier targets.\n\nPatrols were scarce in this remote corner of the Iberian Empire, and Khadidiatou preferred it that way. The Europeans were thieving taxmen, no more than another gang of Bandits too numerous and well armed for the militia to dare resist. Not that they would want to resist--after all it was the Iberians who supplied the militiamen with weapons and imported luxuries.\n\nA convoy of trucks appeared on the horizon. Iberians, of course, but why were they here? This was not a scheduled ammunition delivery or tax collection, and the convoy was twice as long as any Khadidiatou had ever seen. Dozens of European men, many armed with semi-automatic rifles, stepped out and began unloading cargo. Why were they here? Security? Aleg already had security! Sure, the occasional raid still took place, but at this point bandits stole less from the townspeople than the militiamen themselves.\n\nAnd if the Iberians are here because they think they can take out the bandit gangs..."

 IBR.3231.d:0 "It was a choice between ten years in prison, or five years in the cashew orchards. Food was more expensive these days, and Umaro was not about to let his family starve, even if it forced him to commit theft. Alas, the rice-seller alerted an officer whom Umaro had not seen, and as Umaro tried to flee, 20 kilograms of stolen rice weighed him down.\n\nHis wife and children had to join him in the orchard. If they refused, how would they eat? Little Harouna, all of four years old, gathered cashew fruits that had fallen to the ground alongside his seven year old sister Duwa. Umaro and his wife Jainaba sat at the shelling station, hammering at the cashew shells to expose the nuts within. Dust entered Jainaba's lungs, and she struggled to breathe as particles of toxic resin lodged itself in her windpipe. Umaro's left hand was blistered from the resin, his glove having partly torn, and needing to work another 40 hours to 'purchase' a new one.\n\nThe lodging was paltry at best: Blankets sprawled over a concrete floor, each man, woman, and child, packed side by side. Bathing consisted of being stripped naked in a line outdoors and sprayed down with hoses. The food was even worse. A bowl of rice twice a day. On Sundays Fufu, bland and unflavored. A tablespoon of peanut sauce or pepper sauce could be purchased for 10 hours work, but with frequent fines, most could not hope to afford this more than once a week.\n\nThe punishments were cruel and frequent on these long, 12 hour shifts. Move too slowly or too sloppily and be caned by the overseer's baton, or be fined for many hours pay. Try to rest for a second and risk being shocked by cattle prod. Many of the workers had scars on their faces, necks, and limbs. Women were typically scarred in other ways. The more 'creative' overseers had even collected resin to paint the skins of those punished, such that blisters would form into patterns and shapes.\n\nThese were facts of life in the orchards of Guiné."

 IBR.3232.d:0 "Sand dunes have a bad habit of burying things. The roads crossing the Moroccan and Algerian desert constantly must be maintained, carefully monitored for any signs of a sandfall. Just about the only thing more difficult than maintaining desert roads is laying them down. Pablo and his fellow surveyors laid down steel markers as they plotted the course for a new road. Officially, this was to promote regional commerce. In truth, this was to give Portuguese settlers a faster and safer path to illegally enter Algeria. As they moved further east, Pablo noticed a most unusual rock. There were many large rocks out here, but this one was much flatter than the others, an ever so slightly green-tinted color, and...was that rust? Was that cracked glass?\n\n"That's not a rock." Pablo said "Oh my God, that's not a rock."\n\nAs Pablo approached the truck, near completely buried by the sand, he shuddered to think of what he might see inside. Hand shaking, he brushed away the dust that obscured the window. There he found bodies. Sickly brown tissue clung tightly to dust-covered bones. Empty eye sockets and teeth almost forming smiles brought disquieting humanity to the emaciated husks before him. They were holding hands when they died, husband and wife surely. On the floor of the passenger seat rested a smaller corpse. Its skull was disarticulated from a torso wearing the tattered remnants of baby clothes.\n\nWho is to say what doomed this family to die here? A flat tire, an empty fuel tank, a failed ignition. There were many ways to get lost out here but no way to call for help."

Remember, your focus is speed: get to the target as quickly as possible. Weather permitting, it should take only 10 to 12 hours travel to reach the target. There you will set landmines and shoot at anything that moves: Truck, car, tank, helicopter, anything. As long as both roads are unusable, the Italians will have to take a 1000 mile detour to move anything from north to south. And the longer we keep blocking the Touggourt passage, the enemy can't keep all their forces at the frontline.""

His skin was pale, head adorned with only the few wisps of hair that refused to fall out, clinging on to life only by the tubes through his nose and throat. Carmen braced for the inevitable death of her husband. His daughter, also named Carmen, braced for the inevitable death of her father. A few minutes after midnight, Francisco Franco Bahamonde was taken off life support at the request of his family members.\n\nThe general who overthrew the Spanish Republic. The authoritarian reformer. Caudillo of the Iberian Union. Not since Phillip the Second's reign three centuries ago has Iberia seen any one man do so much to transform the politics, economy, and society of the Iberian Peninsula. But in his final years, Franco's grip on power rapidly deteriorated. A long time enemy of Democracy, he could not resist the wave of reformism coming from both his advisors and the Iberian public. His three and a half decades of authoritarian rule came to an end, and now, so has he.\n\nTo his supporters, he was the man who saved Spain from bolshevism and nazism, restored Spain to its Catholic roots, and created the Iberian Union. To those opposed to him, he was the monster responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the civil war, a man who oppressed women, native peoples, political opponents and regional minorities, to a truly abhorrent extent. A tyrant who kept Iberia in chains.\n\nRegardless of his legacy, today is a momentous day in our young nation's history."

To think, what she was doing right now was technically illegal. Indeed, she was being truthful about the cramps, but that was not why she had come here.\n\nContraception had always been illegal and non-reproductive sex was always severely stigmatized in Iberia. "Sex before marriage is a sin" her religious studies teacher had told her class over and over. "It is a woman's duty to have many children" her own parents had drilled into her from early childhood. "Without children, there would be no future" she had heard a thousand times, and a thousand times again.\n\nBut as much as the Catholic Church and the equally conservative Caudillos would like to deny it, attitudes about sex were changing.

 IBR.3247.t:0 "The Woman Mayor of Bilbao"
 IBR.3247.d:0 "Pilar Careaga organized her notes and adjusted her reading glasses. She was a very familiar face to the other Bilbao government officials, having served on the city council for five years. "Good morning everyone! Welcome to the Bilbao city council meeting July 9th 1969. Hopefully this will be a fast and efficient meeting--I guess that's up to me."\n\nTo have a woman sitting here today-not only hosting today's conference but sitting at the head of the local government, this was truly unprecedented, something not seen since before the Spanish Civil War. By all means, she was as qualified a woman as there was in the country, and as passionate an advocate for National Catholicism as any woman could be. But perhaps that made the situation even more unusual--to even think that a woman who fully believed that a woman's place in society was to be subservient to men would accept, much less actively seek out, such a high-ranking post!\n\nBut Careaga was always an ambitious woman. If she had not been, she would not have tried so hard to become an industrial engineer when no other woman had done the same. She certainly would not have succeeded. Being married to one of Iberia's top diplomats didn't exactly harm her political career either.\n\nAll that said, besides the novelty of having a woman in office, Careaga was not especially different than any other Iberian mayor. The Caudillos' main goal in appointing her was neither out of a benevolent expansion of womens' rights, nor a cynical move to assuage the rise in radicals' outrage at womens' lack of opportunities. Mayor Careaga had much more important issues to worry about, such as repairing the potholes that cratered the streets of Bilbao."

 IBR.4112.t:0 "Thanks aplenty, Franco"
 IBR.4112.d:0 "The University dorm room had seemed entirely ransacked, and by all means, would have been mistaken for a crime scene had it not been for the trio of students occupying the dinner table, metal cabinets, and wooden chairs, all bound together by a thick layer of paperwork, a lifeboat of desperation amid a sea of quiet contemplation of the future. The lights had long since been preemptively shut off by the students in anticipation of the power being shut off, and what little refrigerated foods remained in the house now laid on plates sitting on the collection of tables, staining rings into the printed paper, warmed only by the candles which lay on tin plates, serving as a fire hazard and absolute necessity to the terrified graduates. \n\n"Mateo, what options do we still have?" Carlita rapped her fingers on her collection of papers, half of them redundant. "Right, I think we've got this firm out of Lisbon, but we don't speak a word of Portuguese-" Santiago raised his hand. "-Except for me-" "-except for Santiago," Mateo confirmed, and continued: "so he's got that option if he really wants to move back, but as for us, I just don't know..." \n\n"Oh, don't act so ungrateful! We could always work as janitors for pennies on the dollar for our scholarships!" Santiago let out a heave of laughter, hushed by the fact he was the only one laughing. \n\nCarlita let out a sigh and pinched her eyebrows together. "Honestly, that is sounding more attractive by the minute, because I am not spending my years and diploma on a dog-shit job in slum-ville Madrid, might be worth it to actually just take the job and save face." The room went quiet, and the thought of the unthinkable bubbled up in their minds, like water boiling until steam came forth. For this trio of students, this steam was a candle extinguishing. "What if we left for Italy?" The words escaped Mateo's mouth just as easily as a sneeze would have, and the other two in the room reacted as if it had."
 IBR.4112.a:0 "Even still, no objections were raised."

 IBR.4113.t:0 "A Good Life, But Better Pay"
 IBR.4113.d:0 "The Madrid airport was rarely a monument to long lines or waiting businessmen, rarely was it a place where crowds would congregate, the most anyone would normally see is a small horde of Italians flowing in before the great Triumvirate alliance fell on its face. Now, however, the lobbies were filled with tearful goodbyes, and the gates were choked with a bizarre mix; businessmen with packed suitcases and gaudy suits, families with a collection of half-empty cloth bags, and a pair of ex-students, chatting in the dull smog of their cigarettes. "Mateo, you and your family, were you close?" Santiago looked up from the floor, and took another drag on his cigarette, his eyes watering through the cloud of smoke. \n\n"Sure, we were close, kinda. We talked once in awhile, I'd make sure to visit around once a month, but I always made the holidays. I made some kinda amends with my pops, and so long as this whole gamble works out well, there won't be anything to worry about in terms of patching things up." The gaze of the two flicked back to the floor, the gentle din of conversation around them muting their thoughts on the subject. At that moment, Carlita walked to the duo of smokers, letting out a deep sigh of exasperation, and letting in a breath of smoke, which started a coughing fit she could hardly stifle. \n\n"How'd that go? Your folks doing alright?" Santiago asked, Carlita hardly recomposed from the smoke. \n\n"Oh, sure, they're just fine, thanks. At least my parents can say they know I'm out of the country. They're not exactly sweating this 'stagnation' stuff, they're not exactly losing sleep or zeroes out of this, right?" She grinned, and leaned against the wall, fishing around her pockets for a stray cigarette. Santiago looked back to the floor, and took another drag. Mateo looked through the smoke around him, his friends hardly visible through its veneer. He could not be for certain, though he could have sworn that he saw some beads of water in his close friend's eyes."

 IBR.4114.d:0 "Walking with his hands clasped with Sarah just behind the dozen or so tourists half-conscious from the redeye flight into Madrid terminal, Mateo paused. Sarah looked at him and smiled. \n\n"You haven't come this far for cold feet, don't kid yourself. They'll forgive you, and you don't even know if they're upset, c'mon." She extended her arm towards Mateo. He smiled back and took her hand. Walking towards the small crowd of people looking out at the returning families, there were a scattered few parents and grandparents, and a pair of parents squinting into the crowd. Stepping to the side of a family embracing their grandparents, Mateo's parents stood there. A beat passed, and their faces lit up as bright as the sun. \n\n"Mateo! Where've you been?!" \n\n"Is this Sarah? She's beautiful!" \n\n"Are Americans as miserable as we thought?" \n\nThe drive home was about as insufferable as Mateo had predicted, if not for the same reasons as he'd feared. Now, however, the true challenge would come. America wasn't exactly everything it was made up to be, and the bigger pay for doctors back home wasn't exactly dissuading. Carlita and Santiago had gotten better luck with finding work in Florida, but Mateo hadn't been as lucky, except for in one particular department. While Grandpa Franco had promised a job for himself -and there was always a job somewhere in Madrid for veterinarians, so Sarah was covered- the issue of finding a place to stay had begun to rear its ugly head, even if the answer was clear as day for the time being. Looking to Sarah talking with his parents in the rudimentary Spanish she did know, however, Mateo felt a spark of hope in his chest."

 IBR.4115.t:0 "The Days of Black Wheat"
 IBR.4115.d:0 ""DEATH TO THE BUREAUCRATS! STOP THE STEAL! END THE PRODUCTION HIKES!"\n\nBy the time Marcos had arrived, a small crowd had gathered in front of Espinoza Farm, curious to see what the disturbance was. As he turned off his police siren and parked his car, he could sense something was not quite right. Clawing his way through the shouts and whoops of the crowd, Marcos finally saw what was happening. It was the scorching heat that hit him, causing him to stagger back. In the middle of the farm courtyard, there lay a colossal, brilliant orange fireball. So bright was the fire that none of the spectators could even look at it without squinting.\n\nSurrounding the fire was the Garcia family chanting, as if they were in the middle of some occult ceremony that only they understood. The grizzled patriarch of the farm, Mateo picked up a box of wheat and threw it into the fireplace, where it was immediately ripped apart by the flames.\n\n"Are you going to arrest me? This is my property!" Mateo jabbed a finger at Marcos, scowling. The crowd quietened, and Marcos recognised most of the gathering from the local farmer markets in Toledo that he used to visit with his father.\n\n"Mr Garcia, I understand you're angry about the new policy, bu-"\n\n"Angry? I've barely enough food to feed my family, and those bastards want more? Why not take it all away, then? In fact, why not just shoot me? Would that please those white-collar rats?" The soft murmuring of the crowd reached its crescendo as Garcia spoke. Some began to chant the slogans of the Garcias, while others performed impromptu versions of the national anthem.\n\nThis was too much. One policeman - a policeman who was more used to heckling hooligans than dealing with a protest - wasn't going to be able to handle this. As he turned to his car, Marcos realised that he could see a smoke plume on the horizon. Then, another popped up. Then another, peppering the entire horizon with the black fury of the working farmer."

 IBR.4116.d:0 "Four men sat around the table in a small Madrid office. At one end sat Segismundo Lozano, wealthy investor and former logging magnate. At the other sat his fellow investors Juan Esteban and Aquilino Nieto. Old acquaintances traded cordial greetings and confident handshakes, but the pleasantries ended as Aquilino slid a small stack of papers across the table. Lozano skimmed the first page of the report before him: Forestry exports were...falling? "Gentleman, what am I looking at here?"\n\nAquilino replied, "Part of a report on the primary sector. Independently commissioned.."\n\nLozano's brow furrowed. No, those numbers didn't seem right. That didn't seem right at all. Production quotas were 5% higher this year, specifically in order to promote exports. The government had made certain of that. How could sales fall that much, that quickly? "20 percent?! Are you sure all this is correct?"\n\n"Never been more certain in my life."  Aquilino paused for a moment. "It's based on a mountain of data, ship manifests, business' sale numbers, a whole bunch else, and we're seeing the same patterns in every city. The additional production...I can't say where it all went, but it ain't being sold"\n\nJuan interjected "It's the 'reforms'. Availability's a crapshoot and the quality has plummeted."\n\nLozano looked with suspicion. "No, no that isn't right. Even bad wood sells. If it isn't selling, the Caudillos have greater plans for it. Building more housing, perhaps. Or a strategic reserve."\n\nAquilino and Juan shared a quick glance. Maybe Lozano was right, he certainly knew the industry better than they did. And the government kept promising self-sufficiency, a second Industrial revolution to free Iberia from the shackles of international capitalism, and restore the peninsula's place as a world power. But then again, if that's really what they're doing..."

 IBR.4117.t:0 "It Keeps Falling"
 IBR.4117.d:0 "Segismundo Lozano, Juan Esteban, and Aquilino Nieto sat around a table once more. But now the blinds were shut and the mood was somber. The small stack of papers was replaced by several dozen in a binder, organized into a dossier that now sat before the retired  Lozano skimmed through pages of data, and as his eyes raced over each line, his face contorted into a scowl. "My god you two, how did you even obtain all this?"\n\nEsteban replied "We picked it up from some old friends at the INI. Mostly logistics, some more precise trade data too...it paints quite the picture, as I'm sure you notice."\n\n"Yeah, that it does. These production numbers are nonsense. You didn't pay anything for this, did you?" He shook his head as he flipped to a bookmarked page, but seeing the numbers laid before him, his whole body froze. Nearly a third of Iberia's wood unsold, nearly 80% of that rotting, and similar numbers across a dozen vital industries.\n\n"Oh....nice one fellas." His hands began to tremble. "You put a lot more effort into this than the last one." Esteban and Nieto exchanged a worried glance. The room went quiet, save the sound of Lozano's excited breathing. He gritted his teeth, body shaking, and shouted "You really expect me to fall for this? This is a con, isn't it Juan? Trying to make me sell my portfolio to you?"\n\nEsteban and Nieto sat in solemn silence. Lozano's tearful eyes darted between the two men, looking for some movement, no matter how slight, anything that would betray their true intentions. He found none. "Why...why are you even telling me this? What do you gain?"\n\nEsteban spoke up "You are my friend, Sigismundo. The people of Iberia will soon know the truth, and I want to give you a warning. Liquidate your assets, buy as much USD as you can, and take your family out of the country. A year from now, there won't be a single rich man in Madrid."

Guillermo could practically feel his manager watching it grow."\n\n"We'll have everything fixed soon," Guillermo replied. The woman stood silently. "Now ah, I do still need you to pay for that."\n\n"For 6 pesetas?"\n\nThe manager placed himself at the register, "No! That bread costs six and a half pesetas, we've kept the price as low as possible. If you're not going to pay, I'm going to have to ask you to leave my store." Grumbling under her breath, the woman slammed some coins on the table and absconded with her bread before Guillermo had even counted them. At least she had paid full price in the end.\n\nNext in line was an older man with a selection of marzipan and chocolates. "Just imagine if she knew how high the tax on this was!" he joked."

Above its entrance, spelled in bright golden letters, "GALERIAS PRECIADOS"\n\nConcepción felt smaller than she ever had before walking into the store, seeing dozens of people carrying twice as many bags, mothers with their children, teenage girls with their friends, and well-dressed men, all walking amidst hundreds of tables and racks carrying all manner of clothing and fabrics. At the other end of the store were an assortment of large appliances, dishwashers, toilets, ovens, a distance to her right was a whole section for makeup and jewelry, and as if all that wasn't enough, an escalator led to another floor just as enormous, and with just as varied a selection.\n\nHer friend had described Galerías as a 'walk-in catalog', but it was so much more.

New treats, snacks, and whole meals that they had previously only heard of, were now available for purchase right here in the Canaries. And it was all within walking distance of their home!

 iberia.1.t:0 "The Situation in Goa"
 iberia.1.d:0 "With the establishment of the Iberian Council, order is being restored to the peninsula, freeing up the government to work on other pressing matters. It is past due that Iberia set its sights on the rest of the world, and the first step of this process will be the coastal city of Goa.\n\nFormerly a Portuguese colony, the port of Goa was seized by India shortly after the conclusion of the Second World War, near the turn of the decade, in tandem with the annexation of Angola and Mozambique by Germany. The garrison had already been substantially reduced, moved to the Portuguese colonies in Africa to defend them from German attacks. Reportedly, not a single shot was fired in defense or in assault of the port city, with the garrison simply surrendering and withdrawing from the port, allowing the Indian forces to move in and capture the colony entirely unopposed. The nature of the Goa Incident, however, raises quite a few doubts within the general staff, some of whom believe that there was more to the incident than the well-being of the troops.\n\nThere are two reasonable conclusions, according to our general staff: The attack was in whole Indian aggression, taking land which did not belong to them - and against such numbers, how could the already minimized garrison hope to resist them? After all, the garrison was outnumbered and under-equipped. Defeat at the hands of the superior Indian forces was inevitable. The second conclusion though carries far more ominous implications, that some unknown factor motivated the garrison commander to order our forces to stand down, surrendering our territories in Goa without so much as a protest."
 iberia.1.a:0 "The garrison commander is at fault here." 
 iberia.1.b:0 "India is clearly the culprit."

 iberia.2.t:0 "Interrogating the Garrison Commander"
 iberia.2.d:0 "Having had a small series of questions with Goa garrison commander Vassalo e Silva, we are now able to confirm... absolutely nothing. Our interrogation has proved entirely fruitless, having gotten little more than his insistence that he is not at fault, that Indian aggression was the root cause, and that he surrendered for the good of his men, despite repeated questioning. While he may simply be non-cooperative and attempting to hide something, it is still entirely possible that he really is innocent and India's aggression was fully to blame.\n\nThe question remains, who is more at fault?"
 iberia.2.a:0 "I don't think he's going to talk." 
 iberia.2.b:0 "If it wasn't the commander, then it was India."


 iberia.3.t:0 "Investigating Goa Documents"
 iberia.3.d:0 "Given the non-cooperative nature of Vassalo e Silva, we have been forced to follow a more complicated trail of information, and our agents have been forced to coast through an endless series of paperwork and reports, but at last they have discovered exactly what they were hunting for - reports, audits, and scores of other documents detailing just what exactly went on in that port. While the political reports appear, for the most part, normal, the financial audits are what we quickly came to have an interest in.\n\nWhile for a time the trends seemed reasonable, there appears to have been a gradual slippage of integrity culminating in an exceptionally large unexplained payment in mid November of 1961.."

 iberia.4.t:0 "Goan Officials Bribed by the Indian Military"

According to our investigations, the payment can be traced back to several officials in the Indian army, and from there it isn't unreasonable to assume that the stand-down order was motivated by more than the well-being of the troops.\n\nNow we know, for certain, the guilt of Vassalo e Silva. Still, it is entirely possible this conspiracy reaches far deeper than we could expect, and more officials from Goa were involved in this plot than simply the garrison commander. What is our next course of action?"

While the trials started with at least a facade of procedure, by the end of it the men behind the show-trials clearly wanted to just get it over with.

They demand restitution, in full, for all the territories we "seized" from them when we recaptured the port of Goa by simply bribing the Iberian garrison to stand down. What makes this even more of a smack in the face is that they also sent their so-called estimates, inflating the value of Goa far above anything it could be reasonably priced at!\n\nThey are expecting a response by the end of the day.

This time they've informed us they hold compromising information over some of our officers, of which they also threaten to give out. What "give out" means we're not sure. Regardless, they at least had the decency to demand a smaller payment. We can refuse, obviously. However, perhaps we should give them a reduced payment. Of course, they never specified what they meant by reduced, only less than the initial price..."

A trinket or something of the sort, it is argued to us, would suffice just as well as a payment. It would be far easier to acquire the resources required for a move like this, but all of this assumes we have to tolerate this hounding at all. Will we go through with a symbolic payment?"

Firstly, we could grant them special economic rights in the port of Goa. These business rights would allow Iberia to easily make up their claimed difference, without us doing a thing. Secondly, we could propose an equal investment of sorts. Finally, we could make them an unorthodox offer: Prisoners.

Perhaps by fortune, this plan worked out and soon he found himself out of his confinement. Then came the next part of the plan: He ran. He kept running until his lungs failed him and he could move no longer, and he repeated the process until he was far, far away from Goa. What struck him as odd was how little of a chase was given, but he was too busy fleeing the vicinity to properly dwell on it.\n\nHe was making his way to Bombay, where he had heard there were a lot of British people.

There's still a bit of time before the meeting begins, however, so we can take this extra time to figure out our stance. Obviously the whole affair is going to be a bust. Unless, of course, we budge on our prices. It would be entirely possible to just hand the prisoners over to Iberia for free, so long as we make it look like they negotiated it down.

There was no middle ground to be found and the futility of the discussion strained all who participated. It wasn't a meeting; it was hours of misery. The pointlessness flew over the heads of the diplomats, however, who fenced with words in an attempt to arrange a resolution favorable for them.\n\nAs the meeting prepared to drag itself along yet longer, an Indonesian delegate mutters the fateful sentence to a colleague.\n\n"We're never gonna get our ransom at this rate."\n\nThe room froze. While meant as a momentary observation to a co-worker the dreadful phrase was carried to everyone in the room off the back of misfortune. There was a mixture of horror and disgust on every present delegate's face. The atmosphere chilled.\n\nThe Iberian diplomats got up and left, quickly striding out of the room. One delegate looked around, as they stepped outside.\n\n"Did you grab the transcript?"\\n\n"Better. I have a recording.""

Journalists, whistleblowers, all sorts of nosy souls set to it to rip open any veil of confidentiality and show what they call the truth. Unfortunately, they succeeded in showing what we didn't want shown. There's been no end of complaints from the international community, especially from those who don't know how to keep their noses out of the business of others. Naturally, our overlord Japan got a fair share of the flak too. Being far more sensitive to international influence, Japan ordered we release the Timor garrison and send them back to Iberia.

For the less selflessly-minded there were programs with incentives; raffles, shows, anything to eke out just a little bit more in liberation proceeds. It started out intense, and only intensified over the course of the next few days.\n\nUnfortunately, not even this was enough. Despite the early promise the public funding seemed to sputter out in the later days, and by the end of the campaign it was nowhere near its goal. It would appear that the Timor garrison would not be getting their liberation any time soon."

It started out intense, and only intensified over the course of the next few days.\n\nThese measures, all together, seemed to be enough. Thanks to a steady stream of donations the liberation fund soon matched its goal, surpassing it even. The public funding campaign would eventually end with enough money that Iberia could pocket a sizeable sum. Pending money transfer, the soldiers imprisoned in Timor would be able to make their way home soon."

 iberia.47.t:0 "The Price of Liberation" 
 iberia.47.d:0 "Rather than attempt to haggle or cut an underhanded deal, Iberia has elected to pay the full ransom price for the prisoners. In return for their generosity, we were happy to elaborate on some details that were left uncovered - as is only right for a paying customer, of course. The first was where this money would go. Predictably, most of it is to go to transportation, since crossing half the world is never cheap. As corruption isn't entirely defeatable, a small sum must go as a backup to ensure there's enough payment to cover the transportation. Finally, we have taken the liberty of preparing a grand sendoff ceremony, as they deserve.\n\nThe Iberian reaction was less-than-enthused at the breakdown of payment, but since the money had already been sent there was nothing they could do. Regardless, their demeanor will certainly improve once they receive their garrison prisoners."

They have unfortunately mustered a breakout from their prison. According to Indonesia, they killed twenty-seven men and wounded four more on their way out. Much to the regret of Indonesia, they have not been able to find them. Given the island of Timor, it is probably they didn't make it out alive. Even if they were, they're certain to have made their way off the island to parts unknown. Worse, it is estimated that a significant portion of the former garrison have engaged in terrorist activities following their prison break. While it is a potential lead on their location, trying to ever get them back is a distant dream."
 iberia.49.a:0 "WHAT?" 

 iberia.50.t:0 "Official Announcement from the Government"
 iberia.50.d:0 "Featured in the state press, on the front page of the newspaper, was a damning accusation. In bold, capitalized letters, read 'GODLESS FOREIGNERS KILL IBERIAN CITIZENS'. The article itself was no less damning - far longer than the usual news article, it spared no detail on the crimes Indonesia committed on the former garrison of Timor, of which was very painstakingly described as Iberian, not Portuguese.\n\nThe piece launched into the history, and of how the garrison was captured. Then, to the offense of human decency, were used as human labor for menial projects. Because of the total mistreatment of the government, they died, alone, far away from home, and were never to see their families again.\n\nSadly, there was no proper explanation for the mistreatment, other than sheer cruelty. All of this was topped off with a warning, to never let any foreign power take you prisoner... or else this would happen to you."

 iberia.51.t:0 "Protests Against the Government"
 iberia.51.d:0 "Initially a few minor mutters of discontent, the dissent has finally boiled over. At first beginning with a few formal protests, the civil disobedience against the government has intensified to sit-outs and mass showings of solidarity for the families of the soldiers lost in Timor. Chanting all sorts of slogans, most of the anger is rooted in the inaction of the Iberian government. If the garrison soldiers had died, then couldn't they have been saved? All it would have taken was the country acting faster, rather than waiting twenty years to do something about it.\n\nBeing unlawful public gatherings, law enforcement was very eager to have their way in the protestors. All it would take is one piece of misplaced violence, and the boot would come down like an anchor. A justification like this never came, so the police were forced to engage in glorified shooing in order to disperse the protests. At the end of the day nobody who participated in the protests against the Iberian government left without at least some resentment over the matter."

 iberia.52.d:0 "Organized for an upcoming Sunday, a number of Catholic priests had prepared a special service for the now-deceased Timor garrison. Sensing its nature as an easy publicity stunt, the Iberian government quickly latched on to the affair. With the backing of the government, cost was no object. What was once a small ceremony slowly morphed into a country wide holiday.\n\nIt was hosted in many churches around Iberia, and everyone who was able to attend was encouraged to. The idea that some would not be able to was a happening that was prepared for, even if it was for a small few. The ceremony would be televised, and anyone from around the country who wished to watch was able to.\n\nAs for the mourning itself, it was exactly as it could be expected. It was solemn and quiet. The involved priests were as if it was their own parents and brothers that had died, and everyone carried themselves with a dignity that could bring back the dead, if such a thing was possible."

 iberia.53.d:0 "Through no small pressure, over no small amount of time, Indonesia was finally strong armed into bringing us a response to our demands for the former garrison of Timor. The simple response was that they couldn't. After more cajoling, it turns out that they are not authorized to negotiate. Because of that, they were unwilling to respond - as that would give a false impression.\n\nGiven their relationship with Japan, the Empire manages a significant sum of their foreign policy - and this is part of that sum. Any negotiations we come to with Japan will carry over to Indonesia, and they will be obligated to comply. At least they will be quicker to speak with than the Indonesians..."

 iberia.54.t:0 "Iberia Wants us to Release the Timor Prisoners" 
 iberia.54.d:0 "An interesting message has found its way to our government from Madrid. It's riddled with minor errors, endless verbosity, and seems to try and say the same message repeatedly. Phrased more like a legal document than a communication, it gives the impression that the writer cared more about closing up any potential loopholes as opposed to just giving a message. Whatever their motivations, the message itself is still legible, remarkably. Indonesia has imprisoned the garrison of the former Portuguese holding in Timor - which we liberated on our march southwards - and Iberia wants them back. We have been redirected to from our client state because, allegedly, we control their prisoner management.\n\nIgnoring that this isn't true, for the sake of maintaining an honorable reputation they'll need to be given a response. All that needs to be said is whether or not they'll be allowed to take them home. It's not a hard proposal to stomach, provided they provide transport. Of course Indonesia might not approve, and strongarming them into releasing the prisoners may be more trouble than it's worth."
 iberia.54.a:0 "As long as they take them home." 
 iberia.54.b:0 "No, we won't release them."

 iberia.55.t:0 "Timor Prisoners Return Home!" #WELCOME
 iberia.55.d:0 "No reunion lasted long. One would think that separated family, split lovers, would bring something grander. But it didn't. Most just embraced a long-lost loved one, escorting them away with a kind of shocked denial. There was a large wait for many, since it had been decided that the way to go was to summon all the separated individuals and match them with their missing soldier one at a time. It created an excitement with the soldiers, as each one waited in the hopes that they would be the next one to finally go home.\n\nPlacing pressure on Japan was just what was necessary, as they opted to order Indonesia to release the former Timor garrison. Being forced to oblige, they then covered the minor transportation fee to bring them back to their homeland.\n\nThe pride this conveys cannot be easily described! We have bested a superpower, and made them bend to our terms! It is a great propaganda victory, and the population is very well aware of our triumph."
 iberia.55.a:0 "Bienvenidos!"

 iberia.56.t:0 "Japan Refuses to Release the Prisoners" 
 iberia.56.d:0 "Japan was very prompt with their response, surprisingly so. Typically, when communications are opened it takes some time to get answers, and even longer to receive something definitive. Thankfully, this time was different. Once we had transmitted our demands; the immediate release of the imprisoned soldiers from Timor, as they had been separated from their fatherlands for far too long, we received an almost immediate response.\n\nIt was an unceremonious denial. Our imprisoned brethren would be under strict supervision, and were not to be released. When pressed for a justification, cost was cited. When we offered to pay, we were flatly declined. Indonesia, too, has refused further communication on the matter. Since a display of clear malice like this cannot be ignored, we will need to apply diplomatic pressure on the Japanese government."
 iberia.56.a:0 "Please!" 

 iberia.57.t:0 "Iberia Pressures us to Release the Prisoners!" 
 iberia.57.d:0 "As the trouble of pushing a Sphere member into something they really don't want to do is overwhelming, Madrid's prisoner transfer was declined. This seemed to disappoint them, but also looked to be the end of it. Unfortunately, it was not. Taking the mindset that the second and the third time's the charm, they have begun to pester Japanese functionaries everywhere they meet, in order to attempt to wrangle us to the negotiation table, throwing a fit like a child who didn't get their way.\n\nThis does not mean we need to humor them, however. There's no reason to change our ruling on their prisoners - after all, no means no. If compromising the independence of a fellow Sphere member is tolerable, then of course Iberia could still be supplied their prisoners. Any trouble this would stir up is the same as before, as commanding such a petty thing is going to make as many enemies as it could possibly create friends."
 iberia.57.a:0 "Fine." 
 iberia.57.b:0 "We said no."

 iberia.58.t:0 "Japan still refuses"
 iberia.58.d:0 "In order to persuade the Japanese of the need to release our prisoners, nothing short of constant pressure was applied. It began with constantly mentioning it at diplomatic functions. Everywhere a Japanese and Iberian delegate could be found together, it was certain that the Iberian delegate was to bring up the 'Timor situation'. Even after sustaining the pressure, Japan was still aloof.\n\nSince this didn't work, the next plan was to mention it everywhere else. Every opportunity the prisoners in Timor could be brought up, they were. Where they could not be addressed, a chance was created just for the sake of bringing it up. Unfortunately, none of this seems to work. Therefore, the only option is to keep the pressure up, and in more places than before."
 iberia.58.a:0 "Aw, c'mon."

 iberia.59.t:0 "Iberia Keeps Pressuring"
 iberia.59.d:0 "No does not mean no to Madrid! Regardless of how many times an Iberian diplomat is informed that the situation is final, they never come any closer to recognizing the finality of the situation. All that ever seems to come of a meeting involving the two is the Japanese being pestered about prisoners and garrisons. Our officials are growing exhausted with the harassment. With this development, some have taken the mindset that a re-evaluation of our priorities is in order.\n\nForcing the release of the Iberian prisoners is a move growing in popularity with factions within the government, and appeasing them with the benefit of maintaining good relations with another country is a strong benefit. Of course, this says nothing for our credibility- it is very poor publicity move to renege on such a promise."
 iberia.59.a:0 "Fine." 
 iberia.59.b:0 "What part of no don't you understand?"

 iberia.60.t:0 "Japan Continues to Refuse"
 iberia.60.d:0 "Dreadful news! The previous policies of intensifying diplomatic pressure on Japan have not worked. Because it did not work, the plan instead shifted to intensifying it further, in the hopes that Japan would eventually be battered down and accept our demands. As time has moved on, this has proven to not be the case. If anything, our pushing has driven Japan from a simple no to a fiery refusal.\n\nShould we let this continue, there may be a new development resulting in the release of our prisoners, but in doing so we risk permanent damage to our relations. Alternatively, we could stop pestering about it. This would remove any possibility of getting the former garrison back, but it seems increasingly unlikely that such a thing would happen. On the bright side, it would maintain international relations. Ultimately, it was decided to"
 iberia.60.a:0 "Keep up the pressure." 
 iberia.60.b:0 "Drop the issue."

 iberia.61.t:0 "Iberian Pressure Auments"
 iberia.61.d:0 "No matter what they are told, the Iberians never relent. Telling them off only seems to encourage more, like a child testing their boundaries. Our officials are exhausted with it, and the affair has reached a particular boiling point recently, when the pressure has only intensified orders of magnitude. Even worse, details of this have leaked to the public. They have taken the side of the Timor prisoners, supporting their release.\n\nStopping a crisis will require bending to the public will and releasing the prisoners. Thankfully, this will mean an end to the unceasing diplomatic whining. The downsides are twofold, however - Madrid is leaving with a sense of arrogance, now finding that they can force another minority to their will as they please. Furthermore, Indonesia will more than certainly not prefer this approach. Unfortunately, this is all that can be done."
 iberia.61.a:0 "Shut up! Take them! Leave us alone!"
 iberia.61.b:0 "We will let the world know that these prisoners are never getting released."

 iberia.62.t:0 "March in Support of the Prisoners"
 iberia.62.d:0 "A large number of citizens gathered in Madrid but especially in Lisbon. There, they began to march. Against so large a group, with such a cause, law enforcement was unable to do anything to stop them. The whole affair lacked glamour - frequently just citizens marching through either city - but grew, as street goers joined in. Some of the most dedicated held up pictures, taken of the soldiers of Timor. Others chanted slogans, with 'where did they go' showing itself as the most popular. Lasting for hours, the public demonstrations carried on until sunset, as the darkening sky made it difficult to coordinate. The people had departed, but their message had not.\n\nOur refusal to press the issue on Timor has proven disastrous. Confusing pragmatism with forgetfulness, the public has expressed anger at the government. We have to release a statement now, if we hope to save any face."
 iberia.62.a:0 "We did what we could."

 iberia.63.t:0 "Japan Proclaims Prisoners Will Never be Released"
 iberia.63.d:0 "Our decision to drop the support of our prisoners has proven to be a horrible mistake. In the hopes of reaching stable relations otherwise with Japan, the Timor garrison was deemed less important. As if out of spite, Tokyo released a public statement affirming that the former garrison was imprisoned, and will remain that way. Never at any point will they be released, and especially not given transport back to Iberia. Because of our continental separation, we can not do anything. Even if we were closer, we still could not do anything in retaliation. This decision has to be accepted, against our wills.\n\nThe international community has taken a keen interest in this, too - our seeming weakness has been noted, and we have been rendered a laughingstock. It will take a long time to recover from this blow, and even then our standing will never reach what it once was. Indonesia has taken from us even more than our prisoners."
 iberia.63.a:0 "You're joking."
 
 iberia.64.t:0 "Large Protests after Japanese Refusal"
 iberia.64.d:0 "As if the international humiliation of giving up our prisoners wasn't bad enough, it is nothing compared to the domestic unrest. The prisoners in Timor were used as a propaganda piece, and very strongly so. Their status has been cemented as that of celebrities and they were the apple of the public's eye for a large amount of time. With everyone so invested in their freedom, the response that followed the subject being dropped was predictably severe.\n\nConcentrated in the major cities, but still significant in the countryside, was something that very nearly resembled a riot. Large numbers of people marched against the government, and the hostility was most severe in Lisbon, as Salazar was particularly blamed for losing not only a colony, but the Portuguese in it too. Terrorists and separatists took the opportunity to disguise themselves among the crowds, striking from positions that law enforcement could not engage them from. This has been nothing short of a disaster, and everyone is making sure that we are aware of it."

 iberia.300.d:0 "This morning, shocking news reached the offices of the Caudillos. Upon the front pages of national newspapers was a breaking column. Captain Galvão, a prominent naval officer with the command of a significant vessel in the Iberian fleet, has gone public to national media to speak out against the Caudillos. In this media statement, the Captain goes on at length to discuss what he perceives as continual oppression from the Caudillos, the noticeable loss of freedoms across Iberia, and mismanagement of the armed forces. Due to the status of this high ranking military officer, and the power he holds, the nation has gone into a frenzy over this breaking news. One can scarcely appear in public without hearing talk of this breaking headline.\n\nStrict rules are placed upon all members of the Iberian military, forbidding them to give opinions to the media without strict approval and guidance from public relations personnel or superior officers. Due to this, the testimony that Captain Galvão gave to the media could see him immediately tried by court martial resulting in a dishonorable discharge. To commence such proceedings we would need to speak to his direct superior officer. However, Captain Galvão's statement appears to be rather popular at this moment, and immediately silencing him might be seen by the public as a move of suppression, furthering this crisis. Letting the issue fester, however, is also far from ideal for the public image of the Caudillos."

Those not facing direct charges within the naval forces are to be closely audited, as we search for any other possible dissidents within the ranks of the Iberian Naval high command.\n\nRear Admiral Valerio, the superior officer of Captain Galvão who defied orders from the Caudillos, was today among the first apprehended in the first wave of these purges. Captain Galvão himself however, whose name now carries significant weight within Iberia, has escaped apprehension. His current whereabouts are unknown. Some speculate that he has fled to South America, while others claim that he may have fled to a hostile nation in search of amnesty and possibly even support.\n\nWhilst the current scope of those affected by the purges is limited, and mostly surrounds those who have supported Captain Galvão, they have only just begun.

Within two hours of her departure, contact was temporarily lost. Today at 1400 hours, we have received a communique from Castries, detailing their discoveries surrounding the vessel. This morning, the Santa Maria temporarily docked in Saint Lucia, offloading four injured crewmen for medical attention, before quickly departing once again. As the crewmen spoke only Portuguese, it was not until after the departure of the Santa Maria that local authorities could appropriately discern the situation onboard. Caudillos, the Santa Maria and her nine-hundred occupants, including American and other foreign nationals, are currently held hostage by approximately two dozen pro-democracy terrorists. The leader of the terrorists is said to be Henrique Galvão, however we are currently attempting to confirm these claims. A civilian maritime advisory has already been issued, however our naval forces are not ready to conduct a Caribbean search."\n\nThe room descends into an eerie silence as the Caudillos absorb the gravity of the situation. Quickly, Franco chimes in. "If there are Americans being held hostage by these terrorists, we must contact the American government immediately! They will not stand for this!" exclaims Franco.\n\n"No! We should not draw attention to these terrorists. Galvão has received enough attention for his treasonous actions. He should not receive any further recognition." Salazar retorts.

He claims that any Iberian man or woman can make large strides to remove the Caudillos from office, and that should they wish for a brighter future, they should act radically.\n\nWhilst this speech was little more than revolutionary rubbish, many of our people are abuzz with inspiration from the vile broadcast.

 iberia.309.d:0 "Within the high governmental offices in Madrid, yet another disagreement erupts between the Caudillos. Following the outbreak of the South African War, the German and American spheres have thrown their weight behind the factions of the Boer Republic and the Dominion of South Africa, respectively. As the conflict drags on, concerns within Iberia grow that the German backed African powers may soon overrun the Dominion of South Africa, creating a dominance of the German sphere within Central to South Africa. The United States has grown increasingly involved in the conflict, with a growing American force being committed to the South African War to prop up the Dominion government.\n\nSalazar argues to an unconvinced Franco that the Iberian nation would benefit greatly through intervention in South Africa. While the front lines of this conflict are far from home, assistance to the Dominion of South Africa against the Germans and the Boers could provide a barrier to the further expansion of German influence within the African continent. Furthermore, Salazar argues that within a continent rife with the rise of new nations, significant favor and influence over a well established state such as South Africa could prove an essential strategic stepping stone in the expansion and maintenance of Iberian influence globally.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to come to the formal agreement required for any official action to take place, Salazar is unrelenting in his proposals, believing firmly in the necessity of Iberian intervention in South Africa. If either of the Caudillos is to be moved in his opinion, it is likely not to be Salazar."

The nature of the letter, if one could get around the complexities of diplomatic writing, was a candid request. Salazar expresses to us that, following the significant Iberian contributions in South Africa, Iberia formally requests from the United States that Iberia be allowed to re-occupy her former Portuguese colonies, seized by the Germans in prior decades.\n\nWhilst we understand the Iberian desire to reclaim her former territories following a hard fought conflict, it would be near impossible to retain a positive moral image should we accept.

Just as lost as the lives of those men who lay dead in the streets of Cape Town.\n\nFollowing an expensive and strenuous effort by both the United States and Iberia to prop up the nation of South Africa against the overwhelming forces of the Afrika-Schild, the adversity was one that could not be sufficiently overcome. As thousands of brave Portuguese volunteers were sent forth to die in a foreign land, the forces of the Schild continued to press ever farther south, until it was realized by all that this war was one that could not be won. The evacuation of South Africa was swift, with the United States undertaking a large effort to evacuate high value personnel from Cape Town. Tens of thousands of military men boarded ships and aircraft to retreat back home in the final weeks of the South African nation.\n\nAcross Iberia, the defeat in South Africa is seen as an irresponsible military disaster and a humiliation by nearly all, to the point that even Caudillo Franco has noticeably distanced himself from the South African intervention, all too glad to allow Salazar to receive the majority of the backlash for the intervention that was initially proposed by him."

 iberia.322.d:0 "남아프리카 전쟁이 격화되는 가운데, 우리의 이베리아 협력자들의 참여도가 증가하고 있습니다. 우리가 아주 기쁘게 생각하는, 이베리아인들은 이 분쟁에서 약속을 지켜왔으며, 우리의 동맹국뿐만 아니라 우리 군에 대한 많은 선망의 지원을 계속해 왔습니다. 최근 연락에서, 이베리아인들은 전쟁에서의 기존 지원을 대폭 확대할 것을 약속했습니다. 워싱턴 D.C.와의 대화에서 현재 분쟁에 참여하고 있는 이베리아인들의 의도에 대한 많은 복잡성과 세부 사항이 정리되어 있는데, 이 문서 내의 한 가지 서약은 다른 것들과는 두드러집니다.\n\n중앙아프리카와 서아프리카 해안에서 멀지 않고, 적도 바로 북쪽에 위치한, 이베리아의 상투메 섬은 이 분쟁 기간 동안, 물류 중심지로써의 큰 잠재력을 가지고 있습니다. 남아프리카에 이베리아의 작전이 설립된 이후, 현재 우리에게 이 섬에 대한 영유권을 임차하는 것이 적절한 상황이라고 믿고 있으며, 우리에게 귀중한 물류 자산을 제공하고 있습니다. 군 고위 관계자는 상투메 항구가 물류 경유지로, 나아가 우리 폭격기 비행대의 공군기지로도 효과적으로 사용될 수 있을 것으로 믿고 있습니다.\n\n섬의 사용 계획은 아직 초기 단계에 있지만, 실행한다면 우리는 이베리아 임대 제안을 감사히 받아들일 것이며, 섬에 대한 물류 작업은 불과 몇 달 후에 시작될 것으로 추정됩니다."

 iberia.323.t:0 "Stalemate in South Africa"
 iberia.323.d:0 "As the hills of South Africa grow scarred with the damages of war, and the great pastures become choked with the corpses of young men, no victor can be determined. When once, one might say the Boers had the upper hand, and at other times people may have talked of an impending American victory, no such talk takes place any longer. The war is not lost, yet neither has it been won.\n\nAs thousands of Iberian, primarily Portuguese, men now lay dead in South Africa, thousands more back home mourn for their losses in a conflict far overseas, in a land no more relevant to them than the shores of Alaska. In the grievance of their insurmountable loss, many have begun to question the war, and the motives behind Iberian involvement. The people look to Salazar for answers, yet he has none to provide for them.\n\nWhen once Salazar would have spoken at length of a restoration of Iberian glory and an Iberian resurgence upon the world stage, now he says nothing. Salazar knows the war is by no means a success, and the fervor he once held for the Iberian intervention has been all but extinguished, as has all hope of victory."

 iberia.324.t:0 "이베리아가 전쟁 노력을 위한 지도를 제공하다"
 iberia.324.d:0 "모잠비크나 앙골라에 대한 포르투갈 식민통치는 과거일 뿐 역사책에서 언급하는 것에 지나지 않지만, 이 역사의 근간은 현재 전쟁 노력에서 배상금을 지불할 수 있는 잠재력을 가지고 있습니다.\n\n워싱턴에서 열린 최근의 조정 노력의 일환으로, 이베리아 군부의 고위 간부들은 모잠비크와 앙골라에서 포르투갈 식민지 지배의 말기부터 시작된 수많은 지도와 문서를 우리에게 제공했습니다. 문서의 내용은 현재 아프리카실트의 국가판무관들에게 통제되고 있는 모잠비크와 앙골라 내의 다양한 중요 지역의 산업 및 인프라 사양에 대한 세부 사항을 상세히 제공하였습니다. 우리는 지도들이 조금 오래됐긴 했지만, 지금도 매우 정확할 것으로 추정합니다. 이베리아인들이 제공한 정보를 통해 주요한 적의 물류 및 산업 중심지를 정확하게 공격하기 시작하면서, 적에 대한 미국의 폭격 작전의 지속력에 매우 귀중한 것으로 입증 될 것입니다."

 iberia.325.t:0 "미국 공군이 루안다 무기 공장을 타격하다" #event for IBR and USA
 iberia.325.d:0 "이베리아 군과 미군 사이의 정보 교환 이후, 미 공군은 모잠비크와 앙골라의 아프리카실트 관할 지역의 물류 및 산업 배치에 대한 상세한 정보를 확보하게 되었습니다. 그 정보는 필요 없는 것이 아니였습니다.\n\n어제 오후, 미 공군 폭격기가 남아프리카 분쟁 동안, 상당량의 무기 생산이 이루어진 루안다의 산업 중심지를 타격했습니다. 이베리아 정보기관이 제공한 정보로 덕분에, 미국의 폭탄이 지역 산업의 필수 건물에 아주 정확하게 투하될 수 있었고, 돌이킬 수 없는 피해를 입혔으며, 이 지역에서 상당한 양의 무기 생산이 중단되었습니다.\n\n새로운 미국 폭격 작전의 신속하고 파괴적인 효과로, 많은 고위 관료들은 분쟁 동안 국가판무관들의 생산 능력이 현저하게 방해받기를 기대하고 있습니다. 그렇지만, 미국의 폭격 작전이 아프리카실트의 전반적인 효과에 미치는 전반적인 영향이 효과적인지는 아직 확정되지 않았습니다."
