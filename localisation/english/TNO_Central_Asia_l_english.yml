 CA_Bormann.1.t: "Movement in Central Asia"
 CA_Bormann.1.desc: "Had it not been picked up and read so soon, the report on the Iran-Turkmen border could have easily been buried by other documents containing what was thought to be more prescient matters. Yet through some quirk of fate the report was analyzed and what was found was of more importance than expected, though in the grand scheme of things it remained slight.\n\nInside, an agent stationed in Iran had assembled several pieces of information detailing the rise in armed groups spotted across the border in Turkmenistan. Equipment had been modernized and units of tribal soldiers appeared far more organized than in the past. Occasionally skirmishes had been heard, yet lack of witnesses meant this could not be confirmed.\n\nIt forecasted that a conflict was likely, and becoming more and more unavoidable by the day.\n\nDespite the overwhelming judgement of the region being one of condescending indifference, Officer Alfred Eichinger was assigned to monitor the situation. He soon settled into what he expected to be a rather uneventful role."
 CA_Bormann.1.a: "Who gives a damn?"
 CA_Bormann.2.t: "Back From the Dead"
 CA_Bormann.2.desc: "Officer Alfred Eichinger, of the HVA Central Asia Department, placed the report that had been urgently delivered to him hours ago down. The implications here were not to be ignored. It seemed the movements the Iranians had noted recently were indeed indicative of something larger going on. However, there was a far more important revelation.\n\nThe Turkestan Legion had survived.\n\nAlfred hadn't even recalled what that had been at first, and it was only after he'd searched through some decades-old files had he been reminded that they had been the regional anti-Soviet collaborators. Ones whose usefulness had been mixed at best, and who had subsequently failed. It had been assumed they'd dissolved after their final defeat. As it turned out, that was not the case, and not only were they alive, they were still led by Veli Kayyum.\n\nHe wondered how the founder of the Legion had survived all these years. No matter the answers, this was potentially Germany's way into Central Asia - provided the old collaborators of Turkmenistan were willing to be supported. And from the sounds of it, they needed all the help they could get.\n\nAccording to the report, the Legion was in a very sorry state to put it generously. They seemed to be closer to bandits than a legitimate fighting force; poor equipment, abhorrent discipline, preying on isolated tribes and travelers, and beset by infighting and poor leadership - hardly a group that was primed to capture a small town, let alone where the report indicated they wanted to strike - Samarqand, a major city in Uzbekistan.\n\nThey had enough justification to investigate this directly. It was time to rekindle some old alliances - and see if the Legion was still of use to them."
 CA_Bormann.2.a: "Once collaborators, always collaborators."
 CA_Bormann.3.t: "The Bandit King of the Legion"
 CA_Bormann.3.desc: "HVA Agent Stefan felt, frankly, disgusted right now.\n\nWhen he'd been assigned to meet with Veli Kayyum and the surviving Turkestan Legion, he hadn't had high expectations. The dossier the HVA possessed wasn't flattering, and his first impression had confirmed the report about the state of the Legion. Likely the best these inferiors could put together, and simply being around them made his skin crawl - but he was a servant of the Reich, and he would do his job, no matter how distasteful it was.\n\nBeing in the presence of Veli Kayyum however, was offensive.\n\nVeli had welcomed the German with enthusiasm - and Stefan was certain he was partially drunk when he showed up - before proceeding to show him around the camp; a squalor, dirty place where he saw men passed out, drunk, or clearly on substances. Even Veli's own living space, the 'luxurious' part of the camp, was a filthy place that had the only dining area, of which he was sitting in now.\n\n"I'm pleased that Germany has reached out," Veli said, speaking while he was eating. "I can assure you, we are willing to be Germany's strongest ally here, and it is excellent that we can rekindle this..." he hiccuped. "Partnership."\n\nStefen resisted comment. This man wasn't fit to lead a pack of drunks, let alone soldiers. He was a bandit-king, an incompetent, gluttonous, corrupt man. As if to remind him of this degeneracy, one of Veli's wives walked out, and the scantily-clad woman poured him more water. Nearly all of the women he'd seen had been dressed like that, and many of them were the wives of this man.\n\n"Well, what do you say, my friend," Veli smiled, not noticing his disgust. "Shall the partnership of the Reich and Legion begin once more?""
 CA_Bormann.3.a: ""I will report to my superiors. We will be in contact.""
 CA_Bormann.4.t: "Deciding the Legion's Path"
 CA_Bormann.4.desc: "Bormann pursed his lips as he read through the report that had followed the recent outreach to the surviving Turkestan Legion.\n\nIt did not paint a flattering picture.\n\nVeli Kayyum was by all standards, a drunk, indulgent, and incompetent leader who only retained his position because he had founded the Legion. Bormann could only feel disgust upon reading the description of the man, and could only imagine what it would be like to actually be in his presence. In retrospect, it was obvious why the Legion had failed. It seemed like a joke - They finally had a path into central Asia, but if they had to rely on men like Veli, he was frankly not sure it was worth it. The only positive was that Veli was too incompetent to turn on them.\n\nMuttering to himself, and in a foul mood, he turned another page in the report, and cocked an eyebrow as he read. Well, perhaps this wasn't a complete loss. The agent, perhaps seeing how incompetent Veli was, had taken the initiative to find replacements, as clearly not everyone was pleased with Veli's leadership.\n\nOne such individual was one of the Legion Generals, a mercenary who went by the name of Korşirmat. He was the son of a Kokand chieftain of all things - and a man with a deep hatred for Russia and communism. He seemed reasonably competent, though it was noted that he might be unreliable. Men with ambition and desire for power could be utilized, and Korşirmat could be useful in that way.\n\nHowever, there was perhaps a better option. A man named Baymirza Hayit had been in the Legion almost since its founding, hated the leadership of Veli, and very notably was an enthusiastic Hitlerite - a surprise to be sure, but someone who would likely be the most reliable. Bormann found none of these options ideal - but they could only use what they had."
 CA_Bormann.4.a: "Veli Kayyum. While not ideal, removing him might have consequences."
 CA_Bormann.4.b: "Korşirmat. Men like him can be easily controlled."
 CA_Bormann.4.c: "Baymirza Hayit. He will be the most receptive to our interests."
 CA_Bormann.5.t: "The Last Stand of the Blind Shermat"
 CA_Bormann.5.desc: "Korşirmat adjusted his sunglasses as he appraised the valley his men were encamped in. It was more exposed than he would have liked. Against an oncoming force, they were vulnerable, and it would be simple for a more mobile or numerous one to encircle and slaughter them. It was a risk he remained aware of.\n\nThe only reason they were out here at all was twofold. First, to scout ahead of the Uzbekistan offensive, and second to ensure that he didn't befell any 'accidents'. Drunk and incompetent Veli might be, but he knew a rival, and Korşirmat knew that the men were starting to look more towards him for leadership than the man purportedly in charge - a trend that made Veli concerned.\n\nThe men accompanying him were few, but ones he could trust - a necessary commodity these days. Time would tell if-\n\nA single shot rang out and one of the men standing on the perimeter of the camp collapsed, dead. Shouts rang out as more shots joined the chorus of gunfire. Korşirmat immediately grabbed his own rifle, thoughts racing as to how they could have been found without even a hint of a warning.\n\nShots were being exchanged, but the moment he joined his men, he could see it was a lost cause. He only got a glimpse of the soldiers, and they wore the uniforms of Uzbek soldiers - but something was wrong. They were too accurate, too coordinated; Uzbek soldiers weren't like this. His ears perked as between the shots he heard the Uzbeki's yelling to each other. But that couldn't be right?\n\nGerman?\n\nKorşirmat never had another thought, as a bullet from a sniper's rifle entered his head. The mercenary slumped to the ground, dead, as the rifle slipped from his fingers, and his sunglasses fell into the dirt."
 CA_Bormann.5.a: "A fate shared by those who followed him."
 CA_Bormann.6.t: "Smoke Break"
 CA_Bormann.6.desc: "Baymirza Hayit for once found himself in a good mood. It was evening now, and as the night had cooled off, he'd gotten to chatting with one of the new members of the Legion, a German who'd volunteered only days ago.\n\nOf course, Baymirza knew that Germany had learned they were alive, and had sent someone to make contact with Veli. And he also knew Germany could not have been pleased with Veli, and might be looking for...alternatives. Genuine volunteers or not, he felt there was nothing to lose by making a good impression on the young Germans.\n\nThis particular German volunteer might very well be his ticket to taking control of the Legion and turning it into something worthwhile. During their conversation, he made certain to emphasize his admiration of Hitler, National Socialism, and subtly indicate his distaste for Veli.\n\nThe young man smiled, nodded, and in return shared some news about Germany from the past two decades. He'd been saddened to learn of Hitler's death, but it seemed the new Führer was a suitable successor. "Do you smoke?" The man suddenly asked, during a lull in the conversation.\n\nBaymirza cocked his head. "I do, yes."\n\nThe man grinned, and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. "Have a pack straight from Germania, want one?" He picked one out, and offered it to Baymirza. He took and lit it, savoring the flavor. This one had an interesting taste...\n\nHis hand moved to his neck, as he found himself suddenly short of breath. With growing panic, he realized he couldn't breathe at all. Eyes bulging, he looked to the young German man, pleading for help. The man simply watched him coldly; the friendly veneer gone as with a final, gasping breath, Baymirza Hayit went still."
 CA_Bormann.6.a: "After that, the agent left without a word."
 CA_Bormann.7.t: "Knives, Money, and New Beginnings"
 CA_Bormann.7.desc: "The moon shone brightly overhead as the German agent awaited a fair distance from the main encampment of the Legion. He'd been waiting for several hours now, and he wondered if something had gone wrong. Usually the guards were just too bored, drunk, or apathetic to be effective, but there was still a risk.\n\nA fear that turned out to be for naught, as he saw the figure coming closer. He rested his hand on his weapon all the same, but given his view of the environment, he was confident this was not a trap. The woman was disguised, though he had to admit she couldn't quite pass as a man to anyone who took a good look.\n\nStill, she was doing her best, and their options for dealing with Veli were limited. The only ones who could get close to him while alone were his wives - and fortunately there was one who was willing to do the deed. For a price.\n\nShe looked to the suitcase he had in his hand. "You have payment?"\n\nThe agent smiled, and brought the suitcase horizontally, opening it so she could see the substantial sum of Deutsche Marks inside. More than enough to set her up for a decade or two. "As agreed."\n\n"And the other-"\n\n"Yes, a house in Qarshi is already reserved and waiting for you," the agent preempted. "Once we have confirmation of Kayyum's death, you will be exfiltrated." He handed her the case of money - along with a knife. In many cases, he wouldn't give the payment up front - but he knew she wouldn't betray them. She had wanted to kill Veli long before they'd offered her a reward.\n\nShe nodded sharply. "He will be dead by morning." The Agent nodded in return."
 CA_Bormann.7.a: ""We will be waiting.""
 CA_Bormann.8.t: "Marching for Glory, Marching for Victory"
 CA_Bormann.8.desc: "The offensive began at dawn.\n\nThe Turkestan Legion marched forward. Once a barely-presentable pack of bandits, they were now transformed into a fighting force to conquer a nation. Rags and scraps replaced with some semblance of uniform. Barely-functioning vehicles replaced with trucks that bore weapons and transported soldiers. Rusted and unreliable weapons discarded and replaced with rifles and artillery from Germania.\n\nRestored, renewed, the Legion marched once more.\n\nThey marched into Uzbekistan without hesitation or mercy. They marched for glory. They marched for pride. They marched for blood.\n\nBut above all else, they marched for victory.\n\nThe first gunshots rang out, accompanied by shouts of the Uzbek defenders who'd been caught off-guard - surprise which would not last. It would be this first battle that would determine the victor in this war. Legionaries moved, fired, and organized on the orders of their officers and German advisors embedded in the Legion.\n\nHVA snipers took position on ridges, hills, and the German volunteers seeded throughout the ranks worked to keep discipline among the ranks. From the hills, one such advisor watched the battle begin. Manpower, money, and resources had been poured into turning the Legion into something formidable. So many had feared it was a waste; that nothing would be gained.\n\nToday, as he heard the war cries of the Legion as the battle against Uzbekistan began in earnest, he hoped that this investment would pay off - for if it failed, the path into Central Asia would be closed for good."
 CA_Bormann.8.a: "It all comes down to this."
 CA_Bormann.9.t: "The Devils You Know"
 CA_Bormann.9.desc: "Korşirmat appraised the men who sat opposite him in the room quietly. The sunglasses he wore were a useful shield, as they obscured his disease-scarred eyes from being seen. The Germans disliked wild cards. He could tell it made them uncomfortable, but they were unwilling to demand he take them off. Perhaps they didn't wish to press him.\n\nHe had just conquered Uzbekistan after all. Funny how everything had come full circle in a way he couldn't have anticipated. Still, he wanted more, and so did the Germans. Hence why they were here now. HVA agents, uncomfortable bureaucrats, and even representatives of the Führer Bormann. Wild card or not, the Germans needed him, and unfortunately, he needed them as well.\n\n"Germany once more extends congratulations to you, Korşirmat," the leading official said, clearing his throat. "Truly a victory beyond our expectations. Would you not say?"\n\nHe nodded, but initially said nothing. He was no fool. He knew very well how the Germans worked, and knew that he was a means to an end. False praise was pointless. "We know this is not the end."\n\nThe HVA officer seemed amused at that, as he took the lead. "There are many interests at play here. There are others who wish control over Central Asia, and they will not tolerate the likes of you, or the Legion. We must begin turning our attention to the wider region - together, of course. There is only one path in Central Asia for you."\n\n'Together'. For now, anyway. Korşirmat expected that once he succeeded and Central Asia was under his control, they would try and replace him with someone more useful to German interests. He was no puppet, and that placed a target on his back. Unfortunately, for now he had to play along. He would need to simply keep one eye open."
 CA_Bormann.9.a: ""Together. Central Asia will soon be united.""
 CA_Bormann.10.t: "To Spread the Fervor"
 CA_Bormann.10.desc: "It was done.\n\nBaymirza Hayit allowed himself a moment to breathe. Uzbekistan was under the control of the Legion. He had done what Veli in his incompetence could never have achieved, and that had been worthy of celebration. At his insistence, the Legion celebrated long into the night together with their German allies, and while he wanted to indulge, the future occupied his thoughts.\n\nThe future of Central Asia, where his nation would be a beacon of National Socialism to Asia - and the world.\n\nIt was for this reason he had asked the two HVA agents that had been advising him to come for a walk under the Uzbek moon. It was time he received some answers. He had little idea of the state of the world, or even Germany, and if he was serious about leading a nation, it behooved him to be informed on the wider world. "Tell me everything."\n\nTwo decades of history were difficult to properly summarize, but the two men did their best to recount all that had happened. The SS Coup. The West Russian War. The German Civil War. So much had happened to poor Germania, and he had never known. Baymirza felt a pang of sadness upon hearing the death of Hitler, and could only hope his end had been peaceful. Fortunately, it seemed like the new Führer Bormann was a worthy successor.\n\nOnce the recounting had been finished, he took a moment to collect himself. "So much has happened, and still in our darkest hour, Germany was here for us," he finally said. "Allow me to say to you that I will continue to be a staunch ally to the Reich. I promise you this - the torch of National Socialism will soon spread to all of Turkestan."\n\nThe ranking agent nodded sharply, and smiled."
 CA_Bormann.10.a: ""Your loyalty will be rewarded. The Führer will see to it.""
 CA_Bormann.11.t: "A Final Thank You"
 CA_Bormann.11.desc: ""Let us drink, my brothers!" Veli roared as he raised his glass. "Let us celebrate this victory! For there are none who can challenge the Legion!"\n\nThis was received with cheers from the gathered men, some of whom were clearly drunk. Korşirmat himself had indulged perhaps too much, but had to admit - he'd underestimated the man. He personally suspected the German support had more to do with the outcome, but even so, they'd succeeded under Veli's leadership. When he'd been invited to celebrate, he felt he could indulge the man this one time, even if it would mean enduring a speech and Veli's drunkenness.\n\n"Now I will not pretend the road has been easy," Veli's voice turned unexpectedly somber; coiled. "I know there are those who have had doubts about our path." Korşirmat's ears pricked at that. Something was off. He listened as Veli finished."But those times are now passed - now is the time for unity!"\n\nKorşirmat suddenly felt uneasy. Veli was nowhere near drunk enough for a celebration. His eyes flitted around the room at who was here. Baymirza, his own men, himself, ranking officers...everyone who had doubts about Veli's leadership. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw several Legionaries moving closer - armed ones.\n\nVeli smiled broadly. "Thank you, my friends, for everything you have done." He pulled out his pistol, and fired it into Baymirza's chest.\n\nPandemonium broke out as the men who had ate and drank were executed by the Legionaries who'd entered. A dozen were killed before they could move, falling to the ground with slit throats. The rest were killed seconds after with a chorus of gunfire. Korşirmat reached for his own weapon before he felt a cold blade slide across his throat. As the blood drained onto the dirt, he tried to look up one last time."
 CA_Bormann.11.a: "And his last sight was Veli looking down upon him in triumph."
 CA_Bormann.12.t: "The Last Chance Saloon"
 CA_Bormann.12.desc: "Veli Kayyum slammed a shot of Vodka down his throat, but to his annoyance the glass had been so full a fair amount had ended up spilling down himself instead. He then poured out a more conservative measure to follow, once that was polished off he called out to the German agents outside to come in and talk. He immediately felt that he should have waited longer, in order for the alcohol to take its effect.\n\n"Kayyum, we have come to congratulate you on your success, we expect the future cooperation between Germany and the Legion to be of the utmost importance to you. Though we had reserved support for some other it was only in the interest of preserving our position in the region. It was nothing personal."\n\n"Of course, it's all in the past now, no point thinking about it - no point at all." But he could not help himself, he knew he had not been the first choice, hell he was not even the second; the gloom washed over him and, perhaps because of the drink, he let go of a slight sob. There was no other choice, he had to work with them, all he could cling to was the prospect that he could yet prove his worth, to himself as much as the Germans.\n\n"Efforts towards unification must begin immediately, we are counting on you."\n\nA limp wristed handshake followed, then the men left; Kayyum let go of the moment and felt himself melt against his chair - his neck bent backwards and eyes pulled toward the sky.\n\nHe poured another shot."
 CA_Bormann.12.a: "Let bygones be bygones."
 CA_Bormann.13.t: "Failure!"
 CA_Bormann.13.desc: "Agent Stefan had not been in a particularly good mood before news of the failed offensive reached him, once he was informed his range was cataclysmic. Shortly afterward, he crashed through the door of the so-called leader he knew to be responsible, brandishing his pistol with a finger firmly on the trigger.\n\n"What the hell were you thinking [UTL.GetLeader]? This whole operation is in jeopardy thanks to you. Give me a single reason why I shouldn't blow your head off here and now."\n\nThe man burst with fear, pleading with all the air in his lungs. Desperate assurances were flung out as he tried to convince Agent Stefan that the equipment and men lost in the offensive could easily be replaced. However, the agent was not so easily brought round, he could not easily trust a man who had failed him and the Reich he served so disastrously.\n\nThe agent raised his gun and lined his sights, he pulled through the first pressure of the trigger until his target was a hair's breadth from death."
 CA_Bormann.13.a: "You had your chance."
 CA_Bormann.13.b: "One more wrong move and it's over."
 CA_Bormann.14.t: "No Forgiveness."
 CA_Bormann.14.desc: ""You had your chance."\n\nThese were the last words [UTL.GetLeader] heard before Agent Stefan pulled back the trigger of his pistol and put a bullet in his head. The whole thing had lasted no longer than a couple of minutes.\n\nAgent Stefan then exited the room promptly, eager to get the whole sorry situation sorted out as quickly as he could manage. He had no doubt that what remained of the Legion would be in disarray. First the disaster of the offensive and then the loss of the leader would leave their morale in shambles, however, the condition of their equipment would not be much better.\n\nA successor would have to be found to help fix the absolute tragedy the Legion currently faced. Hopefully the fate of the next man's predecessor would give them a better sense of what was expected of them."
 CA_Bormann.14.a: "Crown of Thorns."
 CA_Bormann.15.t: "The Last Gasp"
 CA_Bormann.15.desc: ""One more wrong move and it's over."\n\nIt took a moment for [UTL.GetName] to fully realise the meaning of these words, he had truly believed that they would be the last he ever heard. It was only when the agent before him had lowered his pistol that he knew what had happened.\n\n"Thank you agent, you won't regret it, I won't fail you again."\n\n"Indeed, there is no other option for you, there is no room left for failure.." Agent Stefan's voice had calmed somewhat by now. He slid the gun back into its holster and turned back to leave through the door he had barged open moments before.\n\n[UTL.GetName] lurched out of his slumped position and hurriedly got to work on organizing the next move of the Legion. Despite his prior promises he new better than to expect the coming fight to be remotely easy, his troops had been torn to shreds - those who were left had their morale in tatters. It would be quite a feat to right the course of his shrinking ship."
 CA_Bormann.15.a: "There will be no more mercy." 
 CA_Bormann.16.t: "The Foothold Secured"
 CA_Bormann.16.desc: "Officer Alfred Eichinger laid down the report on his desk. There had been many reports he had read, ordered, and delivered to his superiors over the past few months since the operation with the Turkestan Legion had started. This one, however, was a substantial milestone.\n\nIt was done. Uzbekistan was under the control of the Legion.\n\nHe allowed himself a sigh of relief. He couldn't imagine what would have happened if all that time, energy, money, and manpower had all been for nothing. Frankly, given where the Legion had come from, the threat of failure had kept him up at night. However, German skill had been enough to win the day for the Legion, and subsequently, the Reich.\n\nThe Führer would be pleased.\n\nTheir path into Central Asia, and hold on the Legion was solidified. Unfortunately, this was only the first phase of what Alfred knew would be a far longer campaign. People much more important than him were starting to get involved now that there was a growing possibility of the region falling under German influence - this operation was going to see an influx of resources and funding shortly.\n\nThey would need it.\n\nThe other nations of Central Asia - and their respective superpower backers - were starting to turn their eyes to each other. The report indicated that there were preparations for a summit of nations throughout the region - one which would decide if there was to be unification or war. The Legion was going to participate, and it appeared this would be a true test of their influence..\n\nAnd if it fell to conflict, they would ensure the Legion was prepared for the war that followed."

HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CIA APPARATUS - WITH DEPARTMENTS PERTAINING TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE TWO INDIAS - IS SUFFICIENT TO INFLUENCE CENTRAL ASIA WITHOUT GETTING DISTRACTED ON IRAN OR THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT.\n\nFOR THIS REASON, I CONCLUDE THAT A NEW DEPARTMENT PERTAINING SOLELY TO CENTRAL ASIAN MATTERS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. DOING SO WILL MAKE IT FAR EASIER FOR US TO INFLUENCE THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL ASIA; IF WE ESCHEW THIS PROPOSAL, IT WILL MAKE THINGS FAR MORE DIFFICULT. ACCORDINGLY, I RECOMMEND THAT IT BE REJECTED ONLY IF WE HAVE NO PLANS TO INTERVENE IN THAT AREA.\n\n[NAME WITHHELD]"

 CA_US.1.b: "No, what could that bit of scenic nowhere even offer us?"
 CA_US.2.t: "An Opportunity in Turkmenistan"
 CA_US.2.desc: ""Come again?" The older CIA official lowered his newspaper, not entirely sure that he'd heard correctly, and briefly glanced at the young analyst - what was his name, Max? Whoever he was, he'd come in with apparently important news.\n\n"Turkmenistan, sir," he repeated. "There's been some developments. The President has announced that elections are going to be held."\n\nTurkmenistan - right, central Asia. It'd been a while since he'd dealt with anything in that region. The CIA hadn't even maintained a skeleton office until recently. There wasn't a lot there except despots, tribes, and former Soviet territories. Not a lot of opportunities for American interests so to speak, but elections? Now that was something interesting. He set his newspaper down, facing the analyst fully. "How significant is this?"\n\n"Significant, sir," Max said, shifting in place a bit, seemingly caught off guard he was now being taken seriously. "The President has maintained an 'interim' government for years now. This is a big step for him. If I had to make a guess, sir, it's almost certain that he's going to win. He's a hero to the people."\n\n"Right, right, remind me who the president is?"\n\n"Poda Annaorazov, sir," Max reminded. "You may remember that he was the one who repelled the Shah's invasion of the nation."\n\nAh, now he remembered a bit more. And as Max said, if he was now holding elections, he was likely overconfident he would win. However, he wouldn't be the first man whose overconfidence in elections could backfire. If there was ever an opportunity to exert some influence in central Asia, this may be it - or on the other hand, it could admittedly just be a waste of time."
 CA_US.2.a: ""I think we can take advantage of this. I'll pass this along.""
 CA_US.2.b: """There's nothing worthwhile in Turkmenistan.""
 CA_US.3.t: "Presenting the Options"
 CA_US.3.desc: "Max calmed his nerves, even as difficult as it was. It wasn't everyday he had to present before senior CIA officers - including the director of field operations. His update on Turkmenistan had been passed up much higher than he'd expected, and now operations were being planned. His job now was to explain the candidates.\n\n"There are three major candidates in the running," he began. "We'll start with the current President - Poda Annaorazov. He is the overwhelming favorite, and for good reason. He was already a war veteran, and more importantly, the reason Iran was unable to take more of Turkmenistan. Needless to say, he hates the Reich, especially since he is a staunch communist."\n\nHe moved to the next projection slide. "Ziyauddin Babakhan," he continued. "He is a unique candidate. Not a soldier, but closer to a priest. He is a devout Muslim, and his political philosophy is fusing socialist theory with Islamic tenants - which has made him very appealing to the Islamic community. Compared to his contemporaries, he's the most moderate, and I believe, the most useful for our interests."\n\nNow came the last slide. "Mirsaid Sultangaliyev," he finished. "He was one of the earliest to align with the Bolsheveiks, primarily to empower the Islamic community through communism, though there was a later falling out. He's the most nationalistic out of every candidate - he hates the Reich, but he is a staunch anti-imperialist - which could potentially cause us issues."\n\nThe officers listening nodded, and with the overviews out of the way, asked him a few more specific questions,before deliberating among themselves. They probably weren't happy with the options, since all of them were some flavor of communist, but this was the hand dealt. Finally, the senior analyst nodded to him. "We believe we know who we will back.""
 CA_US.3.a: "Poda Annaorazov is a known quantity, and can be accounted for."
 CA_US.3.b: "Ziyauddin Babakhan can be most easily exploited."
 CA_US.3.c: "Mirsaid Sultangaliyev will deny anyone else the chance to interfere."
 CA_US.4.t: "Death, by Exile"
 CA_US.4.desc: "Michael had always known that there were risks in being a field agent. There was no shortage of stories about agents getting captured and tortured operating in the Reich and the Sphere. Still, out of all the places to be captured, the middle of nowhere in central Asia was not what he'd ever expected.\n\nIt was supposed to be simple. Go into Turkmenistan, make a few contacts, exercise a little force when necessary, a little subterfuge everywhere else. Help make the election go in a certain direction. Standard stuff, simple, straightforward. The nation wasn't exactly a bastion of progress, so he'd thought this would be simple.\n\nAnd he'd been wrong.\n\nHe couldn't say exactly how it happened, but someone must have seen him sneaking around the election offices, and subsequently got the jump on him. And so he found himself waking up on the back of a horse, bound and gagged, bruised and sore all over, and for the first time in his life, thinking he was going to die.\n\nThe horse suddenly stopped, and he found himself being shoved off the horse. He tried to get up, and saw who his captor was. It was a young man, probably one from the local tribes, who looked angry. Michael tried to lift his hand in placation, expecting the worst, but to his surprise, the man cut him free - and his elation dissipated when the man then pulled out his gun at him.\n\n"Go," he said in broken English. "And no come back."\n\nMichael looked out to where he was - and he realized what this was. A death sentence. He was in the middle of nowhere, maybe Turkmenistan, but more likely near Kazakhstan - not that it mattered. He would probably wander aimlessly for days before the end. "But I will die." The man smiled coldly, and nodded."
 CA_US.4.a: ""Yes foreigner, you will.""
 CA_US.5.t: "the Morning Routine"
 CA_US.5.desc: "Work within analysis never had a dull moment, so thought Ian Droderan, a proud employee of the CIA and proud patriot.\n\nHe had a routine. He took the bus to work, stopped at the coffee place outside his field office, and picked up a newspaper or four while he was at it. He didn't read these papers for pleasure, but because oftentimes they gave him faster information than the agents that purportedly answered to him.\n\nToday was no different, and he hummed a tune to himself as he opened the door to his office, making sure not to spill his coffee. Things had been more interesting of late - Central Asia had recently taken a focus due to the Turkmenistan elections, and he knew that had been too tempting for Uncle Sam to pass up. Well, he didn't know for sure, but he wouldn't be surprised if that was happening.\n\nHe doubted that the CIA was moving more agents and analysts to focus on that region. He'd taken to doing some reading on the region himself, in case he was ever moved. Much more interesting than he'd thought. He wondered if this would be a fad and resources would be moved back to German analysis, or if this would be the start of a long-term focus to central Asia.\n\nHe supposed a lot of it would depend on if the elections went the way they wanted. He didn't know who the CIA was backing, even if he could make his guesses. Today was the day they'd find out though, as this was when the election results were to be published.\n\nSettling down comfortably, and taking a sip of his coffee, he pulled out one of the papers, a feeling of anticipation filling him as he opened it. There it was printed, and it seemed like the winner of the Turkmenistan elections was..."

 CA_US.6.t: "Turkmenistan Contingencies"
 CA_US.6.desc: "The President put down the report. "This is problematic."\n\nThe rest of the room didn't have an immediate response; a few muffled coughs from the assembled cabinet, the military officers stood still, and intelligence officials waited for their chance to speak. The news had come in only hours ago - Poda Annaorazov had won the Turkmenistan elections. The outcome itself wasn't surprising considering the man's popularity - but such a hardcore communist in charge was far from ideal.\n\n"What are our options?" The President demanded after a few moments. "Everything on the table."\n\nThe CIA Central Asian Directorate Overseer - Jackson - hesitated briefly. "Frankly, we only have two viable options. We can accept the results as they stand - it's unlikely Poda will be any more open to the Japanese or Germans than to us. Alternatively, we have contingencies."\n\nAt the President's nod, he continued. "We have identified an individual who we believe will be open to our interests. Sarry Karryev, an actor turned military officer, turned politician. He has the political influence, as well as the initiative to take control...should it become required."\n\nThe President frowned. "Take control. Implying this would be done without his knowledge?"\n\n"Not this one," Jackson smiled thinly. "He's a patriot. He would never agree to betray the government - and especially not Poda. If necessary, he will act - we would just need to facilitate a situation where that could be done. I understand that Mr. Karryev is not be the perfect conduit for our interests, but he is far more aligned to us than Poda or any of his ilk. In the end, the choice is yours. What do we want to do?""
 CA_US.6.a: "It's time for a change in leadership. Execute the contingency."
 CA_US.6.b: "We'll handle Poda diplomatically. The contingency will remain inactive."
 CA_US.7.t: "Dixie Man in Turkmenistan"
 CA_US.7.desc: "George Wallace had never gone to the land called Turkmenistan - hell, he had never gone to any of these strange Mohammedan countries, what with all their absurd domes and beards and nonsense like that. He - like so many other proper God-fearing Dixie men - could only name a few cities out of that part of the world, and all of them were in the New Testament. Of course all that had to change the moment it was found that Turkmenistan was threatened by a socialist good-for-nothing, and under his strong management the Turkmen government had removed the parasite and replaced him with a more sound man, a military officer named Sarry Karryev.\n\nThings in the capital of Aşqabat started off more-or-less fine (after some priming by Wallace's trusty CIA officials, who told their president just what not to say). At lunch, Wallace stood up and made an address: "Mr Karryev, ladies and gentlemen, good and free people of the Republic of Turkmenistan, I thank you all very much for your hospitality. It has warmed my heart to see the people of this country flourish under the recent increase of the three great freedoms - of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I would especially like to congratulate Mr Karryev on his successful holy war - 'jihad' I believe you fine people call it - against the evil of socialism, which as we all know is a brother-ideology to the insanity that is Nazism." After his address finished he uttered some mangled words in Turkmen and sat down to the amusement and pleasant clapping of the audience.\n\nAmidst the polite applause, Karryev nodded and made his own speech, filled with similar platitudes. Later on, the two sat down for discussions.\n\n"You can be sure, Mr Karryev, that you'll have our full support in the current crisis." Wallace assured. To that Karryev nodded gratefully.\n\n"Thank you, Mr President. While I'm sure you had your ulterior motives, I trust your commitment to my governance." Wallace looked at him in a new light; truly, this man was more perceptive than he had thought.\n\nKarryev continued: "While it may be premature, when things are more stable, I'd be honored to discuss more... detailed, deeper agreements between Turkmenistan, your United States, and the wider OFN I believe you call it."\n\nWallace nodded. An outright ally in the region would be wonderful for the interests of the free world."
 CA_US.7.a: ""Whenever you want to discuss it, Mr. Karryev, we're ready. No 'premature' here.""
 CA_US.8.t: "Shared Perspectives"
 CA_US.8.desc: "Curtis LeMay had never been to Turkmenistan, nor much of Asia for that matter. It had been region he'd only had passing familiarity with, but this apathy had quickly been changed after a few briefings, looking at a few maps, and considering the broader implications. A gateway on the edge of the Middle East, Sphere, and Russia? Yes, this was a matter he'd handle personally.\n\nThe plan had been executed with perfect military precision. A few well-placed shots here, a few accidents, and the communist snake had been decapitated. Priming the country perfectly for a steady hand to step in and calm the chaos. LeMay wasn't surprised that Sarry Karryev had acted as expected - that was what soldiers did. Taking charge.\n\nKarryev had greeted him in Aşqabat personally, and they'd gotten to talking, soldier to soldier. LeMay found that there were some interesting parallels - both of them had been soldiers turned politicians, in similarly unexpected circumstances. There was common ground there, and moreover, both were patriots of their respective countries.\n\nWhile he would like to exchange war stories all day, there was business to attend to, and a situation to address. "I assure you," LeMay said once their lunch was finished. "The United States is ready and willing to support you and your people in this crisis."\n\n"Your offer is appreciated," Karryev answered. "While it may be premature, once the situation stabilizes, I would like to discuss in more detail some...agreements between the United States, and the wider OFN."\n\nLeMay smiled at hearing that. An ally in the region was almost ensured, and potentially one to join the OFN. This had only gotten better - all he would need to do is keep the good man on his path, and soon Central Asia would be theirs."
 CA_US.8.a: ""Not premature at all, Mr. President. We would be happy to discuss details.""
 CA_US.9.t: "Sufficient Deterrence"
 CA_US.9.desc: "Sarry Karryev was a man that Goldwater did not completely trust. As he had been informed, the man wasn't the most reliable of individuals in regards to receptibility to US interests - but he had been the best option on the table. The only reason he'd signed off on the operation was because of the strategic importance Central Asia had.\n\nAnd here he was in Aşqabat with Karryev, and playing the part of an interested statesman. "I understand that there is some unrest you are handling," he began. "I would like to personally assure you that the United States is willing to provide support to put down these communist insurgents."\n\nKarryev carefully set down the glass of water in his hand. "While the offer is generous, Mr. President, we have the situation under control. It is a...difficult time, as you can imagine."\n\n"Of course," Goldwater said, not overly surprised. "Still, one can never be too careful. Insurgents have a habit of making life difficult."\n\n"I'm very familiar with it, Mr. President," Karryev answered, almost wryly. "There's been enough chaos, it will calm down soon."\n\nThat would have to be sufficient. Goldwater hoped that Karryev was committed to it, but he was skeptical. No doubt he would go easier on the communists than was smart, but not much he could insist without it becoming suspicious. "Regardless, you can rest assured that should it be necessary, the United States will support you."\n\nKarryev nodded gravely. With Iran, Afghanistan, and a uniting Russia, Turkmenistan might be an alluring target to outsiders. "This is appreciated, Mr. President. I suspect that will be a sufficient deterrent from anyone wanting to meddle further.""
 CA_US.9.a: "It will - that I can promise."
 CA_US.10.t: "A Mutual Arrangement"
 CA_US.10.desc: "Margaret Chase Smith had to admit that this was one of the more uncomfortable trips she'd taken. Not just because it was to Turkmenistan, and the weather was too arid for her tastes, but the circumstances around it. Her impression of Sarry Karryev was fairly good; a man who'd taken charge in a terrible situation. A situation that she had signed off on creating. He was different from the kind of people they usually used in these situations.\n\nIt had to be done, of course. Central Asia was vital to containing Japan and that they were near Russia and the Pakt puppet of Iran was just as significant. America's interests came first - at any cost.\n\n"I appreciate your recognition so quickly, Madam President," Karryev said once they were seated. "It certainly helped prevent the situation from worsening."\n\n"Of course," she answered with a smile. "A democracy as new as yours must be protected."\n\n"Which I'm certainly grateful for, along with the rest of the OFN," Karryev said neutrally. "I'm sure you have ulterior motives, but I think we can both work to come to an arrangement."\n\nPresident Chase betrayed no reaction as she took a sip of water. A small smile was on his face, and she was reminded that he was an actor - and more perceptive than she'd expected. All the same, she could work with that. Candid, but not revealing - her words needed to be careful. "I'm glad we understand each other, Mr. President. I happen to agree with you."\n\nKarryev's smile was maintained, even though his expression was unreadable. She found herself in an interesting position - one where her leverage was not as great as expected. And Karryev, it seemed, might be a more troublesome ally than they'd hoped."
 CA_US.10.a: ""I hope this is the start of a fruitful relationship, Madam President.""
 CA_US.11.t: "Assets of Questionable Quality"
 CA_US.11.desc: "The President lowered the report, and nodded once. There weren't many in the room, just a few cabinet members and intelligence officials who'd delivered the briefing on the Turkmenistan election results. "I suppose this was the most likely outcome."\n\n"It was, Mr. President," the CIA Central Asian Directorate Overseer - Jackson - confirmed. "As we expected, Poda picked an ideal time to run and conducted a highly successful campaign. This, combined with his own inherent popularity were more than enough to send him over the finish line."\n\n"And now we have to deal with him," the President moved to sit down. "Poda and his newly legitimized democracy. Not ideal."\n\n"Not ideal," Jackson concurred. "However, this is something that we can work with. Poda is a known quantity, one which we can anticipate and move around. He is predictable, and his tendencies and motives can be exploited - knowingly or not. In terms of him serving as a bulwark against the other actors in the region, he can be a useful variable."\n\nThe President nodded, though with a frown. "Though he'll not be receptive to our recognition."\n\n"No, which is why we'll need to be careful," Jackson paused. "Poda is far from the most receptive ally we could have in the region, but he can serve a purpose in other ways as I described. Beyond that...I suppose we'll see if he's committed to democracy, or if this was a one-time event."\n\nThe President nodded once, as he leaned back in his chair. It was the best they would get, so it fell upon them to make the most of it - no matter how difficult it might be."
 CA_US.11.a: "That will be all. Dismissed."
 CA_US.12.t: "To Unleash Chaos?"
 CA_US.12.desc: "Senior Central Asia Analyst William set down the report, and took a few seconds to rub his forehead. Mirsaid Sultangaliyev as President of Turkmenistan, now that was going to shake things up. It hadn't been necessarily surprising that he'd won - appealing to nationalism was a proven strategy, especially when fused with the dominant ideology and religion.\n\nHe knew that the President would almost certainly be ready to initiate a change of leadership, and it would be difficult to present an alternative.\n\nSultangaliyev was a hardline nationalist and anti-imperialist. Turkmenistan would become hostile to any interference, for any reason. The good news was that would be directed at the Germans and Japanese. The bad news was that it would similarly apply to the United States.\n\nAlthough...a thought came to him. An angle that the President might consider as an alternative to a coup. It was almost certain that Sultangaliyev was going to mobilize the nation to "unite" the region under one people, nation, and religion. War was almost certaintly on the horizon.\n\nA war right on the doorstep of the German ally Iran, too close to the Sphere for them to be comfortable, and right under the shattered Russian nation. Turkmenistan would never threaten America, nor her interests, but Sultangaliyev very well could prove to be a headache to everyone else - and that was certainly worth something.\n\nThis pan-Turnism that he espoused...well, perhaps there could be some steps to make that a little more appealing to the surrounding region. "Imperialism" was such a dirty word these days, and some rebranding was necessary. Although this would be a lot of work, and admittedly, this would hurt the Germans more than help America. Nonetheless, the President expected a recommendation, and that he would provide."
 CA_US.12.a: "Far too much of a risk to be worth it. A change in leadership is coming."

 CA_US.13.desc: "The President frowned once they read the report. "This does not seem ideal."\n\nThe State Department official cleared his throat. That was somewhat of a misunderstanding, but then again, that was why he was here to give the brief. "I understand it might seem that way, sir. However..."\n\n"This says he's a Turken nationalist," came the answer, very much unimpressed. "And a communist. Everything points to this Sultangaliyev..." their lips stumbled over the word. "...President of Turkmenistan destabilizing the region. And he hates foreigners."\n\nAn awkward cough. "All correct, sir, which is the point. He would be a concern if he were on or near our borders. Instead, he is far closer to the only German ally in the region and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. President Sultangaliyev is most firmly against German influence - and to a lesser extent the Japanese. He won't view us favorably, but I can assure you he'll be a much bigger problem for them."\n\nThe President considered that. "A fair point. You think he can be worked with?Though he doesn't strike me as taking too kindly to foreign support - even well-intended."\n\n"Not in the traditional sense, sir," the official clarified. "He won't accept any overt overtures - he'd view it as meddling."\n\n"And something more clandestine?"\n\n"That could be arranged," the official smiled. "We can let him do his thing. If any...support happens to crop up, it will by no means come back to us.""

 CA_US.14.t: "Cost-Benefit Analysis"
 CA_US.14.desc: "A whistle was heard as Senior Central Asia Analyst William read the report. Ziyauddin Babakhan, now President of Turkemnistan. Well, that was certainly an outcome, and out of the possibilities, arguably one of the most unlikely to occur. Beating out the war hero and the nationalist? No small feat. They'd have to reassess the electoral strength of the Islamic population after this, because clearly, it was much greater than they'd expected.\n\nAssuming there was no external meddling of course - And if there had been, well, he certainly didn't know about it. His job was going to be helping determine a path to take. He already knew that the President was absolutely not going to be happy with a socialist - and likely Islamic state, being established.\n\nThe ironic thing was, by every metric, this was perhaps one of the most stable outcomes that could happen for both the country and region.\n\nFrom what he'd recalled from the dossier on Babakhan, he was a moderate. Well-liked, well-respected. Granted, he was a communist, but even his ideology was tempered compared to his peers. He was someone who might be open to cooperation. It certainly wouldn't be the first time the United States worked with a communist nation against a greater enemy.\n\nOn the other hand, there was an open question on if Babakhan would pursue the kind of foreign policy most useful to them. He was no warrior or nationalist, and would be content to focus on his nation. Good for his people, not so much for American interests. Given this, it wouldn't be difficult to propose removing him, and replacing him with someone more useful.\n\nStill, that would be a lot of work, and he wasn't convinced it was even necessary. Still, the President was going to be expecting a recommendation from him, so it fell on him to provide one."
 CA_US.14.a: "Too passive to be useful. Someone more reliable will be needed."
 CA_US.14.b: "There are worse potential partners. We can work with him."
 CA_US.15.t: "A Moderate, Relatively"
 CA_US.15.desc: ""An Islamic state," the President lowered the report with a frown. "Interesting. This wasn't expected, I assume?"\n\n"President Babakhan was always in contention," the State Department official briefing him said, giving the brief overview. "He was well-respected, especially among the Islamic constituancy, and was helped by the fact that Islam is the dominant religion in the region. More importantly for us, sir, he is a relative moderate who primarily wants to improve Turkmenistan. It appears that agenda was appealing to a majority of voters."\n\nA nod was returned, as the President lowered the report onto the table. "Moderate, but he is a communist, correct?"\n\nThe official resisted a wince. "Frankly, sir, every possible candidate was a communist. This was a former Soviet territory, and communism has never really faded. By that standard, yes, he is a moderate. His ideology is closer to a kind of Islamic socialism than traditional communism."\n\nThe President thought for a moment. "Has there been any international recognition?"\n\n"Not officially, no," came the answer from the official, shaking his head. "Germany and Japan have refrained from commenting. Russia is still splintered. Iran has mobilized soldiers on their borders - I suspect they are spooked by the establishment of an Islamic state so close to their borders."\n\nHe appraised the President, who was still in thought. "Are you considering that we recognize them?"\n\nThere was a moment where he thought the President was considering it, before he saw the head shake. "No, that might have unintended consequences," the President answered. "However, it may be in our best interests to keep an eye on this. Pass that on.""

But for the life of him he couldn't find anything even remotely useful anywhere in the RND files, or in any other files of any agency before it. All he had was a useless faded folder noting the existence of a German-aligned 'Turkestan Legion' and no more.\n\nSitting down next to a fireplace in his palatial residence in Germania, Gehlen's face looked more and more like he had been forced to chew on a lemon and then those Indian 'karela' bitter fruits in quick succession. That was because it had become clear to him that the folder he had found was stunning in its uselessness and utter mediocrity.\n\nIn the folder there was nothing but vague confirmation of the Legion's existence in Central Asian territory, its service on the German frontline during the wars in which it was established, and a whole lot of outdated information that was probably useless even at the moment it was written.Gehlen sighed in frustration and resisted the urge to swear. Throwing the useless folder and its contents in the fireplace - no big loss, he could've found all this 'information' in the bloody Volkshalle library - he took his phone and began to speak."

 CA_Speer.4.t: "From the Mountains"
 CA_Speer.4.desc: "Agent Bauch crossed the dusty mountain trails of Turkestan like a phantom, covered by the dead of night. Kayyum was still hours away - the agent worried he may not arrive by morning. Somewhere ahead was a distant rumbling sound, but the agent put it off. In his mind, there was no time for detours.\n\nSuddenly, the rumble turned to a roar. In a flash, a truck pulled out of some unseen alcove as a din of shouts and clamour came from every direction. A few teenagers jumped from the flatbed, pointing guns and hollering. From the looks of it, they were Kayyum's soldiers. Clad in an assortment of Wehrmacht armor and casual wear, the gang looked unprepared for a skirmish, let alone a battle. These men were only fit for one task - extortion.\n\nA soldier stepped out from the passenger seat. He seemed to be the oldest of the group, and the only one with full fatigues. "You thought you could sneak past us, boy? The Khan demands tribute."\n\nThe agent was fairly certain that "the Khan" didn't know a thing about this band of ruffians - hopefully they respected Kayyum enough to not interrupt his crucial negotiations. "I have been sent from Germany to see Veli Kayyum Han. I have my papers here-"\n\nThe leader pointed his pistol towards Agent Bauch's pocket with a stern glare. "If you aren't reaching for payment, it's not worth the trouble. Just pay up, or you're going to find yourself buried to the neck, blooded and beaten, just waiting for the sweet release of-"\n\nThe agent scoffed. "Fine." He pulled out an ornate watch - meant as a gift to Kayyum, ironically - and threw it to the soldiers. "This enough?" The boys quickly surrounded the watch, mesmerized by its glean of its metals. "With that concluded, could you take me to the nearest city? I have further payment if you'll let me hitch a ride.""
 CA_Speer.4.a: "With greed in his eyes, the leader eagerly nodded."

 CA_Speer.5.t: "Gristle and Bone"
 CA_Speer.5.desc: "Ostensibly, this was a business meeting, Agent Bauch continually reminded himself. It was his duty to the Abwehr to take this mission seriously. But staring at the face of Veli Kayyum Han, one single thought rang through his mind - he had never heard a man chew so loudly in his life.\n\nPerhaps Agent Bauch was just wrong. When Kayyum first brought the agent here, he claimed that this was a celebration "in honor of him, the Reich, and the Führer", which seemed to be the prelude to some greater discussion. Yet the two men sat meters apart, on either side of a massive circular table surrounded by hungry guests and covered in food and drink... and women, oddly. Until now, the agent had never been to a meeting with erotic dancers, and he hoped he would never again.\n\nYet somehow, even through the crass hollering of his fellow guests, he could still hear Kayyum chewing! Dressed as a mock khan, Kayyum desperately grasped at everything at his great feast as he leered at the women before him, a seated display of greed. The only times he would stop to discuss German support were to gloat to his deputies and bask in dreams of German wealth, openly discussing his want to "get his hands on those fancy German cars". This meeting was going nowhere.\n\nStill, there were things to be learned at this event. A few men quietly sat amongst their men instead of joining in the Khan's activities, indifferent to Kayyum's vices. Each stood with a purpose, a vigor, and most importantly, a sense of independence. Perhaps there were other factors at play in the Legion than the Bacchus that sat across the table."
 CA_Speer.5.a: "The agent made a note to himself - speak to the stragglers."

 CA_Speer.6.t: "The Jealous Marshall"
 CA_Speer.6.desc: "Agent Bauch sat in the room Kayyum had assigned him, quietly scribbling notes into his papers. With the practically medieval state of the Legion, their base was, of course, not electrified - the agent's only source of illumination was the flicker of a single candle. The time had come to review notes and select a candidate for Abweher backing, but given the state of affairs here, continued contact with headquarters would be difficult. This choice would have to be made here and now, with the ideal candidate sent to HQ to review.\n\nKorsimat was the most obvious choice. Compared to that brute Kayyum, he was composed and dignified, perhaps the only man in that building who appeared to value their work over their various indulgences. When the two had met, he was ignoring the party entirely, focused on explaining an attack set for the next morning. The fact he would attempt any real planning in that environment was admirable - that alone put him into consideration.\n\nHis other admirable trait was his, well, jealousy. In their conversations, Korsimat spoke with grim frustration of the many times he had been passed over for the position of Marshal, which he clearly felt was his to take. This man's lust for power clearly came from a need for personal satisfaction, without plan or ideology, easily manipulatable by the Abwehr.\n\nAnd yet, the agent hesitated. The Abwehr knows its enemies, and this pomp, entitlement, sense of superiority - Agent Bauch had seen all of this in the West Russian War, one of the last times he had been forced to work with Wehrmacht dogs. Those generals, lusting for valor and glory, were easy to manipulate, but they often became hard to control. A man like that would never feel content as a puppet."
 CA_Speer.6.a: "We already have one Wehrmacht, we don't need another."
 CA_Speer.6.b: "Korsimat is ideal. Envy is a powerful motivator."

 CA_Speer.7.t: "The Raving Ideologue"
 CA_Speer.7.desc: "With a heavy sigh, Agent Bauch crossed Korşirmat's name off of the list. After heavy consideration, the marshall simply wasn't trustworthy enough to be a suitable candidate for further RND support. In other words, the search would have to start over.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. There was one more option, picked as a contingency for if Korşirmat was taken out of consideration - Baymirza Hayit.\n\nBaymirza was the Legion's ideologue; at the party, he had proudly discussed his latest work, an unfinished paper on Turkic racial superiority. In explaining his ideology, Baymirza had shown a loyalty to fascism which would make him an easy ally to Germany and a hard ally to anyone else. His evident drive for control only made him more appealing - the ideologue wore his disdain for the central command on his sleeve, discussing a multitude of failings he clearly hoped to rectify.\n\nThere was only one problem, one which had worried Bauch from the moment the two had met. Baymirza was... radical, much more than the Führer and Gehlen typically supported. The ideologue's theories were, at times, troubling - the kind of racialist diatribes which would have led to his removal back in Germany. Clearly, such an asset may not be appreciated within the RND.\n\nUltimately, it was up to Agent Bauch. Even if it may lead to a stern reprimand from Gehlen, whatever choice he made here would be followed. Yet would it be wise to support a man who refuses to follow the positions of the Führer?"
 CA_Speer.7.a: "To support a racialist is out of the question. We must move on."
 CA_Speer.7.b: "He may not be a reformer, but he will make Turkestan ours."

 CA_Speer.8.t: "The Devil you Know"
 CA_Speer.8.desc: "Bleary and exhausted, Agent Bauch stared at the blank page in front of him, unable to write a word. Had it really come to this? Two candidates for leadership had been found, yet both proved woefully under the bar of the RND, not worthy of the immense effort such a coup may require. After hours of searching, it seemed that no one in this petty army was more fit to rule than...\n\nVeli Kayyum Han.\n\nNoisy, piggish, and lecherous Veli Kayyum Han.\n\nThe agent stopped himself. Professionalism was a two-way street. Yes, the Turkbashy may not be the peak of dignity, nor even on the slope, but that did not stop him from being a valuable asset. In fact, it could make him a deeply valuable asset, easy to push any direction for the right coin. By its nature, the RND regularly relied on contacts with unsavory characters, and expected its agents to interact accordingly. Agent Bauch would make this work. He had to.\n\nPlus, the agent had collected so many notes on the habits of Kayyum. Why let it go to waste?\n\nThe wick of the candle was at its final centimeters; surely the Sun would be up within the hour. Sighing, Agent Bauch grabbed his pen and began to draft a letter."
 CA_Speer.8.a: "Dear Veli Kayyum Han - a second meeting is in order..."

 CA_Speer.9.t: "The Battle of Samarqand"
 CA_Speer.9.desc: "In previous months, the town of Samarqand had been the last refuge in Southern Uzbekistan from the movements of the Legion. A fortress of Uzbek troops and guns, it seemed almost impossible that the disorder of Central Asia would find its way to that shining symbol of Turkestani nationalism. Even on that fateful morning, the garrisons around the city frittered and passed the time, ready for another day of petty formalities.\n\nNo one expected what was to come.\n\nIn a moment, the city woke to screams and gunfire, echoing through the city from the southern district where the Legion had first struck. Officers across the city found themselves pulled into a hail of bullets and bombs where city streets once stood. Even those used to fighting off bandits found that the Legion had transformed entirely - what they had remembered as a ragged force was now a well-organized army, though no less brutal in its methods. Across the city, every citizen came to realize that Samarqand may never be safe again.\n\nAnd on a hill in the outskirts of the city sat Agent Bauch, binoculars in hand, waiting for the plans of Kayyum to dissolve into his own..."
 CA_Speer.9.a: "...and hoping that his preparations had been enough."


 CA_Speer.10.t: "Kayyum Han Maqbarasi"
 CA_Speer.10.desc: "Rain splattered onto the walls of the Gur-e-Amir. The legion had attempted to gather the citizenry to hear their new leader, but few were willing to leave their homes under the circumstances - the majority of the crowd was Legionary soldiers, as well as those upstanding citizens deemed worthy of being threatened and cajoled into attendance. Kayyum's victory speech was as hollow as anything else he said, but the Legion hardly cared, lost in ecstasy and the thought of further conquest. Through cheers and roaring, Kayyum happily continued in his speech, proclaiming his conquest and adulating himself as the unifier of the Turkish people.\n\nSuddenly, something burst from the back of the crowd and pierced the Turkbashy's temple. With his chubby face bent into a gruesome frown, Kayyum collapsed forward, tumbling down the steps of the Amir's entrance. Chaos erupted from every side. Locals ran in every direction, while Legionary soldiers scattered to find whoever was responsible or depart before they were the next victim.\n\nBaymirza rushed towards the body, hoping not to save his hated leader but to find whoever was responsible. It all felt so surreal - Kayyum's body, once always marching forward in the hunt for further riches, was now a crumpled mess, his head split on the courtyard's floor. Looking out towards the city, the sniper had disappeared without a trace; from either side, deputies and officials crowded around the body, with Korşirmat-\n\nWait. Where was the Marshall?\n\n"Korşirmat! Korşirmat!"\n\nBaymirza began to turn around, expecting to see Korşirmat rushing towards the body. Instead, he saw the Marshall's hand, wrapped around a pistol."
 CA_Speer.10.a: "And then he saw no more."

 CA_Speer.11.t: "What Must Be Done"
 CA_Speer.11.desc: "The Turkestan Legion lost many great men in the invasion of Samarqand. Some, a small number, were killed by Uzbek soldiers. A great many more were killed by their own kind.\n\nAfter Veli Kayyum Han fell to the floor, his followers were next. Officers loyal to the Marshall organized death squads who roamed the streets of the Legion's new conquest, hunting anyone who might dare challenge Korsimat's leadership. Anyone deemed so ideological as to support Baymirza or so mercenary as to follow the old Turkbashy was shot without trial. Houses were ransacked, garrisons vetted, outskirts fiercely patrolled for anyone who dared run. By dusk, the streets of Samarqand ran with the blood of fallen factions.\n\nFor some, it was revenge. Military officers, tired of incompetent leadership from parasitic bandits, were finally given permission to crack. For them, the killing was a form of justice, or perhaps a punishment for failure. Others never had any loyalty to begin with, and simply saw how the wind was turning. Some required a further push, a bribe or extortion from Agent Bauch. Their motives mattered less than their victims, regardless.\n\nAs the deaths tapered out towards the end of the day, Agent Bauch returned to the edge of town, radio in tow, determined to contact his informants in Iran. No longer would Turkestan stand inert - with Korsimat in control, the Legion could finally serve as a reliable vector for projecting power into Central Asia. For now, Korsimat would get anything he required to modernize his army. With all the deaths that Agent Bauch had caused, it was his duty to make sure something comes out of this madness."
 CA_Speer.11.a: "May a state rise from the bloodshed."

 CA_Speer.12.t: "The Throne Room"
 CA_Speer.12.desc: "Agent Bauch had to admit this room was much cleaner than he'd ever seen it, though not entirely scrubbed clean of the decade of debauchery which had gone on in its walls. Until a few weeks ago, this had been the office of Veli Kayyum Han, if one could call his old quarters an office. Now, the room would be used for an actual meeting.\n\nThe agent was no longer alone, however - Gehlen had sent a whole set of diplomats and observers to forge a more concrete relation between Korsimat and the Reich. It was clear that the marshall loved the attention. Between concrete planning and mapmaking, Korsimat stopped for heroic tales of his rise to power, filled with an energy so infectious it almost made one see past his lies and half-truths. At least work was being done between all the gloating, and it made for some entertaining stories.\n\nAs Korsimat regaled his audience with the tale of the conquest of Samarqand, Agent Bauch what few decorations remained in Korsimat's quarters. Maps. Maps as small as a notebook to as big as a table lined the walls or covered tables. Some depicted cities, strategic priorities, countries; many were of Central Asia as a whole. Most were covered with arrows and notes, a few with model soldiers and trucks.\n\nAnd one map dominated the rest, meters long, a few feet about the seat of the marshall. A map of Central Asia, simply labeled: "Turkestan.""
 CA_Speer.12.a: "And if Korsimat got his way, he would be its king."

 CA_Speer.13.t: "In With the Old"
 CA_Speer.13.desc: "Agent Bauch stopped for a smoke break. What a nightmare. Korsimat once looked so reliable - to see him let Samarqand fall into this... travesty was disappointing. Not that it mattered. After today's events, Korsimat was likely bleeding out in a ditch. If not, the agent would need to make sure that was so. In the matter of a single day, the marshall had gone from heir apparent to a rogue agent in need of suppression.\n\nBut that was a problem for tomorrow. As of today, there was a leader to congratulate - though unfortunately not a new one. Just a block away, Agent Bauch could hear the cheering of Veli Kayyum Han, congratulating himself for having stabilized the situation. Luckily, if he had any awareness of the actual plot, his speech didn't show it. It appeared the Turkbashy was too short-sighted to concern himself with investigations. That was good news, or at least good enough news. On the one hand, it meant that Agent Bauch would be able to work with the Turkbashy for years, and on the other end, it meant he had to. It wasn't going to be the most pleasant work, but if the agency succeeded, it could mean the whole of Central Asia under the Reich's control. Modernizations, reorganizations, much would have to be done, but soon the Turkestan Legion would become a force for German power projection in its own right.\n\nFor a moment, Bauch was going to allow this unreliable glutton onto the throne of a nation. It was the task that Germany, Gehlen, and the Führer required of him. For the moment, the agent looked forward to weeks of planning for the upcoming Turkes Kenes..."
 CA_Speer.13.a: "...and groaned at the thought of another dinner with the Turkbashy."

 CA_Speer.14.t: "The Mercenary's Legion"
 CA_Speer.14.desc: "For all of Korşirmat's faults - and the man had many - Agent Bauch knew that he was a competent soldier. Out of everyone in the Legion, only Veli had his years of combat experience - and even then, Veli was proof that experience didn't necessarily mean competence. It had likely been one reason Veli had repeatedly denied Korşirmat promotion - for fear that it would expose Veli's own shortcomings.\n\nShortcomings that had manifested in full force with Baymirza's gambit launched.\n\nKorşirmat had another advantage in that he had a corps of men who - ironically - were absolutely loyal. Baymirza and Veli had their own people, but their loyalty was fickle, and they were more interested in joining the winning side than aligning based on personality and ideology. Baymirza didn't have many loyalists to start with, but they were rested. Veli had more men, but they were less experienced, and tired from the failed raid on Samarqand.\n\nKorşirmat's mercenaries were also tired, but they were among the elite of the Legion - and the most organized. They were the side that the others hadn't taken into account - and neither Veli or Baymirza had been able to outwit or surprise Korşirmat. Bauch suspected that due to how skillfully the mercenary had turned the situation to his advantage, he'd had plans for this long before today - and potentially had some informants that had tipped him off about Baymirza's plan.\n\nRegardless, the battle was over, and Korşirmat was the undisputed leader of the Legion. This whole situation was a mess beyond comprehension, but it had to be salvaged. It was going to take some convincing to Germany to get them to invest any more into this venture, but the Legion remained their only option in Central Asia - and they had to use it. Lifting his radio, Bauch established a channel with his Iranian contacts - an important update was due."
 CA_Speer.14.a: "This is Bauch, we need to meet. There have been...developments."

 CA_Speer.15.t: "Sins of Impatience"
 CA_Speer.15.desc: "It was like something out of a comedy. A very unfunny comedy. Bauch wondered if Korşirmat was actually deaf, because there was no other rationalization for his actions.\n\nKorşirmat had been ordered - repeatedly - to delay his coup until they were prepared. There was no sniper in position, nor one available to be utilized yet. Any coup needed to be quick and effective - anything more risked an internal civil war. He'd thought that Korşirmat was aware of it at this point, and the man had an ounce of patience to wait for the right moment.\n\nAs it turned out, this had not been the case, and Busch could only assume the power and overconfidence had gone directly to this idiot's head.\n\nHe had watched in utter disbelief as Korşirmat had ordered his people to launch an attack - in broad daylight - against Veli, with other squads presumably sent to kill Baymirza at the same time. He'd literally seen one of the soldiers fire a barrage at a very surprised Veli, who'd immediately dove to cover while his soldiers started firing back while Bauch had immediately run to safety.\n\nNow - again - Sarmarqand was thrown into a battle. Every side in the Legion was gunning for control. It was do or die. While Korşirmat had the initiative and element of surprise, victory was far from a certain thing. Bauch heard gunfire everywhere now, and saw soldiers hunting for anyone who wasn't aligned with their chosen leader.\n\nBauch found himself cooped up in his jeep now, sincerely hoping he wouldn't be mistaken for a soldier. He cursed, seething at Korşirmat's stupidity. However there was nothing more that he could do, as trying to interfere would almost certainly kill him. All he could do was wait, and angrily hope that something could be salvaged from this."
 CA_Speer.15.a: "Power clouded judgement."


 CA_Speer.16.t: "Changing Horses"
 CA_Speer.16.desc: "Agent Bauch shouldn't have been surprised that it had been Baymirza who'd emerged as the victor here. Korşirmat had considered Veli as the most pressing threat, and planned accordingly - a mistake brought by overconfidence.\n\nKorşirmat's gambit hadn't been wholly unsuccessful - listening to the radio, Bauch had known the moment Veli was confirmed dead. It hadn't been the decapitation strike the mercenary had wanted - but it had been done. As a consequence of that, Veli's remaining soldiers had flocked to Baymirza who'd previously pulled his own people back - letting both Veli and Korşirmat's men fight it out.\n\nAnd when Veli was dead, and Korşirmat's men tired, Baymirza had ordered a counterattack with enough numbers and defectors to ultimately win. There was some uncertainty hanging over everything, but Bauch was fairly certain that Korşirmat had been confirmed dead.\n\nWhat to do now?\n\nThey'd invested a lot into Korşirmat. That'd been the horse Germany backed, and the horse had bucked them off, and subsequently gotten himself killed. There were likely some people who'd seen both him and Korşirmat meeting, and Bauch didn't want to be caught in a purge.\n\nThe good news was that he believed this could be salvaged. He was an agent of the Reich, and he could exploit that. Even if Baymirza suspected something, he wouldn't risk Germany's wrath by imprisoning him or worse. At least not if Bauch took the initiative which he needed to - Baymirza was the leader of the Legion, and there was no time to waste.\n\nHe picked up the radio, and tuned it to reach his Iranian contacts. The Turkes Kenes was approaching, and there was very little time to rebuild the Legion into something presentable."
 CA_Speer.16.a: "This is Bauch. There's been a change of plans."

 CA_Speer.17.t: "Downfall"
 CA_Speer.17.desc: "Legion celebrations were ones that Baymirza had grown to become wearily familiar with.\n\nCelebrations that were filled with drunk soldiers, messy tables, scantily-clad women, and lots of shouting and impromptu fighting. The Legion's finest, right here, and nearly every time Veli had thrown one of his parties, he excused himself as he wanted nothing to do with this debauchery unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAt least this time Veli had a legitimate reason to have the celebration. The victory over the Uzbeks had been something they could all feel pride in. If only there was a leader who deserved the adoration Veli was basking in.\n\nA moot point in the end. Soon, this would all be over.\n\nBaymirza sipped his water. No alcohol tonight. He wanted to be perfectly sober. So he watched from the dark walls; he observed the behavior of their great leader.\n\nVeli was drunk, which was hardly surprising, as that seemed to be his state more often than not. He was loud, boisterous, encouraging his equally drunk friends, and flirting with any woman that so much as glanced in his direction. If possible, he was acting even more deranged than normal. Baymirza idly wondered if his drink had been spiked by the Germans, just to ensure he was incoherent.\n\nFinally though, it seemed like Veli wanted some time alone, and stumbled up the stairs to get some air. Baymirza smiled, especially as he saw a trio of soldiers follow, who had been watching - and not partaking in the festivities. Showtime was coming, and he wanted a front-row seat."
 CA_Speer.17.a: "Setting his glass down, he headed towards the nearest balcony."

 CA_Speer.18.t: "His Final Sight"
 CA_Speer.18.desc: "Veli Kayyum stumbled towards the rooftop, his mind spinning and vision blurry.\n\nSomething wasn't right. He could tell that something wasn't right. He'd celebrated, he'd reveled in victory, all the while his emotions were a strange mixture of elation and growing confusion. He was drunk, he knew he was drunk, but it wasn't a state he was unfamiliar with. So why, he wondered in his fogged mind, was he reacting so poorly to just a few drinks. Uzbek alcohol couldn't be the cause, could it?\n\nHe needed some air.\n\nIt was an effort to not just collapse, and he had to lean against the walls to steady himself as he walked up the stairs. He had to pause and puke, before continuing up, glad that no one else was here to see him like this. Once he got to the roof, and took a deep breath of air. Already he felt a bit better, even if the stars above seemed more like streaks.\n\nHis ears pricked up as he heard someone behind him. He turned, groggily staring at a trio of Legionaries. Why were they here? He opened his mouth to ask, before they roughly grabbed him, and threw him over the edge in a quick motion.\n\nVeli didn't remember the fall.\n\nHe felt himself slam into the ground. He felt his bones break, and his organs burst. Pain shot through his body, turning it to fire. He would have screamed if his lungs weren't smashed, and all that came out was a slight whimper. He couldn't breathe; he couldn't move his body. He could only stare upwards as the life left his body. As unconsciousness took hold, his last sight was seeing the smiling face of Baymirza Hayit looking down upon him."
 CA_Speer.18.a: "And his last emotion was the realization that he'd been betrayed."

 CA_Speer.19.t: "A True Ally"
 CA_Speer.19.desc: "As the new leader of the Turkestan Legion, Baymirza understood that there were certain expectations now. Much as he had despised the man, Veli Kayyum deserved a funeral. It was only proper, and it would legitimize him as Veli's successor. Fortunately, it was all too easy for people to believe that Veli had become drunk enough that he'd walked off the edge of a roof.\n\nTragic, but believable. Even though observers noted how passive his tone had been, yet how he had grown more intense in his speech following - one which promised to lead the Legion to even greater glory and victory. An intensity gripped those who listened, as the ascendent Baymirza had taken control.\n\nThe following day had been when he had solidified himself. He had given a simple command to those loyal to him - purge the remnants. One sentence. All that was needed. His advisors would not be the slavish, incomptent, untrustworthy people Veli had surrounded himself with. They would be given opportunities to undertake 'new responsibilities' - which if they did not accept, they would be given executions.\n\nAnd now today was an important meeting. Baymirza had cleaned himself up, holding himself up with a prideful intensity. His uniform was reminiscent of a high-ranking German officer, as was befitting of his statue and importance. Those who walked past him saw a gleam in his eye, an almost fanatical fire as he walked and spoke. The expression of a man who had power, and now intended to use it.\n\nFor Baymirza would be a true ally to the Reich, unlike the fool who had come before, and the agent that had allowed his ascension would see their work rewarded. The agent was waiting, and stood as the new leader of the Legion approached. "The Legion is at the disposal of the Reich," Baymirza began. "How might we support the Führer?""
 CA_Speer.19.a: "The agent smiled, and the meeting began."

 CA_Speer.20.t: "An Unusual Invitation"
 CA_Speer.20.desc: "Baymirza frowned at the paper in his hand. It had been personally delivered to him by one of the Legionnaires, personally ordered by Veli. A single sheet, though he now saw that it was effectively the same as the sporadic notices he'd seen be posted around the town in the past day.\n\nAn invitation. It was growing later in the day, and he personally believed there were more important things to do, but if Veli was having this delivered, he supposed he might as well take a closer look.\n\nThe invitation was purportedly for a celebration, a grand feast that Veli had decided would be held. One where all of the Legion was invited, and that would bring all of them together. From the soldier to the officer, from the protegé to the teacher. A feast that would commemorate their victory over the Uzbeki state.\n\nAlong with a grand declaration concerning the Legion's future.\n\nBaymirza wasn't especially surprised that Veli was holding a feast, he hadn't even needed a reason before, just whenever he'd felt like it. What was notable was that Veli was making some effort to formalize the event. Usually, they started without warning, and ended with him and anyone who took part drunk or passed out. Perhaps Veli was finally learning something, and realizing that he couldn't keep running the Legion like his own personal bandit camp.\n\nBaymirza didn't know if this was Veli somehow managing to sober up, or if the Germans had insisted he straighten up or there would be consequences, but either way it was a...he was not going to say "promising", but it was a better sign than before. He still seethed that Veli still led the Legion, and had certainly not given up his own ambitions. However, until that day came, he might as well not give Veli a reason to get rid of him. What was the worst that could happen?"
 CA_Speer.20.a: "At least the food might be good."

 CA_Speer.21.t: "Thus Always to Traitors"
 CA_Speer.21.desc: ""...as this is only the first of many victories!" Veli roared to the crowd. "No more will the raids of our earliest days define us, for the Legion now rules nations! To the glory of the Legion!" The assembled soldiers cheered as Veli lifted his glass, a triumphant smile on his face as he stood among the tables where soldiers sat.\n\nBaymirza didn't cheer but politely clapped. He was a little bored. Veli's speech on how great the Legion was and how this was only the beginning had gone on for a while now.. Veli was sober for once in his life, which Baymirza saw as an improvement. Still, he could clearly get a crowd riled up. Everyone else definitely wasn't sober though, and Veli not taking part was...odd.\n\n"However...there will be some who will not share in this glory," Veli walked between the tables, his tone shifting in a way that set Baymirza on guard. His smile turned sinister. "We are not immune to the schemes of traitors, but I have learned their names - and many of these traitors sit among us."\n\nBaymirza froze, and even those in their drunken stupor hesitated. Veli was closer to him now, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw some Legionaries enter the building. He felt frozen, like a cornered animal. "And there is only one punishment for traitors," Veli said, almost softly as he met Baymirza's eyes, resting a hand on his shoulder.\n\nHis hand lashed out and stabbed Baymirza in the throat.\n\nBlood spilled out as Baymirza futilely grasped for his throat, falling to the ground, Veli standing over him in triumph. He couldn't breathe as his lungs struggled for air, and already his vision was fading. He closed his eyes and his consciousness faded, the last sounds he heard were the pandemonium that had broken out as the slaughter began."
 CA_Speer.21.a: "And throughout the night, screams and gunfire sounded."

 CA_Speer.22.t: "Spilled Blood and Shallow Graves"
 CA_Speer.22.desc: "The slaughter was gruesome.\n\nAgent Bauchhad expected carnage - he'd been around the Legion long enough to expect that. He'd expected a purge, which was par for the curse for men like Veli. Yet he hadn't expected that the sheer scale of death that would be like this. Everyone - everyone - that Veli had even harbored a suspicion of had been executed.\n\nThe mixed smells of the now-dead soldiers and the food in the hall were nauseating, and seeing blood and whiskey spilled and mixing together, and blood and gore covering half-eaten food was a surreally unsettling sight. Discipline allowed him to keep a straight face, but he felt disgusted by everything he saw.\n\nSimilar sights were found throughout the city.\n\nAfter being told the deed was done - which the gunfire had given away - he'd left to meet Veli. Along the way he'd seen Legionaries digging shallow graves all around the city, and tossing bodies into them. Inside the hall, he saw more tossing the bodies out of the window, where they were thrown into more mass graves.\n\nVeli was in a very good mood - a drink in his hand, and sitting at a table untouched by the carnage. Well, this had been the intended outcome. Mission accomplished. Veli was in full control of the Legion. He briefly stepped out before meeting, and opened a radio channel with his Iranian agents with a short message: "It's done."\n\nHe took a breath, and once again entered the building and towards Veli who smiled as the German agent approached. "Your support in this matter was appreciated, Agent Bauch," Veli said cheerily as he took a seat nearby. "Your superiors will not be disappointed with what we can do. Now, what do you want to discuss?""
 CA_Speer.22.a: ""The future of the Legion. We have some ideas for modernization...""

 CA_Speer.23.t: "Hasty Recalibration"
 CA_Speer.23.desc: "He didn't know who had fired the first shot. Even if he did, it didn't change the outcome, nor really mattered.\n\nAgent Bauch had been keeping well out of sight ever since the battle had started. Over sixteen hours of bloody conflict had followed, and he contemplated evacuation before deciding it was probably more dangerous to leave while soldiers were shooting everything that moved. Instead, he'd watched from the building he'd been hiding in as Veli's men fought against Baymirza's loyalists. He'd listened on the radio as a team of Korşirmat's mercenaries were encircled by other Baymirza loyalists, ended abruptly by a gunshot.\n\nThroughout the capital, gunfire had sounded throughout the evening, night, and morning, growing more infrequent as the hours had passed. With the dust now settled, it appeared there was a clear winner. Baymirza Hayit had apparently secured enough of the Legion to emerge victorious.\n\nThis entire operation had been a disaster, and Bauch didn't want to think about how he was going to reconstitute the Legion before the anticipated Turkes Kenes arrived. The battle had reduced the Legion's numbers significantly, and even if Veli and Korşirmat were almost certainly dead, it would take weeks at minimum before each loyalist was dead - which was to say nothing of desertions.\n\nNothing he could do about that now. He needed to act. He hastily sent a radio message to his Iranian contacts; brief and clear: "Baymirza controls the Legion. Details shortly." They'd know where he was to meet them, and that would be passed back to Germania. With a sigh, he also hastily hashed out a letter to Baymirza, requesting a meeting as soon as possible.\n\nThey had very little time, and needed to make the most of it."
 CA_Speer.23.a: "Hopefully the Hitlerite was as reliable as he claimed."

 CA_Speer.24.t: "The Show Goes On"
 CA_Speer.24.desc: "Agent Bauch personally wasn't surprised by the outcome. The battle that had happened was the absolute last chance any of the people vying for control of the Legion would have, especially after everything that had happened. Of course none of them had thought about if they had the loyalty, skill, and plan to do so - they had just acted.\n\nNow they were dead.\n\nVeli had been the leader and face of the Legion for decades now, and couldn't simply be replaced by haphazard plans based on luck. No matter how many officers Baymirza had tried to convince or bribe, or the tactical skill of Korşirmat and his mercenaries, it just wasn't enough to weaken the grip Veli held over the majority of the Legion - and had held for years.\n\nWhen push came to shove, most of the Legionaries stood by the man who'd led them for so long.\n\nThe battle had gone on for a long time; much longer than he'd expected. All the same, it was over by morning, with only the occasional gunshot every so often. Bauch released a breath, not wanting to think about how much of a disaster this entire operation had been. Veli had enough control to stabilize it relatively quickly - which wouldn't have been the case with anyone else. He disliked the man immensely, but with the Turkes Kenes approaching, there was no one else.\n\nA short message had been sent to his Iranian contacts: "Legion secure. Veli retains control." More details de planned to share with the Iranians at the usual meeting point, which he knew would get back to Germania shortly. Once that was done, he quickly wrote out a letter to Veli, requesting a meeting. Whatever his personal opinions, Veli's hold on the Legion was solidified - and they needed to get to work."

CA_JAP.3.desc: "A dozen times over, Mohammed Zahir Shah refused to join Japan's Sphere. After two decades, the King assumed such missives had finally ceased. Yet today a small group of Japanese diplomats ardently demanded a further meeting. At first, he attempted to dismiss them - it took several attempts for them to explain that this was for something wholly new.\n\nOne man began to explain. "We have seen increasing reports that authorities in Central Asia have made moves towards unification. This presents a direct danger to the Sphere, as the claims of this 'nation' include the province of Xinjiang. We ask dearly for you to grant us access so we may deal with this threat."\n\nZahir shifted slightly in his chair. If Japan was willing to send their men this far, they must be genuinely concerned. But to give unfettered territorial access to Japan would be akin to one of their puppets, ever afraid of a Japanese jackboot. It couldn't be accepted.\n\nBefore the King could decline, the head diplomat resumed. "If this region is unified, it presents a direct danger to your northern territories. A defeat of Your Majesty in the north by this unified Turkestan could threaten the stability of your nation as a whole."\n\nSuddenly, Zahir understood the gambit of these diplomats. If the northern provinces fell, Khalat would likely break with Kabul entirely. That could not be allowed to happen. But there had to be another answer, one which would preserve the integrity of Afghanistan. King Zahir Shah would never be a slave to Japan. It could never be accepted. It could never.\n\nA flicker of a smile broke through the diplomat's face. "Do we have an understanding?"\n\nZahir could only stare down, crestfallen."

CA_JAP.7.desc: "Although we were fortunate enough to gain authorization to move through Afghan territory, the challenges do not stop there. The next problem would be the land itself - The planned route will go through some mountainous regions with conditions that are almost certainly anathema to the wellbeing of our supply vehicles. In light of this, it has been judged that we should take preventative measures to make sure our supplies don't end up furnishing the valley floor, and so we have been afforded some solutions that we have to decide between.\n\nOn one hand, we could make use of local equipment and infrastructure - A low cost solution from the people who know the terrain yet is not very sophisticated and will generally put us at the mercy of the conditions on the day. On the other hand, we could procure some standard military grade equipment to ferry us through, which has been judged as sensible and effective yet more costly than the previous option. On a third hand made of sheet metal with flashing lights blinking on it, however, some have fielded the idea of soliciting help from the Three Pearls of Guangdong, who could eagerly supply some top of the line equipment that would give us a decisive edge against the elements, but it would be at a very sizeable cost that would assuredly put us at odds with our limited budget - Going over it may raise some eyebrows.\n\nFinally, we could simply not bother. We could cut out having to procure any equipment, though it'd mean going in completely unprepared against the full unbridled force of the mountains, which has been judged as "suicide" and "unfathomable" and "possibly the worst idea you could have in this situation". And yet, the budget...\n\nIn the end, it's up to the agent in charge."
