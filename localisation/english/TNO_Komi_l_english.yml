 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VOZNESENSKY_DESC: "원래 소련의 중간급 정치가였던 니콜라이 알렉세예비치 보즈네센스키는 구소련의 작은 부분에서 그처럼 결함있는 민주주의의 유일한 수호자가 되었습니다. 경제 과학과 행정 업무에 뛰어난 재능을 가진, 동료들 사이에서 주목할 만한 보즈네센스키는 서러시아 전쟁 전 붉은 군대 스타프카에 의해 코미 ASSR의 복구 임무를 감독하도록 선택되었습니다. 소비에트 지역에서의 그의 헌신으로, 보즈네센스키는 코미의 사람들 사이에서 상당한 인기를 얻었는데, 그들은 그를 권력에 굶주린 소련 파벌들 사이의 다툼과 음모보다 평민의 이익을 우선시하는 자비로운 정치가로 보았습니다.\n\n식팁카르에서 전선과 강경파 공산당 관료들 사이의 끝없는 권력 다툼의 결과로, 현재 코미 ASSR의 보즈네센스키 대통령은 공화국에서 대중의 지지를 자랑할 수 있는 유일한 지도자로 남게 되었습니다. 정통 마르크스주의 독단주의에 환멸을 느끼고 코미를 거의 파멸에 이르게 한 소련 고위층의 무능과 보잘것없음에 앙심을 품은 그는 공화국에서 일당 독재를 허물고 정치 체제를 모든 남녀의 목소리를 대변할 수 있는 대의민주주의로 재편했습니다.\n\n비록 보즈네센스키의 부단한 노력이 평범한 코미 시민들에게는 일상의 빵과 자신감을 가져다 주었을지 모르지만, 식팁카르에서 그의 명성은 코미의 기관을 통해 코미의 민주주의를 무너뜨리기만을 위해 노력하는 많은 고약한 이들을 도시로 불러들였습니다. 그러나 보즈네센스키에 대한 도전은 극단주의자들뿐만 아니라 보즈네센스키가 자신의 지위에 있는 사람치고는 적절치 못한 행동과 다양한 사회주의자 집단과의 당혹스러운 관계를 언급하며 공화주의적 가치를 유지할 수 있는지에 의문을 제기하는 동료 민주 정치인들 사이에서도 나오고 있습니다. 하지만, 정치적 압력에도 불구하고, 보즈네센스키는 싸워보지도 않고 그가 꿈꿨던 시스템을 포기하고 싶어하는 사람이 아닙니다."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DESC: "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina was one of the children of Josif Stalin, a Georgian member of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and one of Nikolai Bukharin's fiercest rivals. Although her father vanished from the historical record during the Great Patriotic War, Svetlana was able to safely survive the chaotic evacuation of Moscow and came to find refuge in Sykvytkar, capital of the fledgling Komi Republic. While her father was infamous in Party circles for being a hardliner and socialist ideologue, his parenting seems to have driven Svetlana in the opposite direction, and she quickly associated herself with Komi's rapidly growing political center. They welcomed her as a stabilizing force in a chaotic political system, and she quickly became a figurehead for the fragile center to rally around.\n\nNow that the political situation in Komi has deteriorated, Stalina has stepped up and decided to take the reins of state herself. Although she has resorted to some rather authoritarian methods to maintain order, she insists that they are temporary measures in the name of stability, and that she will soon fully restore democracy to Komi. Some are skeptical of her claims, but her actions still trend toward the center, and she is a far more pleasing candidate for many than the alternatives."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DEM_DESC: "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina has been praised by her supporters as one of the few voices of stability or sanity in western Russia, and by her enemies as an authoritarian in denial, an opportunist who would take any chance she could to destroy the perceived radicalism she so hates.\n\nWhatever the case, Stalina's success as a politician is as unmatched as her story tragic. Her father, Iosif Stalin, was a Soviet bureaucrat and early supporter of Bukharin, who had died in an industrial accident rumored to be orchestrated on the orders of the Soviet government. In the long period following the death of Stalin, she has lost more and more - her mother, in the Great Patriotic War, her husband, purged by the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and her eldest brother, killed by friendly fire during the collapse of the Front at the end of the West Russian War.\n\nIndeed, Stalina claims that the war is where she first tasted the bite of radicalism, and when she vowed to oppose it at all costs. Stalina's party, the Sovereign Democratic Party, or PSD, gained prominence in the Komi Republic as a big tent comprised of big tents, a place for all who valued a safe and stable Russia over all else. Though Stalina's policies often borrow from left-wing populist principles, it would be most unwise to mistake her for a Marxist, as her father was. The basis for her political stances exists in the principles of "sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism" - the construction of a strong, independent Russia through an assertive foreign policy, heavy support for public welfare, and a strong, modern military.\n\nThrough the democratic process she fought so long to protect, the people have given Stalina their mandate, and the Lady of Steel stands prepared to defend her beloved Motherland from all enemies that may assail it - even if that danger is the unchecked will of the people itself."

 POLITICS_ANDREY_ZHDANOV_DESC: "안드레이 알렉산드로비치 즈다노프는 그 사람에 대해 실제로 얼마나 알고 있느냐에 따라 사랑이나 의심으로 둘러싸인 이름입니다. 즈다노프는 코미의 핵심 정치인 중 한 명인데, 대조국전쟁 전에 레닌그라드 공산당의 당수를 지낸 경험이 있는 자랑스러운 사회주의 지도자로, 결국 서러시아 혁명전선 정부와 얽혀 독일에 대항하는 러시아의 문화 통합을 장려하는 시도의 영향력 있는 인물로 활동했습니다.\n\n하지만, 전선은 무너졌고, 그와 함께 즈다노프가 애지중지하던 보편적 문화 프로그램도 그렇게 되었습니다. 정부가 식팁카르로 도망쳐오고 얼마 못 가 해산됐을 때, 즈다노프는 공화국 수립 이전의 일련의 쿠데타와 권력 투쟁에서 미하일 수슬로프와 관계를 형성하며 뒷면에 남았습니다. 공화국 초기에 보다 권위적 사회주의적인 입장에도 불구하고, 즈다노프는 최근 코미 사회주의 국가의 민주화, 소수 문화의 성장 장려, 중도 좌파와의 화해와 같은 더 많은 자유주의적 계획들을 추진해 왔습니다. 그는 보편적 문화, 과학, 이념 즈다노프시치나의 일반 교리에 더 많이 통합하고, 공산당 내 과학적 관리에 대한 연구를 우선시하며, '혁명적 예술'에 대한 표준을 만드는 것을 지지했습니다.\n\n그럼에도 그의 실체가 진정으로 변한 것이 아니라 오히려 수면 아래 깊숙이 누워 진정한 권력을 얻기만을 기다리고 있다는 소문이 끊이지 않으며, 편집증은 그를 따라다니는 것 같습니다."

 POLITICS_ALEXEI_KOSIGIN_DESC: "An economic mastermind, Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin is one of the many people to have made himself part of the chaotic politics in Komi. Starting as the director of a textile mill, he was a supporter of the Bolshevik cause but only began to climb the hierarchy of the party and its nation-wide bureaucracy a few years before the war. By the time the Great Patriotic War had begun, Kosygin had been noted by the Soviet leadership as a trustworthy Party member and an overall clever individual. During the small time window between the beginning of the German invasion and the complete collapse of the motherland, he played a key role in evacuating industry to the east. His whereabouts following the dissolution of Bukharin's government remained unknown, until years later, when he emerged in the newly formed Komi Republic. There, Kosygin distinguished himself as a brilliant economist, and a vocal proponent of the Center coalition that held the country together.\n\nSoon, he would found the Union of Young Reformers, a party of his own which still allied with President Voznesensky, but clearly followed a separate agenda. Eventually, while the coalition he belonged in held out against radicals, the Young Reformers were able to usurp power from the dominant coalition leader, and now Kosygin has become the new President. Unlike Voznesensky and his absurdly close relation with certain factions of the Left, he has been clear on this issue: there will be no negotiation and no alliances with radicals on either side of the political spectrum, no matter what. The democrats must stand on their own, and create an economic power that can challenge other contenders for the reunification of Russia - Kosygin always being the designer of these ingenious plans for reform. How far these reforms will go remains to be seen."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SUSLOV_DESC: "볼가 유역의 시골 마을 출신이라는 초라한 배경에도 불구하고, 미하일 안드레이예비치 수슬로프는 자신의 고향에서 이름을 떨치던 사람이었습니다. 공산주의 청년단을 시작으로, 수슬로프는 로스토프에서 볼셰비키의 유명한 당원들 중 한 명이 되었으며, 심지어 당의 지역 행정부와도 접점을 만들곤 했었습니다.\n\n독일이 침략했을 때, 수슬로프는 코카서스에서 게릴라들을 조직하는 위치에 지목받았습니다. 독일의 국방군이 도착했을 때, 누구도 그를 찾을 수 없었습니다. 숲속에서 싸움을 계속해나가고 있다던가, 수비대에게 교수형을 당했다는 소문이 돌았으나, 그가 그의 고향에서 멀리 떨어진 아르한겔스크에 나타나면서 아르한겔스크 사람들에게 그러한 소문들이 거짓이었다는 것이 밝혀졌습니다. 그가 젊었을 때처럼, 오래지 않아 그는 서러시아 혁명 전선의 정계에 입문했습니다. 관료제를 오르고 오르면서, 그는 서러혁전의 대표적인 정치인이 되었고, 곧 외무부 장관이라는 권위 있는 지위를 얻게 되었습니다. 시간이 흐르자 수슬로프의 영향력은 더욱 커졌으며, 그러한 사실들은 그가 차기에 총리가 될 수 있을 것이라는 믿음을 주게 되었습니다. 그리고, 서러시아 전쟁이 발발했습니다.\n\n서러시아 혁명 전선이 붕괴하면서, 수슬로프는 경제기획자인 니콜라이 보즈네센스키와 함께 식팁카르에 있는 자신을 발견할 수 있었습니다. 그들은 힘을 합쳐 조심스럽게 코미 공화국을 만들었지만, 서로가 공화국에 대해 다른 관점을 가지고 있기에, 이 불안한 협약은 곧 끝이 날 것이었습니다. 수슬로프는 권력과 영향력을 얻기 위해 재빨리 붉은 민병대의 지도자 지위를 이용했으며, 그를 통해 가까스로 자신을 정치/군사적인 사안에서 결코 쉬이 제거할 수 없는, 공화국에 없어서는 안될 존재로 만들 수 있었습니다. 오랫동안 인형술사로서 남아 있던 수슬로프는, 마침내 코미 공화국이 사회주의 국가가 되면서 나라를 다스리기 위한 계획을 실행할 수 있는 지도자 자리에 나서게 되었습니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_PONOMARYOV_DESC: "보리스 니콜라예비치 포노마료프는 긴 시간 동안 코미 공화국 내 사회주의자들의 얼굴마담이었지만, 진정한 리더는 아닙니다. 비교적 뛰어난 역사가이자 부하린 시절 소비에트 연방의 말년에 당직을 수행했던 그는, 독일이 침공했을 때 순전히 운으로 불길을 피할 수 있었습니다. 서러시아의 단결되었던 전선이 붕괴하면서, 포노마료프는 다시 한번 위안을 버리고 극단주의자들과 혁명가들의 안식처, 신생 코미 공화국으로 향했습니다.\n\n식팁카르에서, 그는 영광스러웠던 연방이 무너지기 이전의 옛 노선으로 돌아가고파 하는 수많은 혁명의 지지자들과 만날 수 있었습니다. 그 꿈이 멀어 보이긴 했지만, 공화국 좌파들의 세력에 빠르게 자리잡은 포노마료프는 여전히 그 꿈을 지지했습니다. 그러한 그를 특히나 자신의 책략의 일부로 포섭하고자 열중하는 이가 있었으니, 바로 ”인형술사“, 미하일 수슬로프였습니다. 그를 당에서 두각을 나타내게 하고, 어느 정도 권력은 물론 국회에서의 지위를 확보해줌으로서, 수슬로프는 자신이 가진 것에 만족을 표하는 포노마료프의 충성을 보장받을 수 있었습니다\n\n이제 사회주의자들은 마침내 행동으로 옮겼고, 그들의 충실한 당원 중 한 명이 서기장 직책을 맡게 될 것입니다. 포노마료프는 실질적인 영향력이 부족하며, 여전히 음지에서 활동하는 그의 동지들과 정부, 그리고 인민들의 강력하지만 단순한 허수아비에 지나지 않습니다. 그러나 그는 그것에 전적으로 만족하고 있습니다."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DESC: "세르게이 블라디미로비치 타보리츠키의 이야기는 그의 성격과 정치적 견해만큼이나 변칙적입니다. 러시아인 상인과 유대인 재봉사 사이에서 태어난 타보리츠키는 어릴 때부터 강건한 러시아 군주주의자이자 진지한 반유대주의자로, 어머니로부터 물려받은 '카인의 표식'을 없애려 했습니다. 러시아 내전 이후 바이마르 공화국으로 망명한 그는 러시아 반동계와 함께하며 신념을 강화하고, 악명 높은 '시온 의정서'를 독일에 전파하는 데 일조했습니다. 오랜 친구인 표트르 샤벨스키보르크와 함께, 타보리츠키는 러시아 제국을 파괴한 혁명의 주요 선동자로 여겨졌던 이들에게 복수하고자 전직 러시아 입헌민주당 정치가 블라디미르 드미트리예비치 나보코프를 암살했습니다. 독일에서 나치가 집권하자 타보리츠키는 독일의 지배가 러시아에서 군주제 복원의 길을 터주길 바라면서, 백군 이민자들 사이에서 나치 정권의 가장 열렬한 협력자 중 한 명이 되었습니다.\n\n다른 사람들이 그랬듯 타보리츠키 역시 뱟카에서 블라디미르와 합류했습니다. 그러나 곧 그는 자기가 주장하는 대로의 '사기꾼 차르'를 불쾌하게 여기게 됐고, 정당한 통치자에 대한 충성심을 증명하면 기적적으로 살아남은 진정한 러시아의 황제가 될 차례비치 알렉세이가 그의 신하들 앞에 나타날 것이라 진심으로 믿게 되었습니다. 뱟카에서 그의 별난 믿음을 공유할 수 있는 사람은 거의 없었지만, 그는 곧 우스티시솔스크에서 그의 추종자들을 발견했습니다.\n\n적과 친구 모두에게 너무나 불안정한 사람임에도, 타보리츠키는 그들 모두를 뛰어넘고 도시의 유일한 통치자로 부상하며 차르 알렉세이 2세의 제국 섭정의 칭호를 자처했습니다. 타보리츠키의 망상이 실현될 것이라 예상하는 사람은 거의 없지만, 가장 어두운 때에 러시아의 차르를 배반한 이들과 볼셰비키에 대한 오랜 증오가 그의 열의를 자아내는 한, 그의 통치가 흉포하지 않을 것이라 의심하는 사람 역시 거의 없습니다."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_BURGSYS_DESC: "마침내 마스크가 벗겨졌고, 시계는 계속 앞으로 똑딱거리며 움직입니다. 세르게이 블라디미로비치 타보리츠키, 과거 열성당 조직의 다크호스였던 그가 마침내 국가를 완전히 장악하게 되었고, 그의 미래에 대한 계획은 적어도 그의 많은 혐오자들에게는 이 이상 불안할 수가 없었습니다.\n\n모든 면에서 러시아 제국 부흥 협회와의 관련성을 보장하는 웅변술의 재능을 다시 한 번 발휘한 그는 비록 전적으로 더 큰 조직에 포함되어 있었어야 했지만, 지금 바로 왕정복고를 발표했습니다. 그는 오래 전 볼셰비키의 처형에서 탈출했다고 주장하는 차르 알렉세이 2세의 섭정을 자처하며, 전통주의와 제국주의 향수를 중시하는 사람들에게 엄청난 관심을 일상적으로 받으며 이러한 관심을 개방적이고 극도로 치명적인 반유대주의와 결합시킵니다.\n\n비교적 많은 수가 있을 지 모르는 그의 지지자들에게는, 그것은 마치 하느님 자신이 타보리츠키의 형태로, 제국을 구하기 위해 하늘에서 내려온 것과 같습니다. 다른 모든 사람들에게, 그는 위험한 만큼이나 불안정하고 비참한 미치광이이고, 반대파가 국가 내에서 그리고 그 자신의 마음 안에서 합쳐지면서, 질문은 명확해졌습니다.\n\n시계가 자정에 도달하기까지 얼마나 걸릴까요?"

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DEAD_DESC: "귀청이 터질 듯한 침묵이 전파를 가득 채웁니다. 시계가 멈췄고, 손이 제시간에 얼었습니다. 복된 섭정의 개인 도장이 찍힌 편지들은 더 이상 보내지지 않습니다.\n\n하지만 황동색의 장비들이 계속 돌아가면서, 잃어버린 아이의 이름아래 이교도의 시체를 갈아 뿌리 덮개로 만들고있습니다. 섭정의 도살자들이 존재하지 않는 암을 찾아 조국을 해부하는 동안 흐르는 피가 계속해서 토양을 포화상태로 만들고 있습니다. 한 때 러시아였던 납골당에는 더 많은 해골들이 높이 쌓여 있습니다.\n\n계속, 계속, 그리고 계속됩니다. 섭정의 명령을 따르기로 선택한 모든 군인과 관료들은 계속해서 그렇게 합니다. 머리부터 발끝까지 피를 뒤집어 쓰고 고약한 독 냄새를 풍기며, 수백만의 숫자를 매긴 그들은 선택의 여지가 없다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 그들은 섭정과 차레비치 알렉세이께서 보고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 정의는 그들의 이름 하나하나를 알고 있고 그들에게 실패의 책임을 물을 것입니다. 광신적인 감독관들의 총구 아래, 그들의 악몽 같은 수확은 계속되고 있습니다. 때가 되면, 주께서는 그들의 인간성을 희생한 대가로 그들에게 상을 주실 것입니다. 그리고 차레비치 자신께서 그들에게 찬란한 황금빛의 영광을 입힐 것입니다.\n\n하지만 그들의 깨어남에는 순수함이 아닌, 오직 부패과 부식만이 남아있습니다. 신성함은 없고, 오직 타락만 있을 뿐입니다. 평화는 없고, 단지 백만 개의 거대한 무덤들이 침묵할 뿐입니다.\n\n그리고 그 정상에는, 부패가 시든 살 속으로 썩어 들어가는 가운데 흐릿한 눈을 통해 텅 빈 방을 응시하는 시체의 차갑고 죽어버린 시선만이 있습니다."

A phenomenally skilled organizer, administrator, and perhaps most importantly, orator, Katushev quickly grew to dominate his party, centralizing operations in Nizhny Novgorod and shaping its policies along staunchly liberal lines. He was elected party leader in short order, and soon after stood for President.\n\nOnce again demonstrating his talent as a politician, he led the Reformers to victory, and was elected as President. Now so empowered, he intends absolutely to put his lberal policies into practice, shifting the Reformers - and the country - away from their and its socialist roots, and towards a liberal future he considers far superior."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_YAKOVLEV_DESC: "Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev's career is one marked by remarkable change and evolution. Born to a peasant family in Korolyova, Yakolev's father was a Red Cavalryman during the Civil War and an important leader in the local agricultural commune. Raised in such an environment, at a young age he became an ideological adherent to Marxist-Leninism. Under normal circumstances, he might have even become an important local politician, and maybe even beyond. But the German invasion changed all that.\n\nConscripted in the Red Army, Yakovlev saw how easily Marxist-Leninism fell to the hoards of German soldiers, crushed beneath the tire treads of Panzers, then, after it was all done, shattered into a thousand bickering generals and warlords. Such destruction forced Yakovlev to view socialism through a different, more independent lens - a view that placed human dignity above ideological purity.\n\nOriginally a member of Zhukov's clique in the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he has adapted well to the Russian Republic, organizing the Arkhangelsk Oblast into a DSNP stronghold. A firm member of his party's left flank, he has made himself famous as an orator of populist values. Now, as President and successor to Voznesensky, he intends to take both the party and the Republic in a different direction, and to ensure, once and for all, that all citizens are happy and free."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_KARDASHEV_DESC: "One of the youngest senior figures within the Ultravisionary faction, Nikolai Semyonovich Kardashev is also perhaps one of the most prominent, inextricably linked with the movement through his development of one of its foundations - the eponymous Kardashev scale.\n\nA method of evaluating the level of technological advancement of a society he, along with everyone else within the faction, ensures that every policy acts to increase it. This, together with his natural administrative abilities and affable personality, allowed him to rapidly advance towards the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nA physicist by education and trade, Kardashev takes his goal of scientific advancement very seriously. Despite this, however, he is not a member of the so-called 'orthodox' wing of the faction, and indeed disagrees with many of their projects and pursuits. Dismissing the many pseudo-scientific pursuits of others towards a nebulous 'superculture,' he instead concentrates upon economic affairs.\n\nThis expresses itself in his tireless advocacy and pursuit of developments supporting what he considers to be true ultravisionary socialism - a fusion economy where science serves the people and permits the creation of a post-scarcity society. Though many scoff at this dream, Kardashev knows it is achievable.\n\nAnd he intends to make sure that it is so realized."

 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_CHELOMEI_DESC: "A longtime member of the Ultravisionary faction, Vladimir Nikolayevich Chelomei became a household name within the movement through his tireless participation - and enormous success - within the Federation's space program.\n\nTrading on this recognition, as well as his ability to muster support amongst a broad range of influential figures within the Federation, he has been able to rapidly advance his standing, ascending to fill the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nOne of the most prominent members of what could be considered the 'orthodox' wing of the Ultravisionary movement, Chelomei unsurprisingly holds true to many of the core tenets laid down by Zhdanov and other central figures. This includes strong support for initiatives relating to space exploration as well as the ideological concept of the ultravisionary superculture.\n\nIndeed, he believes this to such an extent that he holds it as a simple fact that space is the natural 'next frontier' of the terrestrial Cold War. Securing victory in space, therefore, means securing victory on Earth, and vice versa.\n\nAnd he intends to do everything possible to ensure that the Federation achieves that victory."

 POLITICS_ANDREI_ZHDANOV_ULTRAVIS_DESC: "An Ultravisionary future is within grasp, and Andrei Zhdanov has no intention of allowing it to slip through his, or the state's, fingers.\n\nHaving occupied senior positions in Bukharin's old Soviet Union, the Komi Republic's old Assembly and now, of course, in the position of highest authority within the Federation, Zhdanov is well-accustomed to power, which he has used to advance not only his own cause, but also the cause of the Ultravisionary movement in general.\n\nHe carried it to victory through the chaos of the late Republic. He presented it with a clear path forward. With well-defined objectives that he had meticulously crafted and patiently explained to lesser men. And he had thought his confederates to have supported his view entirely.\n\nBut such was not the case. The rot had set in. Compromise and deviancy had corrupted the agenda, diverting resources and attention from critical projects, scientific and otherwise. The very destiny of the Federation itself was at stake, and as a true visionary, Zhdanov could not remain idle.\n\nRoundly denouncing and taking decisive action against the libertarians and other holders of unorthodox interpretations of the Ultravisionary agenda, Zhdanov has now reasserted his authority over the movement. Now firmly in absolute control, he can turn both his attention and the resources of the state, finally and once again, outwards.\n\nTo the stars - and beyond."

 POLITICS_FAS_COALITION_DESC: "과격한 행동의 여파로 급하게 조직된 열성당은 국가와 국민 모두를 견제받지 않는 민주주의, 사회주의, 모든 유형의 전복을 노리는 파괴적인 세력으로부터 보호하기 위해 국가 내에서 권력을 장악했습니다.\n\n코미 내에서 질서와 진보를 위해 헌신하는 많은 우익 단체들의 느슨한 제휴는 그럼에도 불구하고 협회 전체의 가장 강력한 파벌의 지도자들인 이고르 샤파레비치, 레프 구밀료프, 이반 세로프, 세르게이 타보리츠키에 의해 지배되고 있는데, 이들은 위원회 방식으로 정부 정책을 개발하고 지시하기 위해 집단적으로 행동합니다.\n\n현재로서는 공동의 목표로 단결되어 있지만, 이러한 분권 합의, 나아가 협회 전체가 견뎌내기 힘들다는 것은 모두가 잘 알고 있습니다. 각 파벌은 안정화 이후 새로운 국가가 나아갈 방향에 대해 매우 다른 의견을 가지고 있으며, 만약 그렇다면 누가 동시대인들에게 그의 이상의 우월성을 확신시킬 수 있을지, 아니면 강요할 필요가 있을지는 알 수 없습니다."

Though noble, this goal was a terrible failure in practice, to the point that the defenders of democracy have had to use the same weapon as its enemies: a military coup.\n\nNow that Komi's democracy has been saved from the brink of death, it is the military's responsibility to safeguard it, lest it be lost again and irreversibly. We must be ever vigilant; never again can extremism be allowed to threaten our liberties. Only after we have weathered the storm can the Republic return to a situation approaching normal."
 KOM_ccoup_defend_democracy_desc: "It was nearly lost, but the people of Komi have retaken their democracy from the clutches of an extremist putsch. The Republic is restored, but this may all be for naught if the same forces who nearly destroyed it rebuild their efforts. It is for this reason that we must remain vigilant, and extend our wariness of authoritarianism to the public.\n\nThe people, turned skeptical by recent turbulence, must be reminded to love democracy. Media campaigns against extremism of both the right and the left and a hunt for the anti-democratic forces in our midst are a must if we want to fully restore confidence in the liberal system." KOM_ccoup_expel_the_radicals_desc: "While the political leadership stakes out its course, most of the day-to-day runnings of the republic is handled by the bureaucracy, the police and the army. We must ensure these vital institutions can't be subverted by radicals. We will thoroughly vet our institutions and get rid of everyone with dangerous radical sympathies."

We must ensure these vital institutions can't be subverted by radicals. We will thoroughly vet our institutions and get rid of everyone with dangerous radical sympathies."
 KOM_ccoup_every_last_resource_desc: "We are at a precipice. Our beloved republic is at real threat of being destroyed by subversive forces. To save it, we must be prepared to throw everything we have into the struggle. All our resources and materiel must be put to use. Every last rouble invested. Every loyal citizen must be mobilized. We can't afford to keep anything in reserve. For the good of the republic!"
 KOM_ccoup_emergency_rule_desc: "The greatest triumph of our republic has been to end arbitrary "frontier justice" and give its people a dependable, predictable justice system to protect their rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the radicals still have sympathizers in our society, sympathizers who will abuse these freedoms to obstruct our efforts to restabilize the republic. We are forced to suspend, for the time being, some of our most cherished rights. The radicals have given us no other option."
 KOM_ccoup_restore_order_desc: "The Republican Army failed in its duty when it allowed our Republic to fall to radical forces. While loyal officers have been vital in striking back, our forces are still scattered and demoralized. This state of affairs can't be allowed to continue. Our enemies are rallying their forces, and the struggle for our home is far from over. We need our army back.\n\nWe must rally our soldiers. We must remind them of their duty. The army will restore its honor by crushing the nascent insurgency."
 KOM_ccoup_our_loyal_sympathizers_desc: "A large majority of our citizens support the republic and believe in its founding principles. Recent events have shown, however, that this majority is prone to inaction in the face of attacks by internal, radical forces. We must restore their confidence and teach them principles and tactics of resistance and mass action, so that they will resist attempts to subvert their rights and freedoms and do their part to defend the republic in the future."
 KOM_ccoup_paralyze_the_paramilitaries_desc: "Several political movements have organized their membership into paramilitaries. Previously tolerated to maintain stability, it is now abundantly clear the practice needs to end. The coup-makers leaned heavily on their armed support, but even the notionally loyal groupings proved unreliable, acting more as agents of chaos than allies. We will issue a demand for all such groupings to stand down and demobilize permanently. Paramilitaries which refuse will be subject to arrests and forced disarmament. Peace in the republic requires it."
 KOM_ccoup_restore_the_quiet_desc: "The recent instability and fighting in the republic has wreaked havoc on the economy and the day-to-day rhythm of civilian life. While we are now in the process of restoring control, this has not yet been felt by the populace. That needs to change. We will keep the streets safe for the people. We will reopen schools, markets and shops. They will see that life is returning to normal, and hopefully, it will restore their faith in our leadership."
 KOM_ccoup_komi_belongs_to_the_citizens_desc: "The recent instability has been a dark time in our short history. Our rights and freedoms came under attack, and the Republic itself came very close to falling. Insurgents were in the streets, visiting their thuggery on an undefended people. We were at the precipice of something truly dark.\n\nThrough immense effort, we have made it back. All over the republic, brave men and women have fought for the rights and freedoms we all hold dear. We have fought, and we have overcome. The enemy has been defeated, and moderate forces are now firmly back in control. We have won."

 KOM_unstable_victory_a_victory_for_democracy_desc: "After counting every vote, it turns out that the democrats have received a plurality of the vote!\n\nEven more surprising to Komi's citizens, it seems that the moderates have decided to go at it alone. Without a clear majority of the delegates, the resulting government is destined to be an extremely weak one. Yet the parties of the center left to center right have decided to gamble that neither the far left nor the far right will dare to cause a vote of no-confidence so soon after elections. Perhaps the far left and far right militias will give the government at least a month to live?"
 KOM_unstable_victory_secure_the_republic_desc: "Barring some unfortunate extralegal violence by paramilitaries, the biggest threat to the new coalition government is a simple vote of no-confidence by fascist or communist deputies. The new government's first order of business is thus to spend every scrap of influence and diplomacy to gather enough confidence and supply agreements to stay afloat for the year. By guaranteeing that the government will not fall while trying to pass a budget, the moderate coalition hopes to gain some time."
 KOM_unstable_victory_a_standing_coalition_desc: "Even with the vaguest assurances that the government is free from outside pressure, internal pressure within the coalition also need to be kept in check. When living life on the thinnest of political edges, a single deputy defecting could have disastrous consequences on the government. And so, a generous amount of ministries and positions have to be doled to every coalition partner, with the biggest political party keeping a few choice offices for themselves."
 KOM_unstable_victory_the_defense_plan_desc: "The democratic coalition would not trust the fascist and communist with a bucket of warm piss, let alone believe their empty platitudes about respecting the minority government for at least a year. As such, extra precautions are being taken to make sure every single member of the government is free from extreme ideology. Equally important is being absolutely certain that no one in the coalition can be blackmailed, lest the ensuing consequences be disastrous."
 KOM_unstable_victory_stalinas_speech_desc: "Among the moderate coalition's few blessing is the backing of Svetlana Stalina. The charismatic woman is popular both within the democratic factions and without, throughout Komi's electorate. By having her go on a public offensive against the communist and fascists, some very needed breathing room could be created for the democratic faction. Stalina is already well known for disliking the ideologues and fanatics that impede Komi's progress. Yet, some within the government worry about rumors of the young woman's ambition. Many worry that her honeyed words might in the end poison the young republic. In the short term, however, the coalition must play all of its cards."
 KOM_unstable_victory_direct_action_desc: "Left unsaid in the communist and fascists' pledges not to overthrow the government democratically is the danger posed by their paramilitaries. What's a little coup, between friends?\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, a small cabal of coalition officials have begun to cook up some extra-legal defense of the republic. The communists and fascists fear one another more than they fear the weak minority government. Their surprise at seeing the benchwarmers lash out might be just what the coalition needs to survive."
 KOM_unstable_victory_acquire_the_information_desc: "As the fascist and communist plot each other's destruction, the coalition government's secret security committee has begun to ramp up its intelligence work. Suslov and Gumilyov are slippery eels, yet many of their subordinates fail to live up to their bosses secrecy. By bribing small time agents of both sides, a sizable pot of information can be built up on both factions. Speed is of the essence, as is a simultaneous strike at both sides."
 KOM_unstable_victory_surround_the_neighborhoods_desc: "To a casual observer, it might seem that Komi's republican army is completely compromised; its officer corp riddled with Suslov plants, and many of its best regiments crewed by mercenaries of suspect loyalties. Yet legally speaking, the army's chain of command leads to the civilian government at all times.\n\nNow that the government has intel, army units have been arranged in crucial neighborhoods around the city. By moving rapidly, it's likely that neither side will have the time to use their army contacts before it's too late."
 KOM_unstable_victory_nip_it_in_the_bud_desc: "The tell tale sounds of guns and artillery slamming around various points in Komi has kept most of the city's inhabitants hiding indoors. Occasionally, some daredevil wanders out to look for information.\n\nThe shocked communists and fascists have been woken in the middle of the night by army troops. Both sets of paramilitaries are putting up a violent fight, their cause aided by turncoats within the army. No one knows if the government's gambit is likely to succeed or fail."
 KOM_unstable_victory_komi_is_strong_and_stable_desc: "Throngs of suspected fascist or communist sympathizers are being marched to various secure prisons around the city. Shock and dismay cloud the eyes of the defeated paramilitaries, woken in the middle of the night by the toothless coalition government and its soldiers.\n\nThe minority government has somehow succeeded in its mission to crush the far right and far left! Some might worry that the city's democracy will forever be stained by the violent crackdown. These men and women simply fail to see that for the first time since its foundation, Komi's republic is now strong and stable! No longer shall violence intimidate politicians of the nation!"

 KOM_KPK_election_revolution_by_ballot_desc: "After the most contentious election process in Komi's history, our party stands victorious. The Communist Party candidate [KOM.GetLeader] has seized the presidency and thus reins of power. This is the vital first step in a socialist revolution that will seek to respect the rule of democracy, at least for now.\n\nAs the Communist Party attempts to empower labor and root out "reaction" in the Republic, we will have to grapple with the fact that our opponents consider us illegitimate and dangerously extremist. Some have reportedly even refused to attend sessions of the legislature. Nevertheless, our mandate is impossible to ignore; the other parties will have to learn to respect the Communist Party's wishes, whether through the easy way or the hard way."
 KOM_KPK_election_escalate_the_process_desc: "The Communist Party's quest for a socialist revolution through traditional legislative means is fraught with danger from a variety of enemies. Members of parties of the democratic center still entirely refuse to cooperate with us, and the reactionary right is naturally extremely hostile to our project. In the security apparatus, there is always the risk of military elements hostile to the revolution undermining us through force. It is for these reasons that we must hasten our transition to socialism.\n\nThe Party and its supporters need to be on a war footing. What this means in practice is a vigorous campaign against the enemies of the people, both through a propaganda offensive and through investigation of potential foes within the state. Our enemies are myriad and ferocious; if we are not on guard, we could easily be swept up in a merciless tide of reaction."
 KOM_KPK_election_collaboration_with_labour_desc: "The goal of the KPK has always been to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat in accordance with Leninist principles, and under the current circumstances this requires working with the trade unions. Unions are, of course, a temporary measure in the grand scheme of things, but for the moment they are the primary instrument of the will of the proletariat, and as such must be considered when drafting policy.\n\nWe shall begin drafting laws to delegate powers to the various trade unions, including and especially a policy of greater self-management, though the extent of this remains to be determined within the Party. By working with the unions, we will soon be able to demonstrate to the people that the bourgeois liberalism of the Republic must be abandoned if they wish to enjoy a better life."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_changing_of_the_guard_desc: "The upper echelons of any standing army are almost always in the service of reaction, as 1917 taught us. As such, we have always anticipated needing to move against the Army General Staff, but the revelation of Case October and its possible mobilization by the Republican Army has forced us to consider dealing with them sooner rather than later.\n\nDefense Minister Chelomei has been tasked with ensuring the stability of the Revolution against reactionary officers, and so far seems to have done well in this task. The chief conspirators have been isolated by firing or "neutralizing" key mid-ranking officers, and now all that remains is to remove these men from service. We will tolerate no counterrevolution from our army ever again."
 KOM_KPK_election_cast_down_the_passionarists_desc: "There remains one major threat left to deal with; the Passionariyy Organization. That collection of esoterics and crypto-fascists was left to fester by the liberals, and so, as ever, it falls to socialists to bring an end to the reactionary menace. Only we have ever had the courage, the will, and the ideological motivation to see these lunatics driven out of power, and now we have the means to do so.\n\nIf we are to save Russia, then we must remove the Passionariyy at once, by any means necessary. With our current power, we have numerous methods at our disposal; we could always ask the liberals to cooperate in removing what is clearly the larger threat, in the hope that they will see reason, or we could turn to more forceful means. One way or another, Gumilyov and his coterie are a den of vipers, and we must destroy them!"
 KOM_KPK_election_alliance_of_convenience_desc: "The left and center have an enormous number of differences on a variety of topics. We see them as complicit in the capitalist system; they see us as enemies of democracy. There is one point on which liberals and communists can always agree, however: keeping the far right from taking power is a top priority.\n\nOur makeshift anti-fascist coalition will mostly involve deputies of the DSNP, as the other parties of the center refuse to work with us under any circumstances. If we act quickly, we can cooperate to completely shut out the Passionariyy before they stand a chance of usurping the Republic."
 KOM_KPK_election_revolution_is_not_civilized_desc: "The time for restraint is over. The Passionariyy, with their extreme ideology and terroristic assaults on politicians of other parties, have proven themselves entirely incompatible with the values of the Republic or its people. For every day it exists as an independent political faction, Komi becomes less safe. The forces of reaction cannot be allowed to endanger us any longer; with our legislative majority, we have the power we need to stymie them forever.\n\nThe Communist Party and what remaining anti-fascist allies it has among the parties of the center will vote to declare the Passionariyy unconstitutional for Nazi sympathy and conspiracy against the Republic. The battle against the far-right will be far from over, but its power underground will be but a shadow of what it had before."
 KOM_KPK_election_the_popular_apportionment_act_desc: "The way we can best secure a transition from bourgeois capitalist democracy to the dictatorship of the proletariat is through a piece of legislation known as the Popular Apportionment Act, a bill that redraws the prior election districts. As these districts are designed to allow for participation in bourgeois democracy, they need to be redrawn in such a way that grants the KPK additional seats to ensure the Party is always able to maintain a plurality in the Assembly. In addition, it allows the President to dissolve the Assembly in order to allow additional time to prepare for upcoming elections.\n\nOur opponents may decry this as undemocratic, but true democracy can only occur once the bourgeoisie has been suppressed and power given to the workers, through the vanguard; we shouldn't expect them to understand. And if the Assembly refuses to pass the bill, then President [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] can use his emergency powers to implement it. One way or another, the death knell of Voznesensky's liberal perversion rings loud and clear."

 KOM_demexpansion_the_republic_saved_desc: "Rejoice, citizen, for the republic has been saved!\n\nIt has taken our government everything to prevent our young nation's fall into extremism. But now that the dust has begun settling, our political system has been repaired and we stand united to face against the wider world. Soldiers and leaders that had once only been concerned with surviving just another week are now free to turn toward the rest of Russia. With the end of the Anarchy, many factions will no doubt attempt to impose their control on the lands of the former Soviet Union. Our Republic must stand ready to expand outward in order to crush extremists and find new allies for our fledgling nation.\n\nWe have crushed the fascist and communists in Komi, and this experience shall serve us well!"
 KOM_demexpansion_assemble_the_armories_desc: "With the end of political violence, many armories and weapon caches that were under the control of extremists elements are now open to access. It will take some time to count everything, but already the available rifles and support equipment can be pressed into service to help equip the Republican Army further.\n\nSecuring as many weapons as possible will also help us douse the embers of political extremism. The days of private militias holding onto weapon stockpiles are finally coming to an end. From now on, the government shall decide who has access to military hardware, and that's that."
 KOM_demexpansion_infrastructure_programs_desc: "Now that a map of Syktyvkar no longer resemble a chess board of districts held by a protean mass of paramilitaries of varying allegiance, we are free to roll out unified infrastructure plans. Places where the government has not dared send officials in ages can finally be assessed, improved and perhaps even taxed.\n\nThe least controversial move will first be to improve the infrastructure in and around Syktyvkar. Crumbling roads and buildings do not inspire much hope that the government is looking after the common man. Nor are they much help to an economy attempting to climb out of years of stagnation."
 KOM_demexpansion_the_army_of_the_republic_desc: "Komi has always had, on paper at least, a strong army. Since its inception the republic has remained free from foreign encroachment by the quantity of soldiers in the field.\n\nThis has not always been evident to the man in Syktyvkar's streets. Riddled with corruption and factionalism, with entire units either underpaid or overpaid to ensure political reliability, the army of the republic has always been perceived as a right mess. A significant fraction of its total strength is composed of militias and men outside the regular command structure, fighting only in dire emergencies. Now that the Republic desires to expand outward, a more regular state of affairs is needed. Two proposals have been thought up on the army reforms, and it's important to decide rapidly on which one the republic prefers."
 KOM_demexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc: "The first faction proposes scrapping every militia and integrating their men into the regular army. This will be a daunting undertaking, stretching our current army structure to the breaking point. Countless militiamen will have to be screened for political extremism, and those that don't make the cut will no doubt be angry at losing their job and weapons.\n\nCompleting the reform will take time and effort. But as the WRRF has demonstrated in the fifties, a regular army can achieve miracles when properly organized. The republic must end the militias if it is to be safe internally and externally."
 KOM_demexpansion_elevate_gifted_officers_desc: "Dozens of smart and dedicated men have joined our army from their former militias. In Komi's hyper competitive period of political instability, one did not rise to the top without a good head on their shoulder.\n\nThe integration of these men has done much to soothe the concern of former militiamen about more purges and arrests of the militias. It has also brought us a treasure of institutional experience. Veterans that have fought in the West Russian War, or helped defend Komi as auxiliary militias are now pouring into our army and helping redefine its doctrines for the better."
 KOM_demexpansion_keep_the_militia_structure_desc: "The other approach to reforming our army is to preserve the militia structure. Having armed men outside of the army is a concern for many reasons: some worry about disloyalty from the militias, others point to the dangers of a non-standardized fighting force, or of amateur soldiers breaking at the first sign of danger.\n\nTo others, the militias are a perfectly valid part of Komi's arsenal. They provide large amount of volunteers to defend the rear of the Republican Army; they provide an easy way to train up new soldiers that might one day join the regular army; they show that our reformed government bears no ill will toward its past enemies as all of Komi turns toward the future. Preserving the militias can thus be an essential part of the republic's security policy."
 KOM_demexpansion_popular_mobilization_desc: "Our decision to preserve the militia has made us a lot of friends. Militia commanders of all stripes have decided to repay our trust with a call to mass mobilization. Areas of the city long held by the militias with inhabitants that disdained the republic's officials are now beginning to offer their help. A tide of new recruits to the militias and army has begun cropping up. All that is now needed is to train and equip the brave patriots willing to fight for their country!"
 KOM_demexpansion_mission_to_vologda_desc: "To the west, general Ivanov maintains a careful position of armed neutrality in Vologda. In the aftermath of the Front's collapse, the good general decided that spilling the blood of Russian civilians for ideological squabbles was simply not worth it. Vologda has kept up cordial, if bemused relations with Komi's unstable republic. The western junta has long appreciated Komi's policy of welcoming all, while disliking the resulting political violence.\n\nWith a newly minted democratic government standing proud, it might be time to revisit the relationship. Komi and Vologda both face external threats from the Front and from southern regimes. A diplomatic mission has thus been sent to Vologda to offer a treaty of peace and friendship between both nations."
 KOM_demexpansion_an_alliance_for_peace_desc: "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, our President is scheduled to meet with Vologda's representatives to sign a treaty of peace and friendship. Soldiers and citizens of both side cheered the news that their leadership plans to sign one of the first peaceful reunification of the Russian nation.\n\nMuch remain to be done, beyond this ceremony. The depth of the military alliance, as well as its implication on economical and political matters remain to be seen. But throughout both nations, there is nigh universal agreement that mutual friendship and assistance is the best way forward."
 KOM_demexpansion_establish_economic_ties_desc: "As Vologda and Komi get closer, their respectives economy continue rising from the decade of bombing and warlordism. Trade links that had already been significant during the Anarchy are being strengthened by the day. In this light, it is essential for official trade policies to be established between the two allies.\n\nStrategic industries from both side will be integrated, helping both Komi and Vologda to increase their military readiness. Joint investment schemes have also been discussed to help lift up the civilian economy of both nations."
 KOM_demexpansion_freedom_of_movement_desc: "The frontier between warlords in Russia is often more of a theoretical concept, consisting of a long range of military checkpoints and demilitarized zones plagued by bandits or lawlessness. While in theory there had been no law prohibiting movement between Vologda and Komi, in practice doing so required several levels of military approvals for private citizens. Traders have long been used to carrying their stack of documents at military checkpoints.\n\nA new treaty is in the work, providing legal rights to Vologda and Komi's citizens to cross the border unimpeded. This will no doubt help friendship and partnership blossom among our nations."
 KOM_demexpansion_mutual_defense_desc: "While Vologda might not be totally ready to join any of our future wars of liberation, their generals have agreed to strong mutual defense treaties. In the event of an attack on one side, the other is expected to declare war on the invaders. This defensive alliance will free up much needed resources for Komi's Republican army. Contingency plans for defensive wars will no longer use the hypothesis that the Komi-Vologda frontier requires constant military defense. Likewise, the Vologdan army will be free to tend to its own business, confident in the safety of its eastern flank."
 KOM_demexpansion_the_republic_alone_desc: "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, the republic's reformed army will be deployed in a pre-planned military exercise. The Vologdan high command has been dutifully noted of this; rumors on the street in both capital is that while cordial relations will continue, Komi's government has little interest in demilitarizing the border between both nations after receiving Vologda's refusal of an alliance.\n\nWhile disappointed, analysts inside of Komi's government are not too shaken about Vologda's refusal. It is likely that the Vologdan generals would have refused to help Komi in its offensive wars of liberation in Western Russia. In the end, the republic would have always had to fight alone for the freedom and safety of all Russians."
 KOM_demexpansion_enemies_on_all_sides_desc: "The unfortunate refusal by Vologda of friendship means that the republic, as always, is surrounded by enemies on all sides. Military planners have thus begun preparing supply and communication lines in the event of any invasion by hostile powers. Plans that had been drafted in the event of Vologdan friendship are scrapped, replaced by scenarios where a hostile western army attacks the republic while it is busy elsewhere.\n\nThe republic stands vigilant, and sleeps with one eye open."
 KOM_demexpansion_expand_emergency_conscription_desc: "Going at it alone will require ever more troops in the army. A new call for expanded emergency conscription is being prepared. Our government will explain to every citizen the reason for our renewed conscription policy, and the importance of manning every frontier of the republic. New recruits will be able to free up experienced men for frontier duty, and eventually these veterans will lead the spearhead of our reclamation wars."
 KOM_demexpansion_watch_and_wait_desc: "Our frontiers have never been better defended. As troops settle into their new assignments, officers on the border have been given secret tasks. The best and brightest men of each formation are to run reconnaissance patrols in the demilitarized border zones between us and our rivals. The men are to probe enemy fortifications, observe enemy patrol frequency and destinations, and do their best to assess weak points in enemy lines. This information will be crucial once we go on the offensive."
 KOM_demexpansion_between_three_foes_desc: ""Citizens! My friends, our Republic is in grave danger. To the north lie the remnants of the Soviet Union, haunted by its failures and angry at our independence. Even as we speak, the northern Red Army plots our undoing!\n\nTo the south and east, things are not any better. Deluded tsarist remnants wish to turn back the clock and reimpose the shackles of autocracy on our free citizens. In this project they resemble our eastern neighbors. In Gayny, a theocracy blames Russia's woes not on the evil of German fascism, but on the anger of an unforgiving God. These madmen believe that only by subjugating Russia to the church's whim will the people be saved.\n\nThe Republic rejects this madness! It is not a cabal of communist or tsarist military officers that can free Russia. Nor can its salvation come from subservience to crazed monks. The only power strong enough to free Russia is its citizens. We must be on our guards!"\n Extract from President [KOM.GetLeader]'s speech to the Republic."
 KOM_demexpansion_defense_stratagems_desc: "The work that began during the early reforms of the Republican Army is now complete. The army's commanders have presented to the civilian authorities several military plans as well as new doctrinal recommendations. The doctrinal ideas will help us modernize our army and train a new generation of soldiers and officers. The military plans provide a wide range of military campaigns against neighboring threats to the republic's safety.\n\nIt is likely that the civilian leadership will bring a few recommendations of its own. Nevertheless, both generals and politicians are confident in the republic's capacity to destroy its closest foes."
 KOM_demexpansion_against_the_communists_desc: "To the north, the Western Russian Revolutionary Front. The largest remnant of the Soviet government, the Front fought valiantly in the fifties and almost managed to break the Wehrmacht's spine. When the tide turned, Syktyvkar was to be the Front's fallback capital. Their evacuation pushed further north by the Luftwaffe, the remnants of the Red Army have spent a decade licking their wounds and plotting a comeback.\n\nThe communist's intention against Komi are crystal clear. Arkhangelsk sees us as as nothing more than illegitimate separatist rebels. Our recent suppression of the far left has not improved our reputation with them. Already the Red Army plants its invasion of the south. If our republic is to survive, we must prepare to take the war to them. This will be a titanic struggle, for most of the professional soldiers and industry in western Russia are in the Front's hands. We must prepare!"
 KOM_demexpansion_fortress_syktyvkar_desc: "Syktyvkar is our greatest city, and one of our greatest assets. We cannot afford to lose its population and industries to the communists, or anyone else.\n\nThe Vychegda river's bank have been chosen as the ultimate defensive position, with forward positions on the far side of the river to delay any attack from the north east. Each crossing has been turned into a miniature, self sufficient fortress. The city's districts themselves are also being fortified, with many civilians having a sentiment of deja-vu as their hometown is once more prepared for violent conflict. Each military command and government office in the city has been given several fall back positions, to ensure continuity of government in the events that parts of the city are overrun. In the suburbs, industrial positions have been fortified, with factory workers and nearby inhabitants trained as emergency firefighters.\n\nSyktyvkar shall be one great fortress, a bulwark against tyranny no matter its source!"
 KOM_demexpansion_establish_the_vychegda_line_desc: "The Vychegda river snake along most of our border with the Front. Any direct assault on Syvtykar is likely to require forces on the southern shore of the river, especially if the Red Army attempts to use its tank corps to surround the city. Using the river as a first line of defense is thus a logical step in our preparations for conflict.\n\nA line of machine gun positions and barbed wire on our side of the river will inflict tremendous casualties on any attacking force. Further inland, bunkers and forts will hold mobile troops and artillery able to be redeployed to push any beachhead back into the water. The river will run red with our enemy's blood!"
 KOM_demexpansion_secondary_redoubt_preparation_desc: "A defensive line is only worth as much time as it buys for its defenders. Once breached, a series of fortifications can easily be surrounded, trapping its garrison. It is thus important to build reinforced fall back position further south where our men can continue to fight in the event of a breach of the Vychegda line. The Front's commanders will thus have to decide between overrunning every defensive line, or attempt to capture Syktyvkar with exposed flank. Thus, our secondary positions serve crucial roles in defensive as well as in counter-offensive plans."
 KOM_demexpansion_finalize_plan_red_desc: "Our northern frontier is now heavily defended against any Communist violence. Any Red Army aggression will cost it dearly in terms of manpower and materiel. Once the invaders have been repelled, our commanders will be free to follow the broken formations north and attempt our own crossing of the Vychegda river.\n\nWar with the front will be far from easy. But our position is secure. The Front must either defeat us, Vologda or Gayny if they are to expand in western Russia. The communists are bound to run out of patience and make a tactical mistake in their hope of breaking out of the arctic. We've only got to wait long enough to exploit their desperation. And this combination of preparation and strategic patience forms the core of War Plan Red."
 KOM_demexpansion_against_the_monarchists_desc: "To the south, monarchists have recreated a miniature Russian Empire in Vyatka. Perhaps it was this later-day white army's intention to cloak itself in history. What better, after all, than a new Romanov tsar to end these modern time of troubles? This historical allusion has not provided much humor to Komi's military thinkers as the monarchist have raised a large army of rabble to this end. The monarchists do not field an army as potent as the Front. But their troops are on the march, and an invasion of Komi is inevitable.\n\nThe Republican Army's generals have thus been preparing both defensive and offensive plans against Vyatka. If the monarchists attack, our soldiers would be more than ready to repel them. If we judge it is time to end their monarchist nonsense, our men will be equally prepared to launch an invasion of the south. The white army's day are numbered."
 KOM_demexpansion_fortress_vilegodsk_desc: "Our border with the monarchists follow the Vyatka river. While smaller than the Vychedga river to the north, the Vyatka rivers offers a natural barrier against the whites. The largest city on the river's north bank is Slobodskoy, in south western Komi. From its origin as a small village, the area has seen a population boom as refugees have settled into the young republic and a large military garrison has been established on the southern border. Now the garrison town is being fortified. Slobodskoy will be an important staging point for an invasion of the monarchists, or for any defensive operation along the river's bank. As such, it's a primary necessity to see the city protected from all sides."
 KOM_demexpansion_staff_the_tundra_desc: "Winter Operations are an essential part of the toolkit of any Russian commander worth his salt. Right now our men usually winter inside garrison town, with less than a third of our men used to cold weather deployments in rough outposts. Our new deployment scheme will seek to remedy this by giving every rank of soldier training in the outdoors. Once the soldiers are used to operating in winter as in summer, they will possess the capacity to fight whatever the season."
 KOM_demexpansion_hidden_positions_desc: "The monarchists will no doubt attempt to cross the Vyatka river and gain a foothold in southern Komi before attempting to march onto our capital. In the events of such a breach of our southern defensive line, possessing hidden cards to play would be to the republic's advantage.\n\nWork has thus been planned for a line of secondary hidden fortification. This network of camouflaged bunker will shelter our troops if they feel the need to fall back to the interior. They will also let us strike at the flank of any army marching on Syktyvkar."
 KOM_demexpansion_finalize_plan_white_desc: "While much of our preparation for Plan White has been defensive in nature, our commanders have still given much thought to the best way to crack the monarchist's defensive lines.\n\nThe monarchists have lost no time industrializing, and the Izhevsk arms factory to the south has equipped their conscripts with good weapons. The most obvious path to victory would be the capture of Kudymkar and its surroundings, the one stretch of the border not covered by rivers. The enemy is likely to know this, and defend the area vigorously. The alternatives are costly attempts at crossing the fortified rivers. Once in enemy territory, sieging the enemy capital of Vyatka to separate its defenders from southern industry would likely be a great tactical victory. Secondary target include Izhevsk and Krasnokamsk. Our men must be ready to pay the price for ultimate victory over the monarchist threat!"
 KOM_demexpansion_the_gayny_contingency_desc: "To our east, mad monks have subjugated the Gayny region. Claiming that Russia has been abandoned by the almighty for its sins and decadence, this cabal of maddened mystics has whipped up a mob of peasants into a frenzy. It is very likely that our so-called "godless republic" is next on the monk's chopping block. We must thus prepare contingency plans for a conflict with them.\n\nMilitary authorities have begun reinforcing the eastern regions while our republic's priests and politicians have made joint speeches denouncing Gayny as a mere doomsday cult.\n\nNo matter their goals, these mad monks shall not be given a chance to sabotage our efforts."
 KOM_demexpansion_preempetive_intervention_desc: "The president is expected to make a speech to the Republic's parliament informing them that a state of war now exists between Komi and Gayny's theocratic government.\n\nKomi's high command agrees that with the constant threat of invasion by the Front in the north and by monarchists in the south, the continued risk of a Gayny invasion cannot be tolerated. To face a two or three front war at a critical moment would certainly doom the republic.\n\nInvading the theocracy will be no cakewalk, as fanatical soldiers will follow their religious leaders into battle. The Republican Army must prevail, and rapidly, lest it gets bogged down in a war it cannot afford."
 KOM_demexpansion_extend_the_vychegda_line_desc: "The long Vychegda river is already at the core of preparations made against the Western Russia Revolutionary Front, or Plan Red. The waterway also snakes its way along the Komi-Gayny frontier. Fortifying it would be a cheap way to deter aggression from the angry theocracy. Were the worst to happen and the monks to attack us while we are busy elsewhere, the lengthened Vychedga line would make it easy for small deployments of border troops to repel the attackers until reinforcements are available for a counter-attack. Thus, the generals have approved additional fortification of the area."
 KOM_demexpansion_finalize_plan_black_desc: "It is always a troubling sight for our eastern troops to see their opposite number dig trenches and prepare staging grounds across the Vychegda rivers. The monk and their warriors are no raging peasant mob, but a well organized militia that is preparing for a conventional conflict crossed with a holy crusade.\n\nBut no amount of preparation can make an under-industrialized army break a reinforced trench line, as the first world war shows. Our men in the east are ready for any eventuality. And when the time comes, their commander hold attack orders for the moment when the Republican Army marches east to restore order."
 KOM_demexpansion_the_vologda_contingency_desc: "No matter how our government feels about Vologda, the facts remain that our leaders are prepared for any eventuality. The Vologdan government could collapse, or turn hostile, or fall to invasion. As a result it is good to have some contingency planning for a western war. The usual invasion plans have been drawn up by our commanders, as have a set of recommendations for improved border defences.\n\nNo matter how the Vologdan government feels about us, it will understand our reasoning. In fact, it wouldn't surprise us if they did the very same thing."
 KOM_demexpansion_the_western_line_desc: "Particularly important to our defensive problem with Vologda is that our nation share a long border uninterrupted by rivers or wetlands. It will thus be costly but important to see a long line of bunkers, trenches, fortified positions and garrisons created. In the event of fighting in our western lands, these new fortifications, combined with existing or upcoming military outposts designed for plans Red and White will serve as a bulwark for our wester soldiers."
 KOM_demexpansion_expand_border_patrols_desc: "Soldiers that know a battlefield well can often win surprising victories through deception and quick thinking. The troops on the western frontier have seen their border patrol efforts expanded. Many of our men that had spent their life in Syktyvkar are discovering the countryside in and around the Vologdan border. While a few grumble at the effort, most seem happy at the opportunity to trade barracks life for extended camping trip around the wester territories."
 KOM_demexpansion_finalize_plan_blue_desc: "Our military is now as well equipped for conflict with a "western enemy" as it can reasonably be. It is difficult to gain further military intel without offending the Vologdan government with our espionnage. Nor can we dump an infinite amount of resources into secondary threats.\n\nThe republic's leaders truly do not seek conflict in the west, and the presence of Vologda is reassuring. But in the Russian anarchy, only fools do not sleep with one eye open. As such we must add the final few touches to Plan Blue."
 KOM_demexpansion_fill_the_gaps_desc: "Every eventuality has been planned. Every threat has been assessed. The republic, surrounded by enemies, has turned every settlement into a castle to protect the flame of freedom and democracy. Now its citizens must become warriors to fill the gaps in our defenses, lest the enemy storm through.\n\nA final call to arm has been issued. Less fit men can serve in the interior. Farmers can join regional auxiliary militia to support the Republican Army. If our nation is to survive this darkest hour, we must stand and fight! To arms, citizens!"
 KOM_demexpansion_our_threats_vanquished_desc: "The republic lives! Surrounded by some of the most dangerous factions of the Russian Anarchy, Komi has managed to come out on top of the melee. The land under our control has quintupled, bringing millions of citizens into our nation. Veteran soldiers now stand guard in Arkhangelsk, Vyatka and beyond as Syktyvkar's citizens cheer uproariously in the streets.\n\nThis string of conquest will take some time to adjust to. For now, giving our citizens a breather from total mobilization will help the victory celebrations. We've got much to be proud of!"
 KOM_demexpansion_down_from_the_barricades_desc: "It is good to end total mobilization, for a nation that only busies itself with war robs its children of their future.\n\nWhile much of our recent conquests are still under strict martial law, the core territory of the republic is returning to some sense of normalcy. Streets that had been blocked by the military are now returning to regular circulation. Kids can be seen playing outside while their parents are celebrating the easing up of the rationing system by buying more food. Our citizen's period of rest continues."
 KOM_demexpansion_onto_the_offense_desc: "One who expects war would do well to mobilize first, so that they can choose the battle at their leisure.\n\nKomi's best officers have determined the best scenarios to tackle the north, the south and the east. Wherever our enemy lie, we must strike, for the republic is surrounded by enemies, and shall not see the light again without taking arms.\n\nPlan Red; Plan White; Plan Black; all three shall forever be marked in Russia's glorious rebirth!"
 KOM_demexpansion_execute_plan_red_desc: "The communists have long sown the seeds of conflict with our nation, and for this they shall reap the tempest. The Front has squandered its opportunity to save Russia from the fascists. In its arrogance, Arkhangelsk has not sought peaceful reunification with us, but sent instead thugs and radicals to undermine our democracy. We've expelled the communist threat from our Republic, and now the Republican Army shall eradicate the red menace from western Russia."
 KOM_demexpansion_execute_plan_white_desc: "It is perhaps to the Tsar's credit that he has come back to Russia, rather than live a comfortable soft life in exile. But the fall of the Soviet Union has seen the rise of a new generation of Russians, men and women who do not idolize a fabled past of Russian autocracy. The Tsar and his cronies wish not for citizens, but for slaves and subjects, abject in their subservience. The Republican Army will instead show him the strength of the Russian nation, for these difficult times have forged a new generation of standard bearers for democracy and decency."
 KOM_demexpansion_execute_plan_black_desc: "The monks of Gayny see an angry God in the hardship that have fallen on Russia. They seek to atone for the nation's failings by uniting it in fearful repentance.\n\nWe have a different idea of Russia's plight, one manufactured by evil men and facilitated by the baseness of the human heart. If God has a side then it is definitely ours, the side of compassion and mercy, of hope and courage. To our east, theocrats speak of end times and of the displeasure of the eternal. Our soldiers will prove on the battlefield that by losing faith in the Russian people, Gayny's fanatics have committed blasphemy of the highest order."
 KOM_demexpansion_room_to_breathe_desc: "Our enemies all lie defeated. Their former people mill around. Some feel relief at their liberation. Others struggle to make sense of the defeat of Tsar, communism or fanaticism.\n\nOur soldiers' sacrifice has earned us room to breathe. Beyond our border lurk more dangers; ambitious tyrants dream of subjugating all of western Russia to their whims. For now, however, we have some time to consolidate. Our enemies held great amount of industrial equipment, war supplies and population. Already the republic has gone from one of the weakest factions to one of the powerhouses of western Russia. If the soldiers have been allowed some rest, our poor bureaucrats are working triple overtime to somehow integrate mountains of resources into a system not designed for population and territory of that magnitude. As their work progresses, our integration of these new assets will give us a significant edge in the upcoming wars."
 KOM_demexpansion_negotiate_with_vologda_desc: "It is time to revisit our relationship with our western neighbor. Our first visit to Vologda at the dawn of the unification wars was mainly concerned with military matters, for our young republic was surrounded on three sides with dangerous regimes.\n\nNow that Komi stands tall, we must ask Vologda's government about deeper integration. The men of Vologda are famous for their opposition to wars of aggression against fellow Russian citizens, and now we ask them for help in our grim unification of western Russia. No matter how they felt about us before, the fusion of our two nations is a difficult decision for Vologda's leadership. But Russia long divided must unite again. We can only hope that our neighbors understand this."
 KOM_demexpansion_merge_the_institutions_desc: "Today is a glorious day, for Vologda has agreed to peaceful fusion with our nation!\n\nSoldiers that used to belong to the two nations have crossed the border not in conflict, but in celebration as politicians and commanders meet to discuss how best to merge both set of institutions. Battles will be fought not between brothers, but between conflicting bureaucratic standards as torrents of inks are spilled instead of blood. Paper pushers of both nations have sparred verbally, while inwardly cheering at the peaceful nature of this conflict. And outside, people celebrate the good news of the new republic."
 KOM_demexpansion_execute_plan_blue_desc: "It is with heavy heart that the officers have received their orders. Plan Blue is to be activated: the invasion and occupation of Vologda.\n\nMorale is projected to be an issue, of course. Republican soldiers are not liberating citizens from despotic regimes, but putting the torch to an independent nation. Propaganda depicting Vologda as a tyrannical regime will likely ring hollow to our men... Yet, military analysts predict the campaign's success. Recruits from beyond Komi's old territory have little reason for friendship with Vologda. Amongst our veterans, dissent or requests for transfer have been few in number. Perhaps the horror of the Russian Anarchy has inured our men to senseless battles."
 KOM_demexpansion_pacify_the_territory_desc: "Breaking an army is for nought if the population it defended has not seen its own will broken. Vologda's population is outraged at our invasion, and armed resistance continues across much of the territory.\n\nSome carrots will be offered. Much stick will be given. Already a village has been torched after the company of former soldiers they held tried to fight off our men. The village's former citizens have had their day in court, and for their crimes, their lives were forfeit.\n\nLife as a citizen of the republic is better than death at the end of a pointless insurgency campaign. In time the former Vologdans will understand this. They must understand this. They must."
 KOM_demexpansion_unto_unity_desc: "Plan Red, White and Black were about sheer survival. Now, our Republic turns its eyes to the south and seeks not only to survive, but to thrive. Projecting military power to quash dangerous warlords will greatly enrich our legitimacy, prestige and resources on top of keeping us safer.\n\nOur generals' plans are not as detailed this time around, mostly based on the psychological profile of our enemies and theoretical conflicts using pre-anarchy maps of Russia. As such, much of our newly acquired resources will be used to deal with whatever warlord has lasted long enough to become one of our neighbors."
 KOM_demexpansion_plan_silver_desc: "A strange sense of deja-vu comes to mind as our army mobilizes against Berezniki. Claiming not only to be the true communist government, but also to represent the exalted Tsar's true subjects, Kazembek's strange followers disdain our republic. They seek to mend the rift between socialists and monarchists by restoring the tsar as supreme protector of a collection of soviets.\n\nTheir ideology matters less than the army they field against us. This strange red and white army is motivated, organized in a modern fashion, and unafraid of the Republican Army. We cannot afford to let them scheme against us, lest remnants from the Front or Vyatka use them as useful idiots."
 KOM_demexpansion_plan_grey_desc: "Everyone in Syktyvkar heard the rumors, yet the confirmation of the so-called Aryan Brotherhood's existence came to us as a shock. Many psychologists have studied the spread of mental illness caused by the hardships of the Russian Anarchy. None have come up with any logical explanation for this Russian cult of the men who brought our lands to ruin.\n\nIts grotesque ideology put aside for the moment, reports tell of us of another highly motivated army, assisted with militias of less reliable troops. This ersatz Wehrmacht wishes to impose "order" on every slavic "degenerate" they encountered. For all their endless drilling and training, this awful army of soldier cannot be allowed to survive."
 KOM_demexpansion_plan_green_desc: "The Russian Anarchy has been a bountiful period of time for thieves and scoundrels. There is something to be said for the grandeur of Nikolai Averin's vision: an army of tanks, used for plunder and chaos. It is also admirable that the man's acolytes have mostly reserved their greed toward Moskowien to the west. The time of bandit is drawing to an end, and there is no way to make the men of Gorky see reason. Equipped with tanks and planes, our opponents believe they can dictate us terms, and deny us access to their military factories.\n\nWar with Gorky will take a different characters. Our opponents are mostly Red Army veterans, and are armored to the gills. Anti tank efforts will be crucial, as will good communications. The reward of victory will be Gorky's impressive tank factories, a prize well worth fighting for."
 KOM_demexpansion_plan_violet_desc: "The Tatars saw the fall of the WRRF as an opportunity for independence. Rendered paranoid by the successive erosion of their rights under the tsarist and then communist governments, Tatars leaders have infected their citizens with distrust for the outside world. Negotiation with them is futile, and the only thing able to break their independence streak is the force of arms.\n\nThe Tatars are likely to fight tooth and nail our attempt to reimpose order. Our soldiers will have to carefully show the Tatar population that we fight not the Tatars themselves, but their arrogant government. Limiting civilian casualties will be extremely important."
 KOM_demexpansion_negotiate_with_tatarstan_desc: "It is true that the Tatars have reasons to distrust Russian interlocutors. Moscow and St-Petersburg have long ignored Tatar issues, content as they were to consign the Turkic people to the wastebasket of history.\n\nOur government is made from better stuff than the Tsar's autocratic or the Soviet dictatorship. Ethnic minorities can thrive in our young nation, and if given the chance by Tatarstan's leadership we can prove it. All we need is some trust and goodwill for the negotiations to open."
 KOM_demexpansion_plan_yellow_desc: "Rumors came to us of a breakaway Bashkir state. As it turns out, these separatists also existed an Islamist fashion. The Republican government might come to terms with Bashkir nationalists worried about their lack of rights in a new Russian Republic. The Republic, however, has no place for fanatics, no matter their religion. These Islamists must be crushed.\n\nA lot of the playbook of Plan Black will be reused. We foresee them using a militia based army operating with little heavy support compensated by fanatic zeal and morale."
 KOM_demexpansion_negotiate_with_bashkiria_desc: "Tatarstan's men and women had their grievances with Russian rule. Bashkiria's men and women have their own, mostly centered around religious issue. The Soviet Union's secularism sought to crush islam as thoroughly as other religions.\n\nWe are not the Soviet Union, as demonstrated by our supression of the republic's communists and our part in the destruction of the WRRF. Citizens in Komi have rights, and these rights are intrinsic to each citizen. They are not granted at the whim of a Tsar, or a political committee. Freedom of religion is an important value of our republic; surely we can reach a deal with Bashkiria?"
 KOM_demexpansion_consolidate_gained_resources_desc: "Most of our foes in southwestern Russia have been defeated. The republic stands triumphant once more!\n\nWhile the flood of new land to administer is not the exponential growth seen at the end of Plan Red, White and Black, integrating our new conquests into our republic has taken time. Now that our armies are taking a well earned rest, it is once again time for our public servants to wander into these new territories and catalogue everything. Industrial plants, cities, mines, population centers; all important resources for our growing nation. All this wealth is fed back into the Republican Army, covering equipment and manpower losses, and giving our men new weapons. On the horizon, new enemies. Our men must be equipped for any eventuality."
 KOM_demexpansion_ensure_industrial_preparedness_desc: "Building an industrial economy from the ground up using factories taken over in wars of conflict is not a precise science. Many factories that fall in our hands are geared to produce the same things as other industrial areas in our possession. Russian warlords usually function on an autarkic production system that sees everything crafted locally. Conversely, there are many goods that are produced nowhere, as the divided Russian territories did not possess an economy large enough for things beyond basic military weapons.\n\nAll this is beginning to change as we develop an integrated industrial policy prepared for a wide range of scenario and needs. Once rare items are now being produced in large quantities as the republic synergizes its various economic sectors to prevent any future penury of goods. Entire supply chains of complex outputs are reappearing in western Russia."
 KOM_demexpansion_secure_operational_integrity_desc: "Operational integrity seeks to gather men, methods of doing and materiel into one unified whole. Mechanized tactics cannot exist without supply and logistical regiments. Once in the field, tanks and vehicles are vulnerable to aerial attacks, requiring aerial support of our own. The deployment of costly vehicles and their experienced operators relies on the assumption that neither men nor materiel are in danger of destruction. Thus any deployment also requires an intel corps.\n\nOperational integrity is thus a complex system of simple parts brought together to perform critical military tasks. Our soldiers and generals have integrated every lessons of past conflicts into a new way of doing things. Long before a tank rolls out of our new factories, its purpose is well understood by our military. Our enemy shall learn to fear this oneness of purpose and action."
 KOM_demexpansion_plan_brown_desc: "What more is there to say concerning General Vlasov and his men? The death warrant of every single man of the ROA was signed with the blood of countless Russian soldiers killed on the order of the German Fascists. It is a mystery how Vlasov can keep talking of "Russian Liberation" when he and his acolytes have ensured that the suffering of the Russian people would last another miserable decade of steel and death.\n\nIt would not be accurate to depict the men of the ROA as spineless cowards, for they've shown courage time and time again when using their german training to take on impossible odds in the West Russian War. All we can hope is that these pigs in human form feel at least some fear at their upcoming judgement. The liberation of Samara must begin."
 KOM_demexpansion_consolidating_the_republic_desc: "While military and diplomatic conquest of the shattered lands of Western Russia is all well and good, we must not forget the greater civilian and bureaucratic apparatus that we must establish over our new lands. With West Russia now under our control, the time has come to begin the consolidation of the Republic - running censuses, ensuring that our institutions can handle our new populations, setting up supply lines, installing local leaders, and the thousand other tasks needed to set up a sustainable state."
 KOM_demexpansion_a_centered_capital_desc: "Syktyvkar, the capital of our estimable Republic, has served us well, and has a storied history as the most important city we possessed, in the dark days of our origin. However, a dilemma faces the government, one that is a simple manner of infrastructure, housing, and facilities with which to administer all of West Russia. The cities of Vyatka and Samara, now that they are cleansed of Tsarist and fascist influence, respectably, have both been submitted as possible new capitals for the Republic. While Syktyvkar is well loved, the time may very well have come to move to more grandiose housing."
 KOM_demexpansion_the_west_russian_census_desc: "Russia is a big place, and whie we do not own anywhere near all of it, our Republic occupies a significant portion of the former Soviet Union's landmass. The teeming multitudes of people across our lands have not yet been counted or audited - in order for our democratic institutions and basic social services to have a chance of working at all, we must make a detailed census of our population. Census-takers, many accompanied by armed police, will be dispatched from regional centers in order to alleviate this issue immediately."
 KOM_demexpansion_faith_in_democracy_desc: "Outside of the abortive Republic under Kerensky, Russia has never known true democracy of the sort that we wish to deliver to its people. Understandably and expectedly, the people are nervous and confused - as polling booths are elected, many peasants stay home or attempt to submit blank ballots, fearful of the watchful eyes of the no-longer-existent NKVD.\n\nThis will not do - we must enact a comprehensive program of democratic education, as well as communicate to the people well and truly what our goals and principles are. Democracy must stem from the people, and it may never bloom if the people do not have faith."
 KOM_demexpansion_activate_the_factories_desc: "Across the Republic, factories and other works of technological skill lie unused and unrepaired, for lack of expertise needed to run them. We must restore them at once, and soon, the people of the Republic will be able to enjoy the prosperity that an industrialized economy shall bring. Cars once more shall roam the roads of Russia, our army shall be furnished with matching rifles, and our grand cities' streets shall be lit with constant, incandescent electrical glow."
 KOM_demexpansion_get_the_peasants_on_board_desc: "The final and most crucial part of establishing the new Republic is securing our stores of food, and setting up systems through which the peasantry may be able to once more prosper. For years, many within the Republic, especially those in the frozen North, have struggled under the weight of food insecurity, poor soil, and bad weather. With the fertile lands of the south once more attained, we are now free to organize a better arrangement between the peasantry and our workers, ensuring that all may prosper and be nourished by the Republic's golden wheat."
 KOM_demexpansion_meet_with_the_finns_desc: "A final piece of land lies out of our control in western Russia. In Onega the Finnish government has propped up an army of Russian conscript as a desperate buffer zone between them and the WRRF. While the fear of invasion by the WRRF's brand of military communism is a little understandable, the cowardly Finns have forced Russian men to fight, lest their families be in danger.\n\nThe people of Onega deserves better than servitude at the hands of the Finns. And the Finn shall receive a lesson that the Germans would do well to pay heed to: no one enslaves the people of Russia without fearing consequences down the line. We will prepare a diplomatic party. They will have only one warning."
 
 KOM_demexpansion_restoring_order_desc: "The Republic has managed to sail out of the most dangerous sea. Yet we are not out of the storm yet, for internal enemies still roam within our borders just as we march to war with external rivals.\n\nCaution is the order of the day. Anti-democratic extremists have been severely hurt by repeated losses. As we set out to destroy our regional rivals, we must also keep up the pressure on domestic threats. For this task we can thankfully bring to bear the full legal apparatus. Police officers, judges as well as lawmakers can work in coordination to stamp out poisonous elements.\n\nFinal victory at home is within our grasp. Once its rears are secured, the army of the Republic will be able to begin its march to restore democracy to all of Russia."
 KOM_demexpansion_root_out_paramilitary_commanders_desc: "The army of the Republic has long been a pit of snakes. Political extremism within the officer corp was impossible to root out without fatally weakening the democratic government's grip on power. Left to their own devices, fascist and communist officers were free to aid anti-democratic street gangs. Some did so by propagating their doctrines to rank and files of the army; others used their tactical training to lead street gangs from the shadows; finally some served in the training of paramilitaries.\n\nWith the far right and far left waning in influence, we can finally remove from service officers and commanders who carry the taint of extremism. The loss of experienced personnel will be worth it as the central government's domestic position is reinforced and the soldiers march out with unity of purpose to face the enemy."
 KOM_demexpansion_arrest_sources_of_information_desc: "Many ordinary citizens cooperated with extremists, whether out of greed or ideological zealotry. Now that the judicial system is firmly under our control and that extremists in politics have been shackled, we can crack down with impunity on collaborators and fellow travellers.\n\nThe Republic must cast a wide net to arrest all those who contributed to the government's enemies. Those who broke no laws will be intimidated into taking plea-deals. Personal finances will be audited. We shall process methodically until all are guilty, or all have betrayed their former collaborators.\n\nThere shall be justice for the victims of political violence!"
 KOM_demexpansion_make_an_example_desc: "The Republic does not condemn its citizens to death lightly. However, there must be retribution for those who have conspired to end the nation's freedom and tolerance. Those who have infected Syktyvkar with violence must face justice. Those who have robbed their fellow citizens, those who have injured the innocents, those who have killed under the influence of extremism, all must see their sins weighed and face the risk of the greatest retribution of all.\n\nThe worst of the worst shall be executed. We do not have pity for traitors, and their deaths will hopefully inspire fear among their surviving allies. The Republic's justice is eternal. And its vengeance shall not spare the wicked."
 KOM_demexpansion_instate_weapons_regulations_desc: "The proliferation of weapons in the Republic has done much to let our ennemies operate without fear of retaliation. When a police action against a far-right contraband ring runs the risk of a violent gunfight against the equivalent of a platoon of soldiers with automatic rifles, hitting political criminal gangs hard becomes impossibly difficult.\n\nThe central government will introduce the first ever weapon regulation laws to the republic. The law will explicitly ban the possession of heavy weaponry. Equally under target will be automatic weapons, as well as large magazines.\n\nWe will use this law as both a carrot, and a stick. Extremists will be able to sell their weapons in a government buy back if they wish to quit politics, and those who hold on to their illegal weapons will be breaking the law and thus be easy to arrest."
 KOM_demexpansion_ban_unregistered_armed_groups_desc: "Beyond limiting access to weaponry, the government will also legislate paramilitaries out of existence. Outside of the army of the Republic, the police, as well as a few state backed militias, belonging to an group will be a criminal offense. Those who cling to their paramilitary membership will be arrested on terrorism charges; those who resist will be shot.\n\nThe designation of all those organizations as terrorist groups will allow us to hit their finances, starving them out of money. Violent confrontation need not end everyone of them, as the dwindling money and prestige of paramilitary sees these group hemorrhage members and morale."
 KOM_demexpansion_to_order_desc: "For as long as we have called Syvtyvkar our home, our rivals have mocked Komi's republic as a house of cards, toppled and rebuilt by ideologues constantly, its streets red with the blood of a slowly dying government.\n\nNo more! We have brought the Republic to order. Political extremism has been quelled, and peace and justice are the order of the day.\n\nSome might question Komi continuing to call itself "a place for all", in light of this quelled extremism. We stand by this statement, for all are welcome into the house of governments who will respect its institutions. Sacred hospitality is a two way obligation. Being now rid of those who would threaten others in our midst, we can continue to work on making the Republic a refuge for all Russians in this age of strife."
 KOM_demexpansion_codify_the_unwritten_rules_desc: "Komi has long prided itself on its tolerance of differing ideologies. People of all types call it home. The Republic's politicians are sharp, adept at political deals, trained by the ruthless nature of power in the Republic. Yes, this system's excesses have almost derailed our project. But why toss out the baby with the bathwater?\n\nThe unwritten rules will be codified. The radicals will be given their area to play in; as long as they respect the rules of the game, we will let them operate. In turn they will have to work with us as the Republic marches out against its rivals in Russian reunification.\n\nAfter all, might not the extremists be content with their own piece of the cake, once the Republic stretches from Finland to Manchuria?"
 KOM_demexpansion_negotiate_with_the_remnants_desc: "Having broken the back of the far left and far right and sending their surviving leaders on the run, it is time to negotiate with their remnants.\n\nThe extremist paramilitaries have been a permanent thorn in our side, but their tenacity and resourcefulness has not gone unnoticed. What's more, a great deal of these thugs are officially soldiers and officers of the republic. Were we to purge extremism from our army, a great deal of experience would be bled out from the institution.\n\nWe will offer these crooks a deal: fight for us, or be hammered by the law. Any weapon and supplies that are brought from paramilitary control back into official use will be rewarded, and former paramilitaries who prove especially willing to work with us will see their army career given a slight boost."
 KOM_demexpansion_the_vilegodsk_conference_desc: "To show our goodwill to the far right and far left, a conference in Vilegodsk has been called to help establish a legal framework of spheres of influences within the republic. Political organizations will be allowed to run schools, unions, news agencies and other such services for their own community, with oversight from the central government.\n\nThe ability to live separately from offensive sociopolitical groups within a clearly defined framework will assuage fears that the central government is one decree away from outlawing personal rights. In return, high level members of sociopolitical groups will be in constant communication and coordination with the central government, all in the spirit of showing loyalty to the Republic and a commitment to keeping the system alive."
 KOM_demexpansion_centralize_redistricting_desc: "Woe to the conquered!\n\nOur willingness to cooperate with extremists who recognize their defeat should not be misunderstood for a willingness to turn the other cheek and forget past misdeeds. As such, our government will create a new centralized redistricting office that will be in charge of designing the Republic's electoral constituencies.\n\nUsing this technique we will harvest a bounty of centrist deputies who will help strengthen our grip on the legislative and executive wings of government. This will allow us to pummel renegade extremists, and tempt those willing to compromise to join us at the negotiating table."
 KOM_demexpansion_a_united_army_desc: "The Republic of Komi was founded on the ideals of those who had suffered the Gulags. Never again would the lash of repression strike upon an individual's back. We welcomed the accursed and the forsaken. Now our freedoms must be protected and upheld by those who would strip it away forever. We are an island of light and tolerance in a sea of darkness. Unfortunately the shadow clinging to our borders has taken root at home. Infighting infests the Republican Army not too dissimilar from cancer. Factionalism has set root from the squad level up to entire regiments being divided along ideological lines. We must break up these formations and reform them with a pluralistic mix, led by officers loyal to the ideals of the state than any self avowed creed. Already a new generation of military men are being instructed and trained to take command.\n\nAll that is required is the order."
 KOM_demexpansion_to_arms_desc: "Citizens, the Republic stands more united than ever! Once wasting time in pointless bickering and endless bloodshed, the children of the nation stand united and ready to face their enemies. Old rivalries have been ended in the name of stabilizing and expanding the Republic.\n\nNow that fascists and communists soldiers stand side by side with their democratic counterparts, Komi is ready to go on the offense. The experience of our men and the vast scope of personalities and ideas within our army grants us the flexibility needed to tackle any enemy!\n\nAt least, so goes the theory. The extremists have quieted down for now. We can only hope that they keep their end of the bargain, lest internecine squabbles threaten to destroy our Republic once more."
 KOM_demexpansion_peace_for_now_desc: "Perhaps just a passing dream? The streets of our capital are quiet, for once. A few families are seen walking about where once thugs manned barricades and checkpoints.\n\nThe police reports echo this anomaly. Peace seems to have descended on Syvtyvkar. A fragile peace perhaps, for the demons of civil strife might return if we are not vigilant. A fragile peace, if our rivals in western Russia try to end our democratic experiment. A peace, nonetheless, and one we intend to defend by force.\n\nCitizens, much remains to be done. We must be vigilant, so that our nation's future is not dashed against the rocks of war nor the chaos of internal conflict."
 KOM_demexpansion_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc: "The Republic, once seeing its electoral system frayed and closing down due to extremism, must see democracy flourish again.\n\nRegenerating the interest and trust our citizens have in the democratic process will be tough, especially coming on the tail end of our efforts to end political extremism once and for all. We must accomplish this nevertheless, if the democratic center's power is to be assured.\n\nLetting go of our power to design electoral districts now that they have been sanitized will help restore confidence. As will the ability to call snap elections to remove governments that are wildly unpopular with the electorate. Finally, propaganda campaigns extolling the virtue of engaged citizens will hopefully draw crowds once more to polling stations."
 KOM_demexpansion_new_election_cycles_desc: "Now that the Republic's bases are strong and secure, it is time to turn a new leaf.\n\nNew elections taking place in the rationalized and cleansed political arena will be scheduled. It is perhaps a risky move to entrust the fate of our project to the citizens. No riskier, however, than ruling in content of majority to further the end of small political cliques like our enemies in the far left and far right intended to do.\n\nOur new electoral cycle is set to hold election around the time our army and diplomatic service is set to have reunited many regions of western Russia. Holding an election in freshly annexed or liberated territory must be difficult. But through this our new citizens will see our commitment to democratic ideals!"
 KOM_demexpansion_formalize_our_claims_desc: "Our enemies in the Revolutionary Front call us secessionists and traitors. The Tsar in Vyatka and his cronies dismiss us as the Syktyvkar clique. Others use our official name of the Komi Republic, seeing us as a mere local curiosity standing in their projects of uniting western Russia.\n\nThose names will be relegated to the past. Our government prepares a new declaration, announcing that we alone have the legitimacy to rule all of Russia as the Russian Republic. All of our institutions are to change to reflect this. Territory occupied by our military will merely be territory returning to our rightful rule. Diplomatic annexations will be undertaken under the auspices of bringing rogue provincial governors and usurpers back under the fold of the reborn Russian Republic.\n\nOur regional rivals are not likely to take this seriously. As such, we must be ready to prove our claims through force of arm... or through the silver-tongue of our diplomats. Nevertheless, the world shall know that the Russian Republic, killed by the Bolsheviks, is back!"
 KOM_demexpansion_the_constitutional_convention_desc: "Our status as the true Russian Republic imposes on us a rewriting of our Constitution. Befitting our democratic beliefs, it is important to initiate a constitutional convention, and invite all those who seek to contribute to our constitution in good faith.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and many sources to analyse. Flawed as they were, the constitutions of the late imperial regime, of Kerensky's failed republic, and of the Soviet Union itself are all sources of ideas. Each of the ruling coalition's democratic parties are likely to have good suggestions. We can also expect reformed extremists to attend. Their best ideas must be entertained, and those that were once our rivals will now become our friend in the rebirth of Russia."
 KOM_demexpansion_declare_the_free_republic_desc: "Men and women of the Republic, arise!\n\nFrom the Ural mountains on to the black mark of Moskowien, your fellow citizens everywhere are divided, enslaved by capricious tyrants or huddled in fragile statelets, awaiting liberation.\n\nAs the restored Russian Republic, our first aim is to unite western Russia into a new West Russian Free Republic. This does not shirk from our ambitions to free all of Russia, but rather confirm it! Once the greatest population centers that are free from German occupation are ours, our Republic will march east, to the Pacific!\n\nThe Tsarists, and the Communists of the Front, and the despicable dogs of the so called Army of Russian Liberation, let them all cower! The army of free men is on the march!"

 KOM_stalexpansion_restoring_order_desc: "The struggle for Russian reunification has begun, with territory after territory falling under our control. Yet even as we fight to rebuild our country, we are hampered by the political chaos of the Komi Republic, where extremists on either side of politics seek to take power by terroristic means. Even in our new territories, unrest and radicalism simmer. Russia cries out for true leadership. Thankfully, there is a woman with the talent, vision, and strength to seize the reigns of history and restore order in our fractured nation: Svetlana Stalina."
 KOM_stalexpansion_devolve_judicial_power_desc: "The judicial process in Komi is fair, but also inefficient and slow. With so many radicals opposing our government, and so many trials to process, reforms have to be made. President Stalina has authorized the powers of the judicial courts to be extended to the police precincts and military. This will allow for the police and military to set up courts of their own, so that extremists and criminals can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. While some may call this undemocratic, and fear that this will be used to purge anyone who disagrees with the government, it is simply the only way to proceed. Once the crisis has passed, we can discuss this matter in more depth."
 KOM_stalexpansion_arrest_sources_of_information_desc: "While many of the world's democracies enshrine freedoms such as the freedom of speech as sacred and untouchable constructs, they have their downsides. President Stalina does not despise freedom of speech, she merely wishes to ensure the survival of the Republic. As such, using an executive directive, the freedom of speech shall be suspended entirely, so that it may not be abused by radicals to spread hate and strife.\n\nThis is merely a temporary measure, and these legal protections shall be returned once the crisis is under control, we assure you."
 KOM_stalexpansion_make_an_example_desc: "Our government has recently captured several extremist paramilitaries, whose ideologies have cost the lives of countless innocent souls. They continued to spread hate and destruction within our Republic, and are complicit in the cycle of coups that President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are attempting to end. They must be made an example, an example of the punishment reserved for spreading hate and discord, for propagating extremism and violence.\n\nTheir trials shall be quick, expedited through our new judicial policies. We shall line up these communists and fascists against a wall and eradicate their hatred from this world. May God have mercy on their souls."
 KOM_stalexpansion_seize_unregistered_firearms_desc: "As we have waged our war to reunite Russia and vanquish the warlords, we have increasingly found that many civilians in our newly acquired territories possess their own firearms. Russia has been a dangerous place in recent times, and we would not deprive our citizens of the right to arm themselves for protection and self-defence. Yet in the wrong hands, these weapons could pose a threat to our brave soldiers. We shall have to conduct background checks on the citizen population, making sure there are none with extremist sympathies hiding in our midst, seizing the firearms of any who poses a threat. They will be much more useful in the hands of our men."
 KOM_stalexpansion_clear_the_streets_desc: "Street protests, violent crime, and other civil disturbances continue to plague our cities at precisely the time the campaign to restore Russia to greatness requires order and discipline. It is time to put a stop to such nonsense, by any means necessary. We will deploy the police, our greatest defence against anarchy, across the cities of Russia, and put an end to the chaos. Those who resist will be met with the full force of the law. Some will complain about the stripping of their liberties, but such people do not know that freedom can only be built on the basis of a secure, orderly society. They will learn."
 KOM_stalexpansion_the_crisis_calmed_desc: "Thankfully, due to all of our efforts to remove extremist ideas from our republic the immediate crisis seems to have been calmed. However, there are still many radicals who may try to seize power as we expand into more territories. Similarly, as we come to control regions that were once under communist or despotist rule, we may be at risk of a partisan uprising. These territories that have never known democracy may not be in favor of our government. We should continue our efforts to educate these people and eliminate the threats of radicals and partisans, and we will not stop until our republic is secured."
 KOM_stalexpansion_the_national_reconstruction_council_desc: "President Stalina needs a group of people to aid her in stabilizing Komi, and has found her solution in the form of the National Reconstruction Council. Its members consist of PSD politicians, police commanders, trade union leaders, and military officers, serving as an upper house of sorts for the Reconstruction Government. The Council will propose and pass policy during this time of crisis, give advice and consent to decisions made by the President, and have sole authority to ratify treaties. The National Reconstruction Council shall act as a parallel body to the National Assembly, but will be more reliable due to all of the members being appointed directly by the President herself."
 KOM_stalexpansion_guarantees_to_the_national_assembly_desc: "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. Some have even gone so far as to call President Stalina a dictator, and anti-democratic. What these critics don't seem to understand is that these are all temporary protective measures, to ensure that the Republic does not fall once again.\n\nTo combat these claims, President Stalina shall take a break from her busy schedule to promise that the National Assembly's power shall be returned shortly, and that the Reconstruction Government will be disbanded once the crisis has passed. Hopefully, this will end their useless panicking."
 KOM_stalexpansion_extend_emergency_powers_desc: "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. President Stalina has decided to refuse to guarantee the temporary nature of these policies, seeing it as unnecessary and a distraction from her busy schedule. Instead, President Stalina has chosen to extend her emergency powers indefinitely, and she will cease using them once they are no longer necessary. The Reconstruction Government operates on a need-to-know basis, and currently, that is all the National assembly needs to know. If they have a problem with this information, President Stalina suggests submitting a complaint to the National Reconstruction Council, who will address such complaints once there is enough time available to do so."
 KOM_stalexpansion_issue_the_fundamental_directives_desc: "The Republic of Komi is beset on all sides by extremists, radicals and rabble-rousers who seek to undermine the stability of the nation, planning to destroy the rights of the common man in favour of building twisted "utopias" based on their ideas. This ends now. Only by issuing a series of Fundamental Directives that order their arrests and removals from society can we restore the stability that they destroyed. Who is an extremist will be decided later- what matters now is that they must be eliminated."
 KOM_stalexpansion_liquidate_anti_democratic_apparatus_desc: "With the continued consolidation of the Republic, it has become clear to the Reconstruction Government that democracy may not be restored promptly without more and more decisive action. The time for legislation and temporary police crackdowns is over - the time has come. We must rid ourselves of the Far-Left and the Far-Right, for good. Their members will be arrested. No matter how large they are, or irrelevant, they will be annihilated."
 KOM_stalexpansion_a_blueprint_for_integration_desc: "The more the Republic expands, the more difficult it is for us to properly integrate these new territories into the central government- that is, unless we come up with a distinct plan on how to train and send in new administrators into these territories in a swift but orderly manner. New departments and governments will need to be set up as soon as our armies conquer them, while leaders from regions peacefully incorporated into the state must be integrated into the government of Komi as soon as possible in order to create a stable platform for expansion."
 KOM_stalexpansion_democracy_is_non_negotiable_desc: "Nothing is more sacred on this green Earth than the right for people to take part in the government, but despots and extremists refuse to recognise this. Hence, it is by the guns and tanks of the Komi Army that the light of democracy is carried to the furthest depths of Russia. Hence, we must issue an ultimatum to all the tyrannies and despotates that we encounter on the road to reunification: accept integration into the Republic, or war. Democracy is non-negotiable, and these thugs must learn this lesson the hard way, if need be."
 KOM_stalexpansion_the_road_to_enduring_freedom_desc: "The protection of liberty and democracy in the Republic was long and difficult; some agitators even claim that our methods go against the ideals that we have uphold so dearly. We cannot listen to these rabble-rousers. Since the inception of our nation, the freedom that is so much a part of Komi's identity was besieged by extremists within and without, and it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. As long as it is under attack, we must endure that long road to freedom, facing whatever obstacle comes in our way with courage and determination."

 KOM_second_election_start_desc: "With our liberation of the West, we are closer than ever to realizing the dream of the February Revolution: A truly democratic Russia. Now that we govern West Russia and have transcended the simple borders of the old Komi Republic, it's time to hold the [KOM.GetName]'s first official elections. For many West Russians, this will be their first free election. They are excited to head to the polls.\n\nThree parties have thrown their hats into the ring: The democratic socialist §PDSNP§! headed by Nikolai Voznesensky, the centrist §MPSD§! under Svetlana Stalina, and the liberal §YSMR§! fielding Alexei Kosygin. The [GetYear] elections are sure to be a close race, and whoever wins will decide the fate of West Russia for 4 more years. The race is on!"
 KOM_second_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc: "Voznesensky isn't perfect, but he's perfect for West Russia. The working man in Russia has no better choice than the founder of modern Russian democracy. The DSNP blends the best of old Soviet socialism with new democratic institutions to create a democratic socialist party that protects workers' lives and liberties.\n\nThe DSNP will get a head start on their election campaign. Voznesensky will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting his Presidential record and plans for the future. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc: ""West Russians, workers, countrymen, you have been liberated. Some of you have been liberated from noblemen, juntas, and collaborators who expected you to work to make them richer. Some of you have been liberated from authoritarian communists who valued you only for your output as a line item in a centrally planned budget. But now you have a true friend in your government. Our party fights for you, not for your servitude. We fight that you may earn a fair wage for fair work, that you may feel secure from job precarity, and that you may retire with a well-deserved pension. We are the DSNP, and we are your party."\n\nVoznesensky will go on a speaking tour in factories across the [KOM.GetName]. He will play to the party's industrial base and promote himself as a friend of the working class. By shoring up support from our core constituency, we should have a strong showing in the election."
 KOM_second_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc: "Since many of our voters are new to our party, it would be wise to teach them what we stand for. West Russia needs to know what our ideology and policies are if we are to win a mandate in the 1968 elections.\n\nThe DSNP will publish their party platform across the [KOM.GetName]. In it, they will detail their plans for wage, occupational safety, and pension reform. They will also make it clear that their ultimate goals are to reunify the whole of Russia and apply their pro-worker agenda across all of its regions. Nobody with a heart could oppose this platform!"
 KOM_second_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc: "The [KOM.GetName] is a new and unstable country. Many of its people have only recently been amalgamated into it, and have never experienced a free election in their lives. The last thing they need is more utopian visions by ersatz wings of the old Center bloc. Only Svetlana Stalina's PSD can provide the order and stability that Russia so desperately craves.\n\nThe PSD will get a head start on their election campaign. Stalina will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting her commitment to political stability and moderate plans for reform. As many West Russians will be choosing her for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "If the people of West Russia want anything, it's stability. Having experienced the collapse of the Union at the hands of the Nazis, control of their homes changing hands between different warlords again and again, and finally reunification under the [KOM.GetName], they need an end to the chaos in their lives. They'll be glad to know that Stalina is just the woman for the job.\n\nThe PSD will publish its platform across the country. It will detail plans for rapid reclamation of the unliberated zones to restore the old Russia. It will mention their social democratic economic policies and protections for free speech, but will also emphasize their expansion of the military and police with an aim to create a safe and secure West Russia. This should capture the hearts of the many weary West Russians now joined to our republic."
 KOM_second_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc: ""While West Russians may now breathe free, the wolves lurking at our borders hunger for their blood. The DSNP and SMR may wax enthusiastic about their social 'reforms', but none of them can tell you how they'll keep you safe from an invasion. But our party has an answer: Funding the finest military in Russia."\n\nThe PSD will appeal to national defense in order to rally votes. They will unveil a plan to double defense spending and purchase state of the art equipment from overseas. Peace comes from superior firepower, and voters will know that only the PSD can keep the peace in the [KOM.GetName]."
 KOM_second_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc: "The Komi Republic began with a dream; a dream that one day all Russia would be one, democratic, and free. A dream that prosperity would abound from Murmansk to Magadan, not because it was planned by party bureaucrats, but because Russia's leaders trusted its people to build it themselves. Now that the Komi Republic has been transcended by the [KOM.GetName] we can shed the shackles of the old Center bloc that kept the dream down; Alexei Kosygin and the SMR alone will make that dream come true.\n\nThe SMR will get a head start on their election campaign. Kosygin will criss-cross the [KOM.GetName] giving speeches promoting his beautiful vision of liberty and prosperity. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 KOM_second_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc: ""You Russian students are the builders of the new tomorrow. The DSNP only cares for men who swing a wrench and the PSD chide you to 'follow your elders,' the same elders who let our nation fall to the Germans. I have a different message, dear youth: Russia needs you. It needs your creativity. It needs the diligence you show in your studies. It needs your mastery of the arts and sciences. Most of all, it needs your courage to stand up to the old failures and create new successes. An SMR Russia is your Russia, and it will be the Russia of your grandchildren when you retire to a life of comfort and culture."\n\nKosygin will launch a speaking tour across the [KOM.GetName]'s universities. He will campaign hard for the youth vote. While the youth may seem an odd choice of a support base, their dedication to him now will likely last their whole lives; Kosygin is nothing if not forward-thinking. This should help give us an edge in the [GetYear] elections."
 KOM_second_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc: "Kosygin is the man with the plan. He always was ever since he'd saved Russian industry during the war by organizing the Eastward evacuation, and he's going to save the [KOM.GetName] now with his extensive reforms. He will unveil to all the people of West Russia his blueprint for their future.\n\nThe SMR will publish their platform across the [KOM.GetName]. It will detail their affirmative action plans for Russia's women and ethnic minorities, as well as their blueprint for expanding private enterprise to increase economic growth. While the platform will uphold the socialist roots of the SMR, it will portray them as focused first and foremost on the personal liberty and prosperity of every West Russian. This message should resonate with the electorate, many of whom will have their first taste of real freedom."
 KOM_second_election_let_the_race_begin_desc: "Campaigning season is over and the [KOM.GetName] is heading to the polls. Each candidate put up a good fight, and analysts see this election as anyone's game. Russians will soon gather around their radio sets to hear the final tallies and find out who will lead their nation for the next 5 years: Voznesensky's democratic socialists, Stalina's stability-minded centrists, or Kosygin's liberal democrats.\n\nMany will be elated by the results, others dismayed. Yet one thing all can agree on is that a free and fair election was finally held across West Russia; a triumph in a land that has never known a peaceful transfer of power. No matter who wins the most votes, democracy has won in the [KOM.GetName]."

 ### DEMOCRATIC REGIONALS DESCS ###
 KOM_voznesensky_a_socialist_mandate_desc: "As Russia roils and bleeds around us, we must cling to the principles which have brought us this far: to the ideals of our Constitution. Not for us the tyranny of the Eurasianists, not for us the violence of the Communist Left, and not for us the falsehoods and demagoguery of radicalism! In this and only this do we place our trust: a dedication to Democratic Socialism, one which is beholden neither to the will of an iron hierarchy nor to the nightmarish callings of frenzied agitators.\nYes, Socialism! We dare use that term divorced from the tyrant-Bolsheviks of old, for unlike those who would plaster a Red Tsardom to their walls to keep them safe, we are not afraid of listening to the people - and we are not afraid of acting on what we hear. Only Socialism can keep us loyal to our people, and only Democracy can keep Socialism true to its course. There can be no other option."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_new_republic_desc: "The old Republic was broken by its own best intentions: as Social Democracy was built it absorbed the dregs of every ideology across the political spectrum. A paradox of tolerance was at work, where at every opportunity we promoted the principles that we held so dear, and at every opportunity radicals used our idealism to undermine our grip. Now, as the President consolidates his grip, we will have an opportunity to truly express our beliefs in a purified form.\n\nA form where all will truly breathe free without inconvenient enemies and their alluring agitation-politics. A form where the worst of Voznesensky's opponents, and without a doubt the Republic's enemies by extension, can be discredited once and for all. A new Republic - and a different Russia."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_free_electoral_commission_desc: "Electoral Commissions were a controversial introduction to the old Republic, as repeated efforts to suborn the legitimacy of these Commissions by our associated extremist fringes made every election a headache. That said, our elections are still in desperate need of neutral third-party observation to ensure that said extremist fringe never again regains a hold on our electoral scene. We will introduce a new Commission to solve these problems, one whose neutrality will be firmly guarded by the President and the Head of the Legislature to keep the powers of state in check.\n\nThere are some who claim that the Electoral Commission is in fact simply one more tool in our President's pocket, and that there are in fact widespread claims that the Commission is as steeped in money as its predecessor. These extremist calls will be disregarded as the treasonous claims they are. The truth is this: we are the instrument of the People's Will.\n\nThose that disagree are more than welcome to take it up with us in person."
 KOM_voznesensky_an_urban_rural_platform_desc: "Democracy in Russia is like navigating a tightrope - one is perpetually forced to navigate between two worlds, each with vastly different requirements and lived experiences. Just as Janus was two-faced, so too must we adopt a two-faced approach: to look to the world of the village and the world of the urbanite and balance both their needs. Thankfully, Vosnesensky's long experience in Government has given him an intuitive grasp on these two chambers of the heart of Russia.\n\nWe will adopt a mixed approach, pushing for the gradual integration of the economy through separate, equal development. The farmer shall be given an equal voice and support for his labor, on an equal platform with the laborer at the factory, and we shall push for the organization of a true Farmer-Labor working class that can stand as one despite their asymmetrical backgrounds. Only when the two chambers of the Russian Heart beat as one shall Russia be united!"
 KOM_voznesensky_stand_for_democracy_desc: "There are certain ideals for which we cannot afford to compromise: chief among them would be our oft-quoted support for true Democratic ideals. This is what separates us from the radical rabble to our left and right - our absolute, unyielding conviction that the people alone can decide their mandate, and that no group of stuffed suits should decide the course of the Nation alone. As such, we must develop a new mandate, a Compact with the People, that will appeal to the men and women of Russia. Their alienation must not be allowed to fester, lest it consume the body politic in the sickness of extremism.\n\nA healthy level of propagandization about just how committed we are, accompanied by quiet suppression of the remnants of the old extremist groups, will keep our citizens on the straight and narrow - and a rhetorical focus on progressive legislation will convince them that we are on their side. A carrot and stick approach might not be particularly sophisticated, but that is the beauty of politics, yes?"
 KOM_voznesensky_democratic_idealism_desc: "Just as the poets fled to Tomsk, so too did the tired and huddled masses to the old Republic - despite all that has happened here, we retain that essential spark of democratic energy, that infallible belief that our voices matter. This is what kept the Old Republic going, even as its institutions fell apart around us and the stresses of extremism dragged it into the muck - and it is this idealism that will empower us to build a new dream, stronger and better than the old.\n\nA push for unionism, continued efforts to weed out irregularities in our voting system, and the expansion of our voting system to ensure all walks of life will have an equal say in elections - we are writing into law our passion for Democracy, and our love shall spill onto the streets of our shared home. May Russia live and breathe free, for as long as we draw breath we shall never cease in pulling her towards the public good."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_united_government_desc: "For all our talk of democracy, a certain degree of electoral unity is necessary to ensure our legislative branch is not vulnerable to the attacks that crippled our forebears. We must strive for a government that is both attuned to the popular voice and unfettered in their capability to carry out that which is mandated to us. As such, we will continue the broad-based United Coalition strategy - the extremist elements which we collaborated with, however, will no longer be welcome.\n\nInstead, we will pull in diverse elements from all across society, creating a truly broad-based party capable of responding to popular demands. Unionists, soldiers and street-sweepers shall all have their voices heard in our Coalition, and minor parties pressured into upholding their interests as well - this might fragment the power of our opposition, but democracy is not about opposition, is it not? After all, it is not competition, but representation, that makes Russia great. Why would we ever change that?"
 KOM_voznesensky_a_party_consensus_desc: "If we are ever to get our Government in Order, our control of our own Party must be an overriding priority. The DSNP is a hidebound institution, having inherited much of our factionalist divides from the old era, and even though our opponents are firmly out of office we must ensure that secondary allegiances are wholly uprooted to keep the Party vital. Dedication to the common interest and our party platform will be strictly enforced on members and legislators, with dissent punished by expulsion.\n\nWe will also develop grassroots organizations to keep our party members loyal, developing community ties to local leadership that will sustain our members' electoral campaigns - this support comes with inevitable compromises, and even weakness to the influence of the Party on important issues, but it is all necessary to keep their best interests aligned with our own. Otherwise, what would be the point of the Party in the first place?"
 KOM_voznesensky_relentless_progress_desc: "The political position our party finds itself is already described by contemporaries as "Democratic Hegemony", with a majority of the seats ensuring us practically full control of the legislative, provided we avoid internal strife and the party acts as a single block. This has to lead many of our representatives to doubt the usefulness of the Democratic front and cooperation with rightists as a whole, seeing how there's no need for painful compromises when we can wrestle control of the legislative on our own.\n\nWhile this may be a controversial move to make, we might have to agree with these circles and start distancing ourselves from the other parties. After all, the people of Russia haven't given the DSNP a vote of confidence for it to be bogged down by uncooperative conservatives."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_doctrine_of_compromise_desc: "While the DSNP holds the dominant position in the Assembly, its status as the ruling party is secured by a rather small margin, with support from the other democratic parties often necessary to ensure an indisputable majority.\n\nThough a good portion of our own deputies is dissatisfied with this state of dependence on rightist politicians and factions to pass our own legislation, our leadership has to recognize the unfortunate truth, that maintaining the Democratic Front with moderate rightists is the only way to ensure unity of the political center, for without it the republic would fall to extremism."
 KOM_voznesensky_past_the_scandals_desc: "Though the DSNP is the guarantor of prosperity in the republic and the party that unified Western Russia under the banner of democracy, it has eventually become evident that the pedestal of popular support it's so used to enjoying is quite brittle. With every scandal as minor as a single bribe, the public perception of our apparatus shifts from praise to condemnation, and many say that since its ascension to power the party has been permeated with crooked bureaucrats and thieving executives.\n\nWhile over the years these scandals have become the new normal, as public opinion eventually stabilizes after each one, and any outrage so far has been relatively minor, eventually any of them might spiral out of control, and the ensuing political crisis may cost our party it's ruling place or even the permanent stability of the republic. To prevent such a disaster, we should improve our public image, which will ultimately secure genuine popular support we so desperately require. The recent reunification should serve well to be presented as the moment when the DSNP was reborn from a den of corruption that has abandoned its founding principles. Now it has become a truly democratic association struggling for popular welfare, that is built on the principles of honesty and open government.\n\nAs such, initiatives have been approved for local anti-corruption campaigns, showing the electorate that the party acknowledges its problems and is ready to fight them openly. Whether this will prove effective is another question entirely, though this will be the first step on the way to overcoming the distrust many feel towards the DSNP."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_populist_agenda_desc: "Not so long ago, in the disunited lands of Russia, populism was employed by many a warlord to justify their rule. As such, some view it as a natural tool of a cruel age, invented by despots to bamboozle their subjects.\n\nHowever, we in the halls of power clearly see the benefits of populism - promising a better future to the people, fostering unity between them and the government, and securing their trust in our mandate are all beneficial to democracy as much as to any would-be dictator. Let us cultivate healthy populism in our party program, ensuring popular support in our march to progress."
 KOM_voznesensky_an_all_russian_autonomy_commission_desc: "The territory of Russia, in the historical process of her expansion, has absorbed the lands of many ethnicities, their population varying from millions to mere hundreds, each with a culture, unlike the others. Since the days of the October revolution, Lenin's government, believing in the principles of self-determination, granted the peoples of the new Soviet Union significant autonomy, the legacy of which we still carry, our republic itself having emerged from the Komi ASSR.\n\nWith our authority now extending throughout all of Western Russia, "The Autonomy Question" as it came to be known, has become a more significant issue, with notable figures from various ethnicities dissatisfied with the current status quo. While outright secessionists are few and irrelevant, we could satisfy the wishes of moderate particularist circles by introducing a separate body to improve the status of minorities and serve as an intermediary between the central government and the autonomies in matters where direct control is unnecessary. While some criticize this as "soft separatism" and "subversion of ethnic equality", many agree that this is the only way to guard the many ethnicities of Russia from the tyranny of the majority."
 KOM_voznesensky_prioritize_majoritarian_concerns_desc: "As Russia always has been a multinational state, her many former governments left a number of ethnic policies for our republic to inherit, including Bolshevik self-rule in various autonomies, which we currently practice in a slightly amended form, adapted for our democratic system. Though intended to grant the needed freedoms to the minorities, since the unification many are expressing disapproval of this system, calling for even greater autonomy.\n\nThis notion, though fitting the DSNP's general line, has been met with staunch opposition in the Assembly, with some especially vocal critics branding it as "eroding the principle of universal equality the republic is built on, through giving the minorities undemocratic overrepresentation". Many of the more moderate deputies are abstaining from the direct debate, but are evidently opposed to shaking up the status quo. While we could still force the initiative through, it could undermine the party's stability, and perhaps even sabotage the democracy we struggled so much to build. As such, we better forget about this proposal as soon as possible and move on to more pressing matters."
 KOM_voznesensky_extend_social_welfare_desc: "One of the key elements of any socialist agenda, ours not being an exception, is the promise of welfare for citizens of the state. Many fought for us on the fields of battle and gave us their vote to ensure this better tomorrow for their children, and it's due time we honored this promise.\n\nWith the initial stage of the long-awaited Reunification complete, we have achieved precious peace, allowing us to turn the necessary attention inwards, to finally build a working system of social welfare for all."
 KOM_voznesensky_campaign_for_the_disadvantaged_desc: "Despite our recent general welfare campaign, many of our citizens remain in a powerless and downtrodden state, experiencing difficulties with integration into the Republic's social and political environment. The Reunification, though it brought democracy to the people of Russia robbed many of their old way of life, leaving them stranded on the border between conflicting values and realities of their new life.\n\nSuch people, when not shielded from uncalled hardships, often turn to more radical options, aiming to tear down the society they view as downtrodding. As such, before the disadvantaged turn into radicals and terrorists, we must lend them a helping hand in integration."
 KOM_voznesensky_a_shining_precedent_desc: "Though for years our rivals and critics argued that a functional democracy could not exist within the brutal realities of warlordism and banditry that plagued Russia since her defeat, our new republic has disproven this claim by the fact of its very existence! It withstood the onslaught of radicals within and without, right and left, and has carried the torch of popular freedom from the Volga and to the White Sea. Breaking the expectations of the cynical, it has triumphed in war as well as peace, fighting for progress across both the fields of battle and halls of government. Our efforts here have established a precedent, that will outlast any tyranny, for, in the hearts and minds of the people, our republic shall persist through the hardest of crises.\n\nThree hurrahs for Russia! Three hurrahs for Democracy!"

 KOM_stalina_the_reconstruction_government_desc: "Our government, tasked with the salvation of the Republic, and eventually - Russia, has secured the West of the country, and it is now our duty to protect it from threats within and without. We shall do all in our power to wipe out extremists, restore prosperity and stability in the lives of our citizens, and eventually step down, leaving Russia united and free.\n\nThis herculean mission will not be finished in a day, a month, or perhaps even in years, but Russia's history has taught us that rallied under a strong authority, she overcame countless challenges before, and we are here to ensure she shall do so again."
 KOM_stalina_strengthen_the_institutions_desc: "Our main task, other than securing stability, is to ensure that the new democracy that will arise in the place of our Emergency Government, never meets the fate of the old one, crushed by shady backroom deals, informal agreements, intrigue, and powerplays beyond competency.\n\nIf we are to establish a New Republic, then at its center must stand legitimate institutions backed by public trust, with their offices having strictly defined limits of power and authority, so that biased and informal cliques will shackle Russia no longer."
 KOM_stalina_crack_down_on_corruption_desc: "Unfortunately for our cause, even an apparatus tasked with saving democracy itself is not immune to corruption. Thankfully, with the broadened powers granted to the emergency government under the pretext of national salvation will allow us to confront crooks and thieves directly, in these trying times, when corruption is little less than treason and should be stamped out, lest it finishes the republic in its moment of weakness."
 KOM_stalina_a_stabilizing_thaw_desc: "It seems our promise to eventually restore democracy was perceived quite differently by the populace, with some circles already making demands to start gradual liberalization in their areas of interest, arguing that the worst is behind us.\n\nWhile a few hardliners and military figures disagree, honoring a popular request will yield us much-needed credibility as a government on guard of democracy, and loosening press censorship and the like will help maintain the normality of life in a free society."
 KOM_stalina_a_supervised_state_desc: "With us explicitly defining the Reconstruction Government as a temporary measure to protect the republic's democracy, the rapidly rising campaigns to reintroduce freedoms have only begun to get in the way of our decision-making. While most of those groups are harmless, some movements, particularly those for the reintroduction of press freedoms, are particularly outspoken critics, and thus cannot be ignored.\n\nThough some are calling to listen to those demands, it would be more rational to silence them with a decisive refusal - liberalizing now would only defeat the point of the state of emergency by giving forces aiming to destabilize the nation a legal means of distributing their agitation. For as long as the Reconstruction Government holds, we'll have to maintain those restrictions in the name of stability and safety of our citizens."
 KOM_stalina_the_militarys_approval_desc: "Though the Emergency Government was largely formed by an agreement between Stalina's supporters in the National Assembly, and pro-democratic officers subordinated to Grigorenko, the two have since acted independently of each other, only cooperating explicitly in the initial securing of power.\n\nIf we are to move forward, we'll have to tighten the cooperation between those who protect the Republic in the halls of government and those who do their duty in the army. Thankfully, Stalina's close friendship with Grigorenko can help coerce him into directing the army to support the initiatives of the Government directly, cracking down on radicals and ensuring stability in the streets. Of course, this agreement will not be like the unspoken alliances of plotting bureaucrats in the old republic, with the military's full subordination to the president being formally codified."
 KOM_stalina_the_renewed_defense_of_the_republic_act_desc: "In order to maintain a strong enough army to unify all of Russia, we need to increase conscription. Unfortunately, we are facing a problem regarding conscription. Several loopholes exist in our conscription laws that allow many of our able-bodied citizens to avoid being conscripted.\n\nAs such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have decided to draft a new piece of legislation, the Defense of the Republic Act. this ensures that our citizens can't exploit loopholes to get out of service. Alongside dealing with loopholes, the Defense of the Republic Act renews the two-year conscription periods. If we are to reunite the Motherland, we need all hands on deck."
 KOM_stalina_the_national_sovereignty_act_desc: "Russia possesses many strategic resources, the most valuable to our government being oil. However, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government feel that we give out these resources too easily, allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies. This is absurd, and something has to be done to rectify this matter.\n\nIntroducing the National Sovereignty Act. This law severely limits the exports of strategic resources to nations without defensive ties to the Motherland. In short, if a nation wants our resources, they must declare themselves an ally of the Russian Republic. This shall make the Russian Republic a more attractive ally to nations within the international community, and will help protect the Motherland. At the end of the day, that is all that matters."
 KOM_stalina_the_executive_directive_act_desc: "During times of crisis, the nation can't stop to wait for the mire of bureaucracy. As such, President Stalina - through the recently created Executive Directive Act - has been granted the ability to issue directives to handle any crisis that threatens national security unilaterally.\n\nThis allows President Stalina to govern quickly and efficiently, side-stepping all of the red tape that would normally impede her actions. Some may protest this further centralization of power, but the Executive Directive Act is a necessary step towards the goal of a united Motherland. President Stalina guided the Republic through a time of crisis once before, and she will likely have to do so repeatedly in the future. Our enemies will not wait patiently for our government to come to a consensus."
 KOM_stalina_the_party_registry_act_desc: "It is clear to the Reconstruction Government that the organizations that are allowed to participate in our government must be more thoroughly vetted in order to safeguard the Republic. As such, President Stalina has approved the Party Registry Act.\n\nAll political parties and organizations that wish to operate within the Republic must be officially approved and investigated, to ensure that they are not affiliated with extremist groups. This process shall be carried out by a wholly impartial and unbiased state-run body. While it may be staffed solely with former PSD members, these men and women have sworn to govern solely in the interests of the Republic, and would never allow bias to creep into their judgements. Any who doubt these comments can submit their complaints to the National Reconstruction Council, to be considered once there is enough time available to do so."
 KOM_stalina_empower_the_party_desc: "The PSD is currently the largest party in our Republic, and is home to a variety of centrist ideologies. However, the party's current structure does not allow for the various factions within our party to be heard. As such, the PSD must evolve: it shall become the 'Party of Power.' With this restructuring, the PSD will allow for greater discussion between its various actions, with greater ideological variety inside the party than outside the party. The PSD already serves as the main party for those who support democracy and stand against radicalism, so any consensus reached within the PSD will effectively be the same as a consensus reached within the legislature. The majority consensus shall apply to all party members, and that consensus shall be reached through free, democratic discussion.\n\nOf course, more radical ideologues will remain outside the party, so that they can't derail discussions with their extremist propaganda."
 KOM_stalina_public_concessions_desc: "The PSD and the Reconstruction Government have been highly focused on destroying extremism's influence within the Republic, but it is important that we do not forget our roots. The PSD serves the people, and our policies must reflect this. As such, President Stalina has decided to dedicate funds to the people, in the forms of welfare and pensions. Welfare services and pensions shall be expanded, and our government shall in general ensure that our citizens are taken care of. No citizen shall starve on our streets, no person shall be left without a home in our cities. No veterans shall be left destitute for sacrificing themselves for their country, and no citizen shall need to turn to radicalism merely to survive."
 KOM_stalina_allow_for_a_split_desc: "When in the process of establishing the Reconstruction Government the PSD de-facto absorbed the other parties of the democratic front in, many agreed it was a necessary measure. Now, however, even with our efforts to solidify this union, cracks in the system are starting to show, with activists of the former SMR and DSNP aiming to reestablish those parties once again.\n\nAfter a brief period of discussion, many in the administration seem not to mind this, seeing the division of the political center as a natural phenomenon, and agreeing that the old party structure is not to blame for the situation the republic now finds itself in. With Stalina's approval, the two parties are soon to be restored, though many of the deputies are to stay in the PSD securing its status as the sole ruling party in the Reconstriction Government and ensuring full control of it."
 KOM_stalina_keep_the_big_tent_model_desc: "On the very onset of the Reconstruction Government's establishment, some deputies expressed concern over the fate of the Republic's democratic landscape, presenting the idea that the only way to recover from this crisis would be to preserve the center coalition, centralized around the PSD, as a broad force of containment against radicals.\n\nWith the question of the former SMR and DSNP cadre leaving the PSD to refound their parties, this suggestion has been bought up again and rallied around by a large fraction in the government, arguing that if the unity of the center would be jeopardized, the democratic forces would fall divided. With this proposal practically guaranteeing governmental stability, Stalina has decided to veto the split, cementing her administration's nature as a grand union of all three former moderate parties, disempowering any remaining real opposition."
 KOM_stalina_ensure_free_elections_desc: "Elections, when they are held, shall be free and fair. We cannot make the same mistakes as the previous government, the right to vote for everyone must be upheld. Fair elections will ensure a stable republic and a working, capable democracy.\n\nTo ensure fair elections are upheld, Stalina has authorized for new institutions that promote democracy and freedom be established. These institutions will make sure everyone gets an equal chance to vote. They will also ensure the government does not try to influence or affect the elections themselves or its results. There will be no more chaos at the polls!"
 KOM_stalina_the_constitution_of_national_reconstruction_desc: "Until Russia is reunified, the state of emergency must remain in place. To this end, we will enact a new constitution, one that holds true to the values of national reconstruction and anti-extremism. If that means putting a limit on freedoms and individual rights for now, so be it. Our republic has to be protected from the radicals who wish to destroy it, no matter what!"
 KOM_stalina_faith_in_democracy_desc: "The state of emergency must end, the government cannot maintain a republic with no elections. We cannot call ourselves a democracy if we do not even follow basic democratic principles! This means - come the end of Stalina's lawful term, elections will be called, and the republic will choose between a new president and Stalina.\n\nEnding the state of emergency will also give the people of the republic more rights and freedoms. Allowing the people to exercise these rights will be the first big test of our remade democracy under Stalina. Hopefully, we will not relive the past."

 KOM_stalina_freedom_sovereignty_patriotism_desc: "Svoboda, Suverenitet, i Patriotizm - the motto of the Sovereign Democratic Party. We are the party of strength. We are the party of sovereignty. We are the party that fights for all of the people. And most of all, we are the party for a strong Russia that works for all of its citizens. The people know our platform, and have given us a broad mandate to carry it out. Let us not disappoint them by going back on our promises."
 KOM_stalina_a_democratic_centre_desc: "The PSD stands for many things. For freedom and democracy, sure. But for moderation above all. The people of Russia do not need radical and extreme solutions for their problems. Demagogues have destroyed their country, and they do not wish for another one. They want sensible and reasonable solutions that don't affect their lives any more than necessary. The PSD is at the center of politics, and abhors extremism in all forms. Democracy and moderation is our guiding principle. And we will draw a hard line against anyone who goes against it."
 KOM_stalina_survey_republic_elections_desc: "Russia is a land of many peoples and ethnicities. Many minorities have a degree of independence, allowing them to have their own republics and elections. We must ensure they retain their autonomy. And part of that is eliminating any corrupting outside influence in these republics.\n\nSmaller units of organization have had issues with election fraud for a long time. No longer will this be tolerated. We will begin keeping a closer eye on these elections, and how they are carried out. Then we can be assured these peoples are truly picking their own destinies."
 KOM_stalina_centralize_election_administration_desc: "Free and fair elections must be ensured throughout our republic. And that means fraud cannot be tolerated. We will establish a non-partisan agency, tasked with rooting out and eliminating election fraud and corruption. Election administration will be placed under federal control, although we will make exceptions for local elections in minority republics. Vote-rigging and other such actions are a threat to the very legitimacy of our democracy. And it will be eliminated."
 KOM_stalina_no_room_for_corruption_desc: "Russia has gotten a reputation as a place where an elite political class can live off of the wealth squeezed out of the suffering peasants. So it was in the days of the tsars, when rich aristocrats would live in sumptuous mansions surrounded by the grass and mud huts of the serfs. And so it was in the days of the Soviet Union, when party members would race to their dachas in handbuilt limousines, passing the horse-carriages of the Proletariat. No longer! Corruption will be eliminated in Russia. Massive fines await those who seek to use their positions to profit from the people. And there will be no exceptions or tolerance at all."
 KOM_stalina_the_paramount_civic_duty_desc: "Any Republic is only as good as the people it represents. Too often, people of other nations have allowed others to do the deciding for them, rather than face their issues head on. The results have been disastrous every time. We will not let that happen here. Voting is key to our democracy, and so is actually running for positions as well. Local elections and referenda are highly important, no less so than national ones. If the people understand this, and act on it, we will secure our democracy for a long time to come."
 KOM_stalina_the_new_russian_century_desc: "Tsushima and the Treaty of Portsmouth. Tannenberg and Brest-Litovsk. Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. Russia has been the victim of disastrous defeats and destruction at the hands of foreign powers.But we refuse to let that continue. No longer will the 20th century be known as Russia's century of humiliation. Because with the new republic, Russia once again rises to prominence on the world stage! We shall finally be strong once more, and we shall make this new century into a Russian century - a century with Russia claiming its position as a world power."
 KOM_stalina_accept_the_big_tent_model_desc: "The PSD has been a "big-tent" party for the entire span of its existence, accepting a wide variety of policy positions, ideologies, and approaches towards getting things done within its membership. This unique structure has been instrumental in bringing us to power - it ensures that the entirety of the acceptable political spectrum is represented within our party. To work with other parties, therefore, is unnecessary. If the opposition wishes to achieve positions of power within the Republic, it will be through PSD institutions. There are plenty of opportunities to side with our party - to not accede to them is simply the choice of the opposition to weaken themselves."
 KOM_stalina_justice_before_compromise_desc: "We won't work across the aisle, and why should we? Who wants to water down our necessary laws and policies, just for the sake of patting ourselves on the back that we worked with a few minority parties? It is unnecessary, as we have the strength to get things done by ourselves, without the consultation of the other parties. Moreover, the people explicitly elected us to do these things, not any other party. They wanted a strictly PSD term, and they got it. And we will not deliver anything less than what we promised."
 KOM_stalina_the_oppositions_finest_desc: "Many other opposition parties exist in Russia who will never cooperate with us. Their individual members, however, are another matter. Many opposition members exist who agree with us on at least one issue. Sometimes, more than one. We can try to use that support to help get our bills and reforms passed. Working across the aisles is much easier than just trying to force things through on our own."
 KOM_stalina_roots_for_healthy_competition_desc: "Sure, crushing our opposition into the ground with a massive monolithic organization is tempting, but we have more noble goals in mind. Democracy is not one group of people steamrolling the other. It is a group of people of differing perspectives and beliefs coming together to solve their problems. Thus, working with other parties is essential. Merely consolidating our own power at all costs will lead to a single-party state, just like in the Soviet Union."
 KOM_stalina_towards_a_sovereign_future_desc: "It is time for the signature policy of the PSD to be unveiled. The National Sovereignty Act will change our diplomatic position forevermore. Strategic resources in Russia, such as oil, will be severely restricted from the international market. But this is not a protectionist act, or one aimed at autarky. These limitations will be lifted for those with defensive ties with our Republic. If one wishes to gain access to our bountiful resources, one must make an arrangement with us to assist our military development. And everybody wants these strategic materials."
 KOM_stalina_right_the_pasts_wrongs_desc: "Any objective view of Russia's long history will find many shameful acts and practices. The rampant discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The rampant misogyny towards women. And poor treatment of the disabled. And we say "enough!"\n\nWe shall move forward with a socially egalitarian agenda. Our crusade will end and outlaw these practices, and ensure equal treatment under the law. For aren't we all Russians? And aren't Russians guaranteed rights?"
 KOM_stalina_campaign_against_discrimination_desc: "For too long, the pogoms and other acts of discrimination have kept Russia as a backward state from the middle ages. Even worse, horrific acts of religious persecution still occur in Russia at this very moment, in our supposedly enlightened time. This will stop immediately. We will grant legal mechanisms and rules for Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities to defend and protect themselves. We will combat pervasive religious hatred with the full force of the law."
 KOM_stalina_charter_of_universal_rights_desc: "It's not enough to pass a few rules granting citizens legal rights. We must also codify it into our constitution. The great democracies of the world have unassailable provisions that protect their people, and so will we. And thus, we bring forth an Equal Rights Amendment. Modeled after the Bill of Rights in America, we will make being an egalitarian nation that grants everyone equal rights a permanent feature of Russia. And that is going to be hard for any would-be authoritarian to roll back."
 KOM_stalina_decommunization_and_dewarlordization_desc: "Symbols may seem just symbols at first, sure. But to many people, who have suffered under the tyrants of Russia, they are extremely hurtful and terrifying reminders of times we wish to move beyond. And that any political party, no matter how small, will gleefully use these symbols to identify themselves with the monsters of the past is disgusting.\n\nProminent symbols of the communist regime and certain warlords will be banned, except for art and historical purposes. These legacies have no place in modern Russia. And if the people that march under them can't find something new, maybe it's a sign their beliefs should be left in the past as well."
 KOM_stalina_a_united_russia_desc: "Russia is still geographically torn asunder. By other warlords in the east. And by the Germans in the west. But though we may not be united in a territorial sense, we are united in a much bigger one. For all Russians are united in spirit. And we are a state that shows this unity more than any other. We march united, and committed. For a Russia united by equality. And a Russia united by a strong national identity. That unity and commitment towards this Russia will see us through till the end."
 KOM_stalina_a_shining_precedent_desc: "We have done it. People doubted that the PSD would exercise its authority in a peaceful, constructive, and democratic manner. But we have. Our agenda has been enacted entirely within the confines of the law, and with no extraordinary measures taken. And the will of the people has been respected, to boot. This is a glorious victory for democracy, showing that great change can be accomplished within the system. Let us hope this convinces the population that our system is sustainable and strong as well."
 KOM_stalina_honor_the_republics_heroes_desc: "Due to our history as a unifier of western Russia, our Republic is a Republic of heroes. Innumerable men and women fought to make our Republic whole and put down the tyrannical extremists and warlords that once blighted Russia from Arkhangelsk to Samara. After such service to our Republic, we, too, deserve to provide a service to our veterans and heroic soldiers. Veterans of the West Russian War and Unification Wars shall be taken care of, provided with a generous stipident as a reward for their service.\n\nAdditionally, this action presents a wonderful opportunity for the image of our party. Regardless of one's alignment within the PSD, all of our Deputies and regional politicians can at least agree on the fact that Russia's heroes deserve recognition. Let us assist them, and in doing so, assist the longevity of our party's administration."
 KOM_stalina_emphasize_shared_identity_desc: "Regardless of our heritage, be we Great Russian, Tatar, Jewish, German, or Ukrainian, we are all united in our participation within our democracy, and our residence within the Republic. Whilst the politicians of the left and right may call out to silence peoples solely for their faith or ethnicities, we have the position above all of them, atop the pinnacle of democracy. Our policy regardign ethnicity, thusly, shall focus on the fact that all of us are citizens of the Republic - participants in the grand democratic experiment that has already liberated so much of our Motherland.\n\nWe may call ourselves Great Russians, or Tatars, or Ukrainians - but, in heart, we are all equal in patriotic humanity."
 KOM_stalina_redeeming_our_history_desc: "The streets of the Republic were no longer a battleground for feuding radicals, nor were political assassinations a viable way to mark the passing of the days. The leadership of Svetlana Stalina had cleaned up the behaviour of the people, but it could not wipe away their opinions. The debate of how the history of our Republic should be discussed has become a contentious subject in the halls of legislature, with many calling for a focus on the "Glory of Russia". They say that leftism and division has diluted the common identity of the Russian people, and desire for that to be rectified. The Left has mobilised their political capital against this, but it's the Right who holds the keys to power that are needed for the unification of Russia."

 KOM_authdem_the_russian_economy_desc: "After over a decade of German terror bombing and the chronic insecurity caused by the raids of rival warlords, economic activity in our corner of Russia is on life support. Now that the government is stable and we have control over our own borders, resuscitating the economy will be a priority for the new government."
 KOM_authdem_development_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "Our state exists in a dangerous neighborhood, with the Germans to the west and a motley collection of pretender states to the east. While private enterprise and free competition will continue to be encouraged within the Republic, we don't have the luxury of waiting for economic development from the bottom up. Modernity will come to Russia under the leadership of the PSD and the strong guidance of state-owned enterprises in crucial sectors, complementing its private companies. We have no other choice, even if it means that there will be sacrifices asked of the people and the workers along the way."
 KOM_authdem_prioritize_state_development_desc: "Getting the economy off the ground is a herculean task in any developing country, even more so in an economy like Russia's, reeling from years of conflict. The PSD has decided that the state must utilize its coffers and manpower to jumpstart the new economy by establishing state-owned enterprises to develop critical sectors of the economy and to advance key infrastructure projects throughout the Republic. Some would call this inefficient, arguing that the state would run these projects at a loss - we answer that nobody else is willing to lay the foundations of a modern economy, and unless they have a better idea, they can stay out of the way!"
 KOM_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_desc: "To say the least, Russia is starved of capital. Its productive capacity has been funneled into interminable warfare, and the turbulent political situation has naturally made potential investors extremely cautious to risk putting their funds in enterprises that could easily go bust. Building wealth inside the country takes time that we simply do not have. Attracting investment from outside, on the other hand, is significantly easier.\n\nThe international business community craves new markets, and Russia with its large population and abundant natural resources has a great, untapped potential for profit. Foreign companies can expect low taxes and many potential customers, but they must remember one thing: Russia is a sovereign nation, and they are only there as guests."
 KOM_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_tt: "This may be seen by our §gbase§! as a §Rbetrayal of our principles§!."
 KOM_authdem_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc: "The territory of Russia is rich in natural resources - oil, minerals, and crops. Too often, however, these resources are used as a means of personal enrichment for the various warlords, without a care for the development of a modern economy. Now that the Republic is exerting control over a growing swath of Russian territory, we should establish a government agency to take stock of the bounties of Russian soil and to ensure that they are directed for the good of the state and its people."
 KOM_authdem_consolidate_the_defense_industry_desc: "If the Republic wants to take the fight to the other pretender states in the East - and, eventually, against the Germans in the West - it is essential that we have a defense industry capable of supplying the vast quantities of equipment our new model military will require. This cannot be done through small enterprises and cottage industries: we must think larger, consolidating our various arms manufacturers to unlock the economies of scale necessary for our growing Republic. Through partial nationalization and state-guided mergers, the PSD government will ensure that our soldiers will never want for bullets or quality equipment."
 KOM_authdem_roads_across_russia_desc: "A nation without infrastructure is a nation in name only. Bereft of the connections that allow for commerce and travel, the country is divided, the people's concerns solely local. Russia was once far more connected than it is now; years of bombing and warlordism have caused a retreat, as citizens refuse to stray further from their immediate places of residence. Although there have been minor improvements as local governments build for their own purposes, much of the country remains far behind the Soviet era in this regard.\n\nIf Russia is to reemerge onto the world stage, the Republic needs to forcibly tackle this crisis. The revitalization of our road infrastructure will allow commerce to expand and fuel economic growth, as well as incalculably improving the lot of ordinary people through the expansion of work opportunities."
 KOM_authdem_an_economy_for_us_all_desc: "As economic improvement takes Russia into the modern age, we must be careful to avoid the concentration of increased material wealth into too few hands. The economy is growing particularly in urban areas, with the potential of leaving rural localities behind, and businesses often invest so much in improving physical capital and managerial salaries that they leave nothing for their citizens. As all of the veterans of Syktyvkar's turbulent political scene know, inequality causes resentment, which can and frequently does lead to political instability.\n\nKeeping wealth from becoming excessively concentrated naturally requires government action. Welfare programs, stringent regulations, and taxation on unscrupulous businesses should keep inequality in check, ensuring that Russia's prosperity is truly enjoyed by all."
 KOM_authdem_aid_for_the_agricultural_sector_desc: "Cut off from the outside world by constant turmoil, Russia's farmers have suffered long, difficult years. Between a general lack of feed, modern equipment, infrastructure, and customers, the agricultural sector has been squeezed from all sides. Without a steady influx of food from a strong farming base, building up a country is impossible. It is for this reason that agricultural aid is a necessity for economic improvement.\n\nThrough extensive subsidies, loans, and other forms of financial assistance, the government can revitalize the Russian agricultural sector, and not soon enough; as our growing cities teem with hungry mouths to feed, we need as much food as we can get."
 KOM_authdem_national_recovery_initiatives_desc: "The PSD has great plans for the rejuvenation of the Russian nation and people, but none of that will come to fruition without mobilizing the people for the cause. The government will establish sweeping programs for public works, industrialization, and defense construction to enlist the people in the project of rebuilding the Republic. Where private enterprise shies away, the people will step in, and the government will reward them for their labor."
 KOM_authdem_expand_rural_opportunities_desc: "A key characteristic of 'modern' society is the productivity of its agricultural sector, with machines doing the work of a hundred field hands in half the time. This is not to say that we disparage the work of the honest farmer; far from it! Most Russian farmers live hand-to-mouth, with antiquated tools and outdated machinery forcing a reliance on manual labor - oftentimes their own children, the future of our nation. We must invest in the means of agricultural production, subsidizing access to new technologies and labor-saving contraptions to improve productivity, ensure farming profitability, and give hope to farmers that they are working towards a brighter future."
 KOM_authdem_stimulate_local_businesses_desc: "While our detractors often charge that the PSD cares little for private industry in favor of a state-owned economy, nothing could be further from the truth. We recognize that we are not infallible or all-knowing. Private enterprise will always be more effective at identifying and meeting economic needs at the local level, far removed from the specific needs of the state in defense, infrastructure, and natural resources. We do not seek to control every aspect of economic life in the Republic; indeed, we encourage the people to embrace the spirit of competition, to have a vested interest in their own prosperity. In this regard, all the state should do is create incentives for the Republic's entrepreneurs to invest in the economy, and to provide access to capital for those who seek to start a business of their own."
 KOM_authdem_an_educated_populace_desc: "Every section of Russian society has been impacted by the long war, but none more cruelly so than its children. The new generation knows nothing other than poverty, danger, and upheaval. Even such a simple luxury as an education like their parents had is unattainable. The decline in educational levels is a slow-moving crisis that, if it goes unsolved, will cause a serious shortage of skilled workers in the years to come.\n\nBuilding, funding, and improving schools across the Republic is both the ethical and economical solution. It fulfills national development goals while increasing opportunities for millions. Nothing will signify Russia's slow but sure return to normality more than the masses of children filling classrooms for the first time in a generation."
 KOM_authdem_standardize_the_schools_desc: "As we embark on our mission to improve education, one sore issue sticks out immediately: curricula and educational standards vary enormously between schools across the Republic, as distance, inequality of resources, and a lack of communication between localities drive them further apart. Schools that do not adequately educate their students are scarcely better than schools at all, and the potential is great for a wide skill gap to develop between various regions of the country.\n\nMany of these problems stem from the lack of a widely penetrating central bureaucracy. The government can do a far better job at setting and enforcing standards than the disparate array of local educational arrangements that exist currently, and it must if the Republic's less advantaged children are to get a better lot in life."
 KOM_authdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc: "Rebuilding a country is the tireless endeavour of an enormous number of skilled workers, engineers chief among them. Without them, it would be impossible to erect bridges, lay down vast lengths of road, design military vehicles, or perform any other of the staggering variety of tasks necessary to keep a society running. However, engineers are of short supply in Russia, owing to a general diminishment in educational capacity, and there are far too few to satisfy the exponentially growing demand.\n\nIncreasing attendance in engineering programs is not just a matter of economics: it is a matter of national security. Through subsidies to private schools and the establishment of new public technical schools, the government can encourage the formation of a new generation of bright young engineers who will take their country to tremendous heights."

 KOM_kosygin_springtime_in_russia_desc: "The people of the Republic have spoken; SMR, standing for liberty, economic freedom and a government of common sense, has been elected. Our mandate has been given to us freely and fairly through majority, rather than through the shady politicking of the old Komi Republic.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated President Kosygin has announced his intention to move ahead at once. Now that we no longer have to worry about the threat of paramilitaries, the business of governance can be carried out as it would be in any modern democracy. The long winter of discontent has ended, and freedom blooms anew from the soil of the Motherland."
 KOM_kosygin_a_platform_for_democracy_desc: "The cornerstone of democratic success is majority rule. Though both reactionaries and far-left vanguardists deride this idea as 'mob rule', there is no more clear a survey of the people's desires than a free and open election. If a majority freely supports us, then the radicals have no grounds for their claims of 'elitism' so often lobbed at liberal democrats.\n\nThat the majority of voters reside in urban areas, the core support bases for liberal ideals, is irrelevant. Our popularity is perfectly natural, and we need no dirty tricks to explain our success. The notion that the votes of our support base are inherently of low value due to their sheer numbers is mere jealousy on the part of labor and conservative politicians."
 KOM_kosygin_freedom_and_fairness_desc: "Though we always tried our best, the Komi Republic was never able to do right by its minorities. Even the eponymous Komi were often systematically denied a voice by racist elements of the Assembly. Now that western Russia is under our banner, we have entire republics of non-Russians!\n\nWe are happy to have our brother peoples living and working alongside us, but their republics are much younger and more fragile than ours. Unsavory types, such as Voznesensky, have a vested interest in suppressing their voters, and that's to say nothing of what radicals might get up to. President Kosygin has thus pledged to help build democratic institutions and carry out surveys of the minority republics, so that the interests of all citizens are fairly represented."
 KOM_kosygin_survey_republic_elections_desc: "When even a single voter is denied their fundamental rights, democracy suffers. It might not seem so at the time, but every step away from guaranteed universal suffrage is a step towards totalitarianism. For a proper democracy, this will not do.\n\nEveryone, from the most hard-done-by farmer to the wealthiest urbanite, is of equal value in the democratic process. Neither the elitism of the far-right nor the rabid classism of the far-left will benefit our republic. One citizen, one vote. With anything less, could we truly call ourselves a democracy?"
 KOM_kosygin_learn_from_past_mistakes_desc: "In truth, the Russia that we have begun to build here in the west is not the same nation extinguished by the Germans two decades ago. Nor is it the Provisional Republic, or the Empire. Our republic is something different; an entirely new nation, born amidst the graves of its parents.\n\nAppropriately, our vision for Russia must be forward-thinking and idealistic. Past Russian states had their virtues, but all ultimately failed for a single reason: they refused to change. There was always some rigid ideological line to toe, some utopian obligation that could never be fulfilled. Our republic will not make the same mistakes. We are trying something new, focusing on the practical needs of the present rather than a future that exists only in the dreams of ideologues, or a past that led Russia to destruction several times over."
 KOM_kosygin_towards_a_shining_future_desc: "It's never easy to move on. Russia has much to be proud of in its past, but there is just as much about our history that is sordid and shameful. There was always someone waiting in the wings to lead us astray, away from the path that would have best served the people. Russia has been disappointed by its leaders, time and time again. They always wanted the same thing: a Russia that was the overlord of Eurasia, tolerated no dissent and was feared by all the world.\n\nIt never worked. Fear always gave way to hate, dissent could never be silenced, and our neighbours never had cause to trust us. It's time to put away the dark dreams of Russia-that-was; time to embrace the future of freedom and peace that was denied her for so, so long."
 KOM_kosygin_a_platform_for_unity_desc: "The foundation of a successful democracy is cooperation. While it might be nice to imagine everyone sharing our ideals, that isn't how people work. The diversity of race, creed and class is mirrored in the diversity of thought within the minds of our citizens. The myopic approach of the Bolsheviks, assuming that everyone can be swayed to their 'perfect' ideology, must be dispensed with for the Republic to remain strong and free.\n\nTo demonstrate our good intentions, we shall enter into an alliance with one of the other major parties in the Assembly. Both command substantial support from the populace, and their support would strengthen our mandate. The question is: which? Which party will best suit our purposes: the rural, social-democratic PSD, or the labor-based democratic socialists of the DSNP?"
 KOM_kosygin_the_violet_platform_desc: "Despite being marred by Voznesensky's legacy, the DSNP still commands the respect and support of urban working-class voters. Though more directly inclined towards socialism than ourselves, they are just as committed as we are to democracy. Working with them will show the urban working class that we are still dedicated to advancing the interests of the proletariat, even if our take on socialism isn't quite what they might like.\n\nInformally dubbed the 'Violet Platform', our alliance will be based on a promise to more actively pursue socialism. The more rightist elements of SMR will not be pleased, but they'll come around eventually. We are still ultimately socialists, after all; it makes sense for us to join with the party that shares our end goals, even if our means differ."
 KOM_kosygin_for_the_worker_desc: "Hardline, anti-democratic socialists never understood what the working class really needed. All that talk of theory and uncompromising ideology... what good did it ever do the men and women who make a living on factory floors? A worker can't feed their family with populist ideals and workplace lectures!\n\nBoth SMR and the DSNP understand what the workers really want: a safe, productive work environment, one without harsh conditions or threats to life and limb. Better pay, better hours and better safety regulations will lead to healthier and more efficient workplaces. We will show the workers that one doesn't need to be a rabble-rousing demagogue to have their best interests at heart."
 KOM_kosygin_the_sovereign_coalition_desc: "The PSD has little in common with SMR; while they are ardently anti-communist, we remain committed to socialism. They find support amongst the rural populace and conservatives, while we appeal to urbane and progressive voters. Nevertheless, they are more trustworthy than the perpetually corrupt DSNP, and desire a strong Russia as much as we do.\n\nWe can work with these 'sovereignists'. Their policies of patriotism and Russian self-sufficiency might need to be tempered by cooler heads, but those aren't insurmountable obstacles. Some of their ideas have much to recommend about them; we will need a strong military to face Germany, and a certain measure of economic independence would protect us from negative economic developments around the world."
 KOM_kosygin_for_the_people_desc: "Understandably, SMR is generally leery of the military. It has often served as fertile ground for radicalism of both left- and right-wing varieties. Involving armed men in politics never ends well. That said, the PSD is correct in its assessment that Russia needs a stronger military to defend itself.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, we will show that we are willing to set aside our prejudices and experiment with the ideas of fellow democrats. Progressivism and pragmatism are not inherently in conflict with one another, and our technocratic ideas might find some appeal amongst high command. With the PSD's backing, we will begin a review into how we can improve the technological capabilities of the military and maintain its professional standards."
 KOM_kosygin_a_show_of_cooperation_desc: "Even if it's not a formal coalition government, we have shown our commitment to democracy by cooperating with another political party. Some of our hardliners are yet to stop sulking and publicly give their blessing to this endeavour, but that doesn't matter. This exercise in goodwill has been a resounding success - none can question that fact.\n\nSome critics have derided both parties involved, dismissing the joint effort as a token gesture. They don't understand that democracy is more complicated than they make it out to be. There are always negotiations to undertake, compromises to be made. Yes, the fascists and communists might not have to worry about petty disagreements - but our freedom and happiness is more than worth that trifling cost."
 KOM_kosygin_a_platform_for_reform_desc: "'Russia' and 'reform' are, sadly, two words that have never gone well together. Historically, reform has been hated both for going too far and for not going far enough. Foreigners have often observed that most Russians would rather indulge in murder than allow peaceful reform to occur under any circumstances.\n\nWe must agree somewhat. Reform is all about compromise and gradual change; it offends both ends of the political spectrum and provides a ready target for rabble-rousers. Nevertheless, we must press forth in line with our principles. The people have shown their maturity and commitment to reform by electing SMR - we must not disappoint them. Cultural and social reform are both on the table and ready to be presented to the Assembly."
 KOM_kosygin_assist_the_republics_desc: "Neither the Empire nor the Bolsheviks ever showed much interest in improving the nation as a whole. For them, Russia only needed investment in a few key areas, usually whatever was relevant to the latest propagandized attempt to play catch-up with the West. The notion of wide-reaching progress was entirely lost on them.\n\nTo correct our course and become a truly modern state, we must take a more holistic approach to national wellbeing. We are not a top-down state ruling by decree, but a union of free and equal republics. None of our constituent republics, no matter their history or demographics, deserve to be left behind. So, the programs of modernization and urbanization employed in our heartlands will be shared with all our brother republics. The entire Russian family will be united in prosperity!"
 KOM_kosygin_cultural_exhibits_desc: "Russia is home to more than just Russians. Dozens of ethno-cultural groups make up our great nation, though the Russian supremacist attitudes of past governments have diminished that fact in the world's eyes. Even many Russian Slavs, steeped in their own culture, refuse to accept the diversity of our nation.\n\nTo protect the heritage of our many peoples, President Kosygin has proposed the establishment of the All-Russian Heritage Committee. Comprised of representatives from each republic, the ARHC will direct funding for museums, festivals, artwork commissions and so forth. When the world thinks 'Russian culture', they should think of more than just icons and domed churches."
 KOM_kosygin_protect_natural_beauty_desc: "The Motherland has not been treated well by her children. The Tsars might have been incompetent in economic matters, but at least they were incapable of ruining the countryside. The Bolsheviks, obsessed with rapid industrialization and maximizing economic output, were a different story. The failures of Bukharin's initiatives litter the Russian landscape; open-faced mines carved into hillsides, forests of smokestacks spewing soot skyward, rivers clogged with industrial runoff...\n\nIt's a sad sight, and one that no progressive nation should tolerate. If such practices continue, how long will it be until all of Russia looks like Kaukasien? Proper protections should be established before we progress any further with our industrialization and urbanization programs. Though industrialists and state industries alike will balk at stifling of their expansion, it is a measure necessary for future generations to enjoy Russia as it should be."
 KOM_kosygin_uplift_minority_rights_desc: "Russia's national character is unfortunately tainted by its tendency towards chauvinism and homogeneity. Minorities of all stripes have been mistreated for centuries; first by royalty, then by revolutionaries. It seems that without intervention, Russia is doomed to remain stuck in its backwards, hateful ways.\n\nWe can't get rid of racism overnight, but we can make some important first steps. First, and most importantly: racial discrimination and hate speech must be outlawed, so that everyone can live lives free of fear. Second: the autonomy of minority republics must be permanently enshrined in the constitution. That is the only way to guarantee that a chauvinist government will never again trample on the rights of minorities."
 KOM_kosygin_the_march_of_progress_desc: "Progress has never been a popular idea in Russia. It has always been affiliated with the things that many people dislike: change, diversity, foreign influence. People fear what they don't understand - and the Russian people are particularly short on understanding.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. People can learn, change their ways, open their minds; but it cannot be forced upon them. That is what traditional socialists always failed to understand. Some measure of top-down change is necessary, but the transformation of society they sought could never be forced upon an unwilling populace. Perhaps it will take a century to achieve our ideal. Maybe more. But no matter what comes, no matter what future generations choose, we have done the right thing, and given hope to a generation born with none of it."
 
 KOM_socdem_the_russian_economy_desc: "The current economy is in a terribly bad shape. Much of what we once had was ravaged by German bombings twenty years ago, and the rest was destroyed by the Russian warlords before us. We will have to start a long recovery process if we are ever going to reestablish Russia as a dominant Socialist nation. Thankfully, our economic advisers are already formulating a plan to get us back on track."
 KOM_socdem_public_sector_investments_desc: "The public sector of any economy includes infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, public education, and other important services. Through this sector, we handle the essential services that every citizen in the Komi Republic may use (provided they pay taxes). Arguably, the public sector benefits everyone, and it is why we should put an emphasis on this part of the economy."
 KOM_socdem_lessons_from_the_reds_desc: "Several of our economic advisors believe that Lenin was once going in the right direction when he issued the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy in the 1920s. The Bukharinists shared the same ideas regarding a private sector-based development that would feed into a strong state-driven economy. Today, in the [ROOT.Getname], we have decided to try the 'capitalist turning into socialist' economic strategy and see how well it works. It could be that the Reds were correct in which policies work best for Russia."
 KOM_socdem_our_own_gosplan_desc: "When the Russian worker state was first established in 1921, the Soviets developed a Gosplan to handle the central economic planning of the young nation. The agency would maintain the Soviet economy until the Union's collapse in the face of Nazi Germany. We must develop our own Gosplan-esque agency to grow the young Republican economy. It must have the authority to coordinate both the state industrial development and our public works projects."
 KOM_socdem_rights_for_the_worker_desc: "We have seen throughout history the oppression that everyday workers faced. From Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages-style serfdom to the grueling Industrial Revolution, common workers were just tools that were exploited by the middle and high classes. The Komi Republic has no need for this type of ruthless exploitation; workers' rights were an essential part of the DSNP's campaign, and they will remain our highest priority. When we develop and enforce our policies, we put the workers above everyone else, as they are the collective Atlas that holds this Earth in place."
 KOM_socdem_the_national_resource_directorate_desc: "Here in Komi we have an abundance of different natural resources, but we cannot afford to use up all of them carelessly. We must develop an agency, the National Resource Directorate, to keep track of our natural resource supply and monitor its use. We can ensure that the resources will only be used to enrich the state and if they cannot be used, they will be carefully preserved."
 KOM_socdem_expand_the_key_facilities_desc: "Our large industrial facilities are precious to us; they often provide all of the manufacturing necessary to keep our economy running and our citizens working. We must work on expanding the large facilities we currently have, especially the industry in Izhevsk and Gorky. With improved factories and more jobs for our workers, our economy will certainly be strengthened."
 KOM_socdem_the_public_works_boom_desc: "Our careful policies have transformed a weakened economy into a quickly-developing one, with a strong base for additional improvement. It is safe to say that our economy is now one of Russia's finest, and it is all thanks to our public spending and infrastructure building. We must remember to thank our patriotic workers who have allowed us to establish this great socialist society, and it is through their craft that we are able to live prosperous lives in the [KOM.GetName]."
 KOM_socdem_private_sector_supplements_desc: "Our plan for a total economic recovery starts with developing a private sector so that our people can actively run businesses and generate a profit. Right now, we need an economic system that can work for the individual citizens of our country. If the private sector plan succeeds, we will have a stronger economic base that can transition smoothly into the socialist state we desire. The development towards socialism begins with a capitalist base, after all."
 KOM_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc: "One method we can use to spark our economy is inviting foreign enterprises into our country and permitting them to build factories. These factories will generate a profit for us and a profit for our network of partner companies. All we have to do is reach out to some of these large businesses and convince them to bring their manufacturing plants to Russia."
 KOM_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc_tt: "The §gPSD§!'s support base will §Roppose this measure§!."
 KOM_socdem_stimulate_local_economies_desc: "This economic plan requires the people to be the main source of income for the country. We can give jobs to our citizens by creating local building projects across the Republic, boosting the smaller economies. Once we raise the national standard of living and disperse wealth throughout, our socialist system will be able to manifest under our guiding hand."
 KOM_socdem_regulations_against_exploitation_desc: "When the general public is given power, it is our responsibility to ensure everyone is safe. Ever since we created the private sector, many privately-owned businesses have spawned, each with their own unique treatment of workers. More often than not, these businesses abuse the workers for their own corrupt personal gain, and it is time we put a stop to this cruelty. We must create nationwide safety regulations to ensure our workers are not exploited, and any private business that fails to adopt these regulations will be punished severely."
 KOM_socdem_an_educated_populace_desc: "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 KOM_socdem_standardize_the_schools_desc: "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 KOM_socdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc: "Russia has been destroyed by countless years of war and bombings. To rebuild it, we will need more engineers than ever before. Civil Engineers from all across the nation must be called to serve in new, large projects of building bridges, railways, and roads. Cities must be improved to support the health of the people and ensure services are met.\n\nUnfortunately, the current amount of engineers just won't cut it. If we want more engineers, we must teach more engineers. Universities will be persuaded to hold even more classes in Civil Engineering as well as helping bring additional people into the field. Soon, Russian cities will look even better than they did before all the bombings! "

 KOM_kosygin_the_russian_economy_desc: "There is nothing much to recommend about the Russian economy, such as it is. We have plenty of natural resources and a large population, but lack the means to take advantage of them. What little industry we inherited from the Soviets is variously outdated, run-down or just plain broken. That's to say nothing of our complete lack of international trade, a staple of modern economics.\n\nThankfully, President Kosygin is an old hand at this sort of thing and knows just the people to help draft a plan for the new economy. It won't be easy; even the fundamentals of our economy are lacking and many crucial sectors are non-existent. We're starting from nothing - but perhaps that will be for the best. Better to be free of old burdens entirely than bear their expenses."
 KOM_kosygin_establish_the_economic_zones_desc: "The finer details of economic recovery are for aspiring entrepreneurs and workers to manage. Free enterprise will take care of the groundwork. The state's role, meanwhile, must be to direct development in the most efficient direction possible.\n\nTo that end, our territory will be divided up into economic zones: regions where the economy will be organized by the government along the necessary lines. This way, we can avoid situations where prime agricultural land is given over to industry, or areas rich in resources are allocated to farmers."
 KOM_kosygin_the_contract_responsiblity_system_desc: "Every past Russian government has attempted to achieve agricultural efficiency, but none ever met with success. The feudal nature of the Empire meant that any proposed reform would have to wrangle the indolent, greedy landowners. The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, cared more about having an ideologically acceptable system than a fair or functioning one. This has made famine a recurring and severe threat to our people.\n\nThe 'Contract Responsibility System' will ensure a stable food supply and good income for rural populations by giving parcels of land to groups of farmers. This will minimize competition over land. Additionally, we will accept taxation in grain and subsidize their other crops."
 KOM_kosygin_aid_for_the_farmers_desc: "The current generation of Russian farmers have been building up their livelihoods from nothing. Mechanization was never a priority for the Bolsheviks, and the short-lived war economy only made their situation worse. Most farmers still work the land in the same manner as countless generations of peasants did.\n\nTo feed a growing population, our agricultural capacity needs to catch up with the modern world. For that to happen, every farmer will need the tools and equipment to match his American or Japanese counterpart. Though some economics chafe at the thought, we will have to instate massive discounts to make this possible - not an easy solution, but a smart one in the long-term."
 KOM_kosygin_open_the_republic_desc: "Russia is a land of bounty, but it doesn't have everything we need. More specifically: it doesn't have capital. Most of what little wealth exists is in the hands of governments, bar a few particularly miserly individuals. With our nation in the state it's in now, there is only one place for us to turn.\n\nForeign capital must flow into the country. With it will come knowledge, innovation and technology. All three will improve our economy with alacrity, given the disparity in development. It will be a long time before we can break through the glass ceiling and into the upper echelon of global economic powers, but catching up will suffice for now."
 KOM_kosygin_the_developmental_industry_sector_desc: "Naturally, industrialization will be a priority for us. The great nations of the world moved on from agrarianism decades if not centuries ago. Attempts were made by past governments, but the scale of industry found in Germany or Britain was never replicated here.\n\nBy offering to establish production facilities catering to foreign markets, we can become a workshop of the world. Given the less developed state of Russia, goods can be produced here at low cost compared to, for example, the United States. Basic goods from Russia exported en masse might not be glamorous, but if it works, it works."
 KOM_kosygin_exploit_southern_oil_reserves_desc: "Oil is the lifeblood of nations and the foundation of many economies. Our reserves might not be as vast as those of Venezuela or the Arab nations, but we have plenty to fuel our own economic growth. We have enough, in fact, that exports are a viable option. No doubt some nations will be grateful to have a source that isn't in the pocket of an existing superpower.\n\nReserves already exist in Samara, the Urals and Tatarstan - a decent start, but we will need to drill deeper to find enough for a prospering oil industry. Expansion of existing facilities is a given; we can also look into more opportunities as we expand into Siberia. Just beyond our borders, there could be enough oil to make us a top competitor in the energy business!"
 KOM_kosygin_comprehensive_refinement_program_desc: "Exporting crude oil is good business, but it could be better. Because it's refined overseas, we're missing out on a large portion of the profits from the finished product. It would be a lot more profitable to refine our oil here in Russia before exporting a usable product. We might sell a little less, but the overall profits will be much higher.\n\nWith those increased profits, we can follow the lead of the Arabs and begin massive investment programs to bring our nation into the modern era. It's a seller's market, and we're selling at very affordable prices. Black gold will succeed where real gold cannot, and with it we will buy our way to the future."
 KOM_kosygin_foreign_investment_incentives_desc: "Some ardently patriotic types argue against it, but one cannot deny the efficacy of foreign investment. Granted, it tends to be the government rather than the citizens who benefit financially - but does that really matter right now? We should take any opportunity to further our economic growth, no matter whether it offends the ideologues and a few proud politicians.\n\nLabor incentives and tax breaks are all one usually needs to get foreign investors interested. We will offer both to corporations who open branch offices in Western Russia, as well as those who partner with Russian companies. It worked for the rest of the world; it can work for us, too!"
 KOM_kosygin_project_kibersin_desc: "The field of computing has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. Our resident computer scientists were stunned to learn what kind of advances have been made by the great powers. There has even been some discussion of the possibility that computers will be used in virtually every profession in a few decades!\n\nPresident Kosygin is most interested, and has gathered the Republic's small clique of computer scientists in the capital. Together, they have devised Project Kibersin: an astoundingly ambitious yet quite achievable plan to revolutionize the economy. This will involve establishing computer hubs, placed in key locations around the country. Able to process information at lightning speed, they will provide us with the most efficiently-managed economy in the world - at least, once we have the technology."
 KOM_kosygin_managerial_socialism_desc: "Our free-market reforms and move away from the Bolsheviks should not be misinterpreted. The President is still, in his heart, a socialist. However, while we might aspire to socialist ideals, we are not blinded by ambition or ideological fanaticism. Socialism cannot be forced; it must be born naturally, coaxed gently into being with the consent of voters.\n\nTo this end, we have adopted the principle of 'Managerial Socialism'. Our economy will be regulated and structured in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of liberal capitalism while still enjoying its benefits. Eventually - so the thinking goes - it will progress into a state wherein a peaceful transition to true socialism will occur naturally, without the need for bloodshed and tyranny."
 KOM_kosygin_for_our_prosperity_desc: "Poverty is the bane of all nations. As the wealth and wellbeing of the people diminishes, so too does their homeland. Russia could build cities of gleaming spires, establish a space program and become the world's largest nuclear power. Yet, none of those things would elevate the poor from the gutter and give them the happiness they deserve.\n\nWe shall attack poverty directly and decisively, the better to end its tyranny. This is not a battle that can be won overnight, but future victory can be secured right now. What keeps people in poverty is the need to live on a knife's edge; that can be allayed with a proper safety net. When the poor no longer need to worry about affording their next meal or keeping a roof over their heads, they can become productive citizens and help lift themselves out of deprivation and despair."
 KOM_kosygin_an_educated_populace_desc: "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 KOM_kosygin_standardize_the_schools_desc: "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 KOM_kosygin_unity_in_science_desc: "Science is the way to the future, but our progress in that direction has been halted. The rest of the world has moved on, while we, the Russians, are still working with textbooks from the early Soviet era. This problem is easily remedied, but how to get ordinary people invested in this 'boring' subject?\n\nWhy, propaganda! Propaganda is a dirty word these days, but how else can a government effectively convey its ideals and intentions? It doesn't have to mean brainwashing and 24-hour broadcasts; we can campaign for science through TV, radio and newspapers as we would if we were recruiting for the military. The lessons learned from stoking patriotic pride can be applied well in the popularization of science."
 KOM_kosygin_a_bright_generation_desc: "President Kosygin is said by some to desire nothing more or less than to be at the head of a grand bureaucratic machine. They say that he cares only for the sense of satisfaction he feels at knowing his grand design is functioning smoothly. They are wrong.\n\nThe greatest and noblest of the President's desires is to leave Russia in a better state than he found it. The best way to ensure that happens is to give all of Russia's children the twin gifts of education and safety. In time, it will fall to them to continue what we have started. Russia's future lives and dies in the hearts of these future workers and intellectuals - in the generation that will shine brightest of all."

 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_army_desc: "Our brave men in the field have accomplished a lot for us, yes, but we need to start bringing the Russian Republican Army to contemporary standards. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all have top-notch militaries, and it is likely due to advanced tactics and modern weapons, neither of which we currently have. In order to restore Russian prestige, we must work to modernize the army and join the ranks of the global superpowers in terms of military might."
 KOM_democratic_lessons_from_the_last_war_desc: "Our most recent conflict, the West Russian War, was full of genius tactics and offensives issued by commanders on both sides. We must look back on what worked for us in that war, how we carried out combat and used logistics to conquer our enemy. We can't neglect our opponent's strategy to win the war either, as his forces often fought to the very end. We must adapt these tactics to our current military in order to grow stronger."
 KOM_democratic_study_foreign_strategy_desc: "To improve our military strategy, we need to look to the top armies of the world: Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must observe the swift German blitzkrieg across Europe, Japan's burning advance into China, America's brave defense of Scotland. Even the South African War had plenty of cunning tactics from both the United States and the German Reich, and they were carried out with the newest weapons available. Sometimes, foreign military strategies are the most useful."
 KOM_democratic_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "It was not long ago when Russia was still fractured into various warlord states, each with their own dreams and aspirations of unifying the Motherland. In some regions, chaos remains widespread; it was only through our military that we became the strong force we are today. There are many lessons that can be learned from the Unification Wars, including the tactics used to defeat insurgents and the military strategies behind the most successful warlords here in Russia."
 KOM_democratic_tactical_flexibility_desc: "Sometimes, our grand battle plans may be disrupted by unexpected, uncontrolled events; we cannot expect every war to be carried out perfectly. Instead of relying on one large battle plan, we should start focusing more on officer initiative: letting the individual commanders make the call based on the unique conditions around them. Because our overall command structures may break down, we might need to delegate the decision-making to the individual units on the ground. We must let each respective unit use the tactics that are best suited for their respective situation to win us the war."
 KOM_democratic_a_modernized_force_desc: "Though our Russian Republican Army is mighty within Russia, it does not compare to the contemporary forces of the three global superpowers. Many of our tactics and weapons are from the German-Soviet War over twenty years ago; it is time to bring the RRA to the modern age. We will renovate the army by increasing the military budget, investing in new military technologies, and exploring the most recent military tactics. In the end, the Russian Republican Army will become a Cold War-ready force to be reckoned with."
 KOM_democratic_the_ministry_of_defense_desc: "In the process of upgrading our military, it is imperative that we expand our General Staff to meet the new army standards. We will have to provide our generals with updated data from battlefields around the world and keep them informed about the latest military training methods. We must also streamline the Ministry of Defense bureaucracy in order to improve the effectiveness of our leading commanders."
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_navy_desc: "Many years have passed since Russia had a navy she could be proud of. Over twenty years ago, the Kriegsmarine ravaged the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea during the Second World War. The time has come for us to establish a naval force like no other, one that will prove capable of destroying enemies at sea long before they reach land. We will start by expanding our shipyards, recruiting the best available sailors in Russia, and constructing the most up-to-date vessels."
 KOM_democratic_the_russian_republican_air_force_desc: "One of the most valuable lessons the world learned from the devastating Second World War was the importance of air superiority and close air support of ground troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Air Force could not compete with the Luftwaffe twenty years ago; Soviet planes were often out-of-date, and pilots did not have sufficient training. We shall create a proper air force for Komi by building more air bases, recruiting top-of-the-line pilots, researching the latest models for fighters and bombers, and constructing powerful airplanes to wrest control of the skies and rain death on enemy cities."
 KOM_democratic_infantry_equipment_trials_desc: "Our soldiers require high-quality guns for use in the field, and unfortunately, all we have are World War II-era rifles and whatever left over from Zlatoust's merchants. We must hold trials and competitions to develop a new standard infantry rifle that can be mass-produced for our men. Better guns means more of the enemy we can kill to win the war."
 KOM_democratic_improve_on_the_armored_corps_desc: "The only available tanks we have are from the Second World War, and they do not compete with the armored forces of Germany, Japan, and the United States. If we are to make a swift advance and blast our enemies to pieces, we need to improve the quality of our tanks significantly. We will hold trials to see who can produce the most effective armored tanks that we can use for the army. Hopefully, the end result will be a tank that can compete with that of our opponents."
 KOM_democratic_reopen_the_vyatka_general_staff_academy_desc: "The Tsarists of Russia once had a famous academy that was used to train new officers for the General Staff, and it is time that we revive the academy. It will be used to pump out the best-of-the-best generals for our army and improve the officer corps. With effort, it could become one of the top military academies in all of Russia."
 KOM_democratic_strategic_supremacy_desc: "When it comes to war, weapons are only as good as the person handling them. Offensive and defensive tactics are only as effective as the commander issuing them. We must strive for the greatest tacticians in all of Russia and defeat our enemies through superior tactics alone. At the end of the day, it is our military maneuvers that will set us above our fiercest opponents."
 
 KOM_democratic_onto_the_world_stage_desc: "Now that we have become a regional power, it is time that we start reaching out to nations beyond Russia. To achieve this, we need to establish a proper foreign ministry and hire diplomats that can fully express our intentions to the world. Since we have become a contender for unifying Russia, the world has taken notice of our Republic, and we need to make our first appearance on the world stage."
 KOM_democratic_open_the_gates_desc: "Back when we were a smaller power, much of our trade was confined to Russia only. As a current regional power, we need to start branching out to other nations beyond the Motherland, especially the democratic countries around the world. Now that we have some coastal territory in northern Russia, it would be beneficial for us to establish a merchant marine operating around the White Sea, protected by a few of our ships."
 KOM_democratic_the_last_democracies_of_europe_desc: "With the rapid expansion of ideologies like fascism and National Socialism, it has become increasingly important for democratic nations to band together during this time of crisis. Essentially, we need to reach out for any European democratic hand we can hold onto, and we must appeal for diplomatic relations with these rare countries. Together, we will form a continental bulwark against the evil threat of Authoritarian regimes."
 KOM_democratic_appeal_for_recognition_desc: "Even though we are a regional power in Russia, some countries still see us as "just another warlord state". Diplomatic recognition is the first big step in becoming a relevant world power, the defender of democracy we aspire to be. We must call upon nations like the USA, Iberia, England, and Italy, and convince them that we are a legitimate state and deserve diplomatic recognition."
 KOM_democratic_embassy_funding_desc: "Now that we have received diplomatic recognition from some major world powers, we need to establish official embassies in each country that recognizes us as a legitimate state. We will have to set aside part of our budget to maintain these embassies, but we will also enjoy full diplomatic relations with several leading nations. It is a small price to pay for a spot on the world stage."
 KOM_democratic_call_for_investment_desc: "Our treasury can only pay for so many of the projects we started to transform this country, and now is the time we look to foreign investment. Thankfully, we can negotiate a deal with the new countries that have recognized us. We can assure these countries that if they decide to invest in our Republic, our debts will be paid back tenfold, and every country involved will benefit."
 KOM_democratic_across_the_ocean_desc: "We already enjoy diplomacy with several European nations, but we must also look beyond our home continent for potential allies. Though North America is a distant continent, it serves as a pedestal for the last shining beacon of democracy left on Earth. We should seek to establish connections with Mexico, Canada, and the United States in order to gain more international recognition and more embassies on the Western side of the Atlantic."
 KOM_democratic_a_visit_to_washington_desc: "Ever since our democracy was first formed in the ashes of the Soviet Union, one of our biggest diplomatic goals was to someday meet the President of the United States and discuss the global defense of liberty. [KOM.GetLeader], our own President of the Republic, would like to establish a meeting with U.S. President [USA.GetLeader] in Washington. We will take any opportunity to meet the wonderful American people, and if the proposed summit goes well, it will be another diplomatic achievement we can cross off."
 KOM_democratic_apply_for_ofn_observer_desc: "Though our current diplomatic status with the OFN is quite limited, we could use some foreign aid to continue building up our country. Our democratic government located in the middle of ravaged Russia should be enough to convince the OFN officials to grant us status as a prospective partner nation. It may be the first step on the road to becoming a proper defender of democracy like our American brethren."

 KOM_third_election_start_desc: "It is time for a new election! The usual suspects are running fierce campaigns to make their way to the top, and as always, only one will become Russia's helmsman for the next few years.\n\nOf course, considering our current position as master of Western Russia, whoever wins the presidency is likely to go down in history as the one who finally made the nation whole again after nearly thirty years of strife. Such a fact is not lost on the contenders, who each have their own ideas of how the reunification should play out..."

 KOM_third_election_the_DSNP_campaign: "The DSNP Campaign"
 KOM_third_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc: "The People's Democratic Socialist Republic has always been a powerful force in the republic's politics, ever since the party stood beside Nikolai Voznesensky when he founded it. However, the party has also been a consistently divisive topic, as Voznesensky has proven to be a problematic figure at even the best of times.\n\nA newcomer, Alexander Yakovlev, wishes to change the party's troubled reputation. He is now running a campaign based on ideals of democratic socialism, free from the mistakes made by the party in years past. Only time will tell if his bold promises will pay off."
 KOM_third_election_tour_the_industrial_centers: "Cater to the Working Class"
 KOM_third_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc: "The DSNP, above all, serves the working class of the republic. This is no reason to grow complacent, however, as the other parties are already seeking to encroach upon our most important base of support.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev already has plans to tour the industrial centers of the nation, and to publicly shake hands with the most influential worker's councils of our cities. With the councils on our side, we may have an easier time organizing future campaigns. Most importantly, however, this show of good faith will restore the worker's confidence in our party, and once again solidify our voter base."
 KOM_third_election_present_a_workers_agenda: "A Radical New Platform"
 KOM_third_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc: "The DSNP has long been an advocate of democratic socialism, even during the days of the Voznesentsiy. However, certain compromises in these ideals had to be made to ensure better cooperation with the coalition to stem the tide of radicalism. Now that the storm has passed, the time has come for a new platform to reaffirm our commitment to socialism.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev has given the party the green light to make public this new platform, which is far more radical than anything we have seen before. It calls for a renewed push towards a democratic transition towards socialism, as well as a strict adherence to radical worker's rights policies. Women's rights, which were always present but never really the main focus, have been reemphasized as part of the party's goals. These policies may be seen as a bold shift towards the far left, but Yakovlev is confident that this new direction will revitalize the party for years to come."
 KOM_third_election_the_PSD_campaign: "The PSD Campaign"
 KOM_third_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc: ""Citizens of the Republic, listen to me!"\n\n"Long has our nation been broken by the Germans, forced to cower beneath the shadow of the Kaiser and the Fuhrer! Well, I say on this day, no more!"\n\n"No more will we cower beneath the German, no more will we suffer from its wrath! No, today we stand against the German and those who seek Russia to remain fractured!"\n\n"We fight to make sure no son or daughter of Russia will ever watch the Luftwaffe reign hellfire from the skies! No more, for I swear that if the PSD is elected, we will unify Russia and take Moscow back from the German scum!"\n\n"So who will stand with me? Will you fight for your nation and make sure our flag is known on the world stage?""
 KOM_third_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia: "A Patriotic Platform"
 KOM_third_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc: "The Sovereign Democratic Party was founded at a time when Komi faced threats largely from within. It was a call by those who would see democracy preserved from the radicals, by any means necessary. Some in our party argue that our purpose has been served. No longer do radicals threaten to steal our freedoms. Instead, the officials of the PSD argue that we must look outward. Effective immediately, the party's platform for the upcoming election will incorporate a strong, pro-unification message. How the nature of Russian legislation will be left largely in the hands of local politicians. The focus of the national government will be on a massive rearmament program, which will improve industry, infrastructure, and provide employment to hundreds of thousands of Russians. Who can compete with that?"
 KOM_third_election_an_appeal_to_force: "Stress the Border Issue"
 KOM_third_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc: "Just across the A-A line lies our occupied homeland. Long ago, Bukharin's Soviet Union fell to the Germans and occupied the heartland of our country. Later, Vorishilov's West Russian Revolutionary Front tried to take it back, but the West Russian War and the Republic's independence led to the war's eventual failure.\n\nHowever, now we have an opportunity. While we can not invade the remnants of Moscowien right now, we can start to press the issue of the border to the general public. Troops will be sent to ensure the warlords who have emerged do not invade the Republic and Russian refugees are taken care of. We can not take back what is rightfully ours so long as our flank is exposed, but we certainly can make our case known that all of Russia, including Moscowien, is rightfully ours."
 KOM_third_election_the_SMR_campaign: "The SMR Campaign"
 KOM_third_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc: "It's election time once again in the Republic, and the Union of Young Reformers has a serious chance of achieving victory. Naturally, a winning strategy will require a winning campaign, emphasizing issues that Russia's voters see as relevant to their own lives and choosing popular policies in response to them. But, as the question always is, what to choose?\n\nRussia as it stands is backwards, uneducated, and globally isolated. It has been so for decades, and voters no doubt want things to change. Here is where the SMR can present its recipe for the nation's recovery: expanded investment in education, free trade policy so capital can flow into Russia once again, and the construction of robust ties to the free world. May Russia's rise to global prominence mirror our rise in the polls."
 KOM_third_election_meet_with_the_youth: "Connect with the Intellectuals"
 KOM_third_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc: "The SMR's philosophy emphasizes the values of openness, humanism, and intellectual achievement. Unsurprisingly, this makes the middle classes and the intellectual elite natural bases for the party. Any successful campaign will involve mobilizing voters of higher status, whether material or educational, to the polls in order to beat the other parties' rabble, and voters don't simply turn out because of similar social class.\n\nThe SMR needs an effective infrastructure that can mobilize this base, and the best way of doing so is by meeting them where they are. Sending campaign officials to donors and universities will allow us to build the party's connections to voters just in time to shepherd them to the polls."
 KOM_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future: "A Platform for a New Century"
 KOM_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc: "Alexei Kosygin was a very principled leader, and he helped raise Russia's new democracy from infancy. However, he still held onto obsolete ideals, elements of Russia's Soviet past; while his methods were liberal and democratic, his ends were socialist, even if they were less so than Voznesensky or the extreme left. This element of the SMR was already vestigial when Kosygin was in office, and it is now time to move on.\n\nThe new platform will invoke our earlier ideals of freedom, both in speech and in markets, and of sensible international cooperation, while quietly abandoning Kosygin's leftist sympathies. While some voters may be upset by the transition, others previously hostile to voting for a socialist should more than make up the difference."
 KOM_third_election_let_the_race_begin: "The New Mandate"
 KOM_third_election_let_the_race_begin_desc: "As election is upon us, hordes of citizens can be seen rushing schools, public offices and other polling places in order to let their voices be heard by the high instances of power.

 KOM_dsnp_socialism_for_the_people_desc: "Alexander Yakovlev is no stranger to ridicule - the majority of which, ironically, coming from those ostensibly most aligned with our policies. They accused us of some dreadful lacking for putting faith in the synthesis of Marx's theories and the market's temporary benefits.\n\nSerov believed we lack the vision to uplift Komi from its dilapidated state. Today [Root.Capital.GetName] and its neighbor cities bustle with cars in the day and shine with electric lights at night.\n\nBukharina believed we lack the interest to provide for the people's needs. Today every worker and farmer in our payroll enjoys benefits that would foment jealousy in their counterparts outside Russia.\n\nSuslov believed we lack the strength to exert power over our immediate neighbors. Today the Free Republic's flag flies in every government building west of the Yenisei.\n\nThe conclusion is self-evident: we distinguish ourselves from naive fools by proving our naysayers wrong. As the Republic's generals and diplomats secure West Siberia for Russia's rightful government, their doubting voices have returned - the past years were strings of flukes, or so they claim. Surely Yakovlev can't enforce his wishful thinking onto another large swath of land and its peoples.\n\nFor the revolution's sake, we shall prove them wrong a fourth time."
 KOM_dsnp_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Yakovlev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with [Root.Capital.GetName]'s finest."
 KOM_dsnp_strengthen_the_social_economy_desc: "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 KOM_dsnp_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "Everyday, prospectors drill holes in the middle of nowhere (or rather, in the middle of West Siberia) and drench themselves in fountains of sticky black gold. Powering cars, factories and homes worldwide, Earth's ancient ichor is in high demand - and the Free Republic has fields worth ten hundred billion barrels of it underneath our feet. We would be fools not to exploit them for our benefit.\n\nThe National Assembly has hence approved a bill establishing Gazprom, a state-owned company that shall soon manage the particulars of exploiting quite possibly Earth's largest reserves of crude oil. Oil wells, pipelines, employees - whatever they need, we shall provide. The revenue they will generate will more than recompense our treasuries' losses a thousandfold."
 KOM_dsnp_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc: "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 KOM_dsnp_a_fruitful_reunification_desc: "With West Siberia's last warlord vanquished, the Free Republic now stretches from Gorky to the River Yenisei. It is tempting to make haste and immediately fulfill our preordained right to rule over all Russia, yet we must not stray from our primary mandate - that is, the betterment of the peoples whose lives we affect through the Assembly's laws.\n\nFor now, we shall expend much of the government's attention into integrating our new citizens into the liberties and comforts West Russia enjoys. Wanton conquest can wait until the Republic's citizens, old or new, live the fulfilling lives we have promised them."
 KOM_dsnp_staff_the_bureaucracy_desc: "Bureaucracy grows as the state does; should the latter grow twice its size overnight, then the former grows twice also. Both could be said for the Free Republic at present now that West Siberia is ours. Unfortunately, our sudden dearth of bureaucrats has led to issues in applying [Root.Capital.GetName]'s ordinances past the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn response, President Yakovlev has directed his advisors to recruit more bureaucrats not only from West Russia, but also from West Siberia. The pencil-pushers under our old adversaries' employ will be of great use to their new government soon."
 KOM_dsnp_answer_the_autonomy_question_desc: "Ethnic groups such as the Nenets and Selkups have inhabited northern Russia since before Yermak subjugated the Khanate of Sibir. Centuries of oppression under the Tsar followed, then decades under old Bukharin, until Barbarossa shattered the rusted grip that held their leashes. Pressing circumstances had up until now prevented us from doing more than granting autonomy to the enclaves that remain. Operative phrase: up until now.\n\nCertain members of the National Assembly have proposed legislation that, if passed, would turn the natives' autonomies into self-governing protectorates - independent nations in all but name. Whether or not it does pass will decide what place our Republic has for Russia's many non-Russians."
 KOM_dsnp_approaching_the_dawn_desc: "On the outskirts of Syktvkar, a farmer tests his new tractor in today's harvest. He reaped more wheat that day than in a month with his old sickle and trowel.\n\nIn Omsk, gray concrete bunkers explodingly give way to housing complexes with windows, curtains and balconies: features once dismissed for showing too much to enemies that can neither be seen nor grasped.\n\nIn Gorky, the morning air comes alive with searing heat, struck hammers and steelworkers' song. With the city fathers' leave, its sprawling assembly plants are now put to task building automobiles the common man can afford.\n\nSlowly but surely, leisurely but successfully - Russia steps out of perpetual dusk. We will feel sunlight's kiss again."
 KOM_dsnp_lessons_from_the_sibplan_desc: "History remembers Nikolai Bukharin as a man of many plans but scarce time. His vision for Russia and her proletariat died with Moscow during the Great Patriotic War, and so we can only speculate its specifics. Gosplan nevertheless gave some of it form in the days of NEP, namely Siberia's manmade transfiguration into an industrial powerhouse. The hence-named Siberian Plan's aftereffects lay in the winding railroads and teeming industrial zones dotting the region's halves.\n\nMuch of the megaproject's documents - blueprints, manifests, progress reports - has survived the Warlord Era's complications. We would do the Republic's economy today and tomorrow well by applying their lessons in raw material-rich yet industrially-poor regions like the Kazan."
 KOM_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_desc: "While specializing regions by the resources they possess does maximize their use to the national economy, it also unevenly distributes the state's wealth as a consequence. The end result thereof is a nation comprised of two parts: poverty-riddled cornucopias and towering islands of industrial growth. Who services which needs no elaboration.\n\nThus, the Yakovlev administration's economic advisors have drawn plans to build a network of cities, with their factories and skyscrapers, from Arkhangelsk to Zlatoust. Our results shall prove to the world that the Free Republic has no place for unequal societies."
 KOM_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_tt: "§YInvestments§! shall be made across §Rdisadvantaged regions§! to increase §Geconomic parity§!."
 KOM_dsnp_a_hand_to_the_west_desc: "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 KOM_dsnp_flying_together_desc: "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Yakovlev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 KOM_dsnp_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "Four times have our fellow socialists derided the methods we abide. Four again have results bade them peace.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Yakovlev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 KOM_smr_reforms_for_russia_desc: "West Siberia has fallen to the Free Republic. With the task our generals had accomplished, it is time for our economists to do their jobs bringing the Republic's bounty to the region.\n\nKonstantin Katushev lived through the Soviet Union's downfall, and then survived the political machinations of one of its many successors, fully believing in one fundamental truth: that reform once elevated old Russia into a superpower.\n\nAnd reform shall soon restore new Russia as one."
 KOM_smr_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Katushev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with [Root.Capital.GetName]'s finest."
 KOM_smr_reorient_kibersin_desc: "Project KiberSin has been bearing fruit in Western Russia. The data received from the computers has proven invaluable in advancing our economy onto the world stage. However, currently our KiberSin infrastructure is limited to Western Russia, and we now have annexed a large amount of territory that is in desperate need of economic recovery programs.\n\nIn order to make the Western Siberian economy more efficient and more effective, our President has proposed for increased funding to be allocated to Project KiberSin, and for additional KiberSin offices to be constructed in key locations across Western Siberia. Not only will these offices help open up much-needed job opportunities in these recently incorporated territories, but they will serve as a prime opportunity to re-orient some of KiberSin's priorities in a more modern and consumer-oriented direction. With additional capital investments in the program, Project KiberSin may, instead of adhering to outmoded etatist principles, serve as a means of developing our domestic technology market and increasing domestic communications capacity."
 KOM_smr_subsidize_energy_concerns_desc: "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. With the inheritance of these regions, however, we have nationalized many concerns on a provisional basis. In order to ensure an efficiently managed energy sector, these provisionally state-run energy concerns shall be privatized and placed in the hands of firms which demonstrate responsible practices and a commitment to effective management. Creating private-sector jobs in the energy industry will do wonders for the economies of the newly-integrated Western Siberian region, and ensure significant growth potential in the years to come. In addition, generous subsidies shall be provided to these concerns whilst this process is underway, to prevent shocks to the market causing a disruption in our energy supplies. Whilst costs may be higher short-term, the long-term potential present shall make this investment pay off in time."
 KOM_smr_invite_international_capital_desc: "As a developing nation, despite its size, the Free Republic has much to offer prospective foreign investors. Specifically, our abundance of natural resources and ongoing projects to allow for market-oriented development and investment opportunity in the energy-sector.\n\nTo build capital and ensure a timely development of our nation's economy, selling resources on the international market at fair rates and entering domestically-produced products into the international market via eliminating needless trade barriers should be carried out without delay. Additionally, foreign investors shall be invited to Russia, to tour our cities, resource deposits, and growing native industries. An influx of foreign capital shall invariably follow, lifting our people out of poverty, developing national infrastructure, and improving quality of life en masse."
 KOM_smr_a_fruitful_reunification_desc: "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states, and ensure that opportunities are offered for all people to achieve a standard of living once unheard of in those blighted days."
 KOM_smr_approach_the_siberian_liberals_desc: "Despite the recent integration of Western Siberia, the various administrations of the region have not disappeared. While some of the politicians are far too dangerous to allow into our democracy, especially considering the tumultuous history our Republic shares with extremists. However, some of these administrations are filled with sensible enough people.\n\nBoris Yeltsin, a politician from [Get_RUS_Yekaterinburg_Or_Sverdlovsk], has been a democratic advocate for some time now, and we welcome him and his colleagues with open arms. Similarly, the liberals of Zlatoust can be relied upon for political support. We shall be discussing with these factions, and we can use their recommendations for various bureaucratic positions in our new local governments. Of course, we shall also be ensuring that SMR politicians find their way into the most critical roles of these governments, to ensure these governments are ultimately aligned with our values."
 KOM_smr_reestablish_the_siberian_republics_desc: "The old Soviet Union made many mistakes, but we do not need to dismiss all of its decisions with the same broad brush. Specifically, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, which helped provide representation to the various minority groups within the Soviet Union. Western Siberia is home to many minorities, and our Republic should aspire to ensure these minorities receive the same level of equality and autonomy within our system as they possessed in the old Soviet system.\n\nOur President wishes to recreate these Siberian ASSRs, although modified to better fit our government's structure. With the Siberian Minority Representation & Autonomy Act, several Autonomous Republics will be carved out of Western Siberia, and staffed with various ethnic and religious minorities that require greater representation within our democratic system."
 KOM_smr_crafting_our_future_desc: "When Pyotr Alekseevich became Peter the Tsar, he inherited a backwater from his father Alexis and brother Fyodor. Its cities hearkened the Kievan Rus' in their antiquity and bucolia. Its laity lived almost to a man as illiterate peasants and serfs. Its nobles and generals ruled their fiefdoms like free boyars, rather than subjects of an Imperial Majesty. Lesser men would be tempted to leave the state of things be; after all, what use was there changing an unstoppable force's course?\n\nBut Peter proved himself above and beyond men as concept altogether. By his decrees were our greatest cities willed into existence. By his tutelage, the evolution of peasants into intellectuals, craftsmen, clergymen. And by his ironclad will, seditious subjects and rapacious rivals alike humbled before the twin-headed eagle. The emperor's passing completed Peter the Tsar's metamorphosis into Peter the Great: guiding light and model for all Russians, regardless of ideology.\n\nIt is his footsteps which we had followed yesterday, are following today, and will follow tomorrow. History repeats in cycles - and as sure as the world turns about itself, so too shall Russia repeat the reforms which blossom sun-kissed sunflowers from its all-encompassing wastelands."
 KOM_smr_expanding_university_funding_desc: "The quality of life in Russia is beginning to rise, and our economy is doing well. With increased prosperity comes increased demand for a skilled workforce, and to obtain these skilled people, we need to educate the people. Unfortunately, university-level education has not been a high-priority for Russians ever since it collapsed into anarchy. Our President shall be increasing the funding reserved for universities and higher education.\n\nIncreased university funding will also aid our research endeavors, replenish Russia's academic scene, and it is the next step in advancing our nation to the modern age. Russian thinkers shall once more share their knowledge with the world."
 KOM_smr_new_conservationism_desc: "A core part of Russia is her beautiful, unending nature. The Union of Young Reformers has always stood for protecting the environment, as it is humanity's duty to be the stewards of this earth. With Western Siberia's beautiful forest, tundra, and mountainous landscapes now under our control, we must ensure that these beautiful lands are not butchered by industrialists and the greedy. Of course, our mission is made more difficult by those who governed Western Siberia before us. Tyumen and Omsk, their environments decimated and polluted by the policies of Kaganovich and the Black League. We must clean up their mess, and protect what's left."
 KOM_smr_a_hand_to_the_west_desc: "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation.

This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 KOM_smr_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "Once upon a time, Konstantin Katushev's erstwhile allies would have scoffed at his vision opposite the Assembly's aisle. Their opinions no longer matter now - but for posterity's sake, he has had the last laugh.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Katushev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 KOM_psd_the_sovereign_mandate_desc: "We just secured a new mandate spanning the entirety of Russia. We must use it to spread our fair democracy to our brethren in West Russia as well as our new residents in West Siberia. Our Republic must make itself worthy for public support and ensure a strong, sovereign Russia that is by the people, for the people. Only then can we unite with our rivals and stand against the Nazi menace."
 KOM_psd_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc: "Currently, one of our biggest problems lies in our infrastructure. Even though our predecessors treated this land well and gave it life, there is still much more we can do to build this country up. For now, we should focus on restoring infrastructure and improving our cities to develop a strong core.\n\nNot only will our land development allow troops to move faster, but it will keep our population well-fed, a quality that not many Russian warlords have for their people."
 KOM_psd_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc: "Our Republic currently suffers from internal strife within the general population. Our citizens often criticize our military expansion, which leads to conflict between civilians and the government. A new welfare program should both strengthen the Republic and quell the many disputes arising between our people and the administration."
 KOM_psd_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "Through our military conquests we have captured many sources of oil. We now have plenty of oil to sustain our military and provide a surplus to our citizens. It would be beneficial for us to create our very own oil and gas administration to manage the energy resources we have gathered. Through this, we could give a little extra power to the energy sector of our Republic."
 KOM_psd_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc: "Our economy is in need of a sovereign wealth fund that can be used to properly develop Russia. We need to establish a central bank that can invest in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, anything to enhance our public finance. Having this kind of investment fund will pull us closer to the economic prosperity we need to produce a strong Russia and help our citizens live wealthy lives."
 KOM_psd_siberian_security_desc: "Our conquests in West Siberia not only gave us more resources to work with, but we also have more potential threats to handle. Political opponents still remain throughout the deserted region. We must make sure the residents of Siberia are held to the same nationwide standards as everyone else, while getting rid of the dreaded Tyumen and Black League terrorists. It is our job to ensure the Republic is safe from the domestic extremists."
 KOM_psd_the_association_registry_act_desc: "With an ever-growing population of Russians from across Eurasia, there is bound to be a few political dissenters here and there. We must make it clear that some of these ideologies will not be tolerated, as they are against the principles of human liberty. We should pass an act that requires all former members of the Communist Party and Black League to disclose their membership so that we know who these dissenters are. Any person who was once affiliated with either party and refused to disclose it will be arrested."
 KOM_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_desc: "We look to the East and find our newly acquired West Siberian region, a place where trade once reigned as Yevgeny Dragunov made a fortune selling his guns to the long-extinguished warlords. We could learn a few lessons from his government's former administration. We need to partner up with Zlatoust's former bureaucrats and businessmen to solidify our control of the region, while also scouting for people who are experienced in administrative positions."
 KOM_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_tt: "The Zlatoust magnates may §Ypolitically align§! in a §Mdifferent direction§!."
 KOM_psd_extending_democracy_desc: "We have been growing powerful in our little corner of the world, and some in our administration even say we're approaching World Power status. It seems like our mission of spreading democracy to all of Russia is finally starting to pay dividends. Our people could always use a morale boost to get them working harder, encouraging them to go beyond the imaginary limits that once confined us to our portion of Russia. We all must work to bring the blessing of human liberty to the entirety of what was once the oppressive Soviet Union."
 KOM_psd_encourage_local_democracy_desc: "The federal government always seems to have the greatest concentration of power, but it is the local government where the people's voice is best heard. Local administrations are much better suited to tackle local problems than the federal government, so we should encourage the people to participate in their regional elections. The most important changes often come from elections at the lowest level of democracy."
 KOM_psd_a_framework_for_popular_involvement_desc: "We need to come up with a plan to secure our democratic ideals in case something unfortunate happens in the next elections. We will establish a framework for regional referendums to ensure that the public majority still supports our cause even if we somehow lose the next vote. That way, the PSD agenda will be diffused among the population where it could counteract a potential PSD loss in the elections."
 KOM_psd_further_ofn_ties_desc: "Many members of our government watched the rise of Fascist and Communist regimes with their own eyes, and we all watched chaos ravage what was left of the Soviet Union. Even today, we often witness the brutal oppression set forth by the Nazi Party and the Empire of Japan. Our democratic brothers in North America and Australia work to defend the fledgeling democracies around the world, and we want to join their ranks one day. To start, we need to extend more diplomatic overtures to the OFN and let them know of our intentions"
 KOM_psd_the_twin_eagles_desc: "Our relationship with the OFN has been rather minor, as they still view us as a smaller force within the vastness of decayed Russia. We must send our diplomats to attend meetings with OFN affiliates if we are ever going to increase our diplomatic status with the organization. It would also benefit us to invoke the National Sovereignty Act in order to gain an OFN defensive guarantee. Through these first maneuvers we will improve our relationship with the United States and, like two soaring eagles, we will fight to the death to ensure democracy for all the struggling people of the world."
 KOM_psd_onwards_to_the_future_desc: "In this term we have accomplished many of our goals, both foreign and domestic. We worked with our resource departments to improve the economy, we worked to shatter the authoritarian influence at home, and we worked to better our relationship with the OFN. One major goal remains: we must fight to bring all the Russian people together under a banner of freedom, of life, liberty, and prosperity. It is during this term that we will unite all of Russia against the wicked Nazi influence that demolished the identity of Russia long ago. It is time for the Free Republic to start her final offensive."

 KOM_stalina_the_reconstruction_of_russia_desc: "이제 재건 정부는 서시베리아를 합병함으로써 서러시아 전체를 통제하고 있습니다. 그러나 서시베리아는 테러와 극단주의 정권의 먹칠로 얼룩져 있고, 따라서 튜멘의 빨갱이들과 흑색연합은 사냥을 해서 몰살시켜야만 합니다. 이러한 일이 완벽하게 이루어진다면, 서시베리아에 훌륭한 행정력을 쌓을 수 있고, 이는 동부로의 확장에도 도움이 될 것입니다. 꽤나 힘든 일이겠지만, 이미 스탈리나 대통령과 재건정부에게는 익숙해질만큼 경험한 일입니다."
 KOM_stalina_securing_the_peoples_faith_desc: "러시아 인민들은 그들을 도와주고 지켜줄 무언가를 필요로합니다. 우리 당은 인민에게 힘과 안정성, 그리고 국가적 자부심을 보여줄 필요가 있습니다. 국가가 극단주의로 향할 것을 막기 위해서는 인민들의 지지가 필요합니다. 따라서, 스탈리나 대통령과 국가재건위원회는 생산을 늘리기 위한 선전을 승인했고, 찾을 수 있는 모든 공인들을 매수할 것입니다. 국민들은 주변이 외치는 국가에 대한 칭찬과 박수에 포위된다면, 그들도 재건정부를 지지할 수밖에 없을 것입니다."
 KOM_stalina_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc: "With the Reconstruction Government facing some dissent from its populace regarding the ever-expanding military, and the lack of democracy in our government. To combat this, President Stalina has suggested the allocation of some funds to the expansion of our nation's social welfare. There are two advantages to this decision: It pleases the populace and gets them to stop protesting against our administration's structures and policies, and it strengthens the nation as a whole. It will solve our most pressing problem, and aid us in the long term. A wise course of action, although it will limit the size of our budget."
 KOM_stalina_escalate_the_national_defense_projects_desc: "President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have come to a decision: the national defense projects must be expanded. Large projects such as American-style highways, repairing damaged infrastructure, and other such plans will produce large numbers of jobs, combatting the unemployment problem within our nation. We shall also order the Russian states to expand their defense economies, lifting some of the strain of economic management from the central government. This will also hopefully soothe the populace, who had been growing somewhat discontent as of recent. These actions shall strengthen our nation and prepare the Motherland for what's to come."
 KOM_stalina_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc: "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. If we can harvest our own oil supply directly, we will be able to fuel our military at a much cheaper cost. As such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern in order to efficiently manage the oil industry and ensure the efficiency of the nation's energy sector. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 KOM_stalina_establish_the_russian_sovereign_welfare_fund_desc: "The Reconstruction Government has a lot of plans for the Motherland. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to put these plans into action. However, the National Reconstruction Council has come up with a solution to this problem. With approval from President Stalina, the National Reconstruction Council has greenlit the creation of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund is a state-owned investment fund, the money coming from the nation's banking reserves and our annual revenue. The wealth from this entity will go directly to the Motherland and her people. This will allow us to fund the development of infrastructure and improve our citizens' lives in other, more direct ways. The Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund should be relatively risk-tolerant, so it also is a fairly safe decision. The National Reconstruction Council sees no reason to delay its creation."
 KOM_stalina_a_hand_towards_the_east_desc: "The Reconstruction Government has reclaimed and integrated Western Siberia into the Republic, but our work there is not yet concluded. Lots of work will be needed to raise the region to our government's standards of development. Once we do that, the people of Western SIberia will be able to have the same confidence in our political institutions as the rest of our citizens.\n\nOf course, our work in Western Siberia will not be peaceful. Extremists from Tyumen's Communist Party and Omsk's Black League have continued to fight guerilla campaigns, attacking our soldiers and our civilians. These terrorists need to be hunted down and eliminated, for the safety of the Republic. The scars left by Western Siberia's extremists will heal with the passage of time."
 KOM_stalina_break_the_hidden_circles_desc: "While their regimes have fallen, the extremists continue to thrive in secret. Despite our best efforts, members of the Black League and the Communist Party have slipped through the cracks and infiltrated our state. The Background Disclosure Act requires all former members of either organization to disclose their past membership. This information will henceforth be made available to the public, so that they can't suppress the truth. Anyone who refuses to disclose their membership and is revealed to have been part of either extremist organization will be arrested, and charged with conspiracy."
 KOM_stalina_the_yekaterinburg_commission_desc: "Currently, our temporary military administrations in Western Siberia are both understaffed and under-prepared for governance. These temporary structures were supposed to be just that, temporary. However a lack of trusted bureaucrats led to our government struggling to form proper, permanent administrations.\n\nTo combat this, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved the formation of the Yekaterinburg Commission. This commission's duty will be to locate administrative candidates within Western Siberia and rehabilitate them. While these candidates and bureaucrats may have worked for extremist regimes, the Yekaterinburg Commission will determine which candidates can be expected to abandon their radical ideologies. Once enough positions can be filled, a proper administration will be established in Western Siberia."
 KOM_stalina_redefining_politics_desc: "It has become clear to our nation, that ideology is a corrupting force, radicalizing those who follow these ideals. Instead of simply weakening ideology, we should focus on prioritizing pragmatism in our governance. All of Russia needs to learn to push ideological conflict aside, and accept our shared values: Freedom, Sovereignty, and Pragmatism.\n\nPolitics should revolve around these shared values, and shift towards simply solving problems without considering how these problems fit into greater ideological frameworks. Politics at their core should be utilitarian and unbiased. The best way to destroy extremism is to instigate this cultural shift, and sway the people to our side."
 KOM_stalina_the_toolbox_theory_desc: "As President Stalina continues on her quest to divorce politics from ideology, she has adopted the Toolbox Theory. The theory is very simple: politics and political processes are tools used to solve practical problems. Rational people do not throw out the toolbox and resort to extremism to solve problems, such behavior merely causes new problems to appear. Instead, the answer to all problems lies in our political institutions. All we need to do is use them properly, and use them wisely."
 KOM_stalina_a_foundation_for_the_future_desc: "Once the government is stable, extremism is destroyed, and the Motherland united, it will be time to dissolve the Reconstruction Government. In its place, free and democratic elections will commence, and we will have institutions in place to ensure this.\n\nThe elections will be modeled after the Komi Republic's system, the President elected directly via ranked-choice voting, while the Vice-President is appointed by the National Assembly after the elections. The unicameral legislature will have two-year election cycles, while the President shall be elected every every four years, and there will be no term limits for both the legislature and the Presidency. The Komi Republic's problem was its kow-towing to extremism, not its government structure."
 KOM_stalina_answer_the_eagles_cry_desc: "The key to Russia's future is the OFN, and they are going to be our most important partners as we prepare to unite the Motherland. As such, we need to attempt to obtain increased status within the OFN. This would allow us to attend meetings of OFN-affiliate nations, and acquiring a defensive guarantee. To acquire this guarantee, the National Sovereignty Act can be used as leverage, since the United States is always willing to work with those who provide them the economic incentives to do so. With America's guarantee, the Motherland's bright and prosperous future will be ensured."
 KOM_stalina_look_to_challenges_ahead_desc: "The Reconstruction has accomplished a great deal, and now Western Siberia is fully integrated into our Republic, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead that we must face. However, with the combined power of our strength and our principles, we can move forward. We can unite the Motherland. We can bring stability to her people. We can turn the Motherland into a titan, ready to avenge her humiliation, and liberate Moscow and her citizens. We can achieve all of this, and the Motherland will finally be free from the shackles that extremists placed upon her."

DSNP가 우리들의 연합을 박살내는 꼴을 보십시오. 난 이 상황을 용납할 생각은 추호도 없습니다!" 이건 위험할 수 있었다, 연합의 분열은 선거에서 그들의 성과를 심각하게 손상시킬 수 있었고, 그렇게 되면 급진주의자들이 권력을 얻을 수 있게 될 수도 있었다. 코시긴은 뭔가 해야만 했다.\n\n"친구 여러분, 그리고 동료 여러분, 여러분들의 두려움을 이해합니다. 진심입니다. 저 또한 극단주의에 대해 보즈네센스키가 취한 일련의 입장들에 회의적입니다. 그렇다 하더라도, 공화국이 필요로 하는 것은 연합의 단결을 위협하는 것이 아닙니다. 대신 우리는 대안을 찾아볼 필요가 있습니다." 코시긴은 잠시 말을 끊었다. "보즈네센스키는 한동안 우리 공화국을 이끌었고, 코미는 폭격에도 불구하고 그의 지도하에 계속해서 성장할 수 있었습니다. 하지만, 제 의견을 말하자면, 코미는 새로운 리더가 필요할 지도 모릅니다. 코미가 앓고 있는 홍역을 진정으로 치료해줄 사람 말입니다. 선거가 곧 다가올 것입니다. 여러분, 그리고 우린 함께 민주주의를 지지하는 사람들 아닙니까?" 코시긴은 다가올 선거에 대해 많은 생각을 해왔고, 대통령이 되겠다는 생각은 점점 더 유혹적으로 느껴졌다. 어쨌든 그의 작은 연설에 동료들은 기뻐했고, 현재로서는 재앙을 피할 수 있었던 것 같았다."

The meetings, too, show a great change in mood: the whispers grow in number, the applause grows less certain, the glances become only more and more worried.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries, too, show bizarre behavior. Their movements are further mixed up, the graffiti on walls becoming less and less prevalent, and the members themselves encrypting their communications however they can. The presence of trouble is in the atmosphere - and the reasoning is not difficult."
 KOM.3.a: "The cracks show."

 KOM.4.t: "코시긴이 스탈리나의 계획을 지지하다"
 KOM.4.d: "의회 안은 긴장으로 가득 차 있었다. 스탈리나의 조치는 의원들 사이에 많은 불안감을 불러일으켰고, 방 안의 모든 사람들은 틀을 깨기 위한 어떤 결의나 합의를 바라며 다음 사람이 연설하기를 기다렸다. 다음 발언자였던 민주파 의원들 사이에서 존경받는 경제학의 천재, 알렉세이 니콜라예비치 코시긴은 긴장감만 더욱 증폭시켰다.\n\n"친애하는 여러분, 이번 조치는 필수적인 일입니다. 스탈리나 양의 계획은 필요한 일입니다. 우리는 우리의 아름다운 공화국의 적들이 우리의 결심을 파괴하도록 내버려 둘 수도, 그들이 우리의 불길을 끄도록 내버려 둘 수도 없습니다. 민주주의의 수호를 위해서, 반드시 해야만 하는 일입니다. 사실, 스탈리나 양은 이 문제에 있어서 당의 중요한 자산이 되어야 하며, 우리 모두는 조치에 대한 그녀의 계획만큼이나 그녀의 지도에 감사함을 가져야만 합니다."\n\n수많은 박수 소리가 – 특히나 코시긴과 함께하는 사람들 쪽에서 – 있었지만, 연합의 다른 구성원들, 그중에서도 보즈네센스키파는 더욱 의심을 품었다. 결국, 스탈리나는 그들과 함께하지 않았나?"

 KOM.4.b: "이 일이 정당 간의 연합에 위배 되는 일은 아닐까?"

 KOM.5.t: "A Pact in Secret"
 KOM.5.d: "Following Kosygin's speech, the legislation chamber took a five minute rest and discussion period. To the followers of Voznesensky, however, it seemed like Russia would be reunified before the break would be finished. Discussions in hushed tones dominated all sections of the chamber, but nowhere did it happen more than in Voznesensky's section. As the break reached its end, Voznesensky rose up from his seat and made his way to the podium.\n\n"Kosygin, your plan of action in this chamber do not help us, the party, or the Republic. What you are suggesting is only dividing us further, and constitutes as creating your own alliance with Miss Stalina. I officially condemn your statements. That is all."\n\nWhile some applause rang out, the majority of the Deputies reacted in silence.\n\nAs dusk approached and the session wrapped up, Stalina and Kosygin stayed behind in the room. Their words few, but their motivations plenty, it was agreed on with a simple handshake. An alliance to protect each other, and to serve the republic - through whatever means necessary."
 KOM.5.a: "Let's hope it isn't needed."

 KOM.6.t: "Unity, for Now"
 KOM.6.d: "After the session and Kosygin's controversial speech, two stayed behind in the legislative chamber. The two most influential democrats, the economical masterminds of Komi, the fire and saviours of the Republic must meet.\n\nAlthough the purpose was a brief negotiation, both men proceeded to lose track of time. By the time they finished, it was already near-midnight. However, following a final, genuine handshake, the negotiations were complete. In exchange for Kosygin retracting his statements, Voznesensky would, at a later point in time, send through measures that were more effective. Both men came out of the meeting satisfied, as their party would remain strong - strong enough to withstand any coming political storm."
 KOM.6.a: "We must stand together!"

 KOM.7.t: "눈엣가시"
 KOM.7.d: "보즈네센스키는 시선을 이리저리 옮겼다. 그것은 보즈네센치의 또 다른 회의였으며, 중도파 정치인이 발언할 차례가 되었다. 그가 말을 시작하자, 보즈네센스키는 관심을 갖게 되었고, 심적인 동요와 함께 머리를 회전시키기 시작했다. 그 정치인이 내뱉는 말은 중요하지 않았지만, 그의 소속은 중요했다. 그는 바삐 머리를 굴렸고, 그의 눈은 깨달음의 빛을 띠기 시작했다. 그의 의식 속에 한 명의 이름이 몇 번이고 나타났다.\n\n즈다노프.\n\n비밀이었다. 적어도 지금은. 단체의 극소수만이 그 사실을 알고 있었다. 그러나 만약 그것이 빠져나간다면?보즈네센스키는 몸서리쳤다. 코시긴의 반응을 상상하는 것만으로도 족했다. 또 한편으로는, 즈다노프는 그에게 헤아릴 수 없을 만큼 소중한 자산이었다, 그리고 만일 그의 도움을 구한다면, 그는 즉시 사태가 조용해지는 것을 볼 수 있었다. \n\n그 정치가는 말을 끝냈다. 그러나 그는 다음 발언자의 말에 집중하지 않았다. 보즈네센스키의 선택은..."

 KOM.8.t: "Cutting Ties"
 KOM.8.d: "As Voznesensky penned "Sincerely, Nikolai Voznesensky"to his paper, he let out a sigh of relief. The weight of his burden would forever be lifted, and he could rest. No more connections, no more ties, no more association. Voznesensky would be free.\n\nCalling a trusted courier into his office, he ordered the young man to send the letter straight away - his purpose would be official state business, and the contents classified. He placed faith in the deliverer to complete his task timely - for Voznesensky did not know how long these ties could last before being thrust, in an intrusive display, to the unaware public.\n\nThe young courier nodded his head at the command, and was dismissed straight away. His duties were evident to both men, and it was best for him to start accomplishing it. As he left, Voznesensky smiled. Relaxed now, he sat back into his chair and muttered."
 KOM.8.a: "Severance, at last."

 KOM.9.t: "Our Connections Leaked!"
 KOM.9.d: "A crisis has engulfed Komi! Although this headline is not a new one, the details of this particular story have interested both the public and the politicians alike.\n\nAn unknown 'associate' of Nikolai Voznesensky has come forward with damaging information about him - in particular, his connections with a certain radical socialist named Andrei Zhdanov. The leaked documents detail the extent of the connections, highlighting the relationship between Zhdanov and Voznesensky and showing the amount of collaboration.\n\nThe Voznesentsi has been completely shattered by the news, as highly tempered debates run wild in the meeting minutes and legislative sessions following the story being broken. Voznesensky now must face the consequences of his actions, and has already come to a solution regarding how this mess will be handled."
 KOM.9.b: "This never happened."

 KOM.10.t: "Admitting Fault"
 KOM.10.d: "Friends of the party and of the Republic. I am aware that you all now know of the allegations regarding my ties to Zhdanov. I must say, with complete truth, that these ties have existed, and-"\n\nShocked exclamations and murmurs filled the chamber as the depths of the situation sunk in to the politicians in attendance. For a solid minute, anarchy ruled over the chamber as arguments began over Voznesenky's true loyalty, only ending when the head of the session declared order be held in the assembly.\n\n"These ties have existed, yes. But these ties are now cut. And they will remain cut for good. My loyalty is not to Zhdanov, but to this Republic we preside over. I implore you all to consider this. Thank you."\n\nThe politicians look over at him, all eyes boring down upon Voznesenky. The fate of his leadership relies on them. And now, they must vote on it."
 KOM.10.a: "The Party will decide your fate."
 KOM.10.b: "The Party will decide your fate."

 KOM.11.t: "Finding Forgiveness"
 KOM.11.d: "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nAnticipation rocked the air as the first hands went up to mark him innocent. After taking the census, the hands now went up to mark him in contempt. Somewhere in Voznesensky's eyes, a glitter showed up.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky, the votes have been counted... by a margin of one hundred and twenty two to seventy eight, you have been found absolved of any crime revealed by these documents presented before us."Voznesensky couldn't help but crack a smile. A closer margin than he would have liked? Sure. Yet, despite the turmoil, he was free."
 KOM.11.a: "Lenient, perhaps."

 KOM.12.t: "There will be no Forgiveness"
 KOM.12.d: "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nThe result was quick to arrive. By a margin of one hundred and sixty to forty, Voznesenky was found guilty of his crimes against the Komi Republic, and will be held in contempt of the legislation chamber. Voznesensky's expression was neutral throughout the vote, revealing nothing of his inner mind or plans. But his expression did not matter anymore. His fate has been sealed, for the talks of removing Voznesensky from power have already begun in the room - and they show no signs of letting up."
 KOM.12.a: "No peace. No respite. No mercy."

 KOM.13.t: "Covering the Evidence"
 KOM.13.d: "The sounds of whitewashing broadcasted itself to an almost empty woods. As the shovel dug on, and the briefcase stood firm in the slight moonlight breeze, the man couldn't help think of the circumstances that led to this point. He had obtained the documents, yes - he sent loyal assistants to take care of that. Without anyone knowing, he had slipped out of Syktyvkar during the dead of night, indeed - he arranged it on an official 'private outing' for the next few days, and he thought, at least, no one suspected the wiser.\n\nThe waxing gibbous and a flashlight was the only sources reflecting on his face, yet on his soul reflected much. But his resolve was clear. He must not let this come to light. Otherwise, too much would be at stake. It was for the good of the Republic, he imagined, as the shovel did the last shoveling of its dirt."
 KOM.13.a: "Bury it deep."

 KOM.14.t: "A Leak into a Downpour"
 KOM.14.d: "Voznesensky placed his head down on his desk. An unfortunate courier had delivered news of another set of documents revealed to the public. Not the first time the news was brought to him, Voznesensky simply sighed and dismissed the messenger, muttering a curse word to him under his breath.\n\nEver since the evidence was disposed of, the Republic, and the Voznesentsi in particular, have been wracked by yet another political crisis. This one, however, struck the party nerve to the limit. The anonymous source has not slumbered, as new documents and evidence are leaked daily to the Party and the public. Suspicious of Voznesensky due to him not testifying and seeing less of a necessity politicians loyal to him grow fewer by the day.\n\nIn addition to this, rumours have surfaced of even further ties to Zhdanov, to the point where both men would be comfortable with each other in a meeting, swapping jokes as a socialist revolution is plotted. While these are only rumors, they have still dented the reputation of the party, and threaten to destroy entirely the relative internal peace within the legislation chamber."
 KOM.14.a: "Could it be unstoppable?"

 KOM.15.t: "Hunting the Source"
 KOM.15.d: ""Gentlemen and ladies of the party. The accusations that befall me are quite obviously untrue. Yet despite this, these rumors continue to flow, and damage our wonderful republic. Due to this..."\n\n"This man is a traitor!" outbursts a Deputy, and the entire chamber erupts into chaos. The evident loss of trust in Voznesensky within some sectors of the party continues to manifest itself, until a screech drowns out the arguments and brings order once again to the room.\n\nHolding his microphone, Voznesensky continues. "Now. These rumors are false, yet they damage us. We cannot allow the source of these rumors to continue shrouded in darkness. An investigative committee must, and will be formed. This investigation will encompass any suspected spreader of these rumors. Whoever it is, we will find them, and justice will be served."\n\nThe members, coincidentally Voznesenky's most trusted advisors, have already been selected, and the investigation now begins."
 KOM.15.a: "Come out, come out..."

 KOM.16.t: "The Party Compromised!"
 KOM.16.d: "Voznesensky and his investigative committee glanced at each other with suspense. Progress has been minimal so far into the investigation, and no leads produced conclusive results.\n\nThe tension was shattered with the bursting of a door, and the rushing of a committee member into the room. "The damned Soviet bastards! They're watching us!"\n\nThrough an informant with more loyalty to Voznesensky than previously thought, a sweeping revelation came to the attention of the committee: the party - specifically, Voznesensky's own wing of the party - had been infiltrated by spies. Further questioning revealed that these spies were under the command of none other than Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, suspected leader of the many socialist and communist parties and paramilitaries in the Komi Republic.\n\nAfter being told the news, Voznesensky mirrored the faces of the rest of the committee: near-panic. A decision had to be made quickly in order for the agents not to find out - crack immediately down on them, or wait and see what to do next?"
 KOM.16.a: "Drop the hammer!"
 KOM.16.b: "There will be no hasty moves."

 KOM.17.t: "The Democrats' Purge"
 KOM.17.d: ""The vote is passed. The expulsion of these agents will begin in due process, with no exceptions."\n\nMany members of the democratic party began to sweat. The purge of suspected "agents working for Suslov" began shortly after, with police storming into the legislative chamber and beginning to arrest previously suspected agents. While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. "Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.""
 KOM.17.a: "How many could there be?"

 KOM.18.t: "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 KOM.18.d: "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies were in a state of hysteria. Accusations flew like never before, hostility was palpable, and all worried about the ties of even those persons sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on "destroying the Suslov agents", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do."\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with all eyes weighing up Stalina in disquiet. "I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it."\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually ceased, and some token applause was offered. Most, however, were worried by Stalina admission that a conspiracy as they feared was not beyond her means. Perhaps it would be best not to think on it too deeply."
 KOM.18.a: "Ironic."
 KOM.18.b: "She isn't wrong."

 KOM.19.t: "A Plot!"
 KOM.19.d: "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 KOM.19.a: "Can we stop it in time?"

 KOM.20.t: "A Smoking Gun"
 KOM.20.d: ""Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention."\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. "This man - a traitor of the republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. "Excellent."\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 KOM.20.a: "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 KOM.20.b: "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."

 KOM.21.t: "Blackmailing the Problem"
 KOM.21.d: "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. "I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita."With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example..."Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? "The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife-"Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 KOM.21.a: "Just what he deserves."

 KOM.22.t: "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 KOM.22.d: "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 KOM.22.a: "He will not be missed."

 KOM.23.t: "The Innocent Verdict"
 KOM.23.d: ""He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down."\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 KOM.23.a: "An innocent on our conscience."
 KOM.23.b: "Retract the story!"

 KOM.24.t: "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 KOM.24.d: "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Alexei Kosygin and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Kosygin and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 KOM.24.a: "You should have listened, Nikolai."

 KOM.25.t: "The Vote of No Confidence"
 KOM.25.d: "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Komi Republic. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes."\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 KOM.25.a: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.25.b: "Out with the old?"
 KOM.25.c: "Out with the old?"

 KOM.26.t: "Deprecated"
 KOM.26.d: "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards."\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Kosygin or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Kosygin blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 KOM.26.a: "A new name to learn..."

 KOM.27.t: "Kosygin Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.27.d: "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin."\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Komi Republic. Vowing to steer the republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Komi Republic."
 KOM.27.a: "A change for the better?"

 KOM.28.t: "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 KOM.28.d: "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out."\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Komi Republic. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 KOM.28.a: "Let's see how she does."
 
 KOM.2800.t: "Voznesensky Endures!"
 KOM.2800.d: "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now."As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands."The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office..."Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 KOM.2800.a: "How does he survive?"

 KOM.29.t: "Discrediting the Leakers"
 KOM.29.d: ""Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here."\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 KOM.29.a: "Truth? It does not matter."

 KOM.30.t: "The Party Fades"
 KOM.30.d: "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to."\n\nThe meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back.\n\n"These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.""
 KOM.30.a: "A small price to pay."

 KOM.31.t: "The Popularity Debate"
 KOM.31.d: "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic parties among the people.\n\n"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the coalition has become full of worriers and defeatists," the DSNP candidate begins. "Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please."\n\n"Democracy is virtuous - but it is fragile, when faced with extremism and growing disregard for the very foundation of our Republic." Stalina comments. "It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists, in the name of preserving our homeland from hatred and tyranny. That is all."\n\nIt took barely a second for Kosygin to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. "Thank you. Stalina is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists - the uncommitted citizens who have been unfortunately waylaid by impossible promises - we may be able to draw them into support for democracy. My statement is done."\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 KOM.31.a: "Voznesensky is correct."
 KOM.31.b: "Kosygin has the best argument."
 KOM.31.e: "Stalina presents the optimal solution."

 KOM.32.t: "The Voznesentsi's Solution"
 KOM.32.d: "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis."\n\n"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan... or rather, the lack of one," he muttered under his breath, "...has been passed."\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."
 KOM.32.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.33.t: "Soyuz Molodih Reformatorov's Solution"
 KOM.33.d: "The applause echoed across the chamber. The debate was over, and now was the hour for choosing what exactly must be done to save the democratic parties from losing their grip on Komi, before it was too late.\n\n"Comrades, the vote will now begin. Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please."\n\nWhile the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n"By a margin of forty, Comrade Kosygin's plan will be put into motion."\n\nAlexei Kosygin is a rational man. While he believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, he also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic parties. Kosygin's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Stalina's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under his hand, democracy shall reach salvation."
 KOM.33.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.34.t: "Demokraticheskiy Vybor Rossii's Solution"
 KOM.34.d: "Following the debate and usual applause that came with its end, the delegates were asked to vote on the 'winner' of the debate, and in turn, decide the plan that would end the falling popularity of the democratic party.\n\n"Delegates of this dear republic, it is now time to begin our voting for this debate's winner. Decide and cast your vote now..."\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. "The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."
 KOM.34.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.35.t: "Stalina's Compromise"
 KOM.35.d: "After Stalina spoke her closing statement, the clapping of hands - albeit a little forced - echoed in the room. The debate had concluded, and now, the delegates had to make their choice on the course that the party must take to combat falling poll numbers.\n\n"Comrades of Komi, the voting process for the winner of these debates begins now. Please cast your votes."\n\nAfter a moment, the moderator looked at the box. It wasn't even close.\n\n"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Stalina's plan has been passed."\n\nStalina is a woman who was determined to defend democracy. In her view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the republic. Anti-extremist measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented "citizen's informational media" will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And, with this, in her eyes - the republic would be saved."
 KOM.35.a: "Let's hope it works."

 KOM.36.t: "A Message from Zhdanov"
 KOM.36.d: "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short." I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these. "He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 KOM.36.a: "You're welcome... comrade?"

 KOM.37.t: "Taking the Internal Files"
 KOM.37.d: "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 KOM.37.a: "What could go wrong?"
 KOM.37.b: "We've seen this one before..."

 KOM.38.t: "The Informational Arsenal"
 KOM.38.d: "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - "Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.""
 KOM.38.a: "Perfection!"

 KOM.39.t: "Better than the Others"
 KOM.39.d: "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration." He awaited Zhdanov's next words."
 KOM.39.a: "Thanks, but no thanks."

 KOM.40.t: "Suslov's Secrets"
 KOM.40.d: "Voznesensky looked over at the document with a stone-cold expression. Next to him was Petro Grigorenko, his Chief of the General Staff, and Yegor Ligachev, his security minister. All three of them were discussing the documents that had been seen so far, with only two left to go over together. Already, orders had been sent to police around the Republic to prepare for seizure and securing of Communist assets, and appropriate arrests had been carried out in secret. The spoils of these documents had almost been fully reaped, and it seemed that all was almost finished in action.\n\n"Comrades Ligachev, Grigorenko. These two documents and we're finished. Let's see what else is in this pile."The second-to-last document was unearthed from the stack of papers: a long-term operational plan ordered by and carried out by Yuri Andropov, one of Suslov's lieutenants. After a coup of the democratic government, the operation states that the Communist party would expand its territory to other warlord states nearby, eventually taking over much of the old Union."\n\nThe three men glanced at each other before reading the next document: a conversation between Arvids Pelshe, a key figure on the left, and Suslov. After reading the document, which seemed more like Suslov giving orders to his inferior, the three men discussed it.\n\nFollowing their discussion, they agreed to gather the briefcase and guard it in a secure place, where none could see the machinations inside."
 KOM.40.a: "A treasure worth any price."

 KOM.41.t: "A Plan Foiled?"
 KOM.41.d: "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."
 KOM.41.a: "Perhaps we'll never know."

 KOM.42.t: "Zhdanov's Favor"
 KOM.42.d: "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely."Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. "Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-"He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. "Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. "You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai."Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."
 KOM.42.a: "Do we have a choice?"
 
 KOM.421.t: "Reporting for Duty"
 KOM.421.d: ""Comrade Oplesnin-..." The phone call failed, a common occurrence in Syktyvkar that the Deputy who once dispatched from the Halls of the Kremlin never quite grew used. Pestered, Zhdanov made another attempt: "Comra-..." This second call ended up sooner than the last one. Zhdanov would rather not make a call in the afternoon when all the few lines available are busy with bureaucrats trying to request papers from their managers. Still, the issue was too important to be postponed, so he dialed again. "Comrade Oplesnin..."\n\n"Comrade Zhdanov, is that you, my old friend?"\n\nOn the other side of the line, there stood a tired old man who seldom left his dacha these days, yet who, throughout the decades, saw more battles than half the Republic's military. General Oplesnin knew what Zhdanov wanted with that call. However, he didn't see himself as fit for action anymore; he had led his life like he led his battalions to the frontlines, marching forward with pride and effort only to be torn apart by enemy artillery. No one could be more tired of combat, pain, and glory. But then his eyes caught sight of his Order of Lenin at the wall, awarded by Zhdanov's hand, and set his mind remembering...\n\nThe triumph of the Revolution would be the only thing great enough to justify it. All that fighting would be a vain waste of many lives, including his own, if not redeemed by putting Russia at the hands of the workers. After some more dialectical confabulation, the general gave his caller what he wanted "Comrade Zhdanov, my life is at the hands of the Party."\n\nNikolai Oplesnin took his old uniform out of the closet and got himself properly dressed. If he would be a soldier again, he should make himself feel like one. His first battle would be against the General Staff's telephone.\n\n"General Nikolai Oplesnin, presenting himself for duty.""
 KOM.421.a: ""I am ready for any assignment.""
 KOM.421.a.tt: "Nikolai Oplesnin becomes a General."

 KOM.422.t: "Nighttime Suspicions"
 KOM.422.d: "It was the dark of night when Pyotr Grigorenko, the Republican military's Chief of Staff, telephoned Svetlana Stalina. He had deliberated about the call for some time, worried that she would be disturbed from sleep, and thus unreceptive to his imperative.\n\nHe need not have been. Barely one ring had passed when the call was answered, and the voice all in the Republic knew well answered him decisively. Like himself, Stalina was most active during the nighttime hours, finding them free of distraction and an optimal time to accomplish work. Equally aware of her disdain for wasting time, he got right to the point.\n\nNikolai Oplesnin had been appointed to the Republic's General Staff. His General Staff. And he was most concerned. The man was both qualified and proficient, true, but that was not his worry. Oplesnin's past was. It was impossible to overlook his activities under Bukharin's regime and, thus, his potential ties with the WRRF.\n\nGrigorenko was both surprised and heartened by Stalina's immediate agreement. She shared his concerns, particularly those concerning the absolute necessity of preventing communist infiltration of Republican state organs. Oplesnin had to be watched, closely. They, therefore, quickly came to an agreement of coordination.\n\nIf only the Republic as a whole could be so decisive as Stalina was, Grigorenko thought as he replaced the receiver."
 KOM.422.a: "Keep a close watch."

 KOM.43.t: "The Chaos Increases"
 KOM.43.d: "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n"This is the perfect opportunity!"Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. "These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!""Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?"Voznesensky replied back. "They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything.""You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it."\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 KOM.43.a: "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."
 KOM.43.b: "Send them in, mop them up."
 KOM.43.c: "We shall be everywhere and nowhere."

 KOM.44.t: "No Need to Panic"
 KOM.44.d: "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 KOM.44.a: "The problem solves itself."

 KOM.45.t: "The Shifting Tides"
 KOM.45.d: "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 KOM.45.a: "Concerning..."

 KOM.46.t: "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 KOM.46.d: "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 KOM.46.a: "How could it have gotten so far?"

 KOM.47.t: "Embracing the Moderates"
 KOM.47.d: "The poll numbers are up, for once."Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection."\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 KOM.47.a: "Something good comes out of this."

 KOM.48.t: "The Shifting Tides"
 KOM.48.d: "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 KOM.48.a: "Concerning..."

 KOM.49.t: "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 KOM.49.d: "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 KOM.49.a: "How could it have gotten so far?"

 KOM.50.t: "Peace through Superior Firepower"
 KOM.50.d: "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 KOM.50.a: "Do us proud."

 KOM.51.t: "A Cordial Request"
 KOM.51.d: "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. "From Zhdanov" was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the president of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldiers gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."
 KOM.51.a: "Why would we?"
 KOM.51.b: "Let's try it, at least."
 
 KOM.52.t: "A Propaganda Surge!"
 KOM.52.d: "A leaflet among many, distributed it in mass the last few weeks. "Where were you citizens, when the bourgeois government made open its ties to fascists and reactionaries?"\n\nThe leaflet fluttered down the street. The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. "The so called democrats have always been threats to the worker's revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots! "\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."
 KOM.52.a: "Damnation!"
 
 KOM.53.t: "Suspicions within the Party"
 KOM.53.d: "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 KOM.53.a: "Another trap!"
 
 KOM.54.t: "Silver Bullet Holes"
 KOM.54.d: "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."
 KOM.54.a: "The only upside..."
 
 KOM.55.t: "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 KOM.55.d: "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 KOM.55.a: "Could it even work?"
 
 KOM.56.t: "A Bloodless Victory"
 KOM.56.d: "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshare is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unsscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."
 KOM.56.a: "A surprise, but a welcome one."
 
 KOM.57.t: "Silent Contemplation"
 KOM.57.d: "Stalina's office was tucked away in a distant corner of the building. This suited her, for few party members or employee ever wandered into her room by mistake. All the better to lose herself in thinking.\n\nLike her boss Voznesensky she liked to keep a clean office. In Komi, a small bubble of relative stability had been established from the Russian Anarchy. Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."
 KOM.57.a: "Useful, someday."
 
 KOM.58.t: "Svetlana's Theories"
 KOM.58.d: "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the president of the republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet ?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Kosygin. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."
 KOM.58.a: "We need her more than ever."
 KOM.58.b: "We can't afford to need her this much."
 
 KOM.59.t: "A Victory for Publicity"
 KOM.59.d: "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door. \n\n"Yes, you can enter."\n\nThe president did so.\n\n"Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you."\n\nThe older politician smiled.\n\n"Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food."\n\n"Only if you pay, Comrade President.""
 KOM.59.a: "Let's hope there's no backlash."
 
 KOM.60.t: "A Victory For Internal Affairs"
 KOM.60.d: "The president continued his walk. Useful as she may be, the rising star of the party still had to be reined in. Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her. But it might at least serve as a cold shower on her ambition by signalling to her that the party was watching."
 KOM.60.a: "We should calm her down some."
 
 KOM.61.t: "Suslov Rampant"
 KOM.61.d: "As the conflict between the centrist government and the far right militia escalates, troubling news are spreading from several areas of Syktyvkar. As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly. A great deal of his activities are now going unchallenged, as his opponents are busy with one another."
 KOM.61.a: "Damnation!"
 
 KOM.62.t: "A Reconstruction Government?"
 KOM.62.d: "Secret meetings are part and parcel of political life in Komi. Yet it takes a special set of circumstances for the absolute highest level of security to be deployed. Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Chairman Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."
 KOM.62.a: "Perhaps we can do it... if needed."
 KOM.62.b: "This is too far."
 
 KOM.63.t: "Considerations"
 KOM.63.d: "The heads of the DSNP and SMR, as well as the Chairman of the National Assembly, have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the three men's heads. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Chairman Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 KOM.63.a: "Placated, for now."
 
 KOM.64.t: "A Meeting on the Side"
 KOM.64.d: "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Kosygin's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Kosygin would support the young politician's proposal."
 KOM.64.a: "Perhaps a new approach is feasible after all."
 
 KOM.65.t: "Zhdanovite Connections Revealed!"
 KOM.65.d: "Kosygin often found his cabinet had devolved back into a mess of shuffled papers and documents. He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as "coming from a friend". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nKosygin folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Kosygin break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."
 KOM.65.a: "A traitor at the very top...?"
 
 KOM.66.t: "Beginning the Investigation"
 KOM.66.d: "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Kosygin's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the president of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the president would deny everything. Stalina and Kosygin's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."
 KOM.66.a: "Ask him for answers. Now."
 KOM.66.b: "There's no need for confrontation."
 
 KOM.67.t: "The Confrontation"
 KOM.67.d: "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Kosygin sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 KOM.67.a: "Oh?"
 
 KOM.68.t: "A Stable Partnership"
 KOM.68.d: "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Kosygin. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Kosygin slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the president to shake his hand. "Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize.". The president shook her hand."
 KOM.68.a: "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 
 KOM.69.t: "The Conspiracy"
 KOM.69.d: "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Kosygin and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Kosygin on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 KOM.69.a: "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 
 KOM.70.t: "Approaching the Left"
 KOM.70.d: "Stalina's affinity with the social democratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Chairman Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the DSNP to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the president spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 KOM.70.a: "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 
 KOM.71.t: "Our Cover Blown!"
 KOM.71.d: "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe president casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Kosygin. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Kosygin first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the Liberal Party's leader. Kosygin was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the president and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Chairman Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe president didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."
 KOM.71.a: "Is nobody loyal? Bury this!"
 KOM.71.b: "Give it one last try. Come clean."
 
 KOM.72.t: "Burying the Dirt"
 KOM.72.d: "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Kosygin's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\nIt was all they could do... But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Kosygin of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Kosygin and Stalina."
 KOM.72.a: "May it never again arise."
 
 KOM.73.t: "Traitors to Democracy?"
 KOM.73.d: "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Kosygin had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."
 KOM.73.a: "Can Komi be saved?"
 
 KOM.74.t: "A Successful Ploy"
 KOM.74.d: "'And so, the contradictions of capitalism shall lead to a World War, bringing in the new phase of world socialism.'\n\nSuslov's theory has proven itself accurate. With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad "coalition for democracy", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, Gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted. All that remained to be done was finally break the opposition, and the red flag would fly once more."
 KOM.74.a: "Make it so."
 
 KOM.75.t: "The Confession"
 KOM.75.d: "Voznesensky and the party's whips were breathing down their necks. Time was running out. And so Kosygin decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Kosygin's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of the Liberals, the President of the Republic simply said "Well?"once both were alone. Kosygin sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Kosygin began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."
 KOM.75.a: "Is it enough?"
 
 KOM.76.t: "The Leak Revealed"
 KOM.76.d: "The thought could initially be put aside by Kosygin. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the president and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Kosygin's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the president figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Kosygin didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nKosygin called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."
 KOM.76.a: "How is this possible?"
 
 KOM.77.t: "The Eye of the Enemy"
 KOM.77.d: "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Kosygin or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Kosygin's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Kosygin's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Kosygin's theory.\n\nKosygin was the first to break the silence. "So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the president of being a Zhanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the president that his own party was rebellious." He nodded gravely. "If Suslov was behind the leak to the president, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or president Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down."\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent. The implications were too catastrophic to discuss out loud."

 KOM.79.t: "A Request for a Ceasefire"
 KOM.79.d: "The violent struggle between the government and the far left had left an opening for Gumilyov's scheme. Now the spectre of a far right take-over haunted Komi's young republic. Far-right paramilitaries had begun crawling out of their districts, moving into democratic and communist territories alike as the depleted manpower of both faction left them unable to oppose this take-over.\n\nIt was a risk for a face-to-face meeting to occur between Zhdanov and the president. But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe president listened to Zhdanov's case without comment. Any question he asked might reveal information about the government's position. When the Communist leader finally fell silent, Voznesensky announced his intentions..."
 KOM.79.a: "He's gone too far."
 KOM.79.b: "Let's keep this between us..."
 
 KOM.80.t: "Refusing the Ceasefire"
 KOM.80.d: "The response was short, and polite. Voznesensky explained to Zhdanov that the government had no intention of ending the pressure on the communists.\n\nZhdanov excused himself and walked back to his bodyguards. The president watched his old friend being driven away, his expression indecipherable. Soon, he too had gone back to his bodyguards. His car soon drove off in the night."
 KOM.80.a: "There will be blood."
 
 KOM.81.t: "The Split Front"
 KOM.81.d: "Had there ever been a lull in the fighting? For the briefest of moments, the governmental and communist militias had stopped their clashes. Had it been fear at the rise of the far right militias? Or perhaps some inscrutable order from on top.\n\nThe lull, if it had ever existed, was shattered by a renewal of the violence. Both sides fought savagely. After all, only the extermination of the other would allow the victor to turn around to face the far right.\n\nSomewhere in Syktyvkar, Gumilyov smiled over a map of the city. Things were progressing smoothly."
 KOM.81.a: "We must only hope it was the right choice."
 
 KOM.82.t: "Zhdanov's Ceasefire"
 KOM.82.d: "One day the government's troops were attacking communist districts. The next, the democratic coalition's men were redeploying across the city. New positions were drafted to stop the progression of the far right's men.\n\nNo official announcement was made on the topic. It was left to the public to deduce the loose alliance that now united the communist and democrats. After all, the new combat lines of the reds and democrats would have made no sense otherwise. Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions. The government's temporary united front with the communist appeared to be working as intended."
 KOM.82.a: "Allies across the lines."
 
 KOM.83.t: "A Traitor?"
 KOM.83.d: "The two politicians were united by their distrust of the ceasefire with the reds. Stalina loathed the extremist factions for endangering Komi, while the more moderate Kosygin was worried less by the ceasefire than its implication. How the hell had the president managed to reach a deal with the reds? To the liberal leader's eyes, this secret deal meant the president must have held secret ties to the far left.\n\nThe 'rightist' members of the democratic coalition began planning a joint action against Voznesensky.

The message was a set of deployment order to governmental militias, arraying them to the rear of almost every communist militia. The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find. The government's panic demonstrated their guilt. The plan had been the annihilation of every communist brigade that could be trapped on the front line against the far right. Now everybody knew of the democrats' duplicity."

The president burning his last contact method to hear his old friend's silent fury would not be productive.\n\nVoznesensky picked up the brick.

 KOM.124.d: "회색과 짙은 갈색 바다가 식팁카르의 유일한 괜찮은 호텔 무도장을 뒤덮었다. 6년 연속, 이곳은 우파와 자유주의자들의 정치적 집회의 현장이었을 뿐만 아니라 공산주의자들의 공간 활용의 차례가 되었다. 이것 때문에, 그 장소는 거의 보편적으로 도청당하고 있는 것으로 추정되었다. 물론, 어느 정당이든 이 혐의를 드러내는 것은 그들 자신의 비행에 대해 즉각적으로 맞닥뜨리기 때문에, 일반적으로 무도장에서 모든 공공 문제를 처리하고 호텔 뒤쪽 공터에서 실제 협상을 하는 것이 모두에게 이익이 되기 때문에, 아무도 이것을 인정하고 싶어하지 않았다.\n\n미하일 수슬로프가 중요한 당 인사들로 구성된 긴 테이블의 중앙에 있는 연단에 자리를 잡으며 무대 위를 걸을 때 낡은 의사봉의 날카로운 박수소리에 방이 정돈되었다. 물론, 수슬로프는 그들 중 대부분을 거기에 놓은 장본인이었고, 그들을 정렬시킬 수 있는 수단을 가지고 있었다. 그것이 바로 그의 현재 일을 그렇게 짜증나게 만든 것이다.\n\n"Comrades, I am pleased to announce that the Komi Communist Party's Presidential candidate for the upcoming elections is Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov."\n\nStilted applause, the flashes of cameras, and cheers rippled across the crowd as the Andropov strode up the aisle, with what Suslov knew was a very pained smile. Suslov exchanged a quick handshake with him onstage, and, with an almost fearful feeling in the back of his mind, went on for a few minutes about how bright the Republic's future would be following the victory of their new candidate.\n\nInside, of course, Suslov's feelings were quite different. He had built this organization up from nothing, and everyone who had a position here had it because he allowed it. As he stepped back and watched Andropov stoically address the designated associates in the crowd, Suslov knew this was a risk. Andropov did not want the Presidency, but the fact that nearly no loyalists remained who could take the position was a point of great concern. There was simply no alternative - and Suslov wondered if this would eventually prove to be a fatal misstep."

 KOM.125.d: "The lighting in Mikhail Suslov's office flickered a few times before going out entirely, a side effect of Syktyvkar's often-unreliable power grid. Suslov barely took notice, dispensing two cups' worth of tea from the samovar in the corner and lighting a practically-ancient oil lamp. "Svetlana Nikolaevna," he intoned to the woman sitting on the other side of his neatly organized desk, "Your name carries a great deal of importance in this party. Your father, for all his flaws -"\n\n"Mikhail, while I appreciate the flattery," Bukharina said coolly. "I know you haven't called me here to talk about my family name."\n\nSuslov smiled, as if his guest had lived up to his expectations. "Of course. Comrade Bukharina," he began. "Zhdanov has his sights on me and the political order I have created. What I am asking of you is to work with me to keep him in line." Bukharina eyed him warily, not reacting. "I shall not speak in terms of personal loyalty – I know you, and you know me. We are both above such posturing. I would not be surprised if Zhdanov has already made some sort of proposal to you, and if he has not, I envision he shall soon."\n\n"And, comrade General Secretary?"\n\n"I would simply like to reiterate what should be a self-evident truth: Zhdanov will dispose of you and your associates the instant I am gone. The man desires-"\n\n"You dare to suggest that you're any different?"\n\n"Svetlana Nikolaevna, you know how I operate." Suslov paused, sipping tea. "I am not one for leading from the front. Why do you think you have advanced this far in a party with this much anti-Bukharinite sentiment? Goodwill alone? Your family name? I need people at my side."\n\nInternally, Bukharina had to acknowledge he was right, at least in part. She had been the recipient of Suslov's patronage time and time again. "So what would be saying is that I have a choice between being a puppet under you - and dead under Zhdanov."\n\n"Cruder terminology than I would have used, but directionally correct, Comrade Bukharina. You have a simple choice." Suslov put the teacup down. "Stay the course and continue your meteoric and unexpected rise to power, or throw away everything that has gotten you this far for the privilege of being executed by our dear friend Andrei the moment he sees no more use for you.""

 KOM.126.t: "The New Duumvirate?"
 KOM.126.d: ""Let me guess, you've come to approach me about Comrade Suslov," Bukharina said flatly. If the stocky, mustached man standing athwart the doorframe of her office was at all surprised, he didn't show it.\n\n"Yes, Svetlana," stated Zhdanov. "How'd you know?"\n\n"Intuition. Come in, sit down."\n\n"Then you're a very smart woman indeed," Zhdanov noted with obvious insincerity, declining to take a seat but closing the door behind him. "I've come to talk to you about the snake in our midst. The serpent wrapped around the heart of this Party–"\n\n"I get it. What exactly do you want?" Svetlana responded.\n\n"It's nothing personal against Suslov," Zhdanov continued, his tone now emphatic and frank. "It's just that this party could be run much more efficiently without that rat's lackeys clogging up the machinery. We could do something great, Svetlana. You and I, together, at the helm. Without him breathing down our necks."\n\nBukharina looked back, unconvinced.\n\n"Specifics, Andrei. When, where, and what?"\n\n"There are no specifics yet. Things are... still up in the air. Keep your ear to the ground. You'll hear from me when it's time."\n\n"What the hell am I supposed to do with that?"\n\n"Think, Svetlana, think. You can't live as Suslov's pawn forever–"\n\n"That's an awfully bold statement from someone asking for help," Svetlana noted with a not-so-subtle hint of tactically-induced irritation.\n\n"I can hear it in your voice, Bukharina. You know it's true."\n\n"Our relationship is hardly one of dependence and subordination," Bukharina countered calmly, her voice suddenly placid and professional. "Nonetheless, your offer will be taken under consideration."\n\n"A solid choice. We'll be in touch." With that, Zhdanov was gone."
 KOM.126.a: "Have Zhdanov speak to his contacts first."

 KOM.127.t: "Approaching the Voznesentsi"
 KOM.127.d: "Compared to the austere headquarters of his own party, Zhdanov noted, the Voznesentsy's nerve-center was a roiling pit of barely-ordered chaos. Even Voznesensky's office was something of a wreck, with countless economic charts and graphs pinned to the wall with a variegated array of metal pushpins and other sharp objects.\n\nYet Voznesensky's demeanor could not have been more to the contrary. Although he scarcely cut an authoritative figure in his plaid sport-coat and bow tie, he nonetheless carried the serene, softly dominant aura of a Persian satrap, watching his numerous aides and underlings with a dispassionate eye.\n\n"Nikolai, I thought we would be speaking privately," Zhdanov said with slight irritation.\n\n"My apologies for the dust, Andrei. The upcoming elections have our headquarters in...disarray," Voznesensky explained. "Only physically, of course," he quickly added. Zhdanov's host motioned to an adjacent, empty, conference room. Voznesensky waited until his guest was seated to direct the conversation to the nebulous "business" Zhdanov was so keen to discuss in private.\n\n"To put it simply, Nikolai," Zhdanov said, "I'm asking for your backing in the settling of a political score." These words alone didn't take Voznesensky by surprise, it was the name that came next that did. Mikhail goddamned Suslov.\n\n"With all due respect, Andrei...I don't see how this concerns our party. All concerns of practicality or wisdom aside, this is an internal matter for your party. Suslov's goons are a non-entity for us."\n\n"You're very quick to deny the existence of half of your own party's membership," Zhdanov shot back in a retort he'd been practicing in his head for longer than he really wanted to admit. A half-second later, his host acknowledged him with an eye-roll.\n\n"Do I really need to list the reasons your party would benefit from taking Suslov out of the equation?"\n\nVoznesensky was much too self-conscious to respond verbally, but nodded with understanding.\n\n"What kind of support are you looking for?""

 KOM.128.t: "Preparing the Knife"
 KOM.128.d: "Bukharina knew exactly who it was when her phone rang the first time, but didn't answer.\n\nAs much as she hated to admit it, she was legitimately feeling indecisive. Svetlana felt like something out of a cartoon - an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, each stridently pleading their case into her ears. Except in this case, neither was an angel, and both were probably lying.\n\nThe phone rang a second time.\n\nSuslov, on the one hand, was arguably the safe bet. He was, after all, the puppetmaster of the whole Republic. But the red maestro's sickeningly self-assured words gnawed at her.\n\n"Directionally correct."\n\nAs much as she hated to acknowledge it, Zhdanov was not entirely wrong, and, despite her better impulses, his words had gotten to her. The fact remained that, if she was to ever take the helm of the Komi state, Suslov would have to be gone. A man like him could not be brought to heel or compromised with. He had to be broken, and on that level, Zhdanov's words had some value.\n\nThe phone rang a third time.\n\nOf course, Bukharina could not forget the fact that anything coming out of Zhdanov's mouth was almost certain to bare venomous fangs at her sooner or later. Even compared to the two-faced bureaucrats of Komi, Zhdanov had always displayed a truly disturbing level of comfort with falsehood and deceit. In the bizarre political mirror-universe that was the Komi Republic, an offer of an alliance from Zhdanov was perhaps best considered a florid threat.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, however, was well acquainted with danger. Making up her mind, she picked up the phone as it rang a fourth time."

 KOM.129.t: "Confrontation with Mephistopheles"
 KOM.129.d: "The boyars shouted that the pretender to the throne should be put to death. And, as the actors launched into a rousing chorus with a crescendo of the theater's antique organ, the creaking of steps announced the presence of a visitor for Suslov, the Red Eminence of Komi.\n\nIt certainly wasn't a world-class performance of Boris Godunov that was being put on, Svetlana Bukharina mused as she climbed the rickety stairs to the Komi Grand Theater's lone luxury box parting a thin miasma of bluish cigarette smoke\n\n"To what do I owe the honor, Svetlana Nikolaevna?" Suslov intoned, his voice barely audible over the opera's musical clamor.\n\nBukharina did not respond, letting the tramp of further footsteps on the stairs and a stern look do the talking for her. Six hard-faced paramilitaries filed in behind her as the orchestra below unknowingly sounded a requiem for Komi's puppetmaster.\n\nAnd as his bodyguards shot him a look of sad resignation and holstered their weapons, Suslov knew that this time, he'd been outmaneuvered.\n\n"Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina began curtly, "I think it's time we have a talk." Suslov thought for a moment, running through possible scenarios, and forced a chuckle, regaining a bit of his confidence. He gestured to the militiamen. "I will be honest, Svetlana, I expected better of you."\n\nSvetlana looked right back at him. There was no mercy in those eyes. "As did I. Now, I think we should step out for a moment."\n\n"And for what reason would I do that?"\n\n"Because," hissed a voice from the stairwell. Andrei Zhdanov stepped into the box, flanked by Chelomei and Voytukevich. "I don't think you have a choice."\n\n"My, you people are quite efficient," remarked Suslov, verbally backtracking as he tried to buy time. But age had taken its toll. He had nowhere to run, no backup plan. His bodyguards had been paid off. He fumbled at his pants, trying to draw the pistol he barely knew how to use, but the advancing militiamen were faster, tackling him to the ground and sending his gun clattering across the floor.\n\nSvetlana let a slight smile cross her face. There was something deeply cathartic about seeing the spider become tangled in his own web."

 KOM.130.d: ""Go ahead, shoot me now, you'll only dig your own grave. The police will be here in minutes," Suslov said, feigning confidence.\n\n"Don't bother making a scene, Misha," Zhdanov said with relish. "The musicians have been told that if they stop playing for any reason, they'll be shot by a sniper in the rafters."\n\n"You bastards hired a sniper?" Suslov grunted as his hands were pulled behind his back by one of the paramilitaries.\n\n"No. It's yours," replied Bukharina. "They can't tell the difference."\n\n"You're a fool, Bukharina. Putting a bullet in my skull only means Zhdanov will put one in yours," Suslov said, a snarl creeping its way into his voice.\n\n"That's none of your concern, Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina shot back, pulling a silk dress glove out of her pocket and slipping it on her right hand.\n\nAt the same time, the militiamen pulled the handcuffed Suslov upright. Despite the blood running from his nose and the newly-acquired grime on his suit, Svetlana had to admit that Suslov still cut a striking figure as he examined his captor with disdain.\n\n"So what exactly shall I be forced to agree to?" Suslov sneered. "Surrendering my position? Declaring you Tsarina?"\n\n"Don't you even start with that," Bukharina scolded. "You've known me for long enough to know exactly what I want you to know."\n\n"A naked power grab, then. I shouldn't have expected much from the product of Nikolai's affair with his own secretary," Suslov hissed.\n\nBukharina bent over and slid her prisoner's gun into her gloved hand, screwing on a suppressor. Suslov's eyes widened with fear as she raised it, racking the slide. Pandemonium erupted in the box as Suslov writhed at his handcuffs, shouting breathlessly while Bukharina's men grabbed Zhdanov, and pulled him back towards the railing. The lead soloist launched into an aria, the orchestral accompaniment resounding throughout the hall. Chelomei shouted something, holding his boss back, both helplessly adrift in the ruins of their own plan.\n\nWithout so much as a word, Svetlana glanced over her shoulder at Zhdanov and put a bullet in her co-conspirator's head."

 KOM.13101.d: "The demands presented to her were utterly uncompromising, and Mikhail Suslov knew that he had no choice of not acceding to the document that Bukharina had unceremoniously handed to him the moment they made it to the black van parked out back. A van that, Suslov noticed with no lack of bitter amusement, was registered on his own orders. The pen in his hand twitched as he read through the list again, a cold feeling churning in his gut.\n\nLimitations on the power of General Secretary, an election for the position within three years, a freeze on party purges, an end to interference in local soviets' affairs. All unthinkable on their own - but combined, they formed a crushing, black wall that he could barely tolerate to look at.\n\nHe looked up at his former allies, who sat on the opposite side of the van. Bukharina's stare seemed to penetrate through him as if he wasn't there. He tried to send a glare back, but he couldn't muster it. There was something within him that he had not felt in a long time - resigned defeat. He opened his mouth to speak, the words as ash in his mouth. He knew that he sounded hurt. He couldn't help it.\n\n"I am... surprised that you allowed me to keep my membership within the Party, despite your commitment to stripping me of every ability that I have to keep this organization coherent," he managed. "Do you wish for a puppet, then? A reminder of your triumph?" He practically spat out the words, as he signed the paper.\n\nBukharina's gaze met his, utterly unsympathetic, as she spoke a single sentence. "Directionally correct, Comrade General Secretary."\n\nThe echo of his own words rang in his ears for as long as it took for him to hand over the paper, exit the van, and retire to his dacha, empty and alone."

 KOM.13102.d: "The moment Svetlana Bukharina crossed the threshold into her apartment, she pulled the silk glove out of her pocket, throwing it into the corner, and collapsed onto the couch she kept in the corner, next to her bird's cage. The red-feathered inhabitant was nowhere to be seen, and the door was askew, as she usually kept it - which she figured was good. She didn't want to be seen like this - not even by her pet.\n\nThe vision flickered through her mind again, and again, and again. An impulsive shot - the red mist exiting her old coworker's head, the light vanishing from his eyes in an instant. The sound of his dropping, Suslov staring at her impassively, the mad dash to the van through hidden corridors as sirens rang out in the distance. It repeated like the wail of the air-raid sirens that rang out whenever a German bomber decided to take a risk and go for the city's suburbs.\n\nShe looked down at the black blazer that she was wearing, accentuated by a crimson scarf. Blood-red - the same color that had escaped into the air after she pulled the trigger. The color of the people's flag. As she lay there on her back, staring at the crack in the ceiling that she wasn't home enough to patch, she tried to collect her thoughts. Regroup, refocus, repress the memory. Think of something else, anything else.\n\nHer stream of conscience was interrupted by a slight weight on her chest, and the feeling of tiny claws. The red-feathered, black-beaked countenance of her bird, perched atop the breast pocket of her blazer, looked right into her eyes, his head cocked to the side. She remembered feeding him a worm, and the quick snap of his beak. She smiled sadly, and spoke aloud for the first time since she had shot Andrei."

 KOM.146.d: "Reports from our government officials and associates talk regarding the program to gain the support of the native voting base, while mostly positive, show it has not been a clear success. As for the program itself, it was pulled off almost perfectly, going without a hitch. Many Komi welcomed the opportunity to receive help by the government and seem supportive of the new policy.\n\nIn general, some seem convinced by this, but despite this small boost in the popularity of the Social Democrats and the Coalition, it would be a lie to say we are fully satisfied with the results. The numbers we were hoping for were not achieved, and small hurdles in our way reduced the effectiveness, with many natives either not convinced due to the President's past, or simply indifferent to the new policy. It seems that this was not the help we are looking for to gain support in our struggle against the left and right."

Organized by the groups aimed at the preservation of Komi culture and tradition, some endorsed by the government, it has been a massive success.\n\nThe festival is located in one of the capital's major parks, in one of the safest neighborhoods, which has helped it avoid any paramilitary clashes. Many Komi took the opportunity to help in the festival, by participating in the exhibitions of anything from traditional clothes, to customs and music. The neighborhood has been flooded with the colorful patterns of the natives, and some artists have even helped create a fusion of these traditional designs with modern ideas for artistic masterpieces. The Museum of Komi Culture also cooperated, and has welcomed many visitors this week.\n\nIn general, the Festival seems to have been a massive success for the organizers. Many Russian citizens of Syktyvkar were actually ignorant of the Komi lifestyle and culture, and found this as a fascinating opportunity to educate themselves on it. Now, all of the city is more informed on what this civilization truly is."

 KOM.148.d: "One of the most well-known authors in the Komi Republic, Viktor Smirnov, who is in fact an ethnic Komi, has recently released one of his most popular books, "A History of Our Republic". The book details the history of modern Komi, from the creation of the autonomous territories by the Soviet Union, to its role as part of the WRRF, until its modern state. The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. "The History of Our Republic" has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Russians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, "A History of Our Republic" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."

 KOM.204.d: "The chief of police proudly looked at the note, carefully enclosed in a plastic bag as evidence. Its content was so simple, yet so helpful to his department: "Meet behind central Pazhga café, Thursday, 3:40 AM".\n\nIt had been found in a kitchen cupboard, likely hidden at first by everything else there. But one of his men had been thorough enough so as to search there, and there it was found. The chief knew two things: firstly, that man would be getting a promotion soon. Secondly, this was so big, he could very well be presenting his findings in front of the leaders of the party in the same day. Even he himself truly hoped that, after this entire hustle, Serov could finally be caught and face the consequences of his crimes."
 KOM.204.a: "Let's head to the meeting."

 KOM.205.t: "Ambushing the Ordosocialists"
 KOM.205.d: "Everything was in place for the perfect ambush. The days of hard work to track down one of the biggest political opponents in the socialist Komi Republic still at large had finally paid off. The note found in Serov's house had been enough for the government to follow on this lead, and prepare an attack on Serov at the scheduled meeting. After all, what did they have to lose from this?\n\nThe hit squad was composed of fifteen members, all coming from the army and experienced in battles, albeit usually ones between paramilitary units in the streets of Komi. Amidst the darkness of the night, they arrived in the small town of Pazhga in a dark black truck, going unnoticed by the local population there. In the dark road behind the city's largest café, which would certainly be empty at the time the meeting would be held, they prepared their positions. They hid behind walls and windows, or remained somewhere further away, ready to be called in by radio the instant the traitor made his appearance.\n\nAs the hour of the meeting came closer, the chief of squad, who had been obviously assigned responsible for organizing the ambush, had to make up his mind on what the optimal attack would be. He knew quite well that this could even be a trap for the Komi Red Army to derail their efforts. Thus, he had to inform the squad how hard to attack."
 KOM.205.a: "Ambush him with everything we have!"
 KOM.205.b: "This could very well be a trap..."

 KOM.206.t: "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 KOM.206.d: "For once, good news have come out of the Serov investigation. And the news couldn't be better, as that investigation is officially closed.\n\nAs it turned out, the meeting in Pazhga was not a delicate trap, but an honest action by Serov, who did not know we were planning to make our strike there. When he arrived at the specified time, the squad hidden in the road was easily be able to hit. Serov was caught wih his guard down, only having very few men with him, and so we managed to kill them all, including the traitor, and leave the area with very limited casualties.\n\nWith Serov dead, the figurehead of the Ordosocialist movement is gone forever, and no one is likely to replace him. His followers turn to other groups or flee the country, and his paramilitaries scatter in the countryside, only to be hunted down by the Komi Red Army. The Serov case has been deemed an absolute success."
 KOM.206.a: "We no longer have to worry now."

 KOM.207.t: "The Ambush Fails!"
 KOM.207.d: "The latest developments in the Serov case are not beneficial for the government in control of the nation. It appears that Serov was prepared to repel our ambush, and go on the counter-offensive.\n\nOur men initially seemed to be performing well, according to the reports of the surviving troops, but the traitor soon brought in his reinforcements. At around the same number as our own squad, they quickly dealt with the mild annoyance presented, and held back the enemy, while Serov managed to flee the area and move to an unknown location. While the Ordosocialist have still not been dealt with after this fiasco, at least the casualties of the "battle" were few for our own side."
 KOM.207.a: "That's something."

 KOM.208.t: "The Ambush Fails!"
 KOM.208.d: "The ambush planned against Serov in Pazhga could not have gone worse. In all likelihood, the Ordosocialist leader had left the note on purpose, and as such was completely aware of what was coming for him. When our troops came out of their hiding spots, and tried to kill him, he fought back.\n\nFrom other dark corners and streets, Serov's paramilitaries emerged to protect him. Unprepared for such a coordinated defense by their enemy, that was supposed to be coming alone or with a small guard, our own squad was not able to cope with the problem. They fought bravely to maintain their positions and safely withdraw as Serov escaped once again. What's worse, perhaps, is the consequences of this skirmish. The reports claim that a rocket grenade launcher was used by the enemy forces against the squad, causing a massive explosion in the road. Unfortunately, our entire squad died from the blast, and so did 17 innocent civilians that were in the nearby building, which collapsed from the blast as well. Few know of what actually happened in Pazhga that night, as we have covered up the story, but Serov still remains free, roaming the country."
 KOM.208.a: "This has been a complete failure."

 KOM.209.t: "An Empty Room"
 KOM.209.d: "Nikolai sat on a chair, one of the few things the room still had, to contemplate what was happening. For hours now, the house had been turned upside down. Every object had been examined and looked under, and every possible clue that could lead the police to something closely investigated. But, no matter how many men had worked hard throughout the day, absolutely zero progress had been made. Not a single clue had been found.\n\nIvan Serov was a mystery. Perhaps it was his time in the secret police, but he certainly knew how to hide, and he did it well. What worried Nikolai, though, was the reaction of his superiors. What would they think when they learned that he and his co-workers had found a dead end in one of the most important investigations in the history of the socialist regime, as short as it was?"
 KOM.209.a: "There is no way to continue."

 KOM.210.t: "The Socialist Alternative"
 KOM.210.d: ""Greetings, proud citizens of the Komi Republic! My name is Andrei Zhdanov, and you may know me as one of the leading figures of the Left political alliance. Much speculation on the future of this country has occurred, especially following the dissolution of the former regime. However, I have decided to broadcast this message to national radio, to tell you that a bright future is ahead for us."\n\n"Many of you have constructed an image of what a Republic ruled by Suslov's Socialists would be, but these premature conjectures are much different from what awaits it. I, as the General Secretary, will from now on be the leader of this country, dictating its policies and hearing the voices of the people, and from this position, I must inform you that the Suslovite plans will not be fulfilled. What the new government has to offer is the Socialist Alternative. Not a single person will have to worry about falling into poverty, or being chased down by the secret police for their political beliefs. The goal we have set to accomplish is that of a free socialist state, built on the principles of liberty and solidarity."\n\n"The Alternative will be not be built on exclusion of those who do not agree, but inclusion of all who can benefit. It is an undeniable truth that the writings of the first and the greatest proponents of socialism had the best intentions when creating and spreading their ideas. No matter how much leaders twisted them in the past, we are here to rebuild this Republic, for the good of its people."\n\n"It is for that reason that I ask you to respect the state that only cares for your own good and prosperity. Do not bring about the chaos and anarchy that my predecessors could not prevent, but embrace this new opportunity. Together, we can forge a new future for Komi.""
 KOM.210.a: "Keep it simple - keep it sweet."
 KOM.210.b: "The world is not enough!"

 KOM.211.t: "The Red Meeting"
 KOM.211.d: "It seemed as if Zhdanov had decided not to end any last chance he had of working with the Center. Of course, what was once the leading coalition of the Komi Republic had been scattered by his seizure of power, and so had the Voznesentsi: some had fled Syktyvkar, either to leave the country and push their agenda from abroad, or to continue resisting from the countryside of Komi. However, some members of the former President's faction had still not left the capital, perhaps because they were willing to cooperate. And Zhdanov would capitalize on that opportunity.\n\nThe Center's left wing would be approached with an intriguing chance to remain in power, and that was to peacefully collaborate. Seeing as the new leader of the county had already made an extensive effort to support Voznesensky and his people to get into power, it wasn't that hard to believed that he would use the social democrats to consolidate his rule, which was by no means perfectly stable - even though this was a common occurrence for the governments of Komi.\n\nWhat Zhdanov and his allies understood, though, was that there was perhaps an even better way to solidify their control over the violent political stage, and that was by backstabbing. Having gained the trust of the Voznesentsi, it would be more than simple to make the planned meeting, in which talks with them over a national unity government would be held, a trap. They would be in a perfect position to be arrested, and so the social democratic faction of the Center would disappear in the blink of an eye. In the end, whether betrayal was the best choice was up to Zhdanov."
 KOM.211.a: "I've assembled you here so that the Republic may be saved..."
 KOM.211.b: "Guards? Take them away."
 
 KOM.212.t: "Our Wayward Children Returned"
 KOM.212.d: "Today is a day of pride for our socialist republic of the people. As was the plan by the Zhdanov government, we held the meeting with the followers of Nikolai Voznesensky, the aim being to integrate their group into our greater base of support. The plan has paid off, as after talks and negotiations with the social democrats, they have agreed.\n\nThe meeting was held in the National Assembly building, and had to last several days as some details were sorted out regarding the nature of the "unity government". In reality, as the faction in control of this nation, we were able to exert our influence and manage to pressure the Voznesentsi into accepting a deal that favors us. For all intents and purposes, we and the social democrats are one.\n\nAs for the fate of their leader himself, Voznesensky, he has fled the Republic. Stating it is no longer democratic but under a tyranny, he is currently at an unknown location, and perhaps he is plotting his return."
 KOM.212.a: "He won't be relevant in the near future."

 KOM.213.t: "A Black Day"
 KOM.213.d: "Both sides of the meeting, the Zhdanovites and the Voznesentsi, could feel the tension in the room. The building they were in, what used to be the National Assembly of the Republic until it was forcefully dissolved, seemed massive in comparison with the few delegates that had arrived from the two factions to discuss.\n\nIn theory, this was a National Assembly meeting to "hold talks on the formation of a national unity government in face of the crisis the Republic was facing". In practice, it was nothing more than a meeting between a few representatives, as everyone else not part of the non-Suslov Socialists or the Social Democrats was obviously absent. Soon, though, even this meeting which seemed to show potential would devolve into chaos. Government troops stormed the building, trying to arrest all the supporters of Voznesensky. They replied in kind, using both firearms they carried with them and bringing in support from a nearby paramilitary unit.\n\nThe battle was fierce, but in the end, the small number of government troops seemed unable to cope with the unexpected arrival of reinforcements. Under cover from gunfire, the social democrats fled the building, racing to get out of the city before being caught. And it seems they have succeeded, as they disappeared, before the army reported that this group of a few dozen politicians had actually gotten across the border with the Vologda Neutral Zone, entering the neighboring warlord state.\n\nOf course, being neutral and with some democratic aspirations, Vologda has refused to hand over the "political refugees". We have given up on trying to get them under our custody again, as it now appears out of reach. All in all, this mission seems to have been a failure, and the only thing we can do now is cover up the affair from the public."
 KOM.213.a: "Damn it all!"

 KOM.214.t: "A Strike Against Fascism"
 KOM.214.d: "Yuri Andropov appeared in the headquarters of the Komi Republic Special Forces, far from the busy streets of Syktyvkar, and hidden in plain sight in the countryside. The building did not draw one's attention, cleverly disguised as a normal government building or offices.\n\nThe close associate of Andrei Zhdanov presented himself to the commander of the Squad, who bowed in respect, and quite clearly understood that this was an important case. After completing the typical proceedings and bureaucracy, Andropov was introduced to the group of thirty men handpicked by the regime to lead Plan Blue - the special operation to take the Eurasianists out of the picture. Then, he began to outline the plan to his subordinates.\n\n"I am here on behalf of General Secretary Zhdanov together with my trusted commanders to assign you a mission crucial to this Republic's future - to strike at Lev Gumilyov. On the behalf of the General Secretary, it is my duty to convey the details of this operation, codenamed Plan Wolf."\n\n"Using confirmed reports and eyewitnesses, we have located the hiding spot for the leader of the reactionaries, who is in Slobodskoy and under protection by a local paramilitary unit. This has allowed us to design a plan that, should it be carefully executed, will allow us to capture Gumilyov and perhaps many of his remaining allies, ending the threat they present. It is of crucial importance to maintain the element of surprise and find the perfect moment to strike when their guard is down. Remember, this is no simple operation - it has been assigned to you because you are considered the most capable force available. Preparations will begin shortly.""

 KOM.228.d: "Our grand military is currently in need of more loyal bodies willing to shed blood for the Communist government. One of the most effective ways to gather more troops is to flood the national airwaves with our militarist propaganda in order to invoke loyalty in our subjects. Though much of our messages to the public are loud and threatening, it is necessary to instill courage and toughness into anyone willing to take up a rifle.\n\nUnfortunately, the broadcast of such propaganda may also deter citizens from their faith in the Communist system. Shall we continue with the broadcasting, risking the people's opinion of us?"
 KOM.228.a: "An excellent investment."
 KOM.228.b: "The wrong choice for the situation."

 KOM.229.t: "Seeding the Files"
 KOM.229.d: "Zhdanov mulled over the file from his desk. Apparently, the liberals planned to seize several files from the Party, although their plans have been discovered. Zhdanov wondered what he should do with this information. It would be trivial to plant some false information, and have them turn on each other. Especially if several of their leaders and politicians were to suddenly be revealed to have fascist sympathies, or were selling paramilitary supplies to the highest bidder behind their backs.\n\nBut was seeding the files worth the effort? If their interference were discovered, it could further unite the liberals, and cause some unnecessary hassle down the road. Planting the files seems low-risk, but you can never be too cautious."
 KOM.229.a: "Execute."
 KOM.229.b: "This isn't viable - abort."

 KOM.230.t: "Our Interference Discovered"
 KOM.230.d: "Days passed by, and, predictably, the files were seized. The files had been planted, but nothing seemed to come of it. None of the incriminated leaders were arrested, and the Republic seems to not suspect any collusion within its ranks. An informant discovered the planted files in the trash, which means the plan has failed.\n\nZhdanov's interference was discovered, but how? Was the information contradictory? Were the files out of character for those incriminated within them? Was there a leak from one of their own? Figuring out why this went wrong could prove crucial for the success of future plans. At least the liberals don't seem to be particularly bothered by it, which means that Zhdanov can investigate this small failure free from any distractions that could get in his way."
 KOM.230.a: "Oh well, better luck next time."

 KOM.231.t: "A Successful Operation"
 KOM.231.d: "Days passed, and, predictably, the files were seized. A few short days later, and several prominent liberal leaders were disappeared without Zhdanov's involvement. Judging from which leaders were disappeared, and the timeframe of the disappearances, it appears that the liberals took the bait. They fell for the false intel, and the operation was a major success. Zhdanov smiled to himself as he read the reports, a few rushed documents and an underpaid party official had allowed them to deal a nice blow to the liberals of Komi. Considering the success of the plan, Zhdanov thought that such tactics should be used more often, although the trick may not work as well a second time. None of that mattered right now, for today was a good day for Zhdanov."
 KOM.231.a: "The liberals are being so helpful to the cause."
 
 KOM.232.t: "A Pre-Empetive Purge"
 KOM.232.d: "There are many doubters within the Komi Communist Party.\n\nFew men pledge their whole faith in Andrey Zhdanov. Even his allies are unconvinced in regards to his main objectives. These party members may prove to be quite dangerous later on, obstructions to Komi's (and Zhdanov's) success. They may rat him out for being too much of an idealist, with no realism to back his cause.\n\nWhat hangs in the balance is the decision: should he eliminate these "allies" now, nipping the problem in the bud, or should he let them live and keep his support within the party?"
 KOM.232.a: "Hold off on this."
 KOM.232.b: "They're everywhere, as predicted."

 KOM.233.t: "For the Survival of the Republic"
 KOM.233.d: "Alexei Kosygin stares unenthusiastically at the meeting table. It is not the nice warm bed with a glass of warm water he was hoping for, especially after the chaos of the evening. The dossier on his desk covers an expected topic, blanketed on the cover like an obscene joke - RADICALISM IN KOMI. He flicks through the pages, his frown intensifying at the red names and cancellations on some of the pages - evidently taken from the Democratic Coalition's own census rolls.\n\nThere are quite a lot of cancellations.\n\nVoznesensky has the smile drip off his face, and he faces the assemblymen with little more than a ghost of a facial tic. He has at least the courage to be honest, even if what he is saying will make their jobs far harder than before.\n\n"Morozov spoke to me this evening, after the end of debate. He says some of his men have lost confidence in the Coalition. They're writing the letters as we speak, and after tomorrow we will lose about 30 men. These men are - were - our majority in the Parliament. We will move to formalize relations with the Communists and the Passionariyy Party in tomorrow's session."\n\n"There are still options. We are, after all, the incumbent - and our policies, while leaning on majority rule, are not entirely dependent on it. And after that-"\n\nHe stops, but the meaning in his silence is clear. It is unthinkable, the democrats of Komi plotting the arrests of their opposition. And yet - perhaps it is the necessary option.\n\nKosygin rides the tide of opinion. He clears his throat."

 KOM.234.d: ""I speak to you from the Chamber in which all of our careers were made, and as I begin, I urge all of you to remember your first speeches here. All of us were once novices in politics, thrust into the Assembly by fate and desperate need. This was an unexpected Republic, and we were unexpected Republicans."\n\nStalina pauses, surveys the crowd. Old instincts kick in - her left flank's a little cold. Time to amp it up a little.\n\n"And who among us does not remember the old years? The arguments we used to have, before Vosenevsky brought us into Coalition and Opposition, about how this Republic would be. Who would stay in Parliament when a thousand dreams clashed at once? How would we solve the problems of the citizen when our castles in the sky waited to be built?"\n\nA little laughter, rueful almost. It's working. Stalina turns back to the main topic. Easy does it - like riding a horse.\n\n"My point is this: it was not because of the beauty of our dreams that we have kept our Republic, as the Union fractured and the old world died around us. It was not ideals that kept us fed, or clothed, or safe. Many assemblymen deny it even now - but it was the common belief we are sworn to uphold, the dream of a Congress for and of all, working not towards paradise, but upwards from the present."\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do.

It's time to bring this party sky-high.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly-"\n\nShe barely hears the dull thud of the shot before a guard slams into her bulk, throwing her into the stage as the audience erupts into chaos. The gunshots continue, at irregular intervals, until they are silenced, and from the east of the auditorium muffled cries and the sound of fistfights echo.\n\nThen another burst of fire, this one rapid and shallower, from the top of the tripartite stage above her. Screams, and the distinct thud of flesh hitting lead. Stalina's world tunnels in on itself, to the narrow web of cover that leads to the exit. Grunting slowly from the bruise in her side, she moves forward, ever forward, at what feels like the pace of a snail.\n\nAs the auditorium roars with gunfire behind her, Stalina keeps her face set, only allowing herself the pleasure of a single thought."
 KOM.235.a: "The bastard behind this will pay."

 KOM.236.d: "Old Volkova listens to the chatter of the radio. It's a nice distraction from the constant thrumming hum of the wheat-thresher, and sometimes the stations even play good music. It's about as much as she can ask for these days, and it's not a bad life, all things considered.\n\nAt least this Stalina fellow who's yammering on the radio is a good orator. She tunes the rusty dial up a little, strains her ears:\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nShe nods unconsciously. She remembers the old Union, one where the flutter of the flags belied the dark hollows of its rule. Nowadays the only government functionaries who stop by are the ones who do census-taking, which is a breath of fresh air, really. Things have changed, and mostly for the better, haven't they?\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nVolkova finds herself clapping, for some strange reason, as the speech concludes in a roar of applause - and her thoughts stray to the old passport she still keeps in her closet, signed by Voznesensky himself in the old days.\n\nPerhaps she'll think about voting again, the next time elections come around - and she knows where the future, and her confidence, truly lies.

 KOM.236.a: "A small victory for democracy."

 KOM.237.t: "A Bitter Silence"
 KOM.237.d: "Petro Grigorenko watches as the crowds gather around the Vosnesentsi-sponsored speaker. Factory workers and middle-managers, dressed in the slim-fit waistcoats and suited shirts that pass for Komi haute couture fashion - they seem like the kind of people to gravitate to his friend. In any case, Stalina asked for help in surveying popular reaction, and Grigorenko has never been one to refuse a friend.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nThere are whispers here and there, like a rustling of the wind upon slowly dying branches, but otherwise there is nothing.\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nThere is emptiness on both ends of the radio this time. The crowd continues to whisper, but there is no hint of celebration, agreement or even vague positivity. It is as if the speech had been given over a dead mike - the crowd certainly doesn't seem to have heard anything.\n\nAs the audience disperses, Grigorenko winces and prepares to leave. Svetlana really isn't going to like what he has to say at the next meeting. Perhaps a little alcohol will help the message go smoother."
 KOM.237.a: "I'm sorry, Stalina. They just weren't feeling it."

 KOM.238.t: "Against The Unrest"
 KOM.238.d: "If we're to survive this avalanche of dissent that's flooded our streets, we need a plan. Currently, we control very little, and the dissidents control a great deal. With this in mind, there are two prevailing ideas we can attempt that would see this situation flip. The first is simply to cede the majority of the territory, which we'll never be able to patrol completely, in order to build up defenses and fortifications in crucial government buildings and factories. From there, we can begin sending out combat groups to put down any potential rebellions.\n\nThe second plan is more offensive, the idea is to send out pacification teams to quash rebel activity in the more rebellious neighborhoods BEFORE any dissent can form.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must do so quickly."

Our forces failed to discover the Communist Party's primary safehouses, and our forces have failed to discover any significant arms caches.\n\nIt seems the left had been prepared for our raids, and our attempts to shut them down have failed. It appears our raids, despite their ineffectiveness, have nonetheless incensed several leftist politicians, and the left continue to arm and militarize. It appears our democracy's position has grown even less secure, despite our best efforts."
 KOM.242.a: "That can't be good."

 KOM.243.t: "Failures Against the Right!"
 KOM.243.d: "The strike against the right has been severely blunted. Our forces failed to discover the Passionariyy's primary safehouses, and our forces have failed to discover any significant arms caches.\n\nIt seems the right had been prepared for our raids, and our attempts to shut them down have failed. It appears our raids, despite their ineffectiveness, have nonetheless incensed several rightist politicians, and the right continue to arm and militarize.

 KOM.244.t: "Into the Files"
 KOM.244.d: "In order to curb the influence of radicals within our Republic, we need information to act upon. The locations of arms caches, incriminating documents, and the positions of paramilitary commanders. In order to learn these details, we must raid the headquarters of the Communist Party and Shafarevich's Passionariyy. Those locations are public knowledge, and informants within these buildings can help us find useful intel.\n\nWhile conducting these raids, we have two options for our strategy. The first strategy is to grab only what information our spies can verify, so that we avoid any contingency plans and false intel the enemy may have planted. This is the less risky option, but it also requires more time, and will result in less information being gathered. The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across. This will result in more information being gathered, but is obviously riskier. If we come across false intel, our forces could end up stumbling into a trap. The question is, which strategy do we employ?"
 KOM.244.a: "Grab only what our spies can verify, so we can trust what we find."
 KOM.244.b: "Grab as much as you can, we can't afford to waste time."

 KOM.245.t: "A Perfect Find"
 KOM.245.d: "It seems we have stumbled across the perfect intel. Document after document, detailing the locations of weapons caches, paramilitary commanders, and safehouses. All of the information was recent enough to act upon, and barely any of the information had been encrypted. However, somewhat disturbing were the size of the weapons caches. If we don't act upon this information right away, the enemy will be fully-equipped for a coup. We need to seize these weapons and commanders immediately, anything else is a dangerous waste of time. Luckily, it seems the radicals weren't expecting a raid upon their headquarters, so we should have enough time to strike before they can act."
 KOM.245.a: "Finally, some good news!"

 KOM.246.t: "A Perfect Find"
 KOM.246.d: "It seems we have stumbled across some highly valuable intel. Several documents were discovered, detailing the locations of weapons caches, wanted paramilitary commanders, and safehouses throughout the city. The information appears to be up to date, and it seems the radicals didn't expect these documents to be discovered. If we could seize these weapons and commanders, we could cripple the radicals and ensure the safety of our government. We need to act quickly, however, since it will only be a matter of time before the enemy realize we've received this intel. If we wait too long, all of this information will be useless and we'll have simply wasted our time. Luckily, if we act smart, we can strike the majority of these locations before the radicals can relocate."
 KOM.246.a: "Finally, some good news!"

 KOM.247.t: "Too Much Information"
 KOM.247.d: "Sergei opened yet another drawer of yet another filing cabinet. Sergei hated patrolling the city, what with all of the violent paramilitaries roaming the streets, but this assignment was a truly special kind of hell. It was past midnight, and Sergei had spent the last several hours reading mind-numbing documents with a barely functional flashlight. Occasionally they had to drop everything and hide when a car approached the building, but none of the cars ever stopped in front of the building.\n\nFinancial reports, predictions for upcoming party primaries, complaints about cuts to the catering budget, and meeting transcripts about said catering budget complaints. Polls on how voters reacted to different buzzwords, pages and pages of ideological debates, and disappointing salaries filled up each and every filing cabinet in this God-forsaken building. How could someone fill up so many folders with so much irrelevant nonsense? How was it also so disorganized? Sergei swore there was no rhyme nor reason put into what document went where, and Sergei now understood why people complained so much about rising paper prices in Syktyvkar. This was just an unnecessary amount of documents.\n\nThey had been in the building too long, they had to move on. Sergei stuffed several folders of financial reports, and various other documents that seemed especially useless, and just hoped the radicals happened to have the most amazing encryption code in Russia. Maybe some government bureaucrat can find something of value in this pile of trash."
 KOM.247.a: "What a waste of time."

 KOM.248.t: "The Decisive Blow"
 KOM.248.d: "The Republican Army forces were mobilizing. The information gained from the radicals would be the decisive blow needed in order to stabilize Komi's democracy. The locations of arms caches and wanted paramilitary commanders would be stormed within just a few hours, hopefully before the enemy could mobilize. The operation would be a multi-pronged attack, with squads being deployed across Syktyvkar and the surrounding countryside. Some locations had to be ignored, due to manpower and resource constraints, but the majority could be struck in a reasonable amount of time. If this operation failed... then Komi's republic would likely not last much longer. It was now or never."
 KOM.248.a: "For democracy! For the Republic!"

 KOM.249.t: "Counter-Struck!"
 KOM.249.d: "The Republican Army forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. These forces were expecting to surprise the enemy, and were not expecting much resistance at the various arms caches they had located. If the intel was correct, then it should have been a decisive blow against the radicals, and a great victory for the Republic. Such a victory could have secured the government's position and ensured democracy's survival.\n\nExcept the intel was wrong.\n\nThe radicals had been expecting the Republican forces to conduct a raid on their files, and had planted false intel. Those locations that were correct and not simply decoys had been fortified and staffed with paramilitaries. When the Republican forces reached these locations, the paramilitaries opened fire upon them.\n\nHeavy losses were sustained, and the Republican forces were sent into disarray. Meanwhile, the cells not present in the false intel or that were simply ignored mobilized. Now radical cells were rising up across Komi.\n\nThe Republic has failed."
 KOM.249.a: "Democracy's end draws near."

 KOM.250.t: "Successful Raids!"
 KOM.250.d: "The Republican forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. If the intel was correct, a heavy blow should be dealt to the radicals, and the government's position would be made more secure.\n\nThe operation was a great success. Using the invaluable intel gathered from the radicals, the Republican forces were able to strike at the perfect moment, catching the radicals off-guard. The radicals' paramilitaries were in the midst of mobilizing as Republican forces opened fire, preventing them from properly arming or establishing a credible force. We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was. Even if we didn't truly possess the element of surprise, we still dealt a huge blow to the radicals' ability to strike against the government. The radicals should be unable to carry out an effective coup. We can breathe a little easier now that our democracy has been secured for now."
 KOM.250.a: "Democracy stands strong!"

 KOM.251.t: "Their Forces Diverted!"
 KOM.251.d: "While we have seen great success with our raids, and the enemy forces seem to have been devastated. However, we have surely not secured every arms cache in Komi, and given time the radicals will surely be able to muster enough forces to carry out a coup. At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."

 KOM.253.d: "At first, there were only scattered reports. Right-wing paramilitary leaders attacked in their homes. Businesses broken into in the dead of night, their inventories seized in "proletarian expropriations". Mass spontaneous rallies against the police, with officers temporarily pushed out of entire neighborhoods. As more and more incidents rock Syktyvkar, the communist threat is becoming increasingly clear. There has been an undeniable upward trend in leftist violence in recent days; we have a crisis on our hands.\n\nThe communists have always been a major element in Syktyvkar's street politics, but the political turmoil of the past few weeks has given them an opportunity to drastically expand their operations. In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a "revolutionary situation".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."

 KOM.254.d: "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical "lone wolves"."

Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious -as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."

Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence. The situation on the streets is becoming ever tenser, and law enforcement seems powerless to stop the killings."

 KOM.257.d: "Any person with even a grain of political literacy is aware that the far left has always had a tense relationship with organized religion. Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."

The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."

 KOM.259.t: "파시스트들의 정부에 대한 공격!"
 KOM.259.d: "As if the attacks from the left were bad enough, the government is now facing serious challenges from the other direction. Right-wing violence has often taken the backseat to communist militancy in the eyes of Komi's state and police forces, especially with the preponderance of left-wing terrorist attacks in the past several weeks. As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."

As paramilitaries rage and the police desperately try to restore stability to the city, less scrupulous citizens have resorted to simply stealing what they need from shops and businesses.\n\nSome of these new brigands are political radicals, forcibly expropriating goods from what they see as either bourgeois thieves or plotters against the nation. Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order. Only time can tell whether the police's absence on the streets is a temporary case or a permanent surrender of authority, but things do not look good for the Republic."

Sometimes, audacity pays off, as superior forces occupied by seemingly more important matters overlook a hidden threat until too late.\n\nA monarchist offshoot group sent shivers down the spines of Komi's citizens and police force recently when it seized a fortified arsenal in central Syktyvkar and made off with a great quantity of firearms and explosives. Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state.

As the republic teeters on its foundations, fascist groups have extended their reach throughout the city of Syktyvkar, carving out a safe haven for their brand of violent activism.\n\nIn another worrying showcase of how little the law seems to matter to some of Syktyvkar's less savory residents, far-right groups associated with Sergei Taboritsky's monarchist movement occupied a government owned public housing block, ejecting members of the community and seemingly converting the establishment into a fascist stronghold. Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come.

The extremists smell blood in the water, and they will ruthlessly tear Komi apart to install their agendas.\n\nThe far-right's adventurism has only escalated, as they use the spoils of earlier raids to go after bigger targets. A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."

The fascists are particularly culpable in this atmosphere of dread, since they target civilians indiscriminately in their mad attempts to purify the city.\n\nCitizens on their morning commute were very nearly the latest victims of right-wing violence, as unidentified members of the Passionarist movement planted a bomb on a local streetcar. Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement. If things had gone only slightly differently, there would be an enormous scandal on the government's hands. The far-right will surely not stop its terror attacks after this defeat, and all the Republic can do is hope that its good fortune does not run out."

A blistering array of demonstrations, some planned by a community or labor organization and some completely spontaneous, have paralyzed the central city, as citizens demand higher pay, better conditions, police protection, and other vague yet intense demands. Most are relatively peaceful, but some have broken out into full-fledged violence, overwhelming the thinly stretched ranks of the police.\n\nPoliticians, relatively isolated from the chaos consuming the streets, are starting to feel the pressure. Komi's already very serious problem with radicals will likely only worsen, as a greater quantity of people becomes convinced that violence is the only way to alter the system.

Neighborhoods have walled themselves off, driving away officers and relying on each other (and sometimes radical paramilitaries) for security. The message is clear: the people no longer trust the government to help them.\n\nIf Komi's government is to survive in its current form, it needs to reaffirm to the populace that it is able to protect them.

Needless to say, our checkered history has not brought any confidence to the masses here; the other day one of our members overheard the re-enactment of a recent coup-attempt in the streets, complete with bawdy and inappropriate rhetoric towards our nation's leadership.\n\nWe have also attached photos of recent demonstrations; as you have most likely already heard, the latest series of protests involved effigies of senior government figures. Efforts to trace the ringleaders of these demonstrations have proved futile, but in truth many of the activities performed in these photos are likely to be spontaneous: after all, it does not take a political provocateur to light a petrol-soaked doll on fire. The rampant violence in the wake of these protests on civilian governance institutions, however, are believed to have been pre-organized, and our garrison has been ordered to secure the culprits and make their punishment public...\n\nSummary: Situation in Kotlas slowly worsening - occupation policy main cause.

Agitators shouting into microphones only amplify the chaos as they fan the flames of a thousand hatreds. Rage at the Government's latest policy maneuvers, the nationalisation of industries, and the abhorrent Marxist filth that has gotten into the public education system coalesces into a single turbid mass of discontent with the status quo. As the sun sets to the west, the crowd only grows in numbers and in fury - Party members attempting to reason with them are forced back and spat upon.\n\nA febrile brew of hatred, waiting for a spark - and with a single gunshot the whole edifice is set alight.\n\nNo one knows who fires the shot, or if the Government, or Passionariyy remnants, or outside agitators, is behind the escalation.

As its sound fades, new ones replace it. Windows shatter like chandeliers, falling from the sky's ceiling. Here and there, trashcans lit aflame, left to roll around. New jesters for a court turned upside down. The Government. The businessmen. The army. The Jews. Suddenly all are enemies, and all must be brought to trial. Syktyvkar is a court, a trial run for the people's justice, and its citizens are vengeful judiciaries.\n\nNothing happens; rather, everything happens unseen. Street-sweepers arrive to clear the flaming wreckage. Dirt-smeared signs are cleared by noon. Everyone, of course, says nothing."
 KOM.269.a: "이번이 마지막은 아닐 것이다. 우리는 알고 있다."

 KOM.270.t: "총파업이 선언되다!"
 KOM.270.d: "Valentina fiddled with his pens, as he usually did at times of strife like these. There were many, gathered from all the four corners of Russia by collectors and tradesmen, and their nibs ranged from the thick and stylistic to the thinnest of thin. It was a forgotten art, and he was a middling collector. A quiet pride for the old factory worker - something to do with his free time, something the Government couldn't take away.\n\nToday, however, he had different goals in mind. He chose one of his largest nibs, almost the size of a vegetable stalk, and grabbed a red inkwell from his study. There was work to be done, heralded by the ring of the doorbell. He raised his hands out the window, clapping twice - "no surveillance agents nearby" - and closed the windowsill. Comrade Pushkov would not tolerate lateness.\n\nPushkov had brought the little scamp Iosef with him, out of pity or some misguided sense of duty Valentina could not say. Sighing, Valentina ruffled the little boy's hair, told him not to touch anything in the attic, and got to work on the massive canvas laid out in the living room. Touch upon touch the letters rose in brilliant Cyrillic font - WORKERS RISE UP! OPPRESSION MUST END, OR THE STRIKE WILL NOT! - and with them the little flourishes Valentina had practiced: hammers, sickles and stars seemed to take flight upon the carefully woven synthetic paper.\n\nAs the canvas seemed to fill with color and energy, Pushkov nodded. It was time to bring the little artwork into the open. Iosef skipped with excitement as they neared the crowds near the old factory, a furious mass of masked workers and angry signs. Valentina gestured rudely, and Iosef, nodding, took the banner's edge and unfurled it into the air. The banner took flight, joining the hundreds already in the air, and yells of exuberance arose from the heightened crowd. Smiling, Valentina joined in.\n\nThousands more would join the procession, and protests like it across Syktyvkar, as the industry of Komi ground to a halt. The workers' tide rose, a wave of garish red, and the Government stood helpless to stop it."

 KOM.271.d: "We've been receiving scattered, but consistent reports all morning about a raid upon the outskirts of the city of Syktyvkar by an army of Republican holdouts!\n\nTruthfully, 'army' is being quite generous. We're being attacked by men with makeshift weapons and small arms.\n\nNo one we've interviewed has been able to give us a straight answer on what they're after, but witnesses report that they were focusing more on our defences than upon the populace, additionally, a few were spotted scribbling in notebooks, suggesting that this might be the probing force before a much larger operation."
 KOM.271.a: "모든 것을 요새화하라!"
 
 KOM.272.t: "경찰 내의 갈등!"
 KOM.272.d: "Our regime has many opponents, and these opponents have managed to organize the civilian population of Komi into misguided protests. These protests have steadily escalated against our regime, and with the appearance of armed individuals within these crowds, it is clear that our government's survival is at stake. Therefore, our government has decided to send in the police, and forcefully disperse the protestors. It may become a scandal, but the lives of a few dissidents is a price we are willing to pay for stability.\n\nOur police arrived on the scene, armed and ready to disperse the protestors. When it became clear that they would not stand down, they were given the order to open fire. Except, when the protestors called for the police to 'march with us,' that is exactly what some did. A large portion of the police sent to disperse the protestors refused to fire, citing the protestors as 'non threatening.' Clearly these policemen need to be dismissed, as their loyalties are not with their government, as they should be.\n\nThe larger problem is the fact that the protests continue, and only grow in size. As they grow, our government can't help but notice that more and more weapons are appearing amongs the crowds. We need a new plan, since we clearly can't rely on law enforcement."

 KOM.273.d: "Despite the fall of their government, the Republican Army has refused to surrender. Now resistance cells dot the countryside, engaging in guerilla campaigns against our government and our forces. They aren't a direct threat to our government, but they are keeping us from securing our hold over Komi, and it is clear that we should have been more thorough during our coup. The most recent news to reach our government only helps to confirm such a perspective.\n\nApparently, one of our Army patrols travelling between cities has been attacked. The culprits were Republican Army holdouts, who had set up an ambush on Internatsionalnaya Street. The encounter was brief, but bloody, and our forces took multiple casualties. They were forced to return to Syktyvkar, and apparently our soldiers failed to eliminate the rebels that attacked them. We need to send a more prepared force to snuff out this holdout, and we will need to discuss the republican problem further."

 KOM.274.d: "Increased reports have been filtered through local police departments of brutal thuggish attacks by groups of armed men on minority citizens. Rightist bandits, in their filthy radical pleasures, are reported to gang-up on vulnerable jews and other ethnic minorities in back alleys and darkened streets, beating them senseless. Indeed, their presence is known even by passers-by who recognise them as villains.\n\nThey cause a general chaos in our Republic, and although these events are limited and victims often survive, they are becoming more frequent and more deadly in nature. In fact, the attacks are telling of the bigotry that has plunged so deep into the hearts of Russia's criminals; a reflection of the vile and cruel state our once great nation has sunk into."

 KOM.275.d: "Marching in the eastern frontiers of our republic, the Red Army's steps crunched in the snow. Their strides were orderly, making their way to the nearest village from an encampment. Our men were tired and bitter from the cold, the only thing keeping them going was the thought of food and warmth as they approached civilization.\n\nSuddenly a piercing ring shot through the valley and our men were fired upon from battlements hidden in the wilderness' icy hills. The zip and crackle of gunfire caught many soldiers off-guard and sliced through their limbs; some of our men were chewed up completely by the opening spray of machine-gun fire. Fortunately, however, our men regrouped and engaged in this defensive skirmish with the invisible enemy, and eventually pushed on the offensive.\n\nBandit gunmen, it seemed, had surprised our brave soldiers in the hopes of stealing arms and munitions to supply their own pathetic caches scattered across the wintry forests of northern Russia. Their dead had been identified as rightist paramilitary forces; insurgents who had taken up arms in a feeble resistance against the communist government. Their 'noble' resistance took the form of these pitiful clashes, only resulting in violence and misery. Once the skirmish was over and blood had spilled red into the winter's snow, the Red Army men counted the lifeless bodies in the snow - now aware of political violence proliferating in our frontiers."

 KOM.276.d: "Much to our shock, it seems a fleet of government trucks have been sabotaged today in Slobodskoy! While the trucks seemed fine from a cursory glance, the engines were sabotaged so that they couldn't even start. Due to the internal nature of this, no one realized that the trucks were broken until a soldier tried to start them this morning. After panicking, the soldiers realized that every truck in the fleet was sabotaged.\n\nAs this is where a solid amount of our trucks are located, this deals a heavy blow to our ability to move around troops. While an investigation has started to figure out who did this, it will certainly be difficult to find any evidence, as it seems likely that this sabotage occurred at least a few days ago."
 KOM.276.a: "망할!"

 KOM.277.t: "Aiding the Party?"
 KOM.277.d: "Bukharina leaned back in her chair, contemplative. Komi was in chaos. Everyone knew it, from the peasants all the way up to Bukharina herself. Furthermore, it was clear that she needed to stabilize quickly, or else she'd likely be overthrown by some other faction. The Republic itself had a fair amount of resources, and proper application of said resources would probably be enough to stabilize Komi, given time. Time that she may not have.\n\nBukharina paused her musings and drank from her cup of tea. It was sweet, but not sweet enough, leaving a bitter aftertaste in her mouth. Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or his rivals. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else? Neither option was completely ideal, but hopefully she'd be able to handle the consequences of either one."

 NIK_278_zhdanov_alive: "Like everything in Komi, choosing who to align with was not easy. While Bukharina theoretically had the total support of the Communist Party, the reality was much more complex. The various factions all had their own goals, and while they supported her to an extent, it was obvious that they withheld a certain amount of their resources for their own purposes. This left Bukharina with a tough choice: who?\n\nShe could align with Suslov, gaining support from the orthodox communists. However, such a move would only boost Suslov's already powerful control of the party. On the other hand, she could align with Zhdanov, but that would risk his influence growing greater as well, albeit allowing the two of them to check Suslov's power. Theoretically, she could lean on only her own people in the party for aid, but that would likely signal a huge blow to the party unity. It seemed she'd have to make yet another tough choice."

 KOM.279.t: "Raiding the Radios"
 KOM.279.d: "Dimitri sat down at the table along with his comrades, trying to calm his uneasy breathing. While he supposed it was natural for him to be nervous, seeing as how Bukharina herself assigned them this mission, it wouldn't be good to be openly anxious. Dimitri took a deep breath.\n\n"Alright comrades, Bukharina herself has assigned us to conduct a raid. I'm sure you've all heard that one anti-communist radio station at some point, the one with the hosts who drink a lot?" Dimitri looked around, seeing nods from everyone present. "Good. It's my job to conduct a raid on that radio station and end its blaring of propaganda. Now, seeing as the situation in Komi is not exactly the most stable, we can't afford to quickly muster up troops, as such a diversion could lead to a counter-coup. Of course, if we take a long time slowly pulling troops, the Republican Guard could catch wind of it." Dimitri paused, but was left unable to continue as another officer interjected with his own idea, spiralling into an hour long discussion. At the end of the discussion, Dimitri was left with a choice: devote a fair amount of resources to the raid, or deeply plan it out, allowing for more forces to be mustered?"
 KOM.279.a: "A moderate amount of resources is all we need."
 KOM.279.b: "If we don't plan this out and muster more resources, we are doomed to fail!"

 KOM.280.t: "Successful Media Blackout"
 KOM.280.d: ""While we were able to successfully raid the radio station, we sadly were unable to find the radio operator or any traces of where they might have gone. We restaffed the station with our own people, and it now plays classical music." Dimitri said. Bukharina smiled at him.\n\n"It is slightly disappointing that the operator got away, but I'm happy you and your men were able to end their slanderous broadcasts without issue. Is your report finished?" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. "Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day."\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy. Maybe he'd relax tonight and listen to some music on the radio? There was a new station to listen to, after all."
 KOM.280.a: "The airwaves fall under our control."

 KOM.281.t: "A Complete Silence"
 KOM.281.d: ""During our raid of the radio station, we were able to capture someone. The information acquired from him let us launch secondary raids, allowing for the group coordinating the broadcasts to be captured. They are now under our custody." Dimitri said, proud. Bukharina smiled, very pleased.\n\n"Well done, comrade! I am very impressed with your efforts, and am happy to see that I have good, competent people in the army. Give your men my congratulations and thanks for their hard work." Bukharina shook Dimitri's hand. "I hope you can keep up the good work, comrade.""
 KOM.281.a: "Nothing feels better than success."
 
 KOM.282.t: "The Airwaves, Alive!"
 KOM.282.d: ""Our apologies for a delayed broadcast tonight, some of Bukharina's lot thought they'd actually try to shut us down!" The radio broadcaster said, before drinking some alcohol. "Thankfully, the legitimate army, in the Republican Guard, came and helped us out! They even managed to bring a tank and dealt heavy casualties to the communists."\n\n"You'd think the so-called government has better things to do than raid our little quaint radio station, eh?" The other broadcaster said, chuckling. "Maybe they're not as powerful as they seem, if they can't manage to knock us out? In any case, let's get to our program tonight: how Bukharina's government is doomed to fail!""
 KOM.282.a: "What a disaster."

 KOM.283.t: "Fascists Raid Supply Caches!"
 KOM.283.d: "Bukharina stared at the messenger, growing more and more angry. "You mean to tell me that not only have the fascist militias raided supply caches, but they raided the supply caches meant for wounded civilians?"\n\n"Y-yes Comrade." The messenger fidgeted, unsure of what to do as Bukharina scowled at him. She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n"Please leave, you can finish later," Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else ,or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"
 KOM.283.a: "The people shall be protected!"

 KOM.284.t: "Further Escalation?"
 KOM.284.d: "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."
 KOM.284.a: "Lock down the streets, we need internal security."
 KOM.284.b: "Go after the leaders."
 KOM.284.c: "We need to do both to secure the regime."

 KOM.285.t: "Kosygin Survives!"
 KOM.285.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Alexei Kosygin has survived our attempt to assassinate him! While we were able to begin the process of poisoning him, Kosygin quickly realized something was amiss and was able to seek medical attention, leaving him with no lasting effects. Kosygin has also managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with the method of assassination, in poison, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 KOM.285.a: "Maybe we should've been more direct?"

 KOM.286.t: "The Assassination of Alexei Kosygin"
 KOM.286.d: "It was only noon, but Kosygin already felt tired. Attempting to restore democratic rule in Komi was no easy feat, but it only seemed to grow more and more stressful. He gently rubbed his temples in an attempt to stave off his headache, to no avail. Did he have any meetings scheduled today? He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nKosygin greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Kosygin stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nKosygin all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes. A nice, long nap would be good, he thought, as he closed his eyes. He would never open them again."
 KOM.286.a: "A peaceful end."

 KOM.287.t: "Voznesensky Survives!"
 KOM.287.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Nikolai Voznesensky has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The soldiers sent to deal with Voznesensky were successful in their attempt to capture him, but he managed to escape when they were en route to the location where he was to be hanged, escaping into the streets. Voznesensky has managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with Voznesensky's frankly astounding escape story, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 KOM.287.a: "How the hell did he escape that easily?"

 KOM.288.t: "The Assassination of Nikolai Voznesensky"
 KOM.288.d: "Voznesensky awoke to a gun pointed at his face. Fuck. The soldier holding the gun gestured for him to get up. He reluctantly did, seeing that he had no other option. The soldier escorted him outside, to a truck. Voznesensky noted that some of his guards laid on the ground, dead. Damn it. He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand. At least it would be quick."
 KOM.288.a: "A roundabout manner, but it worked."

 KOM.289.t: "Stalina Survives!"
 KOM.289.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Svetlana Stalina has survived our attempt to assassinate her! Her guards were able to intervene before she was taken away by our soldiers, and she is now in a hidden location. Somehow, Stalina has managed to obtain access to a radio station, and has broadcasted all across Komi about our assassination attempt. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the democrats decrying our underhanded methods, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism may become more desperate..."
 KOM.289.a: "We must prevail!"

 KOM.290.t: "The Death of Stalina"
 KOM.290.d: "Stalina stepped outside, only to be met by communist militiamen. They pointed her guns at her, not even allowing her a chance to say a word before they grabbed her and put her in the back of an army truck. Shit. This was very bad. Was there any way for her to get out of this? Where had her guards gone? Stalina tried to figure out something, anything, but to no avail. After an hour, the truck stopped.\n\nStalina was escorted outside, into what appeared to be a small patch of forest, fairly distant from any life. Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."
 KOM.290.a: "She died with dignity, at least."

 KOM.291.t: "Gumilyov Survives!"
 KOM.291.d: "It seems that despite our efforts, Lev Gumilyov has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The bomb meant to ignite when his getaway car started ended up failing to activate, and he managed to escape the soldiers raiding his compound, later finding the bomb. We can't conduct a follow up raid, as Gumilyov is now hidden somewhere in Komi. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the fascists decrying our underhanded methods as hypocritical as it may seem,will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown!

 KOM.291.a: "Damn it!"
 
 KOM.292.t: "The Assassination of Lev Gumilyov"
 KOM.292.d: "Gumilyov awoke, disoriented. He felt one of his guards shake him yet again, shouting something about a raid. Wait, a raid? He sprung from his bed, rubbing his eyes in an effort to wake himself up. He stumbled out of his bedroom, becoming more and more aware of the nearby gunfire. Shit. His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."
 KOM.292.a: "Only ash remained."

 KOM.293.t: "Expelling the Radicals"
 KOM.293.d: "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 KOM.293.a: "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."
 KOM.293.b: "Fire them all. It's the only way to be sure."

 KOM.294.t: "A Compromise Candidate"
 KOM.294.d: "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Chairman of the National Assembly with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Chairman, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"
 KOM.294.a: "Komi needs the PSD's strong hand. Choose Stalina."
 KOM.294.b: "Only the DSNP can placate the masses. Choose Kantorovich."
 KOM.294.c: "The SMR knows what must change. Choose Kosygin."

 KOM.295.t: "Locking Down the Government"
 KOM.295.d: "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."
 KOM.295.a: "Take down the Reds."
 KOM.295.b: "Don't let a single fascist in."

 KOM.296.t: "Outside Assistance?"
 KOM.296.d: "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."
 KOM.296.a: "Komi needs every man it can get."
 KOM.296.b: "Our safety isn't for sale."

 KOM.297.t: "Traitors Among Us!"
 KOM.297.d: "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To "compensate" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 KOM.297.a: "A military fiasco."

 KOM.298.t: "The Curfew"
 KOM.298.d: "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:00 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 KOM.298.a: "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."
 KOM.298.b: "Armed escorts are both secure and flexible."
 KOM.298.c: "There's no such thing as too many night patrols."

 KOM.299.t: "Night Raids"
 KOM.299.d: "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."
 KOM.299.a: "Who would oppose such a reasonable lockdown?"
 
 KOM.300.t: "Directive 009"
 KOM.300.d: ""BY ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE KOMI REPUBLIC:\n\nI, Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina, hereby order that all legal parties represented in the Komi National Assembly are to be bound in a formal coalition with the Sovereign Democratic Party, effective immediately. This legally binding coalition will remain in place until otherwise directed.\n\nAny member of the Komi National Assembly who disputes this Presidential Directive will be expelled from their position. Replacements will be determined by the leader of the coalition. As the leading representatives of their respective parties, party leaders who reject the coalition or publicly undermine its authority will be expelled and prosecuted for treason.\n\nAll legally recognized parties which refuse to join the coalition will be considered threats to the stability of the Republic and consequently outlawed."\n\nThe Directive complete, Stalina leaned back from the typewriter. Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour. A decision had to be made, lest such violence draw any closer."
 KOM.300.a: "Go it alone for now. We simply don't have time for this."
 KOM.300.b: "Kosygin and the SMR are the only trustworthy option."
 KOM.300.c: "Voznesensky and the DSNP are trouble, but they remain popular."
 
 KOM.301.t: "Directive 011"
 KOM.301.d: ""BY ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE KOMI REPUBLIC:\n\nI, Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina, hereby order that the Komi Police Force is to be placed under the direct command of the Armed Forces of the Republic. Chief of the General Staff, General Grigorenko, is appointed Acting Police Chief until the present situation has stabilized.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is henceforth to be considered an integral part of the Armed Forces of the Republic. All standards and regulations which apply to that institution shall also apply to the Komi Police Force. The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending..."\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either. Maybe taking charge herself would be wiser after all."
 KOM.301.a: "Subordinate police chiefs to army officers, effective immediately."
 KOM.301.b: "Let them keep their ranks - they can figure out the rest themselves."
 
 KOM.302.t: "Police Reorganization Fails!"
 KOM.302.d: "Predictably, the Komi Police have proven as useless as ever. Their 'organic' reorganization has been completed, but not without days-long arguments, multiple resignations and more than a few arrests of problematic elements. The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement. It will be weeks before the police are able to quell the consequent unrest."
 KOM.302.a: "Our lives are on the line, you idiots!"

 KOM.303.t: "Police Reorganization Greatly Successful!"
 KOM.303.d: "Grigorenko reports that he and the police chiefs have successfully hashed out a blueprint for a smooth, rational reorganization of the Komi Police Force into an arm of the military. Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 KOM.303.a: "Blue and green, working in harmony."

 KOM.304.t: "A Successful Reorganization"
 KOM.304.d: "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well. There remains much for them to do, but President Stalina's reorganization has made our security forces far more effective than they used to be."
 KOM.304.a: "Trust in Stalina."

 KOM.305.t: "Directive 013"
 KOM.305.d: ""FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE Komi Republic:\n\nThe legal right to protest is hereby suspended for the duration of the present state of emergency. All protests will henceforth be considered illegal, disruptive to the efforts of our security forces and a threat to the stability of the Republic. Protesters will be arrested and prosecuted on charges of endangering public safety, or treason in cases that severely hinder the work of our security forces.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is authorized to use force to disperse protests, if such action is deemed necessary."\n\nThe Directive was short and to the point; Stalina was pleased with her work and smiled as she passed the final draft to her secretary. However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with. Perhaps the citizens of Komi, unsure of Stalina's leadership, could use an example to get them in line."
 KOM.305.a: "Break these subversives, commander!"
 KOM.305.b: "What difference could a single protest make?"

 KOM.307.t: "Mikhail Suslov Arrested!"
 KOM.307.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nMikhail Andreyevich Suslov, de-facto head of the communists in our Republic, has been successfully arrested. Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 KOM.307.a: "Freedom's torch burns away the shadows."

 KOM.308.t: "Failed Arrest!"
 KOM.308.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI regret to inform you that Suslov has evaded our security forces and is now on the run. The tip-off our informant provided was correct; we successfully located the bunker underneath the Community Party headquarters. However, someone must have also tipped off the Reds to our approach. When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."
 KOM.308.a: "It's not easy to catch a shadow."

 KOM.309.t: "The Execution of Mikhail Suslov"
 KOM.309.d: "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n"Gentlemen," he began. "Please, consider for a moment what you have been-"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. "Shut up," spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. "Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. "Tha... this is preposter-"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. "Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Komi Republic. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot."\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. "What do you think you're..." The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. "You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. "NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?"\n\n"That's all you get, you rat," someone called back to him as they moved further away. "Let's see you slip out of this one.""
 KOM.309.a: "We'll all sleep a little better now."

 KOM.310.t: "Lev Gumilyov Arrested!"
 KOM.310.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nLev Nikolayevich Gumilov, leader of the so-called 'Passionarists' is in our custody after some mild difficulties. As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround. He's now in a cell with a medic on standby.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 KOM.310.a: "Quite tough for an academic, isn't he?"

 KOM.311.t: "Failed Arrest!"
 KOM.311.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI'm sorry to say that our attempt to arrest Gumilov has ended in total failure. The rightist paramilitaries provided much tougher opposition than we expected. They might even have been expecting us. When we surrounded the old post office they were hiding in, we thought they were just cornered rats. But something went wrong - like our recon had it completely wrong. We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district. Gumilov must have been with them, since we found some of his personal effects in the building but no sign of the man himself. I'm sorry, ma'am - we just couldn't catch up to them."
 KOM.311.a: "Would that radicalism correlated with incompetence."
 
 KOM.312.t: "The Execution of Lev Gumilyov"
 KOM.312.d: ""Mind the hair," said one guard with a chuckle as Gumilyov was roughly manhandled out of his cell, banging his head on the bars on the way out. No longer appearing a carefully-groomed intellectual in a tailored suit, Gumilyov had clearly taken his brief stint in prison hard. His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. "Popular, aren't you?" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. "Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."
 KOM.312.a: "Your dream dies with you."

 KOM.313.t: "Andrei Zhdanov Arrested!"
 KOM.313.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI'm pleased to report that Andrei Zhdanov has been captured following a series of raids on his known safehouses. After the first few were empty, we started to lose hope, but then one of the assault teams assigned to the warehouse district radioed in to say they'd got him. Funny thing, too, actually - his guards were the ones who turned him over to us. Apparently they'd had enough of him. We still had to arrest them, of course, but we've agreed not to charge them with anything. I hope you will accept that deal, ma'am.\n\nZhdanov is in a cell now - a padded one, mind you. Something's snapped in that man. He wouldn't stop ranting, so we gagged him. Kept struggling, so we gave him a beating. Got back up after a while, so we brought in a doctor who said he needed to be put in a straitjacket. That was too much bother, so we've just got him tied to a chair for now. Personally, I would ask that we deal with him as quickly as possible so he stops harassing the guards every time they walk past.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 KOM.313.a: "Well, at least he can't hurt anyone in there."

 KOM.314.t: "Failed Arrest!"
 KOM.314.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nZhdanov has slipped through our grasp. We raided every safehouse we knew of, but couldn't find hide nor hair of him. The man's a ghost. We caught an armed individual in one of them, probably one of his bodyguards, but he hasn't said a word - just screamed a lot when we put the screws to him. If Zhdanov isn't in the city anymore, he's probably fled to the forests or an outlying village. We'll never find him if that's the case, not with so many troops and police tied up in urban areas.\n\nFor now, I've withdrawn the search parties and put them to work trying to find possible leads on Zhdanov's location. I'm not hopeful, but I'll let you know immediately if we find anything."

 KOM.315.t: "The Execution of Andrei Zhdanov"
 KOM.315.d: ""Quit struggling, for fuck's sake!" grunted Daniil, elbowing the man held between himself and Abram. A muffled yelp sounded out from beneath the burlap sack tied over the prisoner's head. His heels, at last, stopped dragging twin ruts through the moss and treefall as he reflexively coiled up in pain.\n\n"Christ," Abram wheezed. "Heavier than he looks, isn't he? How much further?"\n\nDaniil nodded and tried to point ahead with his right shoulder. "Just past the treeline. There's a nice drop there."\n\nThe prisoner had recovered somewhat by the time the trio finally came to a halt - enough, at least, to begin ranting again. "You don't know what you're doing!" came the undignified shriek of a thoroughly terrified Andrei Zhdanov. "You're all out of your minds! The Republic NEEDS me - NEEDS the Party! Stalina will-"\n\n"Pipe down, dickhead," muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. "Now, uh..." There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared. "Andrei... fuck, can't read this handwriting for shit. Whatever. Andrei Zhdanov, you've been charged with blackmail, conspiracy to murder, um... treason..."\n\n"Abram, it's just us here. You don't have to read the whole damn thing. Let's just finish him off already."\n\nBeneath the sack, Zhdanov's face blanched and his eyes bulged. Without the covering, he might have been taken for a madman. "No, please! Please, both of you, just listen to me! Stalina, that crazy bitch, she's going to run Russia off a fucking cliff!"\n\n"No," replied one of the guards. "That would be you, Comrade Zhdanov." Someone gave him a shove, and suddenly Zhdanov felt himself falling. He screamed in sheer terror - and continued to do so all the way to the bottom of the cliff."
 KOM.315.a: "How the mighty have fallen."

 KOM.316.t: "Svetlana Bukharina Arrested!"
 KOM.316.d: "REPORT: Madam president,\n\nIt took some doing, but I can confirm that Bukharina is in custody and awaiting trial. Finding her was almost too much of a challenge for us to handle, truth be told. That woman has a veritable legion of sympathizers in her party and a much cleaner reputation than Suslov. There weren't many people who caved under pressure, even when we had irrefutable proof they'd been in contact with her.\n\nWe did get her in the end, though. One of Suslov's cronies spilled the information, said she was a threat to the unity of the Communist Party. Wonder what his boss would think of that. Anyway, we found her in a civilian's apartment, probably some working-class devotee who's been sheltering her. At least she didn't give us any trouble and came quietly - not that I expect it'll make a difference.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 KOM.316.a: "I wish she was a little easier to dislike..."

 KOM.317.t: "Failed Arrest!"
 KOM.317.d: "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nUnfortunately, I have to report that my men have failed to apprehend Svetlana Bukharina. Pursuit of information on her whereabouts just led to one dead end after another. Nobody we brought in was willing to talk, even with the maximum permissible encouragement. With it being so long since her last confirmed sighting, she could be literally anywhere in our territory.\n\nThe search continues, but with your permission, I would see it ended. We're spending too many resources in the pursuit of a single woman and every day spent chasing ghosts just further demoralizes the men. Bukharina is gone - either far beneath our notice, or far beyond our borders."
 KOM.317.a: "They underestimate the threat she poses!"

 KOM.318.t: "The Execution of Svetlana Bukharina"
 KOM.318.d: "The prison yard was quiet and cold. Dawn's first light had come, turning pitch-black night into a faded gray. In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n"No, thank you," she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. "Firing squad!" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. "Ready!"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n"Take aim!" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n"Fire!""

 KOM.319.d: "Commander Leontiy stares doubtfully at his map. The plastic waterproofing has gotten so worn in places that interpreting the little dots he has drawn on it is a pointless exercise, and the woods around him swarm with mist, obscuring the stars he'd normally use for navigation. The compass is no help, either - half the damn compasses in Headquarters barely work anymore, and this one has given up the ghost ahead of schedule.\n\n"Damn this stupid impromptu exercise," Sergeant Kuzmin snarls. Always a loyal follower, but never quite afraid to let his superiors know what he thinks. Leontiy doesn't reply, staring only at the mist. There are some boundaries it would be thoroughly inappropriate to cross. The sanctity of Command is one of them.\n\nAs he glares into the mist, something clicks. Those faint figures aren't trees - they must be the nearby hills. And if he can make out the hills, then - He scrabbles at his map, checking the faint contour lines. If he's lucky, he can get the shape of two landmarks down, like that one shaped a little like a loaf of bread, and the elongated ridge -\n\nLeontiy is a grown man of 37 years, and he's been in and out of barracks for his entire adult life. It takes all he has to keep himself from sobbing. He knows, for the first time in 8 hours, where he is going. His salary, and Kuzmin's, are safe.\n\nLeontiy and Kuzmin stumble into the finishing grounds five hours after that misty hill. They are among the three thousand commanders - of a total count of seven thousand and two hundred - who will survive without ejection from the Republican Army of Komi. But as the Army retools and rebuilds itself, it begins to look less like a rabble and more like a fighting force. And it prepares to cast aside the boring, easy business of border defense for far, far larger horizons."

The rumors have begun to spread, and they cannot be suppressed. Volgoda has refused, it is said. On all sides Ust-Sysolsk is embattled, and the armies grow ever closer in the black night, like a sheet, over the borders.\n\nIt grasps the hearts of senior citizens who watch the false-cheerfulness of the news and look into long-darkened closets, wondering if the old firearms are still working and if their aim is as sharp in their old age as it was at the first. So too the hearts of soldiers and generals, stifling their cheer and dulling the gleam of their boots. No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry. There is no one coming to save them, and what good is a government if it cannot look its people in the eye and tell them that things will, in due course, get better? The staffers, of course, are forbidden from even discussing such things. It scarcely matters. Just as ravens sense the coming of a storm, so too can the public sense the inexorable approach of a problem Komi can no longer deal with.\n\nIn a village to the south of Syktyvkar, children play the timeless games of all children everywhere: they run, aiming mock pistols and bows at each other, giggling as they hide behind walls and bushes.

Above petty grievances and ideologies, Komi was built on the simple foundation that the Soviet Union was inherently flawed, and a new way of thinking had to be born. The potential of the worker, of Russia, is boundless, and what keeps us apart is not only petty grievances but our insistence on repeating the same mistakes.\n\nSimply put, this cycle of repetition and damnation is something that cannot stand, if we wish to guide Russia to a glorious future.\n\nAs it stands, you're at a crossroad, which is why this letter comes to you. Right now, Suslov and his pawns plan behind closed curtains, to tread Komi back to the same failing tune that led us to disgrace, and he and his yolk must be stamped into nothing but the annals of the shameful past of Russia. It's your choice if you will be with us, to write the chapter, or but another name to add to this closed book. I trust you will make the right call.\nSincerely,\n\nIvan Serov."

 KOM.322.t: "The Democratic Right Submits!"
 KOM.322.d: "Ivan Serov wears a simple, stern look on the exterior, but inner he can't help but pat himself in the back as he reads the latest report. Beyond everything, people are creatures of instict, and every prey is wary of a predator after their blood. The nature of state, of Ordosocialism, is a prey to the weaker, frailer ideologies around them, and it is not surprising that many conservatives, that so gleeful claimed to be for the foundations of the republic, would quickly change their tune to the wonders of the true Worker's state once being given a chance to not be run over by it. Of course, that also means many amongst them aren't really truthful to his ideology, but simply desiring to save their own skin; opportunistics will be dealt with time, once their biggest, common threat is done with. Raising from his chair, he walked over for a familiar cabinet, and picked a bottle of spirits. Any good news were deserving of a good drink, after all."

 KOM.323.d: "Yekaterina's husband was a very predictable man. Not in any negative manner, but a man that put very much value in the importance of routine. He woke up at the same time and came home at the same time, which gave her plenty of leeways to plan their meals accordingly. He would always come home to a hearty meal, and a clean house.\n\nWhich made his disappearance, in her mind quite odd.\n\nAs she stared at the wooden seat, the steaming bowl of radish soup sitting in front of her, she pondered what could be so important happening right now. Syktyvkar has always been turbulent, but he always assured her that they would be fine. He even recently hired a bodyguard recently! She kept staring at a clock, and as the minutes sunk into hours, as she went into bed, she prayed, for it to be just her neurosis, that Georgiy would wake at her side, the next day and apologize profusely for not letting her know in advance he was going to be held."
 KOM.323.a: "The sun rose, and Yekaterina became a widow."

 KOM.324.t: "Mobilizing the National Army"
 KOM.324.d: "Serov's newly-established Komi National Army, reformed from the ashes of the inefficient Republican armed forces, have been mobilized and are already acting to secure the streets around the national assembly in Syktyvkar. As trucks enter the city limits and shots are fired, we are currently in limbo as Serov's loyalists attempt to extend their authority throughout the city - with no Syktyvkar, there is no control throughout the rest of the republic, and if not handled carefully, everything could come crashing down.\n\nThe protestors that are staring down the barrels of our guns are just as adamant about removing Serov as Serov is about removing them. However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests. When the time is right, the infiltrators will wreak havoc and collapse their organization. What should we do?"
 KOM.324.a: "Deploy the army; no mercy for dissenters."
 KOM.324.b: "Let's try a more nuanced approach."

 KOM.325.t: "Deploying the Gas?"
 KOM.325.d: "When Serov assumed power, all hell broke loose - and as a result, as a surprise to no one, militias outside of the control of the chaotic Komi political scene seized the Syktyvkar Arsenal and are holding the chemical weapons within the arsenal, as well as the plethora of other weapons, hostage.\n\nDespite the fact that we've almost completely extended our control following the instability of Serov's coming to power, these holdouts have lasted so long precisely because we're not sure of what we should do about them.\n\nSome of Serov's closest advisors have suggested that we make a deal with them, offer them power and positions in our military and government in return for access to the stockpiles and their militias standing down. Others, however, have pointed out that doing so would hurt our already-fragile control over the government.\n\nBy not negotiating with the militias in control of the arsenal, we may not have access to the tear gas that could be instrumental in suppressing these protests, but if we avoid using the gas, even if it means more pain for us now, we may gain some legitimacy in the eyes of the people."
 KOM.325.a: "Make the deal, the Arsenal is an ally we don't want to lose."

Something had gone wrong. He told a guard to open the door, who came face-to-face with a very surprised gas-masked soldier, busy barricading the door. The guard panicked and shot him, putting a hole right through the soldier's mask. Taboritsky, he was the one behind this. They had to move quickly.\n\nA brief but intense firefight ensued. Andropov and his men all scored several kills against the surprising number of stormtroopers that had entered the building. Suslov was escorted by two guards out the door, all the while under heavy fire, making their way to an unmarked van across the street.

Stalina was late for her meeting, and she began to quicken her pace as the safehouse appeared down the street. The Republican forces had been using the small tailor as their emergency headquarters, and Kosygin, Voznesensky, and Morozov had surely already arrived. Stalina would have already been there if that patrol hadn't forced her onto that detour.\n\nAs Stalina drew closer and closer to the building, something felt off. She slowed gradually to a halt, trying to figure out why she felt off. Suddenly, a shockwave knocked Stalina and her bodyguard to the ground, even though they were a block away from the explosion.

Stalina and her bodyguard took cover behind a nearby burnt-out car, what destroyed it, she had no idea.\n\nSuddenly, a truck burst out of the safe-house's garage, with nobody in the driver's seat. There must have been a brick on the accelerator, as it took off down the street and plowed into a nearby store-front, and the short silence afterwards was ended by an enormous explosion.\n\nStalina stared at the smoke and flames, before she heard a voice from behind, the voice of Alexei Kosygin.

They may swear allegiance to some long-dead Tsar, but Taboritsky was their de facto leader. If he relied on Taboritsky's stormtroopers too much, Taboritsky could use his influence over them in order to take power.\n\nThis choice was effectively a question of quality vs quantity. Expanding conscription would give him quantity, although they would likely take longer to be trained, and likely wouldn't be as effective as the stormtroopers.

And yet they speak the language of power, Suslov's only tongue, as well as he does.\n\nIt is power now that the clique gathers to speak. Talk is brief and to the point: there have been an anomalous number of intrusions on what could be said - what would surely be said, had the majority been properly guided by its betters - by people who seem less than interested in the Party Line. Indeed, these people seem altogether interested in taking Democracy out of Democratic Centralism, on usurping the Party for their own functions. And who can trust an unknown in these trying times?\n\nSuslov nods. It is time to move past the rhetoric to the only thing that matters. He proposes, in the tones of a bored schoolmaster resolving a playground dispute, a suspension to certain members of the Party, including the esteemed Comrade Bukharina. A suspension that, of course, will be temporary, and is intended entirely for their own benefit and that of the Body Politic.\n\nSuslov keeps his lips tightly guarded, but he cannot suppress a twitch in his cheek.

They'd have to do better if they wanted to impress the headmaster of the Kotlas School for Young Artists. Dipping a sponge into her bucket of water, she began to scrub the amateurish enthusiasm away. Perhaps their next work would be more inspired, or at least less excessive in its use of outlines.\n\nThe next week the propaganda was back, bolder and more garish than ever. The arsonist, whoever they were, had evidently reacted by doubling down. Bolder and crazier the red mist foamed in every corner. New symbols of progress, arrows reaching ever upwards, lifted atop a sea of crimson arms and hands holding hammers. Above them all, a rocket bearing the spindly wheels of the atom rose like Jupiter into shaded red sun-rays.\n\nThe slogan had at least been shortened.

A list of staffers and senior military advisors is thrown at his desk. An unsmiling Committee Deputy demands more names, training times, a full inventory of equipment. Gluchenkov growls that this is an unprecedented intrusion into Army business on the part of a few jumpstart apparatchiks. The Deputy, the iron showing in his face, points out that if the General does not hop to and give him names, the latter will soon have no business with the Army, or in Komi, or in the world of the living.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of such snarling, the General relents. He knows he's been dealt a losing hand.

These rats in uniform seem to be more than willing to switch sides, betraying their old friends for a new job and a shot at survival.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that these men- if they can be called such- will be any more loyal to our army than their old haunts, the Army can always use experienced officers. Letting those who repent collaborate may be a controversial move, but it would certainly be a boost for our relatively green soldiers. The choice comes down to our leadership."

The question that has plagued multiple warlords over the years now falls to us- what do we do about the Mladorossi?\n\nOn the one hand, their beliefs- as unorthodox as they may be- do mostly fall in with at least some of the Komi Right. They could make good political partners in the region. On the other hand, some of their other beliefs directly clash with some of the closest held beliefs of our own- some even whisper that they are Bolsheviks under a coat of white paint.

 KOM.391.d: "Ivan Serov and Sergey Taboritsky have never really seen eye to eye on political issues, and their alliance was built on their common opposition to the mainstream candidates for the Convergence, and nothing else. Their gambit proved successful, and the two now share leadership of the organization. With their common foes overcome, few expected the alliance to last very long, an expectation which has now proven accurate.\n\nOnly hours after the end of the Convergence, the two men have already renounced one another. Their respective supporters are already on the move, and life is once again brought to a terrified stop as a fierce power struggle plays out on its streets. While it's hard to predict which of the two men will emerge victorious, the consequences of victory are easy to foresee. Enigmatic tsarist or NKVD-turned-nationalist, whoever wins this most recent contest will be the master of Komi, whoever loses will be dead in a ditch. For now, the people lock their doors as the battle rages in the streets."

 KOM.392.d: "The stability of the coalition between Monarchists and Ordosocialists was always in question. Many assumed it would break inevitably - and that to bet on Ivan Serov would be the obvious choice. With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces "occupying" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal. Solidifying his grip over Komi is doubtless the first thing on his agenda, and while his supporters cheer... others fear for their lives."

 KOM.393.d: "Few were surprised when the alliance between Monarchists and Ordosocialists only took days to break down. Fewer are surprised that the resulting power struggle has proven to be brutal.\n\nWhile vicious, at least it's also proving to be brief, as a decisive blow seems to have been struck in the small hours this morning when paramilitaries loyal to Taboritsky were observed taking action in several locations across the republic. Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished. Whether he can keep the power he's secured remains to be seen."

Small private meetings. All with similar guests, and all with similar phrases. "I will protect the proletariat." "I will restore socialism." "I will keep the traditions of the past alive." Despite the similar gatherings and similar guests however, the responses are different. To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them. Or - perhaps he's simply opportunistic, willing to bend whatever way will get him power. No one knows but Serov.\n\nWhat is known to all however, is that this is a risky gamble."

 komicoup.2.t: "우파가 정부를 전복하다!"
 komicoup.2.d: "The rising shocked the current government, beginning with attacks on police officers and loyal civilians. In Syktyvkar, reports of violence streamed to the city hall all too quickly as gunshots and screams became louder, drawing close. Loyalists met the paramilitaries in the streets and alleys. But they were ambushed, trapped by a hail of fire from the windows above and from the cellars below. And as they battled, so were civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nConfusion increased as units were lost in the depths of the city. Others were directed to the wrong places by their superiors. The battles became too intense and men began to desert. But the Passionariyy pursued them, even to the river, where men attempted to surrender but instead paid for their loyalty with their lives. Bodies floated down the water as pleas rang throughout.\n\nBridges were taken. Important roads were blocked, secured by patrols. The ways leading out of the city were sealed as were those getting in. Attempts were made to break out for reinforcements or for escape, but they were crushed.\n\nSoon enough, it was all over. They swarmed the hall, intimidating the legislature as they were opening today's session with guns and clubs. They arrested those they had on their lists, adding to them anyone who resisted or was thought to have resisted. Shots were common, and the bodies streamed out as did those who lived to be sent away.\n\nWith the old government dissolved, they made haste to see their constitution instituted. Then, it was declared, their triumph made law as a cheerful Gumilyov was sworn in as the leader of this new government. With the legitimization of their overthrow, the Passionariyy were now in control of what once was the Republic."
 komicoup.2.a: "Our Guide shall lead us through!"
 
 komicoup.3.t: "Government of National Reconstruction Declared!"
 komicoup.3.d: "Dawn always brought Syktyvkar each new day of its uncertain future.\n\nIn the early hours, long before the first of those lucky enough to have cars could head to work, convoys of trucks converged into Syktyvkar's streets. Armed troopers secured each bridge over the Vychegda River, disarming surprised garrisons without violence. WRRF soldiers on the far side looked on as one group of soldiers tried to make a stand, only to see its position shelled by mortar fire. Soon after, the trickle of soldiers turned into a flood. The paramilitaries that the new government had brought to bear were brushed aside by the full force of the armed forces of the Republic under General Petro Grigorenko. The Republican Guard's IFVs had cordoned off the legislative assembly by the second hour of the invasion. No politicians were in the assembly at that time of the day, of course; they were hiding somewhere in Syktyvkar. Not that it mattered, for the streets were now littered with checkpoints. There would be time enough for the extremists to be found.\n\nThe Republican Guards's technical experts swiftly overtook every strong radio station in town. The same message was put on loop, as Grigorenko took to the airwaves, informing citizens that the previous government had been an illegal affront to the democratic ideals that every man and woman of Komi should adhere to. The Republic would be restored by a government of national reconstruction, the message informed them, with the Army replacing the extremists in the National Assembly, installing PSD Deputy Svetlana Stalina as President, and granting her emergency powers. Thus equipped, the President, and the military, would be able to quash any extremist threatening the Republic's most cherished ideals of democracy and progress. The Reconstruction Government, the message concluded, would not rest until Komi had stabilized enough to see its constitution restored."

 komicoup.4.t: "Democratic Elements Restore Control!"
 komicoup.4.d: "Fresh detachments of the Republican Guard arrived in Syktyvkar in trucks, blocking the streets and taking over the bridges. They crossed over the river, quickly asserting control over parts of the city. The paths leading in and out of the capital were sealed, placed under guard by advance patrols. Even the river was taken over, as men on boats prevented anyone from taking to their vessels. From there, they too came to assist their comrades.\n\nThe swiftness of their arrival and of their advances caught the forces of the current government off guard. Police were neutralized. And any response by the city's own garrison was met with a greater one. In no time, they were turned.\n\nSeconds turned to minutes. And now, the whole city was secured. Patrols now raced to capture the city hall, leaving bodies and spent casings in their wake. Without their security forces, the current government was no more. Forced to surrender at gunpoint, officials abandoned their buildings, hands up as they streamed into waiting trucks. Those who resisted were beaten into compliance or shot for ceaseless defiance.\n\nBut at last, they have done it. The restoration of the Republic was accomplished, punctuated by the broad declaration of a state of emergency. Soon enough, the victorious Republican Guard and their supporters made ready to greet their returning President.\n\nFrom the steps of the hall of Syktyvkar, the legitimate government can begin its term. Komi is now in good hands, to be devoted to a proper republic, one freed of what no longer can be relied upon."

The Republic has risen from the ashes and flames dropped by the Luftwaffe, and it has survived the many knives pointed at its back by its very own people. The rightists and leftists no longer can pose a threat against us, and we did not have to abandon our ideals to do so. The people have made their voices heard, and have embraced democracy as their future. For once, our government may rest, no longer dancing upon a knife's edge. It almost feels like a dream.\n\nHowever, our rest is only temporary, and many external threats wish to see our Republic destroyed once and for all. Western Russia is not kind to democracy's ideals, and we have made our fair share of enemies during our short history. We shall prove them wrong. With the Republic finally secured, we may now prepare to rebuild our forces, rebuild our industry, and prepare to go to war.

Stalina has long known the bite of radicalism, and while she has defeated its presence in Komi, her crusade is not over yet.\n\nRadicalism has consumed much of Mother Russia. So much hate, so much suffering, so much destruction. Radicals surround the Republic, and will inevitably seek to destroy it, as radicalism knows only how to destroy. The Republic shall not fall, however. The people of Komi shall arm themselves, they shall rebuild, and they shall prepare to liberate the Motherland from the clutches of extremism. First, all of Western Russia must be liberated, the communists, collaborators, and Nazis have oppressed this land for too long. Then, the Republic shall reclaim Siberia. Then, the Republic shall look to the west, and allow all of Russia to know the sweet taste of freedom. Then, and only then, will Stalina's crusade be complete."

Kosygin was Sergey's Deputy in the National Assembly, and he was surprised to see a politician taking the tram. Even more surprising to Sergey was when Kosygin turned to talk to him, "Hello, the name's Alexei Kosygin. Do you know when the tram will be here?"\n\nSergey chuckled briefly at the question, "Some time between late and never, Deputy. I thought you politicians had cars or something, no?"\n\n"Flat tire. At least I get to meet my constituents this way."\n\n"About that. I feel that the President's getting too buddy-buddy with that Zhdanov fella, is the coalition going to address that?"\n\n"Yes, that is a problem a growing number of people are beginning to notice. I would love to bring it up, but the coalition needs unity in these times, not division. If it becomes too much of a problem to tolerate, I will make sure he hears of it."\n\n"Thanks, good to know that you're doing something about it," said Sergey. Just then, a man came running up to the tram stop, shouting about how some paramilitaries had busted the tram, and that they all now had to walk."

Life in the Russian Anarchy was one of struggle and heartbreak, of constant worry and stress. The once-proud people of Russia had been bent to their breaking point. Still, the indomitable Russian spirit could still be seen and felt by those who knew to look. As he looked out at the people of Syktyvkar from his place outside of the Democratic offices, he could see that spirit all around him.\n\nMany in Russia had found causes to rally around. Some of these causes had proven themselves to be righteous, but others were of a darker nature. The wretched Aryan Brotherhood was the ur-example of evil in West Russia, and it had been because of this evil that he had joined the Order of St. George. He did not regret his time in the Order, he had been able to help many of the downtrodden of Russia, the faithful that suffered under the eyes of bandits and marauders. But as time went on, he began to see the faults of his order. More than that, he saw the faults of their leader. Grandmaster Antipin was a good man, he knew that, but the Anarchy bred hard men, even out of good men.\n\nBefore he left, he had seen the Grandmaster grow ever more wrathful. The Order itself was beginning to be molded by that wrath and, in the end, he could not stand it anymore. He had found a new purpose, to protect the people of the Republic. It was a difficult road he had opted to go down, the political violence of the Republic was an unfortunate and dangerous fact of life, but he was prepared for what may come."

He was born in Stettin. His father, a communist, and murdered by Stormtroopers in '32. That, the old man thought, was when the hatred began. The hatred only got brighter when he was conscripted in '38, and forced to work for the very men who murdered his father. A humiliation if there ever was one. They took him from his wife and children.\n\nThen the way with the Soviets began, and he saw an opportunity to help defeat the Fascists who took so much from him and his home. He volunteered, and quickly deserted, joining a communist partisan group. To avoid being known, he was rechristened that day as Ivan Ivanovich.\n\nIvan Ivanovich was angry. Deeply angry. He was one of the best partisans out there. He must have helped destroy at least a full division's worth of men. That made the old man smile. But no matter how much he helped, no matter how much he killed, the fascists just kept pressing further and further and further until Moscow itself was in their hands. And the passion for destroying fascism decayed within the partisans.\n\nBut not to Ivan. He spent at least a decade, making the fascist pigs pay for destroying his home and rapping his adoptive one. Blowing up trains. Assassinating important generals and leaders. But no matter what he did, they just kept coming. Now, the hatred was missed by something deeper: loneliness.\n\nHe wondered what happened to his family. Was his wife killed? His children? Or were they brainwashed, just like the rest on his block? And the wondering wandered until fantasies played in his mind.\n\nAnd he continued to think his thought, the thought that plagued him day in and day out.\n\nAnd that thought was: 'I want to go home.'"

There had been a time, she reminisced, when she would have considered that a personal failing - one that she would need to rectify through whatever means she could pull out of her repertoire of learned and tested stratagems.\n\nBut it was no matter. It was difficult to make use of her previous tricks in this grey Hell.\n\nHer objective had been sighted in just the sort of circumstance she expected. Down the hall from her cell was the blocks they used for solitary confinement - blocks that she occasionally heard faint screams from. Screams that made her grit her teeth, and pace across the few square meters of space that she had been permitted by the Government's mercy. In the time she had spent to stare through the bars at the corridor, she had seen two guards dragging a short woman between them, away from solitary - a woman who still extruded an aura of ashen defiance and faded passion. A woman who she had known all too well.\n\nIn the distant past, she had considered eventually breaking her will as a sad inevitability, something that had to be done to realize her vision. But looking into her eyes whilst she had been dragged down the corridor betrayed a different outcome than the one she had expected. Whilst her infamous stark white suits had long been replaced by prison orange, whilst her formerly disciplined and tightly bound hair hung loose and unkempt, Svetlana Stalina was unbowed and unbroken. The Lady of Steel, it seemed, had merely been tempered, and not shattered.\n\nAs she passed on down the corridor, and out of view, Bukharina felt a thin smile cross her face. They may have been bitter foes - opponents that both recognized the other would have to go in order to build the future they desired. But, in the end, in the shadows of both of their defeats, she felt nothing but pride at her former enemy's defiance, and a resolve to adhere to the same standard."

Her vision for socialism is the true successor to her father's Soviet Union, and I will not stand by and let growing reactionary tendencies lead our revolution astray. I feel that," Furtseva repeatedly glanced at the center of the room as she spoke, "I feel that Bukharina's awareness of the oppression that many citizens of the former Soviet Union faced is crucial to our movement's survival. Women, Komi, Tatars, and all of the other marginalized groups within the shattered Union must become true members of the revolution! We must embrace them with open arms, not shun them for not being Russian! Zhdanov's followers would rather distract the proletariat with flashy ideals and impossible goals, unaware of the working class's true struggle! That is why I am proud, both as a woman and as a member of the revolution, to support Bukharina's just vision for the future."\n\nWith her speech concluded, Furtseva somewhat nervously sat down, still glancing at the Ultravisionaries across the aisle. Many of her new allies also watched her nervously, unsure if what she said was what she truly believed in. For now, this was a positive series of events for Bukharina's government, as long as they remained wary of deception."

 komi.22.t: "The Aspects of Culture" #Bukharina
 komi.22.d: "Bukharina had an empty desk in the Ministry of Culture that she wanted filled, but she had reached an obstacle. Yekatarina Furtseva: Ultravisionary in disguise, or a true believer in Bukharina's ideals? She had recently renounced Zhdanov and thrown her support behind Bukharina, but was she genuine? This question had stumped the Chairwoman for a few minutes now.\n\nLooking into her past, Furtseva had first gained the Communist Party's attention by writing a scathing critique of a film displayed in a Syktyvkar theater and its satire of the former Soviet Union's leadership. She called for the Communist Party to boycott the theater until it cut all ties with the film's director and stopped displaying the film. It had worked, and she was elected to the former Republic's National Assembly later that year. Furtseva had arrived before Bukharina's popularity surged, and had already allied with Zhdanov when Bukharina arrived in Syktyvkar. This past could mean that she was a reformist, and renounced Zhdanov when it became clear that Bukharina was the real force for reform within Syktyvkar. Alternatively, she was always an Ultravisionary, and was working with them to undermine Bukharina.\n\nFurtseva clearly cared about cultural matters, and clearly wanted to ensure that revolutionary ideals properly reached the public. The question was: what ideals? The position was fairly limited as well, a mere administrative manager, but it was the principle that mattered. Bukharina needed not necessarily trust, but at least a guarantee that members of her government didn't seek to undermine her authority."

The Party-controlled Metalworkers' Union had won their biggest strike in years, and the whole factory was celebrating by getting absolutely hammered.\n\n"Comrade Nikolayech, are you sure? You can hardly walk."\n\n"We don't win every day now, do we? I plan on abusing my liver at least a few times before the fascists have me up against a wall."\n\nAnother man, clearly drunk, shouted, "The Passionarists aren't too bad. Comrade Serov is right, it's the liberals who need to be shot." Mention of Serov was de facto forbidden.\n\n"What the fuck did you just say, you reactionary prick?" slurred Nikolayevich. "Comrade Suslov would kick your ass for that, and so will I." With that, he threw a punch at the ordosocialist, who responded by tackling him off his feet and into a table. A heavyset metalworker tried to tear the man off of Nikolayevich, but mostly managed to knock chairs over as he clung on tightly, throwing punches all the while. Nikolayevich, for his part, was too drunk to feel or counter the hits, and he cursed out his assailant.\n\nA noise complaint brought the police, and the barman went out to greet them. The cops here were in deep with the Party. "It's a fight over revisionism, officers. Nothing to worry about."\n\n"I completely understand, comrade, just try to keep it inside." With that they left, and the patrons indoors eventually succeeded in chasing the Serovite out of the establishment, celebrating with a toast to Lenin."

 komi.25.d: "A freezing wind blew in Arkhangelsk as a man in an admiral's uniform walked through its currently mostly empty streets. Between nightfall and the relatively new occupiers of the city, most people wanted to remain indoors for the time being. The man couldn't blame them much; Russia was certainly going through a scary time, and it was hard to trust any government after what some of them had been said to treat the people they ruled. Still, the people aside, it was nice to have an actual port for a change, and he'd put it to good use, or his name wasn't Timur Gaidar.\n\nSomething in the corner of his eye caught his attention, and he turned to get a better look at it. It was a book somebody had abandoned on the ground, and Timur picked it up to read the title. He barely avoided dropping the book when he did.\n\nIt was the book Timur and His Squad, the last written work his father, Arkady, had ever made. It had become a widely cherished children's book in areas of Russia still controlled by communists, and even among the communists in Syktyvkar. It was a story of a young communist boy named Timur and his friends helping the public and furthering the revolution in any way he could... and it was all based on him. Timur Gaidar had once been the very boy that Arkady Gaidar had modeled the Timur of the book off of.\n\nIt was incredible to think of how long ago it had been published. 1940, a year before the invasion. He had been a young boy then, an eager Bolshevik, following in his father's footsteps. Now he served people his father would angrily declare traitors to the revolution. Ah, revolution. What a joke. The revolution, the war, what had they been worth? They'd just made his father waste his life and die needlessly. If the path Timur took now was a betrayal of that revolution, if it made his father turn over in his grave, then so be it."

A deserter from the Wehrmacht, he despised the Nazis with every fiber of his being, had ever since they had murdered his father when Fritz was just 16 years old, had ever since they had imprisoned him for daring to think differently, had ever since they had killed the partisans he had deserted to join after years of fighting, and forced him to flee deep into Russia. His German grew rusty, these days, for when he spoke it people looked at him with a mixture of fear, suspicion, and disgust. He could not blame them, not a single one of them. Every Nazi he had killed, every part of Russia he helped bring into the Soviet fold once more, scarcely compared to the countless sins committed by his people. Schmenkel wondered if he would go to heaven, as the christians claimed people did, when he died. If not, at the very least he would make sure a mountain of dead Nazis awaited him in fear at the deepest pit of hell."

Nevertheless, they were exactly that, being Leonid Kantorovich and Yevsei Liberman. Though they favored different factions, both men had remained friends for over a decade, and small differences in politics weren't about to change that now.\n\nThey had little left besides each other, after all.\n\n"A toast!" Kantorovich declared joyously. "To the freedom of Russia, and the salvation of the Jewish people."\n\nLooking around in alarm, Liberman let out a breath when he realized the pub was empty except for themselves and the staff. "Careful, Leonid." He hissed. "Much as we've worked to heal Russia of its bigotry, many remain who would hate us for who we are. The brainless goons of people like Shafarevich and Gumilyov still want our heads, to say nothing of the Reich and their jackbooted dogs. Hatred surrounds us, my friend, and it will take a long time for it to cool."\n\nA small, sad, smile on his face, Kantorovich shook his head. "That is precisely why we must celebrate! We have saved at least part of Russia from itself, and in doing so brought the hated Reich a step closer to its demise. If we do not celebrate who we are in a situation like this, we may as well be as dead as so many of our people."\n\nHis brow furrowing in worry, Liberman locked eyes with Kantorovich, catching his attention.

But, now it was too small and too remote, and then there were the memories. The legacy of paramilitary violence, of government corruption, fascists, and communists lurking in shadows all working to subvert the democracy that had been painstakingly forged in the Russian anarchy.\n\nIt was good that all it was being left in the past, a fresh start for a new Russia, but he couldn't help but wonder if the corruption and backstabbing that had festered in Syktyvkar wouldn't simply find another residence in the new capital.

Perhaps it would have been better to have made a clean break from the cutthroat politics and corruption that were once a staple of the capital.

 komi.30.d: "His old teacher had not had much time of late for mathematics. Evgeny Golod returned to the living room with the new kettle of tea. Igor Shafarevich sat hunched over the table, observing neatly arrayed piles of papers. Outside, the bustle of daily activity was winding down, at this hour between lunch and late afternoon.\n\nThe pair had spent most of the day exploring the Burnside problem, and others like it in group theory. Would a finitely generated group in which elements have finite order would be a finite group? Intuition seemed to say yes. How could finite elements of limited scope generate that which is boundless? Yet, naive intuition was dangerous to any mathematician. Now, the algebraists had an angle of attack toward building a counter-example. For a given field, an infinite dimensional quotient group could be built under certain conditions. From there, solving Burnside's problem was much simplified; all one had to do was create such a quotient group generated by finitely many elements of finite order. This would warrant at least some interest in Russia's dwindling mathematical community. Perhaps in the outer world, someday?\n\nVerifications were moving ahead rapidly. Golod leaned back into his chair, the warmness of the tea mixing with the satisfaction of work well done. In this instant it was so easy to imagine a path not travelled, a Russia not ravaged by war, not divided by scheming generals and politicians. A nation where his friend and mentor had a career as a distinguished academic, instead of his current occupation within the pack of jackals of the Passionary organization. These past few years, Golod had lost himself in his mathematics, to try to blot out the outside world. Perhaps his friend would live to come out on top of Komi's politics. Perhaps he'd be murdered, or exiled. In the meantime, could Golod blame himself for seeking some friendship, some memories of a better past, of an impossible future, with his old colleague?"

Shafarevich was excited to read about their findings. A bit melancholy, perhaps, that war ravaged Russia had not kept up. All dissapointments were soon forgotten as he read the papers, sipping tea every now and then.\n\nA few developments caught the politician's eyes. It seems that the Americans Serge Lang and John Tate had centered some of their work around what come to be known as the Tate-Lang group. This group consisted of the elements of the Weil-Châtelet group of a number field K that are trivial within all completions of K. This notion had equally emerged from Shafarevich's work in the fifties with collaborators. Intriguingly, the Americans had not been able to determine if such a group was finite. This had been one of the open questions in the Russian Algebra community as well. Shafaverich had no idea if the question was entertained in Germany; early translations of Japanese papers did not seem to indicate much interest in the question from the far east.\n\n"John Tate", Shafaverich spoke to himself. His methods were good. His papers were written elegantly, precisely. In another world where America and Russia had not been separated by catastrophe, perhaps both men could have collaborated. Shafaverich shook his head again, smiling. He wasted so much time dreaming of useless dreams."

Then, they would go on stage.... and start ranting about Jews and small nations, and Volkov would have to just sit there and watch the ship sink before his very eyes. He originally had worked with the entirety of the Passionariyy Society, but recently he had decided to focus on the mainstream wing of the party - Shafarevich's Russian National Party. They could at least hide their intentions, and Volkov was at least skilled enough to get people to listen to Shafarevich.\n\nGettings the Passionary into the Assembly was not an easy task, but Leonid Volkov wouldn't let that stop him.

Shafarevich then decided to explain the concept, and it wasn't exactly flattering for the RNP. Volkov had thought that Morozov was just a token representative, but it appears the Komi politicians was more skilled than he had thought.\n\nThis was not the apocalypse however. Sure, data looked poor after the debate, but Volkov had a procedure for these types of situations.\n\nFirst, Radio Free Syktyvkar. Ivanov and Ivanov were the best free advertising money couldn't buy, but if he slipped them a few "donations" he could certainly get them to weave a new narrative. Voznesensky never failed to deliver a new scandal, and Ivan Ivanov could give Shafarevich a flattering, friendly interview, where Shafarevich could moderate his message for the public. Secondly, send out some press statements to the newspapers, and convince them that Shafarevich's words were taken out of context.\n\nOnce all of that had been done, get the public's attention onto someone else. One of his militias had found a KPK weapons stache near a Deputy's home, he could twist that into a proper scandal. As Volkov went over his plan, he knew this was salvageable.

That wasn't the issue here. The real problem was that the district had a large minority demographic, mostly Jewish. The RNP wanted to marginalize this demographic, and ensure that the National Assembly was serving the Russian nation's best interests. To Volkov it was a noble goal, but a difficult one to get into the Assembly.\n\nObviously none of Gumilyov's Eurasianists would do. He found his man in the form of a Passionariyy Society member who owned a successful business in the district. He was a gregarious guy, and had even appeared on the radio once. That was the candidate settled. Next was the issue of demographics.\n\nVolkov wasn't sure how to get a majority in the district. Then, he realized that he didn't need a majority, just a plurality. Volkov just needed to make the district apathetic enough to lower turnout, all the while drumming up support behind his candidate. A smear campaign against the DSNP and their upcoming candidate would ensure that they were no threat, and soon the RNP would have that seat. Volkov pushed up his glasses.

"I didn't know you read those."\n\n"Anything from Syktyvkar is either raunchy, or cluttered with talk about 'symbolism, symbolism, symbolism!'" He lifted his arms, sighing as Dimitry nodded.\n\nFor minutes, it was quiet once again, besides a small bit of wind, and a peaceful horizon, as the two guardsmen of an older age watched the sun set. "I have another joke. Want to hear it?" Dimitry asked, as Andrei gave a nod."
 komi.41.a: "Though action fades, and wars end, bonds can last a lifetime."
 
 komi.42.t: "An End to the Bandit King"
 komi.42.d: "After the Brigade fell apart, stories abounded about Oskar Dirlewanger's ultimate fate. Some said that he was riddled with bullets by Ural Guardsmen, and was cremated afterwards. Some said he was paraded back to Syktyvkar in chains, only to die on the journey there. Others however, told many stories of how he died, ranging from the mundane to the outlandishly bizarre- but all had one thing in common, and that was his death.\n\nYears passed, and the memory of the Bandit King began to slowly fade as life returned to Orsk, championed by a president who was more than content to help people get over the horrors of the past, and remove the stain of the great terror of the Urals.\n\nIn the end, Oskar Direlwanger would become a small historical footnote, or on occasion the villain of a story, or tale. Within decades, he would become nothing to most people at all."
 komi.42.a: "All scars fade with time, no matter how deep."

 komi.43.t: "The Prisoner"
 komi.43.d: "The cell was not luxurious by any means; the food was bland, and the guards hated him. The little social contact with anyone he'd ever get from outside his cell was scarce. The nights were cold, and outside of his cot and bedpan, the only company he had in the room was his notebook.\n\nTo say a large number of people hated Trofim Lysenko was an understatement, but he survived their glares, and their rage, and took his life sentence calmly. After all these were lesser men, and lesser men did not understand great works. Lesser men did not understand sacrifice. All they understood was how to crave power, and how to make lengthy promises. They had no love for science and no concept of strife. So, he simply sketched in his notebook and kept planning; kept designing.\n\nAfter all, once the Germans came they would finally realize they needed his experiments and beg like lesser men tended to."
 komi.43.a: "And until then, he was content to wait."

The policeman in charge practically spat, turning to the officers at his sides. "Get them moved to the cell blocks within the hour; I'd like to get home by the end of my shift." And so, it happened despite kicks, screams, and begging- men were dragged, cajoled, or simply walked defeatedly in, all getting their bearings.\n\nIn truth, these cells were similar to that of the Black Mountain's, and the irony was not appreciated by Alek, or his cellmates.

 yakovlev.1.t: "The Man from Korolyovo"
 yakovlev.1.d: "Out of all the Deputies to come from the former Front territory, none has attracted as much attention as the recent election of Alexander Yakovlev, affiliated with the DSNP. Born to a peasant family in Korolyovo, his father served as a Red Cavalryman in the Civil War and became a leader of a small Collective farm in his village. Yakovlev served in the Red Army during the German invasion, and the horrors he experienced on the Front, including almost losing an arm during the invasion.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fracturing of the country into multiple warlords, Yakovlev's life had been shattered, as the strength and truth of Marxist-Leninism right in front of his eyes. The destruction of his country and ideology forced him to look at Socialism through a different lens, one in which human happiness and quality of life trumped ideological purity.\n\nAfter winning a difficult election in the recently conquered Arkhangelsk Oblast against the wishes of the DSNP establishment, he has established himself as a prominent freshman in the Oblast. Intelligent and reform minded, it remains to be seen whether his left wing credentials can gain him the political power he desires."
 yakovlev.1.a: "More the merrier!"
 
 yakovlev.2.t: "The Party's Firebrand"
 yakovlev.2.d: "Despite only having been elected a few months ago, Alexander Yakovlev, a freshman Deputy of the DSNP, has since made himself known as an influential political operator both within and without of the party. He has been instrumental to the Democratic Front in helping ensure party loyalty among Deputies coming from the former Front and elsewhere. While technically coming from a new territory, Yakovlev has been succeeding in straddling the line between being associated either with the party establishment in Syktyvkar or the frontier, making himself out as a possible unifier in the young republic.\n\nHowever, his desire for compromise extends only so far, as many on the right of the DSNP are well aware. Yakovlev's public criticism of those in his own party who have 'betrayed our socialist roots' has made him popular among leftists in Komi. While his economic policies are far from radical in Russia, his forcefulness in such criticism has since made him a prominent member of the left of his party.\n\nWhile still young and inexperienced in the ways of government, it is expected among the party establishment that he will do great things."
 yakovlev.2.a: "A man with vision and principles!"

 yakovlev.3.t: "The Red Star"
 yakovlev.3.d: "While still a moderately fresh face in politics, the Western Russian Free Republic's Alexander Yakovlev has made himself known as a man of the left in the People's Democratic Socialist Party. A powerful political operative, known for his reformist and socialist tendencies, Yakovlev has gained a following among younger intellectuals, working class trade unionists, and citizens of the Front territory, all of which have made him a powerful figure on the left wing of the party.\n\nWhile once a freshman Deputy from Korolyovo, he has since raised his status as a popular figure among socialists and other leftists within the DSNP, much to the chagrin of the party's right wing. With his fiery criticism of the right DSNP's liberal economic policies and a firebrand desire to uplift the working class of his nation through a newfound humanistic socialism, many expect Yakovlev to seek the Presidency.\n\nAlthough he has kept any hints of seeking the presidency to himself, it remains to be seen if Yakovlev's coalition can overcome the party establishment."
 yakovlev.3.a: "An idealist is rare in Russia."

 yakovlev.4.t: "Voznesensky Announces Retirement!"
 yakovlev.4.d: "Shocking news coming from the Western Russian Free Republic today, as it's first and longest lasting President, Nikolai Voznesensky, has announced his retirement at the end of his term, and that he will not be seeking an additional term as President.\n\nOriginally elected in 1958 after spending a year as its head of state, President Voznesensky went on to be elected two more times in 1963 and 1967 by convincing margins under his leadership. While his popularity was far from what it once was, he has been able to keep the young and unstable Republic from breaking apart.\n\nVoznesensky has not explicitly endorsed a successor, although it is expected he is to endorse his Party's primary winner for the 1971 election. Many in the Republic, however, can not imagine another man to fill his shoes."
 yakovlev.4.a: "Whether his successor can maintain order remains to be seen."

 yakovlev.5.t: "A Power Play"
 yakovlev.5.d: "To the surprise of everyone across the country and beyond, Alexander Yakovlev, a up and coming politician from the Arkhangelsk Oblast, has won the primary to be the candidate of the People's Democratic Socialist Party. Originally considered a dark horse candidate for the party, he narrowly beat out his moderate opponent.\n\nFor years, Yakovlev has been representing the DSNP's left wing for years, advocating for a stronger left wing economic policy, and has led the charge against the party's economic liberalization. This, combined with his support among the former Front held regions, has now catapulted him into his status as a major Presidential candidate.\n\nWhile many on the right of the DSNP grumble about Yakovlev, the center and left wing are openly congratulating the candidate on his victory, and are expected to have even greater representation in the National Assembly. Whether he can win the Presidency, however, remains to be seen."
 yakovlev.5.a: "Let's see what this youngster can do."

 yakovlev.6.t: "Yakovlev's Speech"
 yakovlev.6.d: "'It is time for a return to the fundamental axioms of those who came before: a republic for the establishment of socialism, a world in which no man has too much nor too little, and an economy based upon the ideals of Marx and Engels. While the right may balk at us, the workers of this nation know who their true enemy is.'\n\nAlexander Yakovlev's speech officially announcing his candidacy for the President of the Komi Republic has been well received by many on the left wing of the Democratic Front and beyond. While his candidacy has just been announced, Yakovlev has met with many trade unionists in both core Komi territory and in former Front territory, which were all met with positivity among working class voters and trade union bureaucracy.\n\nWhile many considered Alexander Yakovlev to be a dark horse in the People's Democratic Socialist Party's primary, his unexpected victory has since capitulated his already impressive political record to new heights. His powerful political connections in the Front's former territory, in addition to his harsh criticism of the right wing of his party, has made him the darling of the left within the Komi Republic. It remains to be seen, however, whether he can succeed his predecessor in maintaining order and stability within our young nation."
 yakovlev.6.a: "He can talk the talk - but can he walk the walk?"
 
 katushev.1.t: "The Iron Governor"
 katushev.1.d: "With the recent integration of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky, into the Republic, it was considered essential to establish legitimate governance within both it and the surrounding region.\n\nElections for all positions, legislative and executive, were therefore announced and subsequently held. Although many races were competitive, one in particular - the Governor's - was not. Konstantin Katushev, a local engineer and industrialist, and notable for his long-standing support of and advocacy for broadly liberal policies, won by a considerable margin.\n\nKatushev, who entered the regional political sphere as soon as he was able, quickly negotiated with and secured the endorsement of the SMR, commonly known as the Young Reformers, and began proclaiming their general position to the electorate. Proving himself an exceptionally skilled political organizer, he quickly established both a robust and rapidly expanding political infrastructure, greatly expanding local awareness of and support for democratic ideals.\n\nThis infrastructure proved an insurmountable challenge for his opponents, as though several other campaigns outspent Katushev by a considerable margin, none were able to significantly challenge the increasing momentum displayed by his own.\n\nExperts agree that the 'Iron Governor,' as he has been increasingly referred to, is likely to leverage that infrastructure in order to further establish Nizhny Novgorod as a stronghold, both for the Reformers and for their political adherents."
 katushev.1.a: "A rising star, indeed."
 
 katushev.2.t: "The Party Machine"
 katushev.2.d: "As was previously predicted by experts, the continued efforts of the SMR-aligned 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, to establish Nizhny Novgorod as a bastion of liberal idealism have shown results.\n\nOnce again demonstrating a profound talent for organization, Katushev moved quickly following his election to identify local allies, particularly among those who carefully concealed democratic leanings under the former regime, and then appoint them to politically influential positions. Although many of these allies have been criticized by Katushev's opponents as inexperienced and 'eccentric,' counting among their number political novices from numerous menial careers, their inclusion has won Katushev the support of many within the city.\n\nWhile tirelessly working to continuously further expand the political infrastructure established during his election campaign, Katushev has begun to apply that infrastructure in support of the candidacy of other SMR prospects. Indeed, many of the city's National Assembly districts are now held by SMR deputies, and experts predict that the degree of support extended by Katushev's machine is such that they are unlikely to be unseated by their many opponents anytime soon.\n\nUnder Katushev, Nizhny Novgorod has very quickly become a political bastion of the Young Reformers, and the influence of this fact on the political landscape of the Republic as a whole is expected to grow in the months and years ahead."
 katushev.2.a: "A beacon of liberalism."

 katushev.3.t: "From Oblast to Nation"
 katushev.3.d: "The political influence of Nizhny Novgorod, as one of the largest cities in Western Russia and thus the source of a significant proportion of the National Assembly's deputies, has continued to grow. As has the influence of its 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev.\n\nKatushev's now-extensive political infrastructure and, consequently, his ability to mobilize support for the SMR within the region has led to other parties being all but shut out of its Assembly delegation. Indeed, deputies from Katushev's 'domain' now constitute a considerable portion of the entire Young Reformer caucus, affecting the party's viewpoint as a whole. Recognizing this, the SMR has begun shifting more and more of its administrative organs, other than those required in Syktyvkar itself, to the city.\n\nA corollary to this shift in both caucus demographics and organization is the rapidly increasing influence of Katushev within the party on the national level. He has reportedly begun making 'suggestions' on electoral and positional policy, and it is considered likely that other figures within the SMR's senior leadership will be unable to resist them.\n\nAmong oppositional party organizers, consensus has therefore been reached that Katushev is to be considered a critical and near-irreplaceable figure within the SMR, and he has been identified as a prime candidate for potential party leadership in the near future."
 katushev.3.a: "The 'Iron Governor's' influence grows..."

 katushev.4.t: "Kosygin Announces Retirement"
 katushev.4.d: "Earlier today, President Alexei Kosygin announced that he would not seek re-election upon the expiration of his current term, and would instead be retiring from political life.\n\nIn a brief speech, Kosygin made the proclamation while speaking about his personal political journey, from his time spent in the Soviet state apparatus to his arrival in the Republic and later foundation of the Young Reformers. He exhorted the Republic and Assembly to remain true to the principles of democracy and liberalism on which he was elected, and emphasized to his eventual successor the importance of rejecting radicalism of all types within the national political discourse. He subsequently ended his speech with thanks to his many political allies and other confederates.\n\nWhile some experts had correctly theorized the purpose of Kosygin's speech, most appeared to have been taken by some degree of surprise. Whatever the criticisms held by opponents against Kosygin, and they were many, all could generally agree that he had long desired to see political stability in the Republic.\n\nWhether the race for the Presidency, which has been galvanized by the announcement, will possess such stability is currently unknown."

 katushev.5.d: "The meteoric rise of the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, has continued unabated as he has recently secured the leadership of the SMR as a whole and thus, its official nomination for the upcoming Presidential election.\n\nLeveraging his enormous personal support and political influence within Nizhny Novgorod in the wake of the three-time SMR candidate Alexei Kosygin's recent announcement of retirement, he moved quickly to position himself as a candidate for succession. Although other senior party figures soon did the same, much as it did in his earlier gubernatorial election, Katushev's early advantage and quick action proved decisive, and he was elected leader of the SMR on the first ballot.\n\nThis surprised many observers, who were expecting multiple rounds of negotiation by candidates among the SMR caucus. However, as was evidenced, the increasing degree of party centrality upon Nizhny Novgorod overwhelmingly favored Katushev, and support for other contenders was seen to quickly collapse among the contingents of SMR deputies not already from districts in or around the city.\n\nHaving secured his party's nomination, Katushev is soon, along with the candidates put forward by other parties, expected to begin his national campaign for the presidency. While many have expressed certainty that the policies of the Young Reformers are likely to find little support outside urban centres, others have been quick to identify Katushev's skills at attractively packaging SMR ideology.\n\nOnly time will tell which opinion proves correct."

 katushev.6.d: "Konstantin Katushev, known nationally as the 'Iron Governor' and the SMR's nominee for President, today officially launched his campaign in his personal and party stronghold of Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nSurprising many, his commencement speech made no mention of socialist concepts, long considered a cornerstone of SMR ideology. Instead, Katushev spoke strongly in the support of promoting national modernization through comprehensive programs of ecological conservation, the enshrinement of meritocratic principles in both public and private sectors, and in promoting general economic prosperity through the invitation of foreign investment and bilateral trade.\n\nPolitical pundits were quick to respond, with those sympathetic to the SMR praising Katushev's speech as a focused vision for Russia's future. Those opposed were equally quick in decrying it as a thinly veiled attempt to conceal the 'fundamentally socialist' nature of any SMR policies from rural voting blocs.\n\nRegardless of expert interpretation, however, Katushev's speech drew intense interest from many communities across the Republic, urban and rural alike, and the SMR was quick to capitalize on this by issuing an immediate appeal for both the recruitment of local campaign organizers and of general fundraising.\n\nThough a long campaign remains, and none can yet be sure of the election's eventual outcome, Katushev and the Young Reformers have managed to secure a strong starting position."

 komi_zhdanov_demand.8.d: "A series of devastating leaks have hit our government, seriously destabilizing our authority and possibly crushing our chances in the upcoming election. The leaks allege, and prove with several hours worth of audio tape, pictures, and official government papers, that President Voznesetsky have been involved in abuse of his position from the very beginning of his presidency in order to cut deals with the Communist Party for votes and possibly personal favors. Some of the actions, like the awarding of supposedly open contracts to communist-affiliated cooperatives, are flat out illegal. The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionariyy, while the coalition is reeling. The KPK, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrei Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the "gifts" from the President were done illegally. The President himself has locked himself in his office, from where he has been trying to call somebody all day without luck. Our administration may be history."
 komi_zhdanov_demand.8.a: "Why does this happen to us? Why is it always to us?"

 komi_zhdanov_demand.9.t: "Zhdanov's Ploy"
 komi_zhdanov_demand.9.d: "Alone, in a dacha on the outskirts of Syktyvkar, Andrei Zhdanov was smiling as he was going through his papers and documents. Yes, it was all there. He wrote a note to his secretary detailing how to distribute the files to the correct recipients, then stopped and looked at his desk, at the framed photograph of him and Voznesetsky drinking coffee, or at least what passed for it these days, at the very same dacha four years earlier.\n\n"Quite clever, wasn't I Nikolai? Poor, trusting man. You never had it in you to fully separate public and private life."\n\nHis smile faded. "Had you been wiser you would have tried to end it sooner, but your pride wouldn't allow you, would it? You wouldn't have done the same in my position, which is why it had to be done. We must all give something, for the Republic, for Russia, for the Revolution."\n\nHe sighed and flipped the picture to face down, before picking up the next pile of documents to be leaked to the press. On his way out the door, he cast a glimpse back over his shoulder before flipping the light switch. "Goodbye, old friend."\n\nThen the light went out, the door closed, and the moment was gone."
 komi_zhdanov_demand.9.a: "There are no friends in politics..."


 #Diplomatic Events
 komidiplo.1.t: "Komi Requests Closer Relations"
 komidiplo.1.d: "Our diplomats have received a surprising message today.Ever since the so-called Komi Republic illegally split from the West Russian Revolutionary Front, relations between our two governments have been tense. Now, under a communist government, the Komi Republic has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"
 komidiplo.1.a: "Let us bury the hatchet, and pursue warmer relations with the Republic."
 komidiplo.1.b: "These splitters have the gall to come crawling back? Ignore them."
 
 komidiplo.2.t: "A United Front"
 komidiplo.2.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. They have agreed to pursue warmer relations with our Republic. The current hostility between our governments shall cease, and communism shall once more present a united front against fascism! We are glad to see that our fellow comrades will not let bad blood betray the Revolution. Hopefully this is just the start of a mutually beneficial relationship between our two governments..."
 komidiplo.2.a: "We are glad that cooler heads have won the day."

 komidiplo.3.t: "A Split Front"
 komidiplo.3.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. Unfortunately, it seems their government still sees us as hostile to their cause. They have denounced our government as illegal splitters who betrayed the Front in Russia's darkest hour. The West Russian Revolutionary Front have effectively barred our diplomats from their government, and some advisors believe war may be on the horizon."
 komidiplo.3.a: "It seems old grudges are more important to them than the Revolution."

 komidiplo.4.t: "Shared Training Exercises?"
 komidiplo.4.d: "Ever since we began pursuing peaceful relations with the Komi Republic, their diplomats have become frequent visitors to Arkhangelsk. Today their message is different, however. The Komi diplomats come bearing a request from their government to cross-train our troops and theirs. The Republic will send over some officers to our military bases, and in exchange we will send some in return.\n\nIf we agree to their request, we will have to spare valuable officers and risk military information leaking to unwanted sources. However if we refuse we may offend the Komi government and risk damaging relations irreparably. Do we accept the request?"
 komidiplo.4.a: "Cross-training our troops can only be beneficial to our goals."
 komidiplo.4.b: "We can not spare the manpower, we must unfortunately decline."

 komidiplo.5.t: "Fighting Together"
 komidiplo.5.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, but they have not returned alone. Several officers have arrived in preparation for the shared training exercises, much to the delight of our government. Hopefully their advice will aid in raising the effectiveness of our military, and provide new insight into military doctrine that our officers may have neglected. Of course, we shall send over several of our own officers immediately, as agreed upon. It seems our relationship with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is beginning to bear fruit..."
 komidiplo.5.a: "...and may our relationship continue to bear fruit in the future."

 komidiplo.6.t: "The Front Declines"
 komidiplo.6.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, bearing a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Their government claims they can not spare the manpower to undergo shared training exercises, as they claim to require every officer they can get their hands on. Their government apologizes for their refusal, but claim their hands are tied, and such a request simply isn't feasible at this time."
 komidiplo.6.a: "Hopefully they may change their minds in the future..."

 komidiplo.7.t: "Komi Requests An Alliance"
 komidiplo.7.d: "Diplomats from Syktyvkar once again come to our government bearing a request. The Komi Republic requests a formal guarantee from our government, to last until the threat of reactionaries is purged from the immediate area. They wish to ensure the safety of their people, and believe our military could provide the defenses necessary to secure the Republic's position.\n\nSome within our government believe we can't afford to defend both Komi's territory and our own, and that we must decline such a request at this time. They also argue this deal does not sufficiently benefit our government, and that this relationship with Komi is an unequal one. Others within our government believe guaranteeing the Komi Republic's safety could allow us to gain a valuable and trusted ally, and that our military is large enough to spare the men and equipment for such a request."
 komidiplo.7.a: "A formal guarantee is in our best interests, tell them we shall protect each other."
 komidiplo.7.b: "We can not afford to defend them, they must secure their position themselves."

 komidiplo.8.t: "Mutual Protection"
 komidiplo.8.d: "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear good news. The West Russian Revolutionary Front has agreed to formally guarantee our government. This mutual protection guarantee will place our Republic in a much safer and stronger position. We are glad our allies are willing to cooperate to such an extent, and this partnership has once again proven its worth. In such turbulent times, it is comforting to know that we have such a dependable ally backing us."
 komidiplo.8.a: "We are now a truly united front!"

 komidiplo.9.t: "Alone Once More"
 komidiplo.9.d: "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear bad news. It appears the West Russian Revolutionary Front has refused our request for a formal guarantee of our safety. They claim to be unable to spare the manpower and equipment to defend us at the moment. Not only is our government disappointed by this decision, this decision has disappointed the people of our Republic. If the West Russian Revolutionary Front can't commit to defending their allies, then why ally with them at all? Maybe they will change their minds in the future, but as it stands relations with Arkhangelsk have taken a heavy blow."
 komidiplo.9.a: "Komi stands alone once more."

 komidiplo.10.t: "Allied Pragmatism"
 komidiplo.10.d: "Although the alliance with our ideological brethren in Komi was, of course, valuable to the state both diplomatically and in terms of deterring foreign aggression, it now presents us with a pragmatic issue, as they have now gone to war with the Tsarists based in and around Vyatka.\n\nNaturally, many in our government are adamant that we have both a moral and doctrinal obligation to support our communist brethren against reactionary forces, and should therefore immediately join in their war effort. Others agree with this sentiment in principle, but are wary of a potential intervention by other reactionary elements while our forces are deployed on the front lines.\n\nThis is not an unrealistic fear - we must always be vigilant against the enemies of the Revolution, and there truly are very many such enemies. But is this fear worth potentially being seen as betraying one of the very few geopolitical 'friends' our state has?\n\nRegardless of choice, a decision must be made by the state's leadership, and it must be made soon."
 komidiplo.10.a: "We must fulfill the terms of the alliance. Follow Komi to war with Vyatka."
 komidiplo.10.b: "We must defend ourselves first. Make excuses, and do not get involved."

 komidiplo.11.t: "Komi's Request"
 komidiplo.11.d: "We have received a diplomatic mission from quite an unexpected state, and that is the socialist Komi Republic situated to our east. Ever since they managed to secure their rule over their own borders, the leftists that finally dominated politics in Syktyvkar have turned outwards, and now seek to expand in the rest of Russia. Of course, we are a hurdle to their expansion, but they have not immediately taken up their arms to invade.\n\nAn offer has been made, and that is for our two republics to merge into one. According to Komi's statements, unification could be achieved as we have common goals. Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again. We need to make a choice, or else we will soon have none"
 komidiplo.11.a: "Agree to their deal."
 komidiplo.11.b: "Reject the offer, we do not support socialism."
 
 komidiplo.12.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.12.d: "Vologda has finally endorsed socialism and its principles by joining the proud Komi Republic, after a short period of integration. After seeing the advantages we have to offer, and how successful we have been, it would be logical for any warlord regime to join us. And they, despite their suspected anti-communist sentiments seeing as they were a despotist military junta, have accepted. As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move. Even if some are opposed to this, another warlord state has embraced communism."
 komidiplo.12.a: "A victory for the proletariat!"

 komidiplo.13.t: "Vologda Declines"
 komidiplo.13.d: "Even though some had voiced their concerns on the military government of Vologda and their possible reluctance to join us, we decided to take the chance and make an open offer, since we had nothing to lose. But it seems that, in the end, they were right. As they wish to maintain their neutrality, Vologda has explicitly refused to surrender to our communist regime. As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time. At least, that's what the High Command claims. Thus, we can no longer delay the invasion of Vologda."
 komidiplo.13.a: "To arms, comrades!"

 komidiplo.14.t: "An 'Offer' of Integration"
 komidiplo.14.d: "The Foreign Ministry has informed us that, earlier today, a message was received from the government in Komi concerning the integration of our state with theirs.\n\nThough many within our government at first reacted with confusion, as the context of the 'offer' became clear, sentiment darkened rapidly. It is now clear that those in Komi intend to absorb our state entirely. Peacefully if possible but, as this communication proves, with force if necessary. They will not take no for an answer.\n\nAnd, yet, an answer must be given. What shall it be?"
 komidiplo.14.a: "We do not stand a chance. We must submit to annexation and integration."
 komidiplo.14.b: "Never! We secured our independence one - we can do so again."
 
 komidiplo.15.t: "A Successful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.15.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as many in our government and military advised us would be the case, a reluctant yet inevitable acceptance.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria opposed this decision, preferring to challenge our rising supremacy and fight to the bitter end. Fortunately for them, cooler heads prevailed, and we can now begin the process of annexing their lands.\n\nWhile also saving our strength - both economically and militarily - for the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.15.a: "They made the right choice. For us, of course."

 komidiplo.16.t: "An Unsuccessful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.16.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as only some in our government and military believed would be the case - owing to the sheer insanity of it - a stern refusal.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria supported this decision, resolving themselves to oppose submission of any kind, and fight to the bitter end. It is most unfortunate, as now we will need to fight to secure their lands.\n\nWhile victory is inevitable, the damage upon the territory that will be inflicted will take time and resources to fix - which would have been much better spent towards the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.16.a: "They chose... poorly. As they will immediately learn."

 komidiplo.17.t: "Komi Offers Integration"
 komidiplo.17.d: "The socialist state of Komi, believing we have much in common and share common beliefs and ideologies, has decided to peacefully approach us. Messengers from Syktyvkar relayed the offer the Republic has made, and that is the re-integration of Gorky and the army it possesses into their socialist state.\n\nThis offer, while it would end our sovereignty, could prove to be beneficial for us. First of all, we do in fact believe in the revolution as well, and as such Komi's ideology is aligned to our own. Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi. Their reasons vary, from small differences in socialist doctrine, to the simple reluctance to simply give the precious city of Gorky away to someone else. Still, a final decision will have to be made."
 komidiplo.17.a: "Join with our socialist brothers!"
 komidiplo.17.b: "We cannot be annexed by them, reject the offer!"
 
 komidiplo.18.t: "Gorky Accepts Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.18.d: "This day marks a victory for socialism in West Russia, as Gorky has welcomed Komi's government with open arms. Seeing the similarities we share, and eager to see the motherland strong and reunited under a leftist government to fight the German menace, the military government agreed to unify with us.\n\nA joint military parade was organized in the streets of Gorky, outside of the massive tank factory. Thousands came to see it, and celebrate the unification of the two regimes, further demonstrating the popularity we have in the city. Furthermore, the city's army, well known for its use of armoured fighting vehicles to a great extent, has clearly demonstrated its loyalty to Komi, not only through the parade but through willingly joining with our own Red Army and beginning their integration into the High Command. Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

 komidiplo.19.t: "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d: "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."
 komidiplo.19.a: "Let's hope we succeed."

 komidiplo.20.t: "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d: "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a: "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b: "We must refuse. We can go on our own."

 komidiplo.21.t: "Vologda Accepts our Request!"
 komidiplo.21.d: "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a: "Just as planned."
 
 komidiplo.22.t: "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d: "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."
 komidiplo.22.a: "Vologda will stand on its own."

 komidiplo.23.t: "A Gift from the Republic"
 komidiplo.23.d: "We received a message from the Komi Republic this morning, something that becomes more frequent as we strengthen our alliance. It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe "aid pack", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."
 komidiplo.23.a: "Let's send them our own aid."

 komidiplo.24.t: "Freedom of Movement"
 komidiplo.24.d: "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a: "Open the borders."

 komidiplo.25.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d: "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."
 komidiplo.25.a: "Clearly, Komi is unable to communicate their true intentions."
 komidiplo.25.b: "Accept the offer, for a democratic Russia!"

 komidiplo.26.t: "Vologda Declines!"
 komidiplo.26.d: "Unbelievably enough, the neutral zone of Vologda has refused to bow down to our authority! In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."
 komidiplo.26.a: "This is what happens to traitors."

 komidiplo.27.t: "Vologda Votes to Join Komi!"
 komidiplo.27.d: "Celebrate, citizens of Komi! Today, Vologda joins our republic!\n\nThe offer for merging the administrations has been welcomed by the semi-authoritarian government in Vologda. It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."
 komidiplo.27.a: "This is truly a day of joy."

 komidiplo.28.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.28.d: "We have received a curious message today. Diplomats from the so-called Komi Republic, which now borders our free state, have sent us an offer that is not to be taken lightly. They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react. They may opt for a more direct approach to our annexation..."
 komidiplo.28.a: "Our independence is not up for debate!"
 komidiplo.28.b: "It is for the best that we join them."

 komidiplo.29.t: "Tatarstan Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.29.d: "Bad news from our diplomats in Tatarstan. Their arrogant government has outright refused our well-intentioned annexation proposal, and have strongly insisted upon their status as an independent state! Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long. Once the dust has settled, a period of occupation will begin to ensure the annexation process goes smoothly."
 komidiplo.29.a: "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this."

 komidiplo.30.t: "Tatarstan Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.30.d: "Good news from our diplomats in Tatarstan! The Tatars have agreed to our generous offer of annexation, and have reached out to us to formalize their integration into our republic. Their little nation, including their politicians and armed forces, are expected to join the fold shortly. An autonomous Tatar republic will soon be established within our borders, but most importantly we have managed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed despite these turbulent times."
 komidiplo.30.a: "Diplomacy has won the day!"

 komidiplo.31.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.31.d: "Ever since the forces of the Komi Republic had arrived at our borders, it was only a matter of time before they would attempt diplomatic overtures. That day has finally arrived, and diplomats representing Komi come bearing an offer that we would do well to consider. They are offering us a great deal of autonomy under their protection, as well as a place in their democratic political systems. Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a: "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."
 komidiplo.31.b: "No, they are not to be trusted!"
 
 komidiplo.32.t: "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d: "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a: "They leave us no choice."

 komidiplo.33.t: "Bashkiria Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a: "The pen is mightier than the sword."

 komidiplo.34.t: "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d: "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a: "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b: "Our road is ours to tread."

 komidiplo.35.t: "Vyatka Agrees to Cooperate"
 komidiplo.35.d: "Today, the forces of anti-Bolshevism make a great step in defeating even the last pocket of red in the free Russian territories. The message we have sent to the warlord state of Vyatka, vaguely aligned with our ideological goals, has received a positive reply. Likely coming to the realization that we are one of their few hopes for survival and flourishing in the region, they have been quick to voice their agreement for a mutual assistance pact.\n\nThe developments from the moment the reply was received have been surprisingly rapid. The minister of foreign affairs for our republic and their counterpart in Vyatka have come into contact, and are now in the process of scheduling the meeting in which the alliance will be officially signed. However, as often happens with these backdoor diplomatic arrangements, many of the points of the alliance have already been discussed behind the scenes.\n\nThe deal will include a promise that, should one signatory be attacked, the other will have to abide by the treaty and come to the aid of their ally. Limited military presence in the form of advisors and attachés will also likely be a term. Finally, a number of economic and military support between the two nations is more than likely to be included. From now on, Vyatka fiercely stands by us as our great ally."
 komidiplo.35.a: "Good to see we finally have some friends."

 komidiplo.36.t: "Vyatka Refuses our Offer"
 komidiplo.36.d: "When the telegram looking into the possibilities of an alliance with the monarchists to our south was sent to Vyatka, we expected that Tsar Vladimir would see how much we have in common, and how dire our situation is against numerous enemies. However, from what we can gather from the reply hastily sent by their own foreign office, the minute differences in our ideologies have been enough for them to reject the offer for an alliance, or at least justify doing so.\n\nOf course, we have been limited to our beliefs of the greatness of the Russian nation and its people, as well as their will to oppose the communists, the Germans, and all other enemies. We chose not to blindly follow the ideals of monarchism, that only appealed to the elite of the elite, and ignored the true will of the people of all classes. Despite the doubts by very few of the right's members, perhaps we were absolutely right in doing so.\n\nAny diplomatic channels and backdoors between Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka that remained open have been closed in the aftermath of what is perceived as a diplomatic betrayal, especially when the WRRF looms over us ominously. For all intents and purposes, all prospects of befriending the Tsarists have ended. From now on, the only diplomatic interaction we will ever have again will be their instrument of surrender when war inevitably comes between us and them."
 komidiplo.36.a: "Much more dangerous threats exist right now."

 komidiplo.55.t: "The West Russian United Front?"
 komidiplo.55.d: "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."
 komidiplo.55.a: "Pah! We will go our own way!"
 komidiplo.55.b: "Let us merge the two governments."
 
 komidiplo.58.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.58.d: "Over the past few weeks, our scouts have observed an increase of military activity on our borders with the state known as "Ust-Sysolsk"; a highly militaristic, far-right regime based in the lands formerly owned by the Komi Republic. The belligerent attitude this regime has held towards their neighbors has been cause for concern, and now it seems they are turning our sights towards our holy order.\n\nA message has been received this morning demanding our immediate submission. Should we accept, they would peacefully integrate our order into Ust-Sysolsk and bloodshed would be avoided at the expense of our own freedom. On the other hand, should we decline, it seems clear they would not shy away from military action..."
 komidiplo.58.a: "We have no choice but to submit."
 komidiplo.58.b: "These heretics do not deserve our fear!"

 komidiplo.59.t: "The Order Submits!"
 komidiplo.59.d: "As expected, the Order of Saint George has wilted in the face of our military might and decided it would be best to submit rather than risk a military confrontation. Our troops are already moving across the border into Gayny to ensure the integration process goes smoothly and without incident."
 komidiplo.59.a: "One more step on the road to unification."

 komidiplo.60.t: "The Order Stands Defiant!"
 komidiplo.60.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Order of Saint George has refused our demands and stands defiant even in the face of our overwhelming martial superiority. They are already reinforcing their borders and preparing for the inevitable conflict, but this effort is almost certainly futile. Our forces outnumber theirs by a considerable margin, and this war is not likely to take long."
 komidiplo.60.a: "Brave, but foolish."

 komidiplo.61.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.61.d: "Trouble on the horizon. The far-right regime based in Syktyvkar has long been a source of concern for us, and it seems their attention has finally been drawn to our neutral zone. Large forces of troops are massing on the border, and this worrying turn of events has coincided with a message to our foreign office.\n\nThe so-called state of "Ust-Sysolsk" demands the neutral zone's immediate submission and integration into their borders. Should we refuse, they have vaguely implied some kind of military action. Judging by the large presence of troops on our border, this threat is hardly a bluff. Shall we surrender and put the final nail in the neutral zone's coffin, or attempt to defend ourselves?"
 komidiplo.61.a: "We cannot possibly win. We must submit."
 komidiplo.61.b: "The neutral zone cannot fall!"
 
 komidiplo.62.t: "Vologda Submits!"
 komidiplo.62.d: "Unsurprisingly, the neutral government of Vologda has wisely decided to submit to our demands rather than subject their lands to the ravages of war. We shall begin the process of integration immediately, and our soldiers have already crossed the border to ensure our rule is solidified. "
 komidiplo.62.a: "Neutrality is overrated."

 komidiplo.63.t: "Vologda Refuses to Submit!"
 komidiplo.63.d: "The neutral zone of Vologda has, bafflingly, decided to defy our demands and refuse integration! They clearly do not understand that the odds are against them, and would rather risk a military confrontation than give up their misguided independence. Their army is woefully inferior compared to ours, and isn't expected to put up much resistance."
 komidiplo.63.a: "We will crush them!"

 komidiplo.64.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Breaks off Ties"
 komidiplo.64.d: "Worrying news from our supposed "allies" of Ust-Sysolsk. The government in Syktyvkar has decided, in defiance of any rational explanation, to nullify their treaty of mutual assistance with the Empire.\n\nWe can only guess why they've done this, but it is almost certainly because they desire our lands. Our scouts already report concerning troop movements across our borders, so we must be prepared for anything. If Ust-Sysolsk truly is planning to attack, we cannot afford to be caught off-guard."
 komidiplo.64.a: "We never should've trusted them!"

 komidiplo.65.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.65.d: "A message has been received from the neighboring statelet of Ust-Sysolsk, demanding in no uncertain terms for all our forces to stand down. This is hardly a bold-faced bluff on their part, as their armies have already mobilized to our borders in the event of our refusal.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation indeed. Should we surrender, there's no telling what will become of our soldiers, who have engaged in acts of banditry across the entire region. On the other hand, remaining defiant could result in far more death than if we were to just surrender..."
 komidiplo.65.a: "Perhaps it is time to lay down our arms..."
 komidiplo.65.b: "We shall crush them beneath our treads!"

 komidiplo.66.t: "Gorky Surrenders!"
 komidiplo.66.d: "The bandit brigades of Gorky have wisely decided to surrender to our forces, no doubt coming to the conclusion that a conflict would result in their total destruction. Our troops have secured control over Gorky and its important mechanized factories without so much as a shot fired, and the integration of the region proceeds as planned."
 komidiplo.66.a: "How fortuitous."

 komidiplo.67.t: "Gorky Refuses!"
 komidiplo.67.d: "Unsurprisingly, the bandits of Gorky stand defiant in the face of our demands and are preparing to do battle with our forces. Despite having them outnumbered, the bandits' vast fleet of tanks may prove to be a challenging obstacle indeed. That being said, they cannot hope to hold out against our comparatively vast army for too long."
 komidiplo.67.a: "Those rusty tin cans do not scare us!"

 komidiplo.68.t: "A Letter to Tartarstan"
 komidiplo.68.d: "Our relations with the West Russian states that we reluctantly call our neighbors are limited, at best. In truth, the Tartarstan Republic finds little need for a world that has mostly abandoned it, and as our economy and workforce face the problems inherent to a newborn state, even that is steadily decreasing in importance. For the most part, we are alone, and we would be happy to stay that way.\n\nIt appears this isolation has now been forcibly ended.\n\nThe letter from the new leader of the Republic to our north has more to it than a mere notice of name-change: its new leader, Gumilyov, speaks to a union of flesh and steel that he envisions will one day stretch across the long band of the Urals. It is, in his defence, a very well-argued concept, even if it sounds like the babblings of a madman, and some on our soil have been noticeably swayed by the Pan-Eurasian siren. It does not help that the letter promises religious pluralism and respect for our ancient creed; our men are warriors of faith as well as champions of industry, and Gumilyov's promises of a minimal degree of respect are inherently appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, these promises inevitably come at a cost. Gumilyov calls for our righteous submission, and as he phrases it, "much will come of our work together - our place is one of humble leadership, and yours of loyal and righteous service". These are controversial words, and the best we can say about them is that they are not quite as bad as what we would expect from your average Russian Alexander-to-be."
 komidiplo.68.a: "God Willing, may our union bring glory to us both."
 komidiplo.68.b: "Rebuff these fools. Their words mean little."

 komidiplo.69.t: "The Instrument of Accession"
 komidiplo.69.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nThe Accession Instrument is simple: in exchange for privileged treatment as an ethnic minority following a noble creed, the Tatars shall swear political allegiance to us and fold their own government into ours. The Tatar economy shall also take marching orders from our own leadership, although it is in truth more difficult to constrain their thriving caravan economy than it would be to herd cats.\n\nOur Leader has expressed good cheer at this news, and he has issued a Pan-Eurasian call to unity to be read in the new territory's mosques. Surely the noble Moslems of the region will greet their new brothers with open arms..."
 komidiplo.69.a: "Glory to our brothers from Tatarstan!"

 komidiplo.70.t: "A Temporary Resistance"
 komidiplo.70.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nUnfortunately, there have been complications in enlightening the Tatars as to the obvious benefits to their accession. We have received a stiffly-worded refusal in exchange, citing only "natural political and cultural concerns" as their primary reasons. Pah! The Teacher's embrace is all the political and cultural incentive these misguided Muhammedans could ever desire, and it is to their detriment that they are blind to our compassions.\n\nNo matter - the refusal is purely a temporary matter. Our divisions are preparing to bring the inevitability of Eurasian rebirth to Tatar soil. Let the grasses weep; we will join soil with soil regardless."
 komidiplo.70.a: "They will come to regret this."

 komidiplo.71.t: "Gumilyov's Invitation"
 komidiplo.71.d: "The land of Komi has been atumble with political intrigue for as long as can be remembered: now, however, something entirely new has emerged from the chaos, and the new leadership has set its sights on us. Their leader, Gumilyov, professes a strange creed proclaiming unity with all brothers and sisters of the land, and they have even sent us a strange advertisement proclaiming a common "base of faith, tolerance and ardor" - our imams are confused, to say the least, but they appreciate the proposal.\n\nQuestions of religious tolerance aside, we do not possess any illusions as to the true nature of their proposal. Gumilyov claims that our men and armaments will be subsumed into a larger cause, one that aims to bring unity to the steppes. What he conveniently neglects to mention is that this endeavour will require colossal amounts of bloodshed; much of it, no doubt, our own.\n\nSome on our soil, however, have found his beliefs persuasive: just the other day we had to lock up an itinerant preacher with some strange ideas about this Eurasianism, and a domestic crowd rallies to the defense of a Russia we thought dead decades ago. Opposing them is most of our domestic political establishment, the latter of whom believe Gumilyov's strange ideas regarding the Rus are merely proof that Ust-Sysolsk truly is a land for madmen.\n\nWell, madmen or not, we must decide. Unity or independence? Peace or war?"
 komidiplo.71.a: "Let us go with Gumilyov."
 komidiplo.72.b: "We stand alone!"
 
 komidiplo.72.t: "The Integration of Bashkiria"
 komidiplo.72.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nUfa is festooned with the banners of Eurasia today, bearing witness to the arrival of the Teacher Gumilyov - in his first public address to the new province, Gumilyov read verses from the Koran and promised to uphold a "staunch brotherhood and mutual respect" between all peoples. This was met with cheers from a mostly amused crowd, although a few upstart imams have also been arrested for trying to cause trouble. We are certain that the troublesome talk of resistance some of these incendiaries have seeded in the population will take some time to weed out as well...\n\nWell, it is not all bad news. The religious and political establishment of Ufa have already sworn allegiance to their new superiors, and the principles of Eurasian Fraternity have been successfully rolled out in the provincial education system. Military recruitment is also progressing as well as can be hoped, although the existing officer corps is taking longer than usual to accommodate our new oaths. Perhaps a visit from State Security is in order?\n\nWell, that is all I can report from Ufa this week. We congratulate the Teacher on his success - may Eurasia be reborn from the blood and resolve of our brothers!"
 komidiplo.72.a: "Glory to Gumilyov!"
 
 komidiplo.73.t: "Stubborn Fools!"
 komidiplo.73.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nWe recognize now that our efforts to promote brotherhood and common cause between us and these damnable Bashkirians were doomed from the start; is it some peculiar fault of the constitution that engenders a lack of common sense? Is it a failed education system that causes the blindness of its leadership? Either way, the result is clear: Bashkiria has rejected our proposal for unity, and they have even gone so far as to expel our Consulate with your most humble servant included! What an insult to the Eurasian ideal, and to the Teacher himself!\n\nWe have succeeded in drawing perhaps a few hundred to the fold, and some have promised to leave this misguided land altogether to join the Leader, but there is little hope that this quasi-state will ever be persuaded to join us peacefully. Some of their most notable imams have thrown us a statement outright denying our tolerance and calling us the "spittle of Satan", in fact. Insults aside, we should not anticipate a peaceful occupation should we decide to militarily intervene.\n\nWe must prepare for the worst: eventually they will come to accept that our rule is a benevolent one, no matter how much blood is spent on their conviction."
 komidiplo.73.a: "Mere delays to the inevitable."

 komidiplo.74.t: "A Threat to Berezniki"
 komidiplo.74.d: "Kazembek's watching the guard escort the Eternal Loyalty convoy to the gates when the message comes. The sky is foggy and the wind gnaws at everything, such that the messenger's words are almost lost in the whirl:\n\n"Ust-Sytolsk wants our terms, Sir!"\n\nThere is little doubt what he means: Vyatka's active government has long warned of such a possibility. Ust-Sytolsk is run by an insane demagogue who demands the blood of his countrymen to spill in rivers for his deluded fantasy of Eurasianism, but it was believed his madness would gutter out long before he became a threat. Instead, his armies are here and an imminent threat.\n\nKazembek's meeting with his little cabinet is brief. All other options are denied them; Gumilyov demands submission or war, and there is no room for negotiation. Nor will this fight be anything but a fait accompli for the limited military strength of the statelet: they cannot hope to sustain more than a relentless retreat or a single, hopeless stand.\n\nThere is one last choice to be made, and no dignity in either option. Kazembek sighs, like something being released from his spirit, and chooses."
 komidiplo.74.a: "Submission."
 komidiplo.74.b: "War."
 
 komidiplo.75.t: "A Resignation"
 komidiplo.75.d: "Berezniki's choice is clear when the morning comes: the border garrison notes mass surrenders of border troops and a rapid breakdown of anything resembling coherent resistance. As the armies march into the statelet, they encounter a mostly subdued scene: thugs running People's Battalions pushing prisoners forth stop patrols and offer their charges to soldiers before running away, and villages offer only temporary rest and aid before shooing confused officers away.\n\nThe leadership having surrendered, its administrative apparatus begins the slow process of moving towards Gumilyov's own government, and there it receives a rude awakening. Civil servants and democratic dissenters trade homes and offices for the prison-camps, and there is nothing resembling fair trials for the intelligentsia already under arrest by the previous regime. Instead, for a select few who have earned the wrath of the Eurasianists, there is a bullet in the dead of night as the sum total of mercy offered.\n\nBerezniki dies with these quick arrests - the rest offer submission, and Gumilyov's regime is quick to begin the next step of ensuring loyalty. Young men are rounded up in squares and markets, the perennial harvest of all states, and offered the choice:"
 komidiplo.75.a: "Serve Eurasia or die for yourself."
 
 komidiplo.76.t: "A Simple Refusal"
 komidiplo.76.d: "Berezniki makes its stance clear in the dead of night: the envoy from Ust-Systolsk is expelled and his guard unceremoniously shot as a warning, and as he is taken back to the border by People's Battalions he records the following:\n\n"Watching a convulsion of violence erupt, from the safety of my truck: here and there bonfires and shouts, and I hear screams from the grasslands. They are rooting out sympathisers, some real, many imagined, and they intend to sear it out of them."\n\n"We are passing by the ruins of a village. The smell is fresh, acrid. Greasy. I ask: what happened to these people? The guard snorts and turns away, saying only: they opposed the People's Tsar."\n\n"For the first time since coming, I can no longer trust the honor of the Mladorossi. It is now apparent they are violent, angry people, and they cannot be trusted in peace any more than they can be offered mercy in war."\n\nThe report has been met by accusations of bias and outright fabrication by their own representative in our regime, but he has been expelled from the country as well: there will be no room to rebut this, and it does make a convenient narrative to rally around."
 komidiplo.76.a: "I'm not sure whether to believe this."

 komidiplo.56.t: "The WRRF Refuses!"
 komidiplo.56.d: "Excerpt from "On Deviationism: A Response to the West Russian Pseudo-Revolutionaries", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt is with deep disappointment, but no real surprise, that we discover the true nature of the so-called Arkhangelsk Socialists - or, as we now know them, the Arkhangelsk Junta. We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous Communist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism. We thank Arkhangelsk for this, and only this - because of their stubbornness, we have been inoculated from this disease once and for all."

 komidiplo.57.d: "Excerpt from "On Solidarity: A Response to the West Russian Comrades' United Front", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt was always to be expected that our brothers in arms would one day find us, their natural allies and equals, and it is with great joy that we announce that the inevitable has finally occurred. We look to the World with expectant eyes, and to the rest of our Motherland - if the generals of the Front hope to find in us the ideological strength and the collective will to undo the Undoing of the Nation, they can rest assured that they will find us more than sufficient.\n\nWe must not rest on our laurels, however. The time has come to use the massive armaments Arkhangelsk has gathered - the warlords around our scattered domains are restless. They see the march of history in their eyes. The time is coming when they will attempt to stop it.\n\nWe must simply beat them to the punch. Let us not be afraid of the future, comrades. The triumph was long delayed, but it, like the World Revolution, like the spinning of the world itself, will come one day. Only our resolve is required, that on that day we might stand in the hallowed ranks of the Martyrs and say:\n\nI was there when History needed me."

 komi_socdem.1.t: "경제 상태"
 komi_socdem.1.d: "Rodionov gazed at the hulking shell of the factory, lost as ever in thought. He was not a particularly expressive man, but occasionally he afforded his mind the luxury of imagination as a dog might be afforded a leash on a warm day. It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - Voznesensky had sent him here, on this 'fact-finding mission', to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins? Rodionov thought to the interviews he'd held with the townsfolk in the little village to the left. So few of them left, and so many empty houses. Gone with the money, or its lack, and the hope leached from their faces like a blanket sodden too long in bleach. The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting. Thick-woven cotton, a few buttons, a face and body and little cloth-knotted arms, and on the face a little smile - a child's doll, here in the ruins of Russian industry. If that wasn't symbolic, he didn't know what was."
 komi_socdem.1.a: "Much has been lost...but much can be rebuilt."
 
 komi_socdem.2.t: "Voznesensky's Speech"
 komi_socdem.2.d: "No one at the DSNP headquarters knew when the miners' protest letter made it to Voznesensky's office. Truth be told, that was probably the only reason why it got as far as his door in the first place - the DSNP had gotten past its worst day, but a residue of suspicion seemed to taint everything past the office doors these days. Even so, once the letter made it to Voznesensky there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon Voznesensky later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. Voznesensky seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to 'speak' directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling Voznesensky held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."

The Unionist grimaced at his glance, but otherwise did nothing. It wasn't like he could do anything about the man with the popular mandate, after all.\n\nNow Voznesensky approached the topic of contention again, almost patient, like a schoolmaster feigning concern. "Alexei, I believe we have certain concerns your Union has failed to address - I am not a man enamoured of warding off the inevitable, so let us try again. Will you, or will you not, stand for a work-week reduction?"\n\nThe Unionist sighed, trotting out the same words he'd always trotted out to the faux-benevolent. "With all due respect, Mr. President, you simply don't understand the material conditions here. We are already treading on the ragged edge of our employers, and it would not do to anger -"\n\nAll at once Voznesensky was animated, almost snarling. Alexei reeled at the sight. "And there it is! How dare you comport yourself like a union man while you bow and scrape before your employers! What a travesty to the spirit of Unionism, and an insult to the ideals of our Nation!" Was it just him, or was there a gleam of triumph in the President's eyes? Was this sport to him?\n\nAs the men gathered around him clapped and jeered, Alexei covered his face with his hands. He'd lost the union's heart, and who knew if his successor would resist crumbling before the demands of the people? Or if the Company wouldn't expel them from the factory altogether? Voznesensky, shaking his hands, leaned in and whispered, as if delivering a final blow:"

He hadn't even agreed to the damned meeting, so why had the President authorized a 'mandatory getaway' from his duties in the Army to attend it? Presently a staffer, dressed in formal slacks, put on a painfully plastic smile and clapped for attention. "Gentlemen, I welcome you to the first meeting of the Republic Electoral Committee. Please, let us go around the table and say a little about where we come from and what we do."\n\nAs Korolkov listened, his face grew ever more set, and his heart chilled. He'd learned from young to tell when someone was speaking about something they didn't believe. Their eyes never met yours, or their words were oddly stilted or lilting. Something about the human voice was a consummate betrayer of intent. Every one of the members of the table had a voice that betrayed him. Their gazes were false, and when they spoke of the enthusiasm they shared for the Electoral Commission red flags began to appear before Korolkov's own mental gaze.\n\nKorolkov kept his voice level as he rose to speak, but on a sudden tide of conviction he decided to probe a little. "Gentlemen, I believe that we have only breached the surface, as it were. I wish to hear a little more about why Voznesensky chose you - for our common will must be built through our understanding of our individual purposes. What can we bring to democracy - and how can we bring it about?"\n\nThe men looked to him, then around them, and they began to laugh. One slapped the table, chuckling as he got the words out. "Oh, Korolkov, you're funny. You're right. Let's admit it, folks -" The man gestured expansively to a nodding audience. "We were picked because we stand to gain from it all. We don't need to pretend at fairness, and we won't. Democracy is when Voznesensky wants things done, right?"\n\nThe man leaned close, almost predatory in his sudden smile. "And the more he wants done - the more democratic his elections will be.""

"Can anyone tell me what Democracy is?" Komorova's voice is stern and gentle in a fashion only seasoned educators can pull off. For once, the class is not silent before her gaze. One boy - Pavlovich, with the curly hair - raises his hand tentatively. She nods to him. "Yes, Pavlovich."\n\n"Demok - democracy is when people choose what they want to happen! Like when Dad and Mom choose between me and my brother to help at the shop!" Komorova nods approvingly. "That's right, Pavlovich. Very good. Democracy is when we choose the important things - not just who does the weekly chores, but also our leaders, what we dream about for our country. Our futures."\n\n"And Socialism is when the Government does things!" A voice rings from the back of the class, jubilant in its confidence. Dana. "My father says Shofarevich is right and that the - "\n\n"Your father is wrong, Dana. Socialism is a lot like when we divide apples at lunch. We give extra to those who might have less to eat, and when people can give extra slices from their own share we distribute those too. Because it's fair."\n\nKomorova smiles wanly.

This time was different. She was surrounded by her wards and these were tears of joy.\n\nWhen the German bomb destroyed the last history book, she feared the worst. Never would the children know of Rurik and his sons, or Alexander Nevsky's victory over the Teutonic Catholics. It wasn't simply the destruction of a book. It was the obliteration of their history. Then a man from the government came. He was short, balding, and had no smile. A perfect bureaucrat and a boring human being. Yet Katerina wished she picked up that tiny man and kissed him on the spot for what news he brought. New books! Not just reprints, badly copied ones at that, but actually new books with the latest in historical efforts. And not just for history, which had been lost in the bombing, but chemistry, math, biology, and the humanities.\n\n"Come children, come!" Katerina said, clapping her hands together. "Before we start our math lesson, let's read about a great and mighty Queen, mother of Rurik's grandchild, Olga of Kiev." She tapped the edge of the book, drumming up their innocent and avid excitement before reading.\n\nLater in the day she would bore them with numbers and talking about amoebas, which would help them in the future. But the past had been kept alive. What Russia once was had been kept alive. The taxes weren't simply going to bombs or bullets or bread, but making sure they had a future.

For most of her young life, the weekly trip to the town market had been something to avoid. The shopkeepers had been hostile and the shoppers angry. Arguments over weights and prices had often turned into scary shouting matches around her.\n\nThat scary market was now firmly a thing of the past, at least to Zora. For the first time she could remember, basic goods were plentiful. There were more smiles to be seen, fewer arguments, and most importantly, a plethora of new faces, stalls and goods on offer. It seemed every market day there was something new to see, smell or taste! The Shaurma she'd shared with her father last week still made her mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nAs they walked to the town square, she was running circles around her mother, nipping impatiently at her coat. Once the market came into view, her mother gave her a warm smile and a small coin. "Run along, Alsu, and enjoy yourself. Find me in front of old Mustafaev's stall in an hour's time." The words had barely left her mouth before the girl was running full sprint, off to find other excited girls and boys and to see, smell, taste and experience everything her 10 kopeks could buy."

In fact, there is no provision that allows it. The newly elected councilors will sit for the full four years," he answered in unaccented Tatar. The first half hour now spent making assurances that the failure to produce a majority was not due to the electorate doing something wrong, somehow, they were starting to get somewhere.\n\n"Since no party can command the council by themselves, they will have to work together. Many cities already do this. Sometimes they have stable alliances that rule together, sometimes the largest party builds different coalitions from issue to issue. Even President Kosygin has to listen to the other parties and work with them."\n\nHe was optimistic they could do it, too. He expected the SMR, as the largest party, would form a coalition with either the DSNP or the regional Voice of Tatary movement.

From coffee shops, libraries and nascent universities, ideas flowed to a public rapidly learning to discuss them openly. From factories and workshops, Russian and foreign the goods flowed, to city shops, town squares and village markets and a public eager to purchase them. And from citizen to citizen, to the benefit of all, was provided the basic needs of life. The country could only be great if it was good for all, only strong if it protected the weak.\n\nThere is much still left to do, and the road will be long and hard, but what we have suffered to come here will drive us onward.

Exhaustive in nature, they have been instantiated at every level of governmental administration, and reforms range from examinations of school density distributions, to the development of standardized testing measures, and more besides.\n\nHowever, perhaps the greatest achievement of the state in this regard has been the general agreement by all concerned parties that the quality of available education has sharply increased. Strenuous qualification standards, the focused attraction and repatriation of exiled and expatriate academics, and the provision of proper funding and equipment for scientific purposes, have all contributed to this.\n\nAlthough the level of the Republic's available academic offerings does not yet begin to approach that of more established localses, such as the Reich, the Sphere, or the United States, the gap is quickly closing.

Valery promised himself that once this was all over, he would take some time out of his schedule to speak some very deliberate words to the visual designer.\n\nWell, it wasn't like the logo was important. Taking his placard, Valery began the twenty-minute trek to his appointed District. He had at least gotten lucky with the placing: he'd heard some volunteers would have to stay overnight thanks to the travel time back and forth. As he arrived in the little park-square, he set up his placard next to a couple of chairs with a sign hung between lamp-lights: A CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY! ALL WELCOME!\n\nThe first to approach the improvised booth he'd set up was a pensioner, a lady in her sixties clutching a handbag. Valery helped her into the seat opposite his as she snarled at him. "Get out of my district, reactionary. This place isn't for your type and it never will be."\n\nValery simply smiled, drawing his secret weapon from his bag: a flask of tea, chilled and thoroughly stirred. "Reactionary? That's an interesting word to use, madam. I'd like to hear more about what you have to say about us - and if I'm not wrong, you stay on Petrov Street, don't you? Our representatives have never been to the area..."\n\nThe afternoon wore on, clouds scudding and fading across the patterned bands of the horizon. Valery danced with words, taking the lady on a tour of democratic ideals, PSD's manifesto and policymaking, and the agenda of Unionism. By the time the lady left, her head was full of strange new thoughts and something even stranger. A sympathy to democracy.\n\nAs Valery made a satisfied note on his log, he wrote the lady's name in red, with a star next to it."

There was valuable information in there, and the Boss would kill them both if she knew they'd wasted office supplies on a mere health concern.\n\nThe middle-aged woman did not resist as he tucked her head above her arms and his jacket on her back. Twenty uninterrupted hours of work: it was a wonder she wasn't in a coma. Well, it was the best he could do. Grabbing the document she'd been working on, Nikolai took his position and began to rewrite her own words. In truth, he already knew what she was working on.

Many of my own interactions were with factory managers who expected only the good things in life, not the responsibility to think about their implications.\n\nThis event, however, shows genuine promise for the District. I'm not sure whether to peg it to the laudable enthusiasm displayed by our surveyors, or to the warmth and compassion of the services we've offered under our The Government Works For All campaign. Either way, we believe the many agencies we've collaborated with deserve rich praise for their conduct during this campaign, and the near 60-percent increase in voting registrations rests in no small part on their many shoulders. Special thanks go to the Mitvol family, whose invaluable help in setting up our conversational tea-booths boosted our public image immensely.

Yes, he'd had his differences with Ivana, and yes, he'd come to blows with the Neo-Stolypinists in his ranks more times than he had fingers, but he'd kept the Party together even as so many had lost faith in his direction - if he stopped now, what would it mean for his life's work?\n\nThat was what Yahontov told Stalina, over a cup of hot tea at one of the less run-down cafes in this part of the Capital.

Many in our party support this policy, while many others critique it for being against Russia and its values. The party has been split in two by this issue, and if we do not step in, it could divide the party even further and destabilize our democracy.\n\nAdopted by party members many years ago, the policy espoused by the PSD, or rather a collection of policies, are very critical of Russia's past actions - especially those of the empire. Those who support the policy, primarily those who helped create it, say the policy is necessary to encourage positive change and improvements in Russia, as we should not forget those who failed before us. However, some say it is so anti-Russian that it must be abolished. Those who critique it say it goes against the ideals of a strong, united Russia, and if advocated for by the PSD, it will only weaken the party and the republic in the long run.\n\nTo maintain the unity of the party, action must be taken. If we want a strong Russia, we must have a strong party as well."

 komi_authdem.9.t: "The Veteran"
 komi_authdem.9.d: ""Meh! I'm not stupid, if it weren't for the bottle, none of you would come around."\n\nSuch was the climax of Nadia's lengthy argument with Old Man Vadim, the most stubborn veteran in all of Russia. Nadia sighed, threw up her hands in defeat, and finally departed the little cabin, an hour after her friends had already left. All except Pavel, as it turned out, who smiled at her from a chair on the porch, causing instant guilt and embarrassment to come bubbling to the surface.\n\n"You have a strange taste in friends", he spouted with scathing sarcasm. She shot him a glare, and as he stood up, a punch on the shoulder. She hated to admit it, but the statement held some truth. What was she doing hanging around an old soldier all day? Her friends had come for the booze and the tall tales, two things Vadim had in spades. He was an entertaining spectacle to be sure, but for the rest of the young people in Syktyvkar, nothing more.\n\n"I just think that old fool needs some help is all. It isn't healthy to spend all your time drunk, weaving words and reminiscing alone. Besides, there's a good heart buried in there somewhere" Pavel responded knowingly.\n\n"Well, if you want to spend all your time around old kooks with Soviet flags on their porch, I won't stop you..."\n\nShe knew he was right, on some level. Who was she to tell some old man what to do? Still, each week she would find herself lingering in Vadim's residence, shooting the shit in lengthy kitchen discussions. There was something tender about the old man, and as the months went by, mild curiosity became a genuine friendship. Vadim had become Nadia's pet project, and she encouraged him to come into town. Like a turtle, coaxed from its shell, her efforts had begun to yield fruit."

 komi_authdem.91.d: "Things had changed.\n\nNadia still remembered her conversation with him the night before. It had been a rough day, rejected in both her class project and a romantic prospect. Vadim, usually a belligerent complainer, had noticed her change in attitude. He was calm, caring, and for once, her confidant. She had sat crying on his furniture, feeling better after a long talk.\n\nToday, as she approached the small cottage from a distance, a pit formed in her stomach. Vadim's flag was down, and his front door wide open. Two cars flanked each wall, and an armed militant leaned against one.\n\n"Whats going on?" She called out nervously\n\n"Displaying symbols of antidemocratic regimes is a crime," the militant retorted matter of factly ",what do you care?"\n\nNadia felt sick. If there was anyone in Syvkvytar who would resist such a measure, it would be Vadim. Though he could hardly make his way across the house sometimes, she held no doubt's that the tough old bastard would throw punches before taking down his flag voluntarily. The thought of Vadim, bloodied and languishing in jail, was almost too much to bear.\n\nShe set off in a panic, afraid of what she would find when she arrived."

 komi_authdem.10.t: "The Russian Identity"
 komi_authdem.10.d: "Stalina stared at the proposal before her, annoyed at its existence. The "Party Program Regarding Russian Identity" was dripping with danger. A political landmine had found its way to her desk, shoving a wrench in her proceeding with more important matters.\n\nOn the "Left" were those that supported autonomy. Russia, they rightly argued, was neither wholly European or Asian. Beneath her shattered banner lived many races; Buryats, Kazakhs, Tartars, Bashkirs. Each had unique customs, and a distinct identity. Trying to force them all into some unitary "Russian" identity, as their forebears had done, would only lead to resentment, and in the case of uniting Russia, popular resistance was an untenable prospect.\n\nOn the right were her comrades of sort, advocating the exact opposite. The task before Russia was grand; uniting a broken and disparate people against a teutonic invader. There would be no room for bickering in the unification struggle to come. The peoples of Russia had for centuries shared an identity, regardless of ethnicity, and could only restore themselves behind such a common name.\n\nUltimately, she did not feel strongly either way. This was a theoretical issue, something to be resolved when they had the luxury to do so. Much more pressing was rebuilding an economy, guarding against foreign threats, establishing control over newly acquired territories.\n\nYet still, she knew the inflammatory debate that had conspired to bring this proposal to her desk. It was the right wing that held most sway, and it was the right wing that kept her in power. In the interest of the Free Russian republic to come, many compromises would have to be made.\n\nBegrudgingly, she signed off on the right wing's proposal, authorising their blatant attempt to shape the Russian future in their image. To live in Russia was to be Russian, insignificant cultures be damned. Besides, what would matter most to the Baskirs and Tartars, bread and electricity? Or some pseudo-autonomy?"

 komi_authdem.11.t: "In the Classroom"
 komi_authdem.11.d: ""Alright, class, today we will be learning about the colonization and conquest of Siberia. Many centuries ago, Russia was much smaller than it was before the Great Patriotic War and the Russian Revolution. Siberia remained much of a wasteland, with few people living there. To expand the glory of the empire and spread Russian culture, the Tsars decided to settle more Russians east of the Urals. Nowadays, many Russians live in Siberia, and it is no different from Russia the further West you go. Expanding into Siberia made Russia big and strong. No one wants to be in a tiny country, do they?" The teacher paused and looked around the classroom, finding a boy with his hand up.\n\n"Teacher, what happened to the people in Siberia before we went there? Did they go somewhere else?" The boy questioned.\n\nThe teacher paused a moment, thinking. "Well, as I said, there were some people in Siberia before us. Not much changed for them though, they are still there, even in Siberia today. Back then though, many were ruled by terrible khans and suffered under raiders until Russia united them and brought them into Russia. With Russian culture, they learned to work together with each other and the new Russians." Content with her explanation, the teacher began to change the subject, then the boy spoke up once again.\n\n"Didn't they fight back though, like we fought the Germans?"\n\n"What, that's nothing like what happened at all," replied the teacher, obviously vexed by the boy. "Those are two entirely different situations. The raiders fought us of course, but they were murdering poor and innocent Russians. They had to be fought. Meanwhile, the Germans planned to exterminate all of Russia! The Germans were brutish devils while the Russians were pure saviors. Now, I don't want to hear about this any longer. We are going to talk about the war with the Polish Commonwealth to liberate the Slavic peoples there. Open your books to page 402, please.""

 komi_authdem.12.t: "To Write a Speech"
 komi_authdem.12.d: "Stalina sighed as she looked at the multitude of suggestions for her upcoming speech that had been thrown onto her desk. When she had thought of working to unite Russia, working to a better tomorrow for democracy, she hadn't imagined fools throwing themselves around at irrelevant issues instead of looking at the bigger picture. The biggest points of contention lately had not been of military strategy or anything that actually had any meaning. No, the bureaucrats were battling over the "Redemption of Russia". She needed to cement the state position, otherwise the Republic would still be babbling on about culture in the year 2000. Looking over suggestions for opening her speech gave her a headache. One leftist proposed the opening address to be towards "Those who reside within our controlled area of Russia". That contrasted with one man on the right who declared that she should address her speech to "The most loyal Russians of the Empire". It went on like that, paragraphs and pages on what some thought her first words should be. That didn't even brush upon the rest of the "critique" she was given. Some believed, on both sides, that how deep her voice was held the utmost importance. One concerned educator wrote in frantic pace about how speaking deep-voice would seem "Imperialistic". A miner who had learned their letters just to write to her pleaded in scrawled Russian that she acted "as a man".\n\nStalina, having wasted her night, tossed the pile to the waste basket. For this speech, she already knew the general ideas of what both sides of the party wanted. The Left, pandering to progressive causes and pluralism. The Right, lip service to a strong Russia. She weighed her options. She had little care for the actual issue, but the Right were presently a more powerful ally. It would anger the Leftists, sure, but, perhaps, that didn't quite matter all that much anyways. As long as Russia could be united under the Free Republic, it didn't matter who she stiffed. Decided, she finally began to write."

Many of the papers were the usual: status reports from the Moskowien border, reconstruction progress, and anti-partisan efforts. One document, however, captured Stalina's full attention.\n\nApparently, just across the Urals, another warlord had unified a large chunk of Western Siberia. The West Siberian People's Republic, led by one Lazar Kaganovich, had unified a quarter of Russia. Stalina would have dismissed them as any other Soviet warlord, except that these communists idolized Joseph Stalin, Stalina's father.\n\nAccording to Kaganovich, "Stalinism" consisted of an exceptionally hardline interpretation of communist ideology, with highly-centralized power and a focus on mass-industrialization. Stalina's father had died when she was young, but it seemed accurate to what she remembered of him.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter what specific strain of communist belief Kaganovich spouted, because at the end of the day they were still communists. Russia had suffered under Soviet rule once, Stalina refused to let it happen again."

"이런 사업에는 시세가 없나?" 군인들은 서로를 바라보며 낄낄 웃었습니다. 그들 중 한 명이 갈리나를 향해 뭔가를 던졌고, 그녀는 깜짝 놀라 겨우 그것을 잡았습니다. 군 배급품 비스킷. 공식.\n\n"우린 그저 그런 군대가 아니에요, 아가씨. 이건 모두 정부의 통제 아래 운영되는 것입니다." 장교는 간신히 입술 위로 얼굴을 씰룩거리며 웃었습니다.

 komi_despotism.2.d: "Ludmila liked the quiet of the morning office. Boss Matovsky seldom came in before 11, the workers filed in at 9 sharp and between these times a peace descended upon the little cubicles of the Tax Registry Bureau. She would take her custom-made cup (a gift from a friend) and swish the dregs of her tea as she paced the office, taking in the sheer freshness of the morning streaming in through the office windows. There was something about solitude, Ludmila felt, that made the everyday magical - it was the redeeming perk of an otherwise uneventful job.\n\nShe wondered, as she often did, what the men and women of the office did to make them stay so late. Most offices closed at 5 and opened at 8, but she'd been specified to leave the offices open till 2am. If her parents hadn't passed on a few years back she'd have refused the job outright for its late hours. Even so, she was a light sleeper.\n\nAnd sometimes files passed, here and there, without even Ludmila noticing, and some of the dossiers she managed were thick one day and thin the next. It wasn't her job to notice, and so she made an effort not to. Better to keep to silence than to risk an intrusion - or her salary.\n\nThis morning, she thought, she would make herself her favourite tea-brew. Humming a light tune, she walked to the office doors and was taken quite by surprise by the thud of gunfire.\n\nAs the noise hammered her ears, she huddled by instinct against her desk and watched her world torn asunder by burly soldiers hefting crate upon crate of files - and protesting men - out the door. An officer, clambering up to her, yelled at her to go home - and four words, repeated over and over, such that they rang in her head with every step of the journey."

He had no idea how he'd escaped the initial payroll purges, but here he was, the last real tea-boy in whatever the Republic's leadership apparatus had become. And he had a job to do.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he struggled to write everything down: the two animated figures certainly didn't seem terribly concerned about their scribe, talking in a constant, uninterrupted flow of dialogue. Damn this job! He knew the two were friends - the way they were at ease with each other, it was hard not to see them as the two nerdy children in every schoolroom - but did they really have to speak this much on official business?\n\nStalina paused, her face momentarily darkening, and Brukhonekov murmured a silent prayer as he finished the last notes on their conversation. A discussion on democratic reversion, the usual talk of military loyalty - nothing beyond the ordinary. But if he knew Stalina, her pause meant she was moving to the real meat of the conversation.\n\n"Petro, you are of course aware of why I am here.

They crossed each street once or twice, leaving a trail of paper behind them, and then they left for the town centre. Noises and the echo of audiovisual equipment could be heard through noon, as residents hid in their beds and snapped obscenities at the menace. For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world.

The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked "APPROVED". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window.

How had she worked with them for so long without tiring of the effort?\n\nPresently they were speaking regarding the latest Political Reservation measures, measures she'd put in place to ensure the safety of the State.

Well, this latest bill would shut up the yapping once and for all. Hiding her growing irritance she waved for the Speaker to admit her name to the list.\n\nSavouring the looks on the legislators' faces as she did so, Stalina spoke in what seemed almost like glee: "Under the auspices of the Executive Directive Act, I declare the Political Reservation Measures under discussion today a matter of National Security. Discussion of this topic is hereby curtailed; now, if I could invite the audience to examine page 63 of our latest Economic Budget..."\n\nWatching the sheepdogs storm out of the Chamber, Stalina felt something churn in her stomach.

Morozov lost friends, one by one, in the trickle back to the provinces and villages. One last act of protest.

Assuming, of course, it came to an end at all.\n\nMorozov preferred not to think along those lines. Perhaps the residual unease was why receiving the news of the new Democratisation Order gave him such a wild joy - the President had been explicit in her orders, and he looked forward to retrieving his old membership rolls. A new beginning was here for his movement.\n\nAs he looked on, however, darkness once again clouded his vision: for it appeared that someone had gone through his membership records with a sharp eye and a sharper knife.

She'd been one of the most terrifying debaters in the Party before Stalina had managed to integrate their ideals into a united force, in the early days - even now she was facing dogged resistance in the Legislative Branch for a controversial stance on the latest welfare bills, and coming out all the stronger for it.\n\nAs they stared in mutual confusion at the empty room, Stalina cleared her throat and rose to speak.

Morozov leaned close, the skein of humor slipping off his face. "In all due seriousness, however, we would like to know when we can get back to governance, and representing the people, like we are paid to do."\n\nStalina kneaded her temples. It was time to bite the bullet. "I assure you, this period is temporary. In my years of work, have you ever seen me hesitate in my struggle to build democracy? I will not abandon my long work for the sake of petty power." She gestured at the Assembly. "Tell your friends, scream it at your enemies. We will restore you sooner than you think."\n\nMorozov looked unsatisfied, but nodded. For the both of them, this would have to suffice until some better alternative emerged."

 komi_despotism.12.d: "The National Assembly was a cast of eclectic characters, to put it charitably, at the best of times - and Stalina's regime had been one wild worst time after another, in quick succession, for quite awhile now. Legislators gathered in resentful clumps, like driftweed caught in some strange tide, and aired their thoughts on the matter. Stalina knew she was losing control - reading crowds was intuitive to her - and for the first time in quite awhile she struggled to compose a response.\n\nPresently a group of middle aged bureaucrats padded up to her, led by old Morozov, long-time associate even if they had never really agreed on much. Morozov cast a quizzical look at her, unsmiling, calculative as ever. "We need to talk about the role that the Assembly plays in, well, governing this country. As you can see, we are one-track horses: when the racetrack is denied us, we whinny in our stables until we are set loose."\n\nStalina nodded slowly. These people were worse than horses, she thought: horses could be ridden, while people were never so trustworthy as to carry out even that simple task. How many times had she been sidelined by the allies she had trusted? How many times had simple mandates gotten bogged down in the realpolitik she was forced to endure?\n\nShe had made the mistake of betting on horses once before. It was time to learn from history. Rising to leave, she said loudly, so Morozov's men could all hear it: "The stable gates will stay locked, then, until these horses learn obedience. My mission is absolute."\n\nCasting a quelling glance at Morozov, she added, "Yours, however, is not. You would do well to remember that." Morozov watched her leave, dull horror etched on his face - but Stalina had never been one to look back"

 komi_despotism.13.d: "Stalina's fingers trembled as she wrote. How best to describe what she was doing? Never in her career had she dreamed of succumbing to her worst impulses - and yet the nightmare of paranoia and perpetual control seemed to unfold as she wrote it into being, horrifying and clear as day.\n\nA light breeze blew through the study, gently flickering the candle she was using for light. Stalina kneaded her eyes, clutched at a useless coffee mug, and gazed at the dense script. Something in her felt deeply unbalanced, like a child playing on an endless swing whose hinges grew ever looser. Any moment she would fall off, and the game would be lost, and the long work would be lost with it. No, this was not the time for some idle nonsense! Only an objective examination of the facts would do. Rousing within herself the old strength she relied on, she stared at the current Bill.\n\nThe present draft would pass muster as it stood, she was sure. Increases in public security budgets and extraordinary provisions for law enforcement, investigations into public journalism outlets with suspicious sources, a crackdown on radical unionism: that was surely uncontroversial. And yet she wondered if she should make it lighter - perhaps only an investigation of formal socialist parties instead of a blanket attack on the unions? Yes, it seemed better to adopt a gentle touch.\n\nAnd yet it seemed woefully incomplete, almost vulnerable, in the space of an eye's blink. No, better to be harsh and stable than to regret leniency! Yes, a forced destruction of independent outlets here - and here - surely that would bring the Republic's radicals to its knees. Surely this would be enough.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet...Stalina's head whirled, a maelstrom of thought. It was far too much, it was never enough. How had it ever come to this? And was a better choice even possible?"

Couples paced, giggling as they did so, down the broadwalks of the city centre, and to their flanks the city came to cautious life. Here and there a busker played their repertoire to all who would listen, drawing in curious crowds and the occasional tourist. If there were signs of protest, they were certainly well hidden (although the recent Public Security Act was very comprehensive, it was not supernatural).\n\nShe felt tired, hollowed out, even. The preceding months had taken their toll on her sleep schedule, and she'd been through so many arguments with her closest staff that she sometimes felt ashamed to greet them in the morning. It felt like a vast abyss separated her from the old Stalina, the committed Democrat, the speech-writer and rabble-rouser. Would her past self even like the person she had become?\n\nStalina sighed. Perhaps this was how her father had felt in the last years of his life. Withdrawn and burnt out by the endless contention for power - it was no wonder the old Steel had rusted and broken, and with what to show for it? A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day. For now, what she had built would suffice. She reached to the telephone to call Kosygin. Even if the Republic disdained her, her friends - and her brandy - would not."

Usually this took the form of mild snarls and accusations of incompetence, which was comparatively mild for the Republic's politics. It was of little consequence to the advisors, and after she calmed down she was usually more amenable to discussion, even if she remained reluctant to change her views on anything. Anger was common, and easy to deal with.\n\nThis preternatural calm, however, was not. Stalina looked at the senior staff of the Economic Bureau, calm, unsmiling and totally implacable. "No, I will not. That is the end of the matter. I will not reconsider the signing of the Sovereignty Act under any circumstances." She flipped open a dossier, looking through its contents as if her staff were simply not there.\n\nOne of the advisors, a mid-level bureaucrat, made the mistake of speaking his thoughts. "President Stalina, with all due respect, the Act will cripple our economic will and devour our private industry. I have been on the phone with worried corporate clients all week."\n\nInstantly her gaze, as scorching as the sun and far less measured in its touch, was upon him. "With all due respect, I care not a whit for you or the corporate suits. My job and my heart lie with this country, and if we are to sell its treasure to those who cannot be trusted with it we may as well disband the Army and lower our banners tomorrow."\n\nShe turned to her papers with a rare vehemence. "You are forgiven the little transgression of your ignorance. Speak against me again and I will ensure even that privilege is stripped from you. Now leave.""

Beside him the squad rustled in its frantic activity: water canteens needed filling, loaded bags checking, rifles inspecting. There were barely enough hands on deck to accomplish it all.\n\nAs the officer lumbered away, Kirov whispered, "Shitbag." What an insufferable son of a whore! And scheduling this goddamn idiotic march on a Friday fucking evening, of all things! Did the Colonel have his brain installed where the arsehole was meant to be?\n\nGod, it was intolerable - and the only reason why he put up with it all was because the Republican Army was still the finest pension-fund in all of the Republic. Kirov was a man of faith - he had faith only in what men could bring him, that was. And having looked through the pension plans, he knew exactly what the next few decades would bring him, assuming he lived through it all.\n\nWell, time to stop speculating on the future: the present, and his squad, awaited him. He moved towards his squad. "Are you lot ready to go? Get your thumbs out of your asses, gentlemen. It's time to start hauling ass, and if you lot have taught me anything it's that men without brains can get very, very far in life. It's time to start putting that theory to practice."\n\nA chuckle escaped the squad, and Kirov's gaze shot to its source. Glaring at the conscript, Kirov let the coldness of the evening into his voice. "Did you think that was funny, Private? Don't give me an answer. You'll have time to think about it on guard duty tomorrow. Double shifts." He turned to the rest of the squad. "Get ready to move. One mike.

Another exercise was planned the following week, and the Commanding Officer had put everyone on standby for emergency planning duty. Officer Nabatov had been on emergency duty the last twenty-four hours in a row, and the map wasn't just swimming in front of him - it was doing victory laps in his eyes.\n\nShaking his head, he took another swing of the jealously-hoarded coffee ration and looked again at his prooftexts. He had to make the maps fit together, damnit, and in their proper order - there had to be some applicability of the Manual of Foreign Operational Doctrine here. What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed. How on earth could he make this offensive work in the five hours he had left?\n\nHe barely noticed the Commanding Officer approach, but he did smell the pungent cigarette fumes on his breath. "Trouble planning this? Here, try this reference - American work, British defense. Good for the terrain, armor strength parity might need a little rework though." And the CO was gone as Nabatov's eyes widened behind him.\n\nYes, he thought as he flicked through the manual. This would work. This would work! His legs turning to jelly from the exultance and stress, Nabatov scribbled a few hasty notes and rose to find the Strategic Briefing Notes. And then, for the first time in two days, he could sleep."

"If the Council truly believes that this newfangled strategy is what is best, I think it best that we safeguard the real power far away from them until they are disabused of the notion."\n\nStrelkov nodded helplessly. "Commander Grigorenko! Please, this is not a usurpation or anything of the sort. We are simply attempting to better strategy now that our Air Force is in working condition. After all, we in the Republic cannot afford casualties the same way large countries can - "\n\nAnother binder-thud, this one louder than the first. "You are delusional if you think that the air-land strategy will safeguard our losses! Strelkov, I have been working for close to a decade in the Military, and our entire operational doctrine has been configured to work with combined armor-infantry operations. The Air Force will only complicate this state of affairs by stealing resources and money from us."\n\nStrelkov kneaded his temples. "Commander, there is to be no stealing - we will allocate funds as we deem fit for the health of the Republic. Moreover, we are aware that the transition to air-land battle will take quite awhile, which is why we need you on board. Who else could train with us?"\n\nGrigorenko simply shook his head.

Another day in the Ministry of Defense and its assembled glories. Well, glories was a strong term, but he lacked another word for it.\n\nAt least this paperwork would be of use to the Republic - a paper drafted by one of his staffers on the movement of hybridized troops in the last days of the West Russian War, and a note on how to make it applicable to the Republic's current situation. Poring through its conclusions, Korolkov nodded, making notes in the margins. There was plenty of work to be done to bring the military up to parity with its contemporaries, and this would definitely help.\n\nA stubble-headed member of the General Staff approached him, and Korolkov got up to show the formalities. "Stand down. I'm looking for a paperback, something to fill the gap on someone's chair. Hmm, have you seen any spare binders? Preferably something slim? Ah, this will do," and the paperwork was snatched from Korolkov's desk.\n\nThe General Staff member retreated, and Korolkov kneaded his temples in frustration.

Each ship, he had told her, was far bigger than the fishing junk they shared: they had guns, ammunition stores, quarters for dozens of people on each ship, and the burnished steel shone like gold in the sun's rays, like some forgotten treasure brought to light.\n\nOf course, that had been a long time ago, he had whispered, and now the Republic they were in was landlocked, and the dream, for now, was dead. But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do. A vision, after all, was worthless if not fulfilled.\n\nShe wished her father could see her now, standing upon the deck of the Republic's latest vessel. He'd always been foolish, and perhaps a little too attached to the drink at the end, but he'd never wavered, and her dreams were his dreams, too.\n\nAnd watching the flag fly above a silver-sheened ocean, gulls flying overhead as the engine whirred, Yefimova felt something in her heart glow.

Perhaps it was acceptable in Zlatoust, where standards were as low as the Altai Basin's dunes, but not here. He lowered the gun and began to pore over the blueprints scattered around him in a half-blossom.\n\nPerhaps it had been the material, or perhaps there was a structural cause in sight. The latter would explain why the soldiers on the Testing Squad had complained so bitterly about the loading and unloading drills. Something about the barrel, then - but their reports had focused on the firing-pin mechanism itself, so it couldn't possibly be that. Maybe in the way the barrel interacted with the firing pin? Yes, perhaps the explosion of the shot had cracked something within.\n\nA passing soldier yelled, "Korenev! Hard at work? It's almost lunch!" Koronev, barely looking up, greeted him and told him, in no uncertain terms, to go away. The soldier giggled as he left: it was adorable, the way Korenev was so immersed in his work he was blind to everything else. Absolutely adorable.\n\nKorenev's mind was far away, however: the rifle, as did all the equipment he'd been given, preoccupied him. Some solution needed to be found in the meantime. The barrel problem would probably need a full rework of the design, perhaps even a back to basics test. But the main problem, as he saw it, was the drooping. Perhaps - yes - that would have to do.\n\nKorenev scribbled: PUT SOME EXTRA STOCK ON THE RIFLE AND TELL THEM TO AIM HIGHER. Satisfied, he nodded and went on to the next rifle."

The Budget simply didn't have enough room for the additions of tank units to the Regiments of the existing armor corps. It would be necessary to reconsolidate their existing assets into a single unit, and retrain them day and night until they could perform the roles they'd missed.\n\nSo the People's Hussar Division, as it was known (no one could remember the actual number and reference), was formed, and the farmers and their sons and daughters watched the tanks move row on row into distant fields, towards the base where they were to be christened in a new name and mould.\n\nThere were failures, as there always were: a few of the new models, fresh from the factory, had broken down in a muddy field, and no one was yet sure if it was equipment failure or a planning error that had brought them down. The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit. There was a sense of general anticipation - this one, it was believed, would go far, and it would take the Republic with it."

It had been, if this little contraption was accurate, almost half an hour since the scheduled delivery to the Military Academy. How the hell was he supposed to get there on time?\n\n"Yes, far indeed. I've been waiting forty-five minutes myself." There was a twinkle in the other man's eye. Sokalov sized him up, suspicious as a miner's son in a poor district could be of someone who looked suspiciously bourgeois. Dressed in relatively well-tailored clothing, with a little cap to stave off the wind - this man looked nothing like what he'd been told to encounter. "I don't believe we've met. I'm Semyon.

"Well then, I suppose we'll get acquainted eventually. What's your designated specialisation?" The man rustled about in his breastpocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. "Ah, I'm assigned to Artillery and Fire Control. You're Infantry Standards, I take it? I know they're taking a lot of them these days, and you seem the type."\n\nSokalov nodded, chuckling a little. "Can't believe they sent me to Vyatka after sending me into the roughbodies - think the Army wants to kill me, between the both of us." Semyon chuckled back, and the air between them grew easy. "Why did you sign up? This course ain't gonna be easy for none of us."\n\nThe man seemed almost shy. "The same reason as you. I love my country."

It's all the bodyguards can do to keep him safe from the chaos.\n\nIt gets a little better when the Ambassador is ushered to the Finnish Government's official headquarters. There the mob of intense reporters is locked out, and the only man in a suit the Ambassador must face is the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, what he lacks in numbers he more than makes up for in intensity: there seems no escaping from his intense, silent gaze.\n\nAt least the conversation starts cordial. The Ambassador makes polite small talk, drawing from the little he knows of the Finnish within his own country: he talks of music, culture, shared brotherhood. The Prime Minister replies in kind, but there is something in his eyes that reminds the Ambassador of a butcher checking his latest cut for its weight and value. Something transactional, something shallow.\n\nThen the Prime Minister looks him in the eye and asks: What is the status of the occupied territory of Karelia? The room seems to drop a hundred degrees in minutes.

At remote ports, antiquated cargo ships flying a new flag are dropping anchor and selling goods. Meanwhile, at rail yards across the country, oil barrels and lumber piles marked "MADE IN THE WESTERN RUSSIAN REPUBLIC" are turning up. There has been a great deal of discussion in the halls of business and government about this new governmental claimant, especially in recent months, but now, the reality has become clear. This [KOM.GetName] is here, and they are willing to trade with us. Hopefully this marks the start of a positive relationship, and a dawn of newfound stability in the Russian chaos."

According to their message, they are a democracy, committed to the ideals of liberty and freedom for all throughout their territories. Citing our shared ideological outlook, they have requested diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state. Should we offer them this recognition? It may affect our diplomatic relations with other European powers, but we also need all the allies that we can get in this brave new world."

West Russia's representatives have been talking the ears off of influential economists, politicians, and government bureaucrats, and now the word on plenty of lips is "investment". The WRFR has vast fields of oil, a strong timber industry, and increasingly developed light and heavy industrial sectors, such as steel and chemicals. In addition, given river and rail development, the WRFR also has economic ties to other parts of Russia, Central Asia, and regions further east. However, this nascent economy needs a boost in order to be all that it can be. Should we offer direct financial aid, investment subsidies, and perhaps R&D funding to the WRFR? It could yield economic and political benefits down the line, even if the cost up-front strikes some as unreasonable."

 komi_dem_generic.39.d: "An interesting offer has recently come to the State Department from the embassy of the [KOM.GetName]. The country controls a series of ports along the White Sea, in the far north of Russia, near Finland and the Baltic region. While the sea is fairly quiet these days, there is a substantial amount of military infrastructure left over from when ports like Arkhangelsk were controlled by the West Russian Revolutionary Front. The WRFR is offering to give us basing rights at these ports, in exchange for a yearly increase to their aid funding of approximately 550 million dollars. While this sum may seem eye-popping at first, it's a rounding error for a budget as big as the USA's, and in exchange, the US Navy would have a toehold deep in the heart of Russia, within striking distance of numerous strategic targets. What should we do?"

For us, this is a significant diplomatic coup. We get an American military presence for defense, and a substantial amount of funding that can be put to good use. Already, officials at our foreign ministry are toasting to a job well done."

While the American government has noted that our offer of basing rights on the White Sea had its benefits, and that they desired continually positive diplomatic relations, the price tag was ultimately too high for them to justify. Negotiations over the agreement broke down, and unfortunately, they broke down quite publicly. Word of the failure has already made its way to the press, and some commentators are calling for the foreign minister to resign over the matter. With the diplomatic row and the loss of a potential financial lifeline, this has clearly been a major blow to our government's standing."

The Democratic Socialist People's Party, supporting democratic socialism in the republic, have started to spread their message of equality and worker's rights. This has gained the support of the poor and the workers of Russia, who now see the DSNP as a party for the poor. It seems the DSNP will have a lot of support from the laborers and the working class.\n\nThe Democratic Socialist's promises for equality in the republic have also gained the support of many laborers and farmers alike, unhappy with their conditions and especially with the landowners that have been gaining power ever since the collapse of authority in the warlord era. However, the DSNP's past scandals still hurts the party to this day, and it may be an uphill battle to win the election."

 komi_dem_generic.43.d: "The Gorky factory hall was oddly quiet as Nikolai Voznesensky stood facing the countless factory workers, tired from hours of hard labor. They didn't seem interested in him, more glad to have a break than anything. Voznesensky knew he would have to make a good speech to get these workers on his side.\n\n"Laborers of Gorky, I come here with promises. Promises of workers rights, healthcare, higher wages, safety regulations, more pay and fewer hours. You have worked tirelessly for Russia. Whether you produce tanks or toys, you are the ones who will be building a better Russia. Not the politicians, not the economists, but you, the worker. Producing weapons or civilian goods, you make a better Russia for us all, one step at a time."\n\nThe workers had begun to perk up, it seemed like they were becoming more interested in what Voznesensky had to say. "For all you have done, I thank you. But I wouldn't be doing anything if I was just congratulating you or giving out promises, would I? I assure you, in my presidency, the workers will be my top priority. Your hard work will no longer be unrewarded! For what you do for this country, you will be duly compensated. I promise all of you, no worker of this republic will ever be ignored again!"\n\nAs he finished the speech, Voznesensky looked into the eyes of everyone in the room. Eyes of hope, pain, and a desire for a better life. He could not let these people down."

As such, the pamphlet mentions the DSNP's plan to increase workers' rights in great detail. Plans of workplace democracy, empowering unions, and increased pay have been promised to all the workers of the republic. The pamphlet also goes on to say how the DSNP plans to transition the republic into a socialist democracy and a socialized economy, creating a republic of equality. Still, many doubt the DSNP, if elected, could successfully implement any of their reforms."

 komi_dem_generic.45.d: "The campaigning parties continue to spread their platforms across Russia, and the PSD is no different. From the large cities to the small villages, Sovereign Democratic Party presence can be seen almost everywhere. A platform for a strong, sovereign Russia, the PSD hopes to appeal to everyone, the factory workers, the farmers, and the business owners. The Sovereign Democratic Party hopes anyone who cares for their motherland will vote for them in the coming elections.\n\nThe PSD, hoping to steal votes from other parties as well, are also promising social democratic and capitalist policies. Social policies as well as free-market economics are becoming a main point of the Sovereign Democratic Party. One thing is for sure, the PSD should not be underestimated."

 komi_dem_generic.46.t: "The PSD Platform"
 komi_dem_generic.46.d: "More pamphlets are circulating across the country from the parties. The PSD's includes stories from everyday Russians both young and old as well as the party's platform. Containing the ideals for a strong and independent Russia that stands above its enemies, the pamphlet has many promises for the future, hoping to gain the support of every Russian.\n\nAs written in the pamphlet, the Sovereign Democratic Party has promised a social-democratic republic, one that does not ignore the poor and in need, yet bashes the DSNP for its radical ideas. The pamphlet also advertises anti-extremism and anti-radicalism, denouncing both fascism and communism. The PSD has also promised more liberal social policies, advocating for equality and liberty. Most important to the PSD however, is the reclamation of Russia. In their platform, the PSD has promised to focus efforts on reunifying the motherland, no matter the cost. With this, the republic under the PSD can expect an increase in the size of the military and preparations for a war economy.\n\nIt's certain the PSD has much support, but will a platform of war and reclamation work with everyone?"
 komi_dem_generic.46.a: "And I thought they were authoritarian!"

 komi_dem_generic.47.t: "Surrounding Threats"
 komi_dem_generic.47.d: "It was a brisk, cool morning in the republic's capital. Stalina, standing above a crowd of onlookers, prepared to make the first speech of her campaign.\n\n"Brothers and sisters of Russia, our motherland is in danger. Our young republic is surrounded by those who wish to destroy it, just as it was ten years before. We cannot make the same mistakes! We must all be stronger. The failure that led to the destruction of the revolutionary front by Germany must not end our republic as well. And to the east are even greater threats. Rival governments that claim they are the true government of Russia. Warlords who wish to conquer and pillage our homes and destroy our democracy. We must defend our families, our Russia!"\n\nThe crowd seemed to be growing larger now, so Stalina began to speak louder. "A PSD victory means a Russia that can defend itself from aggression, and a Russia that can take the upper hand. If we want to defeat those who threaten us, we must strike first. Russia needs a large to defend herself. If we appear weak, our enemies will strike us down. Vote PSD, and save Russia!""

Russia needs all of your help. Your intelligence, creativity, and determination will decide the future of your country. The Union of Young Reformers is working towards a developed and modern Russia. I promise that together, we can lead Russia into a new age. The SMR will fund your projects, your dreams, and your jobs. You will be the ones transforming Russia, helping its economy, its sciences, and its people. A smart, modern Russia can be built out of nothing. What will you do to help Russia? What will you do to make your dreams come true?"\n\nThe incredible crowd, encompassing most of the university, went wild with excitement. They were Russia's future. Why would the SMR let them down?"

Including the dreams and ideas of a modern, developed Russia, the pamphlet hopes to attract voters who wish for a better life escaping from poverty and living a modern lifestyle. In the pamphlet, the SMR promises to totally transform Russia during its term.\n\nResearch funding is also a major stance taken by the party, hoping new technologies will modernize the country. This has also begun to gain the interest of everyday Russians, intrigued by new technologies that could make their lives easier.\n\nThe Union of Young Reformers also includes ideas from other parties, including social equality and workers benefits. The SMR hopes to create a full market economy and bring prosperity to all Russians. Connections can be easily made to the American system.

DSNP, SMR, PSD 세 당만이 국회에서 진정한 민주주의 정당이었다. 그들의 정책은 그 이상 다를 수가 없었지만, 그들은 함께 앉아 있었고 그들 모두는 극단주의의 늑대들이 어둠 속에서 그들의 자리를 탐욕스럽게 바라보고 있는 것을 혐오했다.\n\nSMR과 PSD 의석 사이의 경계에는 두 명의 국회의원이 앉아, 원내에 새로 상정되는 법안들을 평소보다 조금 더 경계하는 모습을 보였다. SMR에서 키가 크지만 얌전해 보이는, 보이는 것 보다 나이들었을 한 여성이 있었다. PSD에서 나온 다부지고 자신 넘치는 건장한 청년이 그녀 옆에 앉았다. 그들은 둘 다 토론이 일어나는 것에 대해 비슷한 생각을 하며 용납할 수 없는 것이 있지는 않은지 열심히 듣고있었다. 그들이 극단주의자들을 증오했던 만큼, 그들은 공화국을 사랑했고, 공화국의 민주주의를 사랑했다.\n\n열성당의 한 회원이 의회를 반쯤 방해하는 동요되고 떠들썩한 고함을 지른 후, 두 사람은 서로를 주시했다.

But not Elena. Despite her being rather furious, she stood her ground with very few other SMR members, those who would hopefully make their voices heard.\n\n"That disgusting, apathetic, traitorous pig! Is Voznesensky abandoning the party that won the last election with him for those dirtbag marxist-leninist zealots?"\n\nYegveny sighed, understanding her concern. "I get that, I really do. I'm sure he would've done the same to us if we were in the SMR's place, but our caucus has bigger things to focus on right now. Almost the entire SMR delegation walking out shows the others that we do not stand in solidarity with each other, and it makes us look weak."\n\nElena, now looking physically furious, began to full-on debate Yevgeny. "How could you even support anything that conniving despot says? He would throw the entire caucus under the bus to drink champagne with his party and celebrate victory while working with the very forces which want to destroy us! Let me guess, your "Woman of Steel" said it wasn't a big deal. That she would work with whatever the DSNP wants to keep her own party in the majority. We're supposed to stay true to our democratic principles!"\n\nThe rest of the Assembly looked on in intrigue, and Elena soon became part of the procession who left the building. Yevgeny sat there, somewhat upset and embarrassed, but silently believed that she would come to her senses. She, and the rest of the SMR, had to. For if they didn't, our democracy would die."

Reconciliations between parties and a strategy for election day were planned to happen tomorrow. Among other initiatives to strengthen the power of the Center came Elena and Yevgeny, as they were a few months ago, analyzing key issues together. Combined in one of the Assembly building's offices, they gathered other like-minded members of the Center and gathered all evidence, notes, and observations they have about the political situation in Komi.\n\n"The left is divided between "reformist" and "orthodox" lines, with yet another division in their orthodox caucus." Elena presented.\n\n"Furthermore, the right is extremely ideologically fragmented as well. Fascists, Eurasianists, Shafarevichites, and Monarchists do not mix well." Yevgeny added. "We're convinced that the Center has the greatest chance for unity and the greatest chance to appeal to the common voter, despite the obstacles we may face."\n\n"Like what? What's an obstacle which could possibly be holding us back?" Elena eyed Yevgeny, and the two nodded at each other. They were ready for this. They've seen and known it since day one.

He did not want to remember the documents he burned in his house today with the very same matches he used to light his cigarette. "Member of the Passionariyy Society. Not anymore, but God forbid they found out. They'd sweep the entire PSD under the rug as despots and fascist sympathizers in disguise." Yegveny thought to himself deeply, looking at the stars forming in the night sky.\n\n"Hey, Yevgeny!" He panicked, dropping his cigarette and matchbox into the street below, and turning around to see Elena. "I came here to drop off some papers to you. You don't look so well though. Should I come back later, or..?"\n\nThe two of them talked for what seemed like hours, despite being only a few short minutes. "Elena, I have to come clean. I was a card-carrying member of them once. The Passionariyy. To think I only spent some years off the street beating our political opponents... I don't want to be reminded of it, and I'm terrified of what they'd do to me if they found out."\n\nElena sighed, and sat down on his desk, with her arm extended to move his face to look at her. "Yevgeny, it's okay. I don't care what you did back then. You're a good person now, and you're going to help us put a nail in their coffin for good. I know it."\n\nHe smiled, exhaled camly, and thanked her. He was safe, despite his past, and so was his beloved Republic."

komi_friendship.8.d: "After much debate in another closed meeting of the Assembly, many agreed that Stalina was the best shot at curbing radical leftist influence. A stalwart anti-extremist, more so than any other democratic leader at the moment, the government passed a motion of support in favor of her to enact some of her plans in order to protect the Center from the Left. While the entirety of the PSD is overjoyed right now, the largest majority of NO votes came from the SMR. Elena was the only member of the SMR who abstained, and wasn't too excited about the following resolution.\n\n"Hey, Elena. The vote's got you down, no?" Yegveny was standing over her seat, coming over from the delegation of PSD members.\n\n"I don't want to talk about it right now. I never thought we would get behind her policies like that, even if it's for the good of the Republic..."\n\nYevgeny sat down beside her, and much like how she confided in him, he began to confide in her. "I would've done the exact same you were doing right now if Kosygin was Stalina. I know you're reluctant to vote for someone you disagree with. She may be the Woman of Steel, and she may not be the most liberal, but we have to remember that we're in this together. You won't be a deviant for bending your values a bit, especially if it's only for now. The PSD and DSNP will all go together to the polls, and we don't want the SMR to have doubts. Especially not me."\n\nWith a sigh, she nodded. "I'll consider supporting her agenda in the future. I suppose I owe you for this one, friend.""

Are you really willing to put your own partisan politics over the sanctity of our democratic process and protection of it from subverters?" In a heated assembly meeting, many members of the PSD, including a very vocal Yegveny, are furious about the recent direction the government has taken. To them, Stalina was a woman of steel, with a plan of iron and a will of titanium. Now, she and her party were embarrassed and sidelined. Voznesensky's harsh dismissal of her plan has caused more harm than good, it seems.\n\nThe PSD is fracturing the democratic Center. While all members of the PSD seemed to agree with Yevgeny's talking points, other democratic members of the assembly simply watched in shock. Jeers from the right and left energized their own platforms; further lowering the morale of the Center. When all hope seemed to be lost, a single voice was raised in the assembly.\n\n"Yevgeny, you promised to help us... what are you going to do now? We said we would defend democracy together!" Elena, almost on the verge of a breakdown, stood up valiantly and finally had the courage to confront her friendly rival on the Assembly floor.\n\nAfter silence and a sigh, he finally spoke. "I'm going to accept the results of the election, regardless. I have no faith in a system that sidelines their own allies for meaningless favors." With his statement, the Center remained quiet. The roar of celebration from the other sides, however..."

Even with the intensity of Komi's political situation ramping up, both of the assembly members remained calm and collected. There would be a future for the people of Komi which wasn't one which would bend too far to either side.\n\n"So..." She began. "How does it feel to be headed into this election as one, partner?"\n\nYevgeny looked to his side, eyeing the smiling Elena next to him. "Partner? I'm more partial to the use of colleague, but go off, I suppose."\n\nThe two share a brief laugh, before continuing to walk to their homes. "Not everyone will be happy when it comes time to cast our ballots, that's for sure. But, at the same time, I'm okay with it. And hopefully you are too." Elena nodded.\n\n"You know, I never understood Stalina's fascination with paternalism. Could you explain it again?" Once again, the two of them were locked in a fierce, but friendly debate, one that would continue until they reached their homes. Regardless, when they parted ways, they were both accepting of the overall motions that the political system was going through. As uncoordinated and bickering as the Center may be, they shall hold fast once again."

Elena and Yevgeny both gave two short speeches in support of their candidates, hoping to garner up some last minute support for both.\n\n"...I know Alexei personally. Deputy Kosygin would be a safe, sane choice for a healthy democratic Komi, and perhaps with time, Russia as a whole. In a region and world so corrupted by undemocratic tyrants, the policies of Deputy Kosygin would be the light shining against the darkness."\n\n"...I speak for many of us when I say that Stalina is a bulwark. She will protect your rights, your freedoms, and this country from radicals. No other candidate is as crucial to ensuring a safe and just democratic process as she is. I promise she will never let you, nor the people of Komi, down!"\n\nBoth finished their speeches to respective cheers and boos.

He thought of him as a misguided idealogue.\n\n"Now what?" Elena sighed, rubbing her temples and closing her eyes. "Neither of us want to stand up for that racist bastard, but do we have another choice?"\n\n"I didn't come this far over a year to quit now. You don't care about how we got here, and neither do I. But this is the hand we've been dealt. There's too much at stake to not play it."\n\n"I... Suppose you're right. It's just disappointing to have it come down to this."\n\nThe two walked briskly in silence. Yevgeny's hands were sternly clasped in his pockets, gripping an anger that wasn't entirely there.

Although he had pledged to defend democracy, was this really who he had to fight for? Was there no true other choice?\n\n"I know you're disappointed, Yevgeny. I can only imagine what you feel." Elena tried to console her colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on him. Much like the Woman of Steel herself, Yegveny was seemingly dead-set on his iron-willed ideals.\n\nThat is, until he stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep inhale, he released the tension in his body, and turned to face Elena. "It's no big deal. I know we were upset during the nomination, but I want to talk to some of them. Tell them that there's still hope. We may not be the happiest, but we're willing to hold on much the same. Even with Kosygin."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, he crosses the busy street.

Yevgeny tried to console his colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on her. Idealistic to the end, much like Kosygin himself. She was seemingly unmoving and uncompromising in her direction.\n\nThat is, until she stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep exhale, she released the tension in her body, and turned to face Yevgeny. "No matter, I suppose. Many in our delegation are... very clearly disappointed, but there's nothing they won't do to bring freedoms to the people of Komi. Including supporting Stalina."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, she crosses the busy street. Yevgeny, with a large grin appearing on his face, laughs happily to himself. Democracy is unbreakable, it seems."

For all of their hard work, the last thing they wanted to do before it all went down was head for a drink.\n\n"Ready?"\n\n"Ready. Za zdorovye!" With the clink of two glasses, both assembly members take the first few sips of their drinks. Yevgeny coughs a bit, but with a cheerful expression. Elena simply sits calmly and downs her liquor, the bitterness trapping her tongue. Vodka, above all else, was more than just cheap entertainment and a staple of the Anarchic diet. It was a truth-sealer. "I didn't think we'd get this far without being shot, honestly."\n\n"Oh, nonsense! If you keep thinking like that, Elena, I'd be surprised if you don't drop dead from this vodka." Holding in their laughter, the two finally break and chuckle childishly. Perhaps in the past year, they would never expose this laid-back attitude to one another. Political enemies. PSD dog. SMR freeloader. All of that distrust and hatred disappeared with a few sips.\n\nAfter sitting silently for a while and drinking a bit more, Yevgeny pushes his drink to the side and faces his friend. "Hey, Elena?

The thought that this was a time for celebration was an understatement, Komi is essentially able to breathe once again.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sit on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side.

Violence by extremists was reported six hours ago. Two hours ago, the first Zhdanov cocktail had been thrown. Now, the city streets of Syktyvkar became an all-out warzone, with different factions determined to wrestle control over the facilities of government. It seems that the worst case scenario has become reality; and now it was a time of survival.\n\nElena and Yevgeny were shocked, initially. How could all of their efforts have failed? Was the Center not united enough? Perhaps the extremists gained too much strength? Whatever the case was, both of them have been drafted to serve under an emergency government under [KOM.GetLeader]. Their goal was no longer to save democracy, but save Komi entirely from the ever-encroaching threat of radical takeover.\n\n"Yevgeny." Elena said, shakily gripping her hastily-issued pistol in its holster. "Is this a bad dream?"\n\nHis expression did not give her any condolences. Perhaps, behind his usual carefree and steely demeanor, he was terrified too. "The only way to wake up is to work together now. This time, for real. I know we can do it."\n\nPlacing a comforting hand on her shoulder, the two pass by some soldiers and walk into an emergency command room, ready to take action once more."

Elena and Yevgeny breathed heavily, as other people were forced to sit around them. The crackle of flames were present around them. What exactly happened? Their heads hurt, their hands were weary, and they felt that something was incredibly, incredibly amiss.\n\nWith a motion of one of the commissars, all of the bags were removed. Elena and Yevgeny looked around them, seeing fellow members of the Center, tied up with them as prisoners. Communist partisans and soldiers were armed, rounding up members of the democratic opposition. "Listen closely! Everyone here is considered a traitor to the Komi Provisional Soviet. You will now be tried against a People's Commissariat for crimes against our glorious revolution. How do you plead?"\n\n"Not Guilty!" Elena and Yevgeny shouted in unison. Deep down, they held onto some youthful hope that they had a chance. However, as the trial went on, as the commissars spoke, and as several assemblymen were taken away around them, it became clear that this was a show trial. This was the end. Meaningless words, piercing their defenses like tank shells, rallying the super-partisan council of judges assembled against them. They would certainly meet their deaths. However the communists decided to do it, however, was what occupied their minds.\n\n"What are you going to do to us? We did nothing wro--"\n\n"GUILTY! Let them hang alongside their collaborationist brethren."\n\nDespite their cries, despite their physical resistance, this was the end. Elena and Yevgeny, with the strike of a gavel, now had their necks wrought around a noose. They had failed. Despite all of their promises, their work would be for naught with the simple collapse of a platform. Tears escaped Yevgeny's eyes. Elena remained silent. Both of them composed themselves, with a final exhale, before their lives were taken from them as swiftly as the floor below them dropped."

Their last, desperate attempt at freedom has gone awry. Rightist paramilitary groups were winning against the final garrison defending the would-be refugees. The hallways were filled with gunfire, screams, the crackling of wood. All that they loved, all that they fought for, was finally being eviscerated in front of their very eyes. Good men died to prevent this. Worse men fought to reduce it to ash.\n\nYevgeny coughed heavily, a stray bullet still lodged in his lung. The clenched hand grasping at his gunshot wound was becoming weaker by the second. He didn't believe that he would die here. Not in some run-down records room, slumped over against a table with one of his former enemies at his side. The pistol on the ground was empty, much like the air in his body. Perhaps, if there were still some bullets left, they could fight. One last, desperate clawing attempt for liberation. Perhaps they could end their life. Surely, whatever the fascists did to them would be worse than death.\n\n"We promised... And we failed."\n\nAs Yevgeny became closer to death, the door to the record room was slammed open with a kick. A member of the fascist paramilitary, with the raise of his PPSh, filled the duo with bullets and added to brass piles on the floor. After a quick look around the room, he looks down at the victims. Whoever they were then didn't matter now; Russia would move on without them. With that concluding thought, the soldier exits the room and ducks his head low to avoid the smoke around him."

No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the efforts of the PSD's reconstruction government have triumphed over all opposing forces. Stability would no longer be a word foreign to any citizen of Komi.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sat on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side.

As the two began to walk home, Elena turned back to Yevgeny, but his eyes stayed the course forward. Despite their victory, she felt like something was lost.

Half the people around him looked like they were afraid to do anything at all around him for fear of some reprisal, like he was a Tsar who could have them flogged at a moment's notice. What was there to be done about it, though? He remembered how they'd treated Lenin and Bukharin, and if he was going to restore Soviet order to Russia, they'd treat him like that as well.\n\nBut they liked Bukharin! The golden child, they called him, with his boyish face, his affable smile, and his charming manner. Sure, people feared Bukharin's name, but when they faced the man himself they were laughing and joking with the General Secretary. He had his disagreements with his erstwhile comrade and boss, but Nikolai had been good at one thing; making people like him. It was how he'd come to power. He'd have to calm those around him.\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] gestured to one of the Party militia officers he'd brought with him. "Hand me that cap, comrade," and he then put it on his head. "Comrade photographer! Do I look more presidential now?" he asked, smiling to the people around him. A few of the Party men dutifully laughed, and the photographer gave a stilted chuckle.

Cabinet meetings were technically not open to the public, and so to host the rest of the party leadership he needed it held away from the normal location. Though there were additional reasons for the secrecy. "This was discovered near an incinerator in the Ministry of Defense," [Get_Left_Sec_Min] began, passing copies of a dossier to the members of the cabinet. "'Case October;' as you can see, details a plan by the Republican Army to launch a military coup against the government in the case of the government falling into our hands. It was drafted by by Grigorenko and Korolkov."\n\n"I assume this was without Voznesensky's approval?" \n\n"Correct, Comrade Furtseva. They considered him an unreliable element."

He didn't fear Suslov, but what was he planning? \n\n[Get_Left_Sec_Min]'s voice brought him back to reality. "Comrade President, I recommend stationing the following units around Syktyvkar," he said, handing a list to the President. "I have vetted them personally, they are loyal to the revolution. We can use our paramilitaries to suppress the traitors." [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] calmed down. Calm, he'd have to be calm. Calm like Bukharin had been.

Comrades, you bewilder me, what assurances do you need?"\n\n"The old Union subordinated workers' associations to the Party before.

A minor infraction when he hadn't paid enough at a cafe once in 1960 was the only real misdeed, and indeed was the one listed as the reason for his discharge, but Grigorenko had noted Bezmonov before, for his refusal to allow KPK propaganda leaflets to be distributed in his unit. The discharge order had been signed by the President himself. The fifth one this week.\n\nGrigorenko tossed the discharge order aside. Did [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] know? They'd incinerated all the October files. Or had they? There had always been Communist infiltrators, had a copy been leaked? No, it couldn't have been.\n\nDamn the October files, though.

"I was here to deliver the good news." He pulled out three letters and handed each of them to their intended recipients.

"We can deal with them easily.

"As you are doubtlessly aware, our former comrade, Serov, has joined the Passionariyy in his naked revisionism and powerlust. He is intimately aware of our security procedures, our structure, and our weaknesses. Most importantly, his Ordosocialist paramilitaries are extremely dangerous. All ex-Red Army or ex-NKVD. They're not Gumilyov's lambs, they have no compunction with killing, and Serov has no compunction with having them do so."\n\nThe cabinet thought the matter over, before a voice in the shadows whispered quietly. "Comrades. Everyone here is aware that whoever the people hate the Germans the most. They have taken everything from us, and everyone on the street knows at least someone who died to German bombs or bullets. And what is Serov if not a fascist?" Mikhail Suslov leaned into the light.

Provided, of course, that you commit to keeping within the legal strictures of Republican norms and laws."\n\n"Pah! You're one to talk about 'the legal strictures.' Just last month, KPK paramilitaries were shooting at me as I walked to the cafe!"\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] sighed. "The violence of the past and of my party are both regrettable, and must be averted from here on out. But we have moved on; the Party has realized the errors of paramilitary violence, and now seeks to function legitimately." He couldn't help but notice the nodding of the DSNP delegates next to Rodionov. Each had been blackmailed by Suslov's intelligence apparatus beforehand. [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] would have to find out what else Suslov knew eventually, but for now he was only grateful.\n\nRodionov, considering the mood of his compatriots, mused on the potential deal in front of him. "We can agree to ban the Passionariyy, in exchange for certain concessions. First, the disestablishment of the KPK's paramilitary. Second, a commitment to abide by Republican principles, including multiparty democracy. Third, an official condemnation of past terrorist actions by the KPK in public."\n\n"Done," [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] smiled, then shook Rodionov's hand.

Once [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] was in power, it wasn't difficult to guess where it was going. Gumilyov didn't listen, Serov seemed more excited for a fight than anything. Of all the people in the Passionariyy, he hadn't expected Taboritsky to be the one to nod silently when he had brought up his predictions. He'd been prepared for some time. Whatever happened to the rest was no matter; he had to get going while the going was good, and that window was closing.\n\nThe truck pulled up in the lot he had planned out. It stopped, and the driver stepped out. "You need help with that luggage?"\n\n"Sure, please." The driver helped load suitcase after suitcase into the back, then got back into the truck. Shaferevich, holding a book, a piece of scratch paper, and a pencil got into the passenger seat. With that, they drove off into the Syktyvkar night.\n\n"So what's your story?" the driver asked.\n\nShaferevich paused, nervously, then answered as truthfully as he could. "I'm a mathematics professor. I taught courses at the local university until relatively recently."\n\n"Ah, that sounds like a good gig. Why'd you leave?"\n\n"My employment was, uh... terminated, recently. Have to find a new job."\n\n"What happened?"\n\n"Disagreement with the boss." The driver nodded, and Shaferevich thought it over. He'd acquired forged documents that could get him through WRRF territory, from there into Onega, and then on to Helsinki. It could be worse, he told himself. They might need professors in Helsinki. Come to think of it, he'd heard that the streets there needed an improvement. He took out the paper and pencil, thinking of a new way to organize the flow of urban traffic.

He grunted, then had the two soldiers accompanying him kick down the door.\n\nThe office, full of shelves and books, was dark and devoid of people save one man. He stood in front of an open window, holding a rope tied to his heavy desk, then looked at the door. His eyes filled with fear as he saw the soldiers, then he tried to climb through the window. Popov grabbed his legs as he tried to escape and dragged him back inside the office. Gumilyov squirmed on the ground as Popov slapped handcuffs on him, then pulled him to his feet and forced him through the door.\n\nOutside, he threw Gumilyov into the same truck as a bulky, raging figure in an old uniform then shut the door.

Shackles bound their hands and feet, clinking with every bump in the road. Serov sat with his back straight, feet planted firmly on the floor. As a former member of the NKVD, he had no illusions about what was at the end of their road and he embraced it. Gumilyov, bent over in his seat, felt sick. Not only from the certainty he was about to die, but from the jostling and jumping of the truck along the pot-holed road. He had once said that you couldn't kill an idea, but now that he was facing his almost certain death, he supposed that a bullet in the head might kill any ideas he could have.\n\nThe truck squealed to a halt, and the KPK thugs in the back of the truck with the two Pasionaryy bosses hauled them to their feet. The bags were torn from their faces, and Gumilyov blinked and swore as the light hit his retinas. It was, he supposed, a nice day. Birds chirped, leaves crunched under his feet. At least he would die in his beloved Eurasia. Serov was an impassive giant, who knew what was going on in that contradictory mind of his.\n\n"End of the line, fascists," said a guard holding a submachine gun, "any last words?"\n\nGumilyov shrugged, why not? "Eura-" The guard pumped bullets into the Eurasianist, light glinting through the holes punched into him. Gumilyov's shredded body fell to the ground without a sound.

We must equip the people of Komi, and we must go to war. If the rest of Russia will not embrace the revolution, it must be spread by force. The reactionaries cling to a doomed cause, and we shall prove this to them through the strengths of our bonds, and the strength of our arms."
 komi_KPK.13.a: "Onwards!"
