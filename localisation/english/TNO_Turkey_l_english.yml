 POLITICS_ISMET_INONU_DESC:0 "If Mustafa Kemal was the father of the Turks, then Ismet Inönü is their Godfather. What could suffice, to describe the life of the man whose very whims have defined the policies of nations, armies, and empires?\n\nBorn to a Kurdish father in Smyrna in the year 1884, and faced with the weight of an empire collapsing all around him, Inönü served the Ottoman army with distinction in Yemen, in Rumelia, and under Mustafa Kemal himself in the war of liberation against the old empires of Europe. Ismet was a man truly committed to seeing the Turkish nation rise restored from the ashes of the caliphate, and quickly rose through the ranks of the new revolutionary guard until he was no less than Ataturk's own right hand.\n\nTensions had always existed between Kemal's strident pragmatism and Ismet's uncompromising will, and burst into sparks on numerous occasions in the past. Today, with the days of the Ghazi confined merely to memory, many claim that the old Vizier has overstepped his limits. That he had sold the nation to her enemies, that he had turned it against the very principles it was founded on. But those claims were nothing; Nothing save for insults to the very legacy of Ataturk.\n\nIn his long tenure as President of the Turkish republic, Ismet Inönü has pursued a single aim with a single mind: the survival of the Turkish state that he had helped found from nothing. When the State's interests called for detente with the Fascists, he had followed them. When they demanded the jackboot and the butt of the rifle, he heeded them. Through the great trials of the past three decades, he marched on: Battered and bloodied and slandered - but never beaten.\n\nThe state that stands today is a testament to the man's political ability and above all to his uncompromising will. A great Turkish state: one that will remain great, no matter the cost."
 POLITICS_CEMAL_GURSEL_DESC:0 "A nineteen year old teen lays dead\nUnder the sun in the mornings,\nUnder the stars in the nights.\nOn Beyazıt Square in Istanbul\n\nCemal Gürsel is a tired man. He has been tired for a very long time. The crown of Turkey sits upon a weary and worn brow of man approaching his seventeenth year. For his nation, Cemal would give everything; he has given everything. When asked to serve above and beyond the call of duty for most men he already surpassed that expectation. And yet he is called once more in service of a coup that he does not believe in.\n\nBut the blood is spilled. A boy lays dead with a school book on his hand. On one hand a dream that never started. Cemal understands that democracy in Turkey may never recover. He cannot allow that to happen. Democracy must return. He did not serve his whole life, he did not survive malaria under the British, he did not fight in the furnace of the Independence War to be broken now.\n\nThere is no other path for Cemal except forward. The same choice he had in the desert, against the Italians and Ba'athists. Though he may wish now never to have emerged out of that goddamn desert with the task ahead of him. The only way is forward. For Cemal can trust no other man to resist the temptation to snuff out the flame of freedom forever. Those who have died in this damned coup, those who will continue to die from its aftermath, must have died for something. Cemal will make sure that happens. The only way is forward."
 POLITICS_BEHICE_BORAN_DESC:0 "Behice was born the youngest of three siblings to Kazan Tartar parents in Bursa, 1910. After completing primary schooling she enrolled into the American College for Girls in Istanbul. With adept skills in foreign languages and a scholarship from the University of Michigan, she completed her academic education with a PhD in sociology in 1939. Afterwards she accepted an Associate Professorship at Ankara University teaching foreign language, history and geography.\n\nBoran had an interest during her professorship in writing political papers. Though at times called a Marxist, her writings never garnered the attention or condemnation from İnönü's administration despite leftist leanings in the texts. But when the Second General Inspectors were established in 1956, Boran could no longer remain silent and spoke out rather harshly against the act. For this she was imprisoned for 32 months.\n\nWhen her sentence ended, Boran formed TIP which failed to garner enough votes to challenge CHP in any meaningful way. It did, however, lead to an alliance with Türkân Akyol and the formation of DYP. Boran does not believe that there can be a worker's revolution in Turkey but instead she advocates for trade unions being the vehicle to shift Turkish politics further to the left."
 POLITICS_CELAL_BAYAR_DESC:0 "Mahmud Celâleddin Bayar was born in the coastal province of Bursa, to a family of Bulgarian Turkish migrants. Immediately bright, the young Bayar enjoyed a promising career in banking after finishing his education. The political turmoil borne out of the first world war soon drew him and many other like-minded men towards the political world; Bayar served as a representative in the Ottoman parliament before finally joining Mustafa Kemal pasha's revolutionary circles as an attorney and civil adviser.\n\nGrowing into a talented and respected politician during the days of Atatürk's Kemalist revolution, Bayar emerged as the pre-eminent advocate for a more flexible and capitalistic policy of Etatism. Indeed, many of the Republic's early success can be attributed to Bayar's programs. This did not earn him the love of the decidedly interventionist İnönü, and the two of them oft competed for the position of Prime Minister under Atatürk's presidency, before he was eventually expelled from the CHP alongside three of his allies in the later years of İnönü's tenure for daring to criticize the CHP's blatant neglect. Bayar was encouraged to found his own party instead, leading to the birth of the  first Ulusal Demokrat Parti. This was a move that proved immensely successful: For he now stands proud as the third President of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nPromising the people democratic reform and a liberalized and rejuvenated economy after decades of stagnation under İnönü's CHP, Bayar's party has nonetheless been accused of populist leanings, and even of steering away from the principles of Kemalism. - a case strengthened by Prime Minister Menderes's notorious rabble-rousing rhetoric, and the fact the DP itself had only won the election leading a coalition of Right wing groups with dubious Kemalist credentials, and well-known ties to the wolves.\n\nBayar himself has steered clear of such accusations intending to provide a firm hand that will lead the Republic to her rightful place as a modern and prosperous Turkish state."
 
 POLITICS_AHMAD_BARZANI_DESC:0 "Is compromising your ideals the only way for the Kurdish people to reach for an once thought impossible dream of self-determination? It seems like it is.\n\nSheikh Ahmad Barzani once lost it all at a young age: his tribe having launched an insurrection against the Ottoman authorities in his infancy, he was not even an adult when his father, grandfather and a brother were executed for their defiance of the Sublime Porte's yoke. It wasn't until the 1930's, after a short exile in Turkey, that Ahmad himself led the various Kurdish tribes against the Iraqi government and their British puppet masters alongside his younger brother Mustafa.\n\nOne would've thought his war was a hopeless cause. But as the British Mandate of Iraq fell before the might of the Axis soldiers, Barzani swiftly took control of his homeland by fighting for the Turkish forces and taking advantage of his liaisons within the Turkish political scene. The Sheikh now sits on top of a throne made out of the bones of Kurdish freedom warriors, listening to a sweet tune coming from Ankara which tells him what to dance to..."
 POLITICS_SNS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Syrian National State was born from abandonment.\n\nPromised independence in exchange for supporting the Germans, Syrians watched in horror as Turkish soldiers marched to Al Azm Palace with no German help in sight. In the birthplace of the revolt against France, the Syrian National State under Turkey was formed - birthing NASIL, the resistance to the Syrian State.\n\nThe SNS played a critical role in the Iraqi War in 1952, as the Turkish armies were stalled in Iraq, until Tayfur Sökmen, a Syrian official, developed a plan to invade Iraq from Syria, which was enough to win the war. Sökmen was assassinated afterwards by NASIL, leading the SNS to violently crack down on all dissent and anti-Turkish sentiment through political persecution, military force, and even public executions.\n\nToday, the SNS is led by a council led by Husni al Za'im, Adib Shishakli, Fawzi Selu, and Sami al Hinnawi, each of whom have their own ambitions for Syria. Yet there are whispers of the NASIL remnants stirring once more - whispers which threaten to bring down the unstable foundations of the Syrian National State."

 TUR_economic_stagnation_desc:0 "Failed German projects in the Mediterranean and along the Euphrates have seriously damaged our economy after a period of prosperity. To complicate the recovery, German and Italian companies are less and less willing to invest in Turkey, the former due to its ever-worsening political and economic situation, the latter due to our precarious alliance: reforms are needed, and quickly, or the Turkish economy might fall even harder should a crisis arise.."
 TUR_italo_turkish_tension:0 "Italo-Turkish Tension"
 TUR_italo_turkish_tension_desc:0 "The Triumvirate is on its deathbed, and the "loving" relatives are mostly cheering for the agony to end. With relationships between Turkey and its former Italian ally at an all-times low, several nationalist politicians have resurrected the old Turkish claims to the Levant, Cyprus, Rhodes and Thessaly, in the hope of bolstering national morale - and their own popularity.\n\nDespite this nationalistic revival, there are many who express worry, or outright fear, for the potential consequences of such claims. Italy is - after all - the most powerful country in the Mediterranean, and despite its overstretched forces, there is no guarantee that they won't find the strength to fight..."
 TUR_inspectorate_generals:0 "Legacy of The Fifth and Sixth Inspectorate Generals"
 TUR_inspectorate_generals_desc:0 "The Fifth and Sixth Inspectorates were government commissions tasked with extending Turkification policies to the lands acquired after the war, mainly the new provinces in the Caucasus and the Levant. Despite their efforts, they only managed to create more problems than they were actually able to solve: the Fifth Inspectorate simply deported Armenians and Kurds from the Caucasus to the Levant, while the Sixth was only able of replacing a colonial administration with a Turkish one, leaving rural areas de facto abandoned to themselves.\n\nNow, unrest is rising across all newly-acquired provinces. Despite harsher and harsher methods - which are slowly turning even peaceful locals against the government - dissent and separatism are constantly growing, and the military police is unable to keep them under control: reforms are needed for something to change, and even then, it is not clear whether the change will be for good, or for worse..."

 TUR_Fahri_Koruturk_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LBorn in 1903, Admiral Korutürk's career has borne witness to several eras of the Turkish Republic. The Istanbulite earned his spurs in the unstable world of the thirties, taking part in numerous missions and naval attachés across old Europe and quickly becoming fluent in the language of diplomacy. The Atlantropa 'project' sealed all chances of any career in the Navy. Instead, he earned prominent postings as an ambassador to Turkey's allied states.\nA veteran of the Triumvirate's paradoxical procedures and present ever since its founding under Inonu and Mussolini, Korutürk's appointment as Prime Minister has reoriented Turkey's vision outwards, towards its dubious allies.§!"

 TUR_Cemal_Gursel_sec_desc:0 "------------\n§LBorn in Erzurum in 1895, Cemal Gürsel's career in the Turkish military is perhaps the only one that can rival the President's own. Serving With distinction in the Ottoman army during the First World War, Gürsel was captured by the British in 1917 and learned French if only to spite his captors, before returning as a seasoned commander to lead new Republic's militias in the Turkish War of Independence and the Turkish Armed Forces to victory in the Second World War. A capable and popular member of the President's cabinet, the old General is adored by the public and the military in equal parts.\n\nSo far, he has used this influence to disseminate one message:\nA strong and professional military, dedicated to serving the Turkish state - and the Turkish people.§!"
 TUR_Ferit_Melen_eco:0 "Ferit Melen"
 TUR_Ferit_Melen_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LA member of the generation that was raised in the midst of Ataturk's glorious revolution, it is no surprise that the minister of the economy is one of the loudest voices calling for adherence to Kemalist principles. Born in 1906 and graduating from the University of Ankara in 1931, Ferit Melen is a staunch proponent of state intervention in the economy, one of the 'six arrows' of Kemalist ideology. A nationalist and life-long civil servant, he was instrumental in shaping the modern Turkish economy; This has made the Minister of the Economy a polarizing figure to say the least, with criticism from both the left and the right:\n criticism which has only strengthened his faith in the thought of Mustafa Kemal, and tempered his nationalism into a dogmatic orthodoxy.§!"
 TUR_Feridun_Cemal_for:0 "Feridun Cemal"
 TUR_Feridun_Cemal_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LFeridun Cemal Erkin is a familiar face in the President's cabinet. Long-time ambassador, reliable diplomat, and well-known influence in the Foreign Ministry. Feridun has always urged a degree of caution when it came to tampering with Turkey's international position, warranted after a grueling experience as part of the Republic's embassy to Germania. A calm and rational voice in a cabinet of ardent nationalists, the foreign minister's advice might as well be foreign, for how little it's taken.\nNonetheless, the man has served the republic with dignity and was an invaluable asset in turning the country away from the Reich and towards the Mediterranean, while preventing a war anticipated by all.§!"
