 POLITICS_ISMET_INONU_DESC:0 "If Mustafa Kemal was the father of the Turks, then Ismet Inönü is their Godfather. What could suffice, to describe the life of the man whose very whims have defined the policies of nations, armies, and empires?\n\nBorn to a Kurdish father in Smyrna in the year 1884, and faced with the weight of an empire collapsing all around him, Inönü served the Ottoman army with distinction in Yemen, in Rumelia, and under Mustafa Kemal himself in the war of liberation against the old empires of Europe. Ismet was a man truly committed to seeing the Turkish nation rise restored from the ashes of the caliphate, and quickly rose through the ranks of the new revolutionary guard until he was no less than Ataturk's own right hand.\n\nTensions had always existed between Kemal's strident pragmatism and Ismet's uncompromising will, and burst into sparks on numerous occasions in the past. Today, with the days of the Ghazi confined merely to memory, many claim that the old Vizier has overstepped his limits. That he had sold the nation to her enemies, that he had turned it against the very principles it was founded on. But those claims were nothing; Nothing save for insults to the very legacy of Ataturk.\n\nIn his long tenure as President of the Turkish republic, Ismet Inönü has pursued a single aim with a single mind: the survival of the Turkish state that he had helped found from nothing. When the State's interests called for detente with the Fascists, he had followed them. When they demanded the jackboot and the butt of the rifle, he heeded them. Through the great trials of the past three decades, he marched on: Battered and bloodied and slandered - but never beaten.\n\nThe state that stands today is a testament to the man's political ability and above all to his uncompromising will. A great Turkish state: one that will remain great, no matter the cost."
 POLITICS_CEMAL_GURSEL_DESC:0 "A nineteen year old teen lays dead\nUnder the sun in the mornings,\nUnder the stars in the nights.\nOn Beyazıt Square in Istanbul\n\nCemal Gürsel is a tired man. He has been tired for a very long time. The crown of Turkey sits upon a weary and worn brow of man approaching his seventeenth year. For his nation, Cemal would give everything; he has given everything. When asked to serve above and beyond the call of duty for most men he already surpassed that expectation. And yet he is called once more in service of a coup that he does not believe in.\n\nBut the blood is spilled. A boy lays dead with a school book on his hand. On one hand a dream that never started. Cemal understands that democracy in Turkey may never recover. He cannot allow that to happen. Democracy must return. He did not serve his whole life, he did not survive malaria under the British, he did not fight in the furnace of the Independence War to be broken now.\n\nThere is no other path for Cemal except forward. The same choice he had in the desert, against the Italians and Ba'athists. Though he may wish now never to have emerged out of that goddamn desert with the task ahead of him. The only way is forward. For Cemal can trust no other man to resist the temptation to snuff out the flame of freedom forever. Those who have died in this damned coup, those who will continue to die from its aftermath, must have died for something. Cemal will make sure that happens. The only way is forward."
 POLITICS_BEHICE_BORAN_DESC:0 "Behice was born the youngest of three siblings to Kazan Tartar parents in Bursa, 1910. After completing primary schooling she enrolled into the American College for Girls in Istanbul. With adept skills in foreign languages and a scholarship from the University of Michigan, she completed her academic education with a PhD in sociology in 1939. Afterwards she accepted an Associate Professorship at Ankara University teaching foreign language, history and geography.\n\nBoran had an interest during her professorship in writing political papers. Though at times called a Marxist, her writings never garnered the attention or condemnation from İnönü's administration despite leftist leanings in the texts. But when the Second General Inspectors were established in 1956, Boran could no longer remain silent and spoke out rather harshly against the act. For this she was imprisoned for 32 months.\n\nWhen her sentence ended, Boran formed TIP which failed to garner enough votes to challenge CHP in any meaningful way. It did, however, lead to an alliance with Türkân Akyol and the formation of DYP. Boran does not believe that there can be a worker's revolution in Turkey but instead she advocates for trade unions being the vehicle to shift Turkish politics further to the left."
 POLITICS_CELAL_BAYAR_DESC:0 "Mahmud Celâleddin Bayar was born in the coastal province of Bursa, to a family of Bulgarian Turkish migrants. Immediately bright, the young Bayar enjoyed a promising career in banking after finishing his education. The political turmoil borne out of the first world war soon drew him and many other like-minded men towards the political world; Bayar served as a representative in the Ottoman parliament before finally joining Mustafa Kemal pasha's revolutionary circles as an attorney and civil adviser.\n\nGrowing into a talented and respected politician during the days of Atatürk's Kemalist revolution, Bayar emerged as the pre-eminent advocate for a more flexible and capitalistic policy of Etatism. Indeed, many of the Republic's early success can be attributed to Bayar's programs. This did not earn him the love of the decidedly interventionist İnönü, and the two of them oft competed for the position of Prime Minister under Atatürk's presidency, before he was eventually expelled from the CHP alongside three of his allies in the later years of İnönü's tenure for daring to criticize the CHP's blatant neglect. Bayar was encouraged to found his own party instead, leading to the birth of the  first Ulusal Demokrat Parti. This was a move that proved immensely successful: For he now stands proud as the third President of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nPromising the people democratic reform and a liberalized and rejuvenated economy after decades of stagnation under İnönü's CHP, Bayar's party has nonetheless been accused of populist leanings, and even of steering away from the principles of Kemalism. - a case strengthened by Prime Minister Menderes's notorious rabble-rousing rhetoric, and the fact the DP itself had only won the election leading a coalition of Right wing groups with dubious Kemalist credentials, and well-known ties to the wolves.\n\nBayar himself has steered clear of such accusations intending to provide a firm hand that will lead the Republic to her rightful place as a modern and prosperous Turkish state."
 POLITICS_AHMAD_BARZANI_DESC:0 "Is compromising your ideals the only way for the Kurdish people to reach for an once thought impossible dream of self-determination? It seems like it is.\n\nSheikh Ahmad Barzani once lost it all at a young age: his tribe having launched an insurrection against the Ottoman authorities in his infancy, he was not even an adult when his father, grandfather and a brother were executed for their defiance of the Sublime Porte's yoke. It wasn't until the 1930's, after a short exile in Turkey, that Ahmad himself led the various Kurdish tribes against the Iraqi government and their British puppet masters alongside his younger brother Mustafa.\n\nOne would've thought his war was a hopeless cause. But as the British Mandate of Iraq fell before the might of the Axis soldiers, Barzani swiftly took control of his homeland by fighting for the Turkish forces and taking advantage of his liaisons within the Turkish political scene. The Sheikh now sits on top of a throne made out of the bones of Kurdish freedom warriors, listening to a sweet tune coming from Ankara which tells him what to dance to..."

With relationships between Turkey and its former Italian ally at an all-times low, several nationalist politicians have resurrected the old Turkish claims to the Levant, Cyprus, Rhodes and Thessaly, in the hope of bolstering national morale - and their own popularity.\n\nDespite this nationalistic revival, there are many who express worry, or outright fear, for the potential consequences of such claims.

Despite their efforts, they only managed to create more problems than they were actually able to solve: the Fifth Inspectorate simply deported Armenians and Kurds from the Caucasus to the Levant, while the Sixth was only able of replacing a colonial administration with a Turkish one, leaving rural areas de facto abandoned to themselves.\n\nNow, unrest is rising across all newly-acquired provinces. Despite harsher and harsher methods - which are slowly turning even peaceful locals against the government - dissent and separatism are constantly growing, and the military police is unable to keep them under control: reforms are needed for something to change, and even then, it is not clear whether the change will be for good, or for worse..."
