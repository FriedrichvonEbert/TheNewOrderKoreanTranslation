POLITICS_FRANZ_HALDER_DESC:0 "Franz Halder, a name that will forever ring through the history books as one to be remembered. Who was it that broke the Soviet Union and Poland both? It was Franz Halder. Who was it that felled the twin titans of the European continent, France and Great Britain? As Chief of Staff of the OKH, it was Franz Halder who oversaw the planning of both, and the direct enactment of Operation Sealion, the master stroke that felled an Empire on which the sun never set. It was everything a military officer could dream for, and what better way to end ones glorious career than peacefully ensuring the compliance of a collaborationist government with a small out of the way garrison. The honour was Halders of course, though perhaps if he'd known what he was getting into he'd not have taken up the offer when Hitler presented it to him.\n\nThe incompetence of Mosley resulted in him needing to be removed, and the paltry succession of Prime Ministers that followed him were to a one incapable of managing their population, meaning that it was Franz Halder who needed to be the de facto force behind the government's actions. But then the Russians invaded in 1953, and it looked for a brief moment like Halder might be pulled out of his semi-retirement and sent to command the forces on the Eastern Front once more. It should have been his final victory, his last great battle. Then the communists rose up in London.\n\nThat Mountbatten had allowed the situation to get to the point where a revolt was possible was damning enough, but rumours of his contacts with certain undesirable elements of British society only sealed his fate. He would die shortly after the revolt started, and it would be up to Franz Halder to spend the next few weeks burning the communists out of London block by block. With his record of competence put in doubt, he never was able to convince Hitler to allow his retirement, and for the past decade the old general has sat in Cornwall dealing with petty terrorists and the imbecilic moaning of his so called allies in London. Now all that Franz Halder has left to him is a forgotten, crumbling garrison and the memories of past glories."

CRN_the_paper_lion_desc:0 "The core of the German presence in Cornwall is a cadre of battle hardened veteran soldiers, some of the finest that the Wehrmacht has ever produced. Honed by years of training and battle, and capable of storming hell itself if need be. The rest however, are the sons of the wealthy elite in Germania who want a safe posting for their children. This has needless to say caused a certain amount of lopsidedness in the Garrison's combat effectiveness."

CRN_the_fading_generaloberst_desc:0 "Franz Halder wanted to have his last war be on the icy plains of Russia, a final service to the Reich before a well earned and comfortable retirement. Instead, he has been stuck in England for the past two decades suppressing petty communists and monarchist vagabonds. In truth, Franz Halder wants to spend his last years in peace, but this seems a wish he is unlikely to see granted."
