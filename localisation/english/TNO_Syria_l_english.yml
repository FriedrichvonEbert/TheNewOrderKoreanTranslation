 #Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_SNS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Syrian National State was born from abandonment.\n\nPromised independence in exchange for supporting the Germans, Syrians watched in horror as Turkish soldiers marched to Al Azm Palace with no German help in sight. In the birthplace of the revolt against France, the Syrian National State under Turkey was formed - birthing NASIL, the resistance to the Syrian State.\n\nThe SNS played a critical role in the Iraqi War in 1952, as the Turkish armies were stalled in Iraq, until Tayfur Sökmen, a Syrian official, developed a plan to invade Iraq from Syria, which was enough to win the war. Sökmen was assassinated afterwards by NASIL, leading the SNS to violently crack down on all dissent and anti-Turkish sentiment through political persecution, military force, and even public executions.\n\nToday, the SNS is led by a council led by Husni al Za'im, Adib Shishakli, Fawzi Selu, and Sami al Hinnawi, each of whom have their own ambitions for Syria. Yet there are whispers of the NASIL remnants stirring once more - whispers which threaten to bring down the unstable foundations of the Syrian National State."
