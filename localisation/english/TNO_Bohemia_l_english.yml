POLITICS_LUTZ_GRAF_KROSIGK_DESC:0 "A conservative lawyer and disgraced former finance minister, Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk is not the first man one would expect to be running any part of the Reich's vast territories. Appointed as Reich Minister of Finance by the hated von Papen, he managed to hold his position into and through the National Socialist takeover through a combination of keeping his head down and blindly following any order from Hitler, along with steadily towing the party line. Through his seeming competence at keeping the economy together, he managed to win the Führer's trust and respect enough to save him from execution after the economic crash of the 1950s. Hitler's respect, however, could not save his job.\n\nDemoted from his post as Reich Minister, he was bounced around numerous departments, becoming a wandering bureaucrat shuffling papers. Finally, the Führer showed mercy upon him and sent him to become the Reichsprotektor of Böhmen-Mahren, with the understanding that he is on thin ice.\n\nKrosigk enters the Protektorat's political scene with a mixture of horror and determination to show the Führer what he's made of. Naturally, Böhmen-Mahren is a wreck of a nation, with partisans regularly destroying whatever's left of the failing infrastructure. It will take some work and reform to get the Protektorat up and running again. Of course, Germany may not like that reform, but what they don't know can't hurt them."

POLITICS_KURT_DALUEGE_DESC:0 "Born in a small Silesian town, Kurt Max Franz Daluege was always a German through and through, thriving in the military culture of the old empire. Daluege joined the Nazi Party in the early years, and soon moved onto the SS, serving as head of the Ordnungspolizei for many of the prewar years. It was a post perfectly suited for a sociopath such as himself, and Daluege was highly effective at crushing partisans and dissenters.\n\nSo it was that when Daluege was sent to Bohemia after the defeat of the Soviet Union it felt, to him, as if he was being stripped of his rank for little reason. But despite his distaste for the position, Daluege was convinced that he would return to the centre of German politics soon enough, and so he continued to exercise a callous cruelty towards those he watched over. As Himmler undertook his coup, Daluege could do nothing but watch from his post in Prague. The return to central German politics never came.\n\nLack of a position in the inner party did not truly put down Daluege, however. He has since built his network in Bohemia, even betraying SS principles and working with the Czech Resistance in the years after the West Russian War, allowing them to grow under his supervision and using them to undermine the garrison when he saw fit. When the civil war came, he called upon his network and chased the garrison out of Prague, declaring himself Oberstgruppenführer. There are few outside the SS who would support his coup, and the fanatical actions that are sure to follow.\n\nBut in Daluege's eyes, he has has been shunned long enough by Germania. Let decadent fools shout across the continent. Daluege now holds the power in Bohemia, and nobody, not in his own realm, not in Germany, not even in Burgundy, is going to take it from him."
