POLITICS_LUTZ_GRAF_KROSIGK_DESC:0 "A conservative lawyer and disgraced former finance minister, Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk is not the first man one would expect to be running any part of the Reich's vast territories. Appointed as Reich Minister of Finance by the hated von Papen, he managed to hold his position into and through the National Socialist takeover through a combination of keeping his head down and blindly following any order from Hitler, along with steadily managing the precious currency of the Reich during the years of massive spending. His competency, however, could not prevent the economic crash of the 1950s. His previous achievements on that field and even Hitler's respect, could not save his job.\n\nDemoted from his post as Reich Minister, he was bounced around numerous departments, becoming a wandering bureaucrat shuffling papers but eventually ended up becoming the Reichsprotektor of Böhmen und Mahren due to his rather soft and skillful hand in placating natives. As it turned out, he was the last in that position, as the Reichsprotektorat was formally annexed into the Reich in the early 1950s.\n\nYears after Reichsprotektorat annexation into the actual Reich borders, Krosigk emerged on the local political scene again, albeit this time as a Reichsverteidigungskommissar of Wehrkreis XIX, a local Wehrmacht command that took over after chaos engulfed the Reich. German Civil War participants had not yet managed to take over the rather small and neutral territory, but the future of such cordon - and the Reichsverteidigungskommissar with it - is rather bleak if things will fall apart under one of the contenders' wake."

POLITICS_KURT_DALUEGE_DESC:0 "Born in a small Silesian town, Kurt Max Franz Daluege was always a German through and through, thriving in the military culture of the old empire. Daluege joined the Nazi Party in the early years, and soon moved onto the SS, serving as head of the Ordnungspolizei for many of the prewar years. It was a post perfectly suited for a sociopath such as himself, and Daluege was highly effective at crushing partisans and dissenters.\n\nSo it was that when Daluege was sent to Bohemia after the defeat of the Soviet Union it felt, to him, as if he was being stripped of his rank for little reason. But despite his distaste for the position, Daluege was convinced that he would return to the centre of German politics soon enough, and so he continued to exercise a callous cruelty towards those he watched over. As Himmler undertook his coup, Daluege could do nothing but watch from his post in Prague. The return to central German politics never came.\n\nLack of a position in the inner party did not truly put down Daluege, however. He has since built his network in Bohemia, even betraying SS principles and working with the Czech Resistance in the years after the West Russian War, allowing them to grow under his supervision and using them to undermine the garrison when he saw fit. When the civil war came, he called upon his network and chased the garrison out of Prague, declaring himself Oberstgruppenführer. There are few outside the SS who would support his coup, and the fanatical actions that are sure to follow.\n\nBut in Daluege's eyes, he has has been shunned long enough by Germania. Let decadent fools shout across the continent. Daluege now holds the power in Bohemia, and nobody, not in his own realm, not in Germany, not even in Burgundy, is going to take it from him."
