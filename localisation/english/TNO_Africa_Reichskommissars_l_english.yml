ANC 파르티잔을 우연히 만난다면, 가장 위험한 사냥게임을 시작합니다."

An invasion of South Africa has been suggested constantly in different forms for the past twenty years, and we have gone so far as to keep a steady stream of arms and weaponry, with the Reich's approval and support, going to the Boer's to help them with their struggle. This finally seems to have found fruit, as with the situation in South Africa also deteriorating, the Boers have declared their independence from the South African government.\n\nIt is unsure if their rebellion will see much fruit, but if we were to support them in their struggle, we could find a strong ally to help us against our own insurgents. The other fear is that if we allow the Boers to go to the wolves, the OFN will most likely support the South African government, and then we'd have our enemies at our doorstep. America is cautious however, no doubt if we join the Boers, the Yankees and their pets would be too afraid of conflict with the mighty Reich to try and stop the events."

While this will hurt the Reichskommissars, especially the massive landgrab on the part of the OFN, perhaps the shrinking of the borders will ultimately prove to be a good thing for our security."

Our economic analysts, the ones that were personally trained by Göring himself, predicted that by fueling the economy with the fires of war and supplementing that with the spoils from our new conquests, would ensure that our previously rather collapsing mp economies would explode into massive growth.\n\nThose economists were shot today, as the news of another slave plantation being burned down by ANC resistance fighters reached the headquarters of Afrika-Schild. The supposed \"Wealth of Africa\" with which we were supposed to save our budgets has, unfortunately, seemingly vanished with the evacuated South African government.\n\nThe Boer republic, our client state administering what was once South Africa, has proven itself to be less than successful at capitalizing on the economic base that exists there. Soon after their government was established the various militia groups that made up the Boer army, once united against their common enemies, soon fractured into cliques centered around powerful generals  with the main contention between them being the Boers relationship to us, with a growing force of Afrikaans military men declaring that they will refuse to bend the knee to a German just like they refused to do so to an Anglo... While tensions are dormant for now, they will not remain so for long\n\nWhile they may be uncivilized, the ferocity and skill of these African resistance fighters is undeniable. But what is truly keeping us down is the newfound cooperation between the ANC and the few rouge South African army units still active.\n\nWhile the ANC might previously have been described as a highly motivated but lightly equipped force of revolutionaries, the second part of that sentence must be removed now that they have access to military grade hardware and training. It seems that the supposed \"Economic miracle of war\" was just an illusion."

There Müller is met with a warm welcome by his closest friend and newly declared head of the military junta that now leads Free France, Jaques Massu.\n\nA few days earlier Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig invited Müller and Reichskommissar Schenck of Südwest-Afrika to a celebration of their mutual victory over the American swine. Schenck, being located closer to Hüttigs manor, arrived first. He would never return. Müllers spies had warned him only a few hours before he arrived at Hüttigs estate that Hans was planning to murder them both. Unwilling to pursue a war against the elite forces under the command of Hüttig, Müller decided that his time as leader of Zentralafrika was over, and fled the country.\n\nNow the sole remaining figure of German authority in the region is Hans Hüttig, the butcher of Africa. As he took control of all of the German colonies in Africa he announced the creation of the Großafrikanischer Reichsstaat, a new administration which would ensure that the proper ideals of national-socialism would be enforced over Africa.\n\nLittle news leaves the Reichsstaat, but what comes out is horrifying. Entire regions \"Pacified\" by Hurtings fanatical SS soldiers. Slave labor camps that stretch on for kilometers. And a total dedication to eradication any shred of resistance that remains in Africa."

Zentralafrika is, if anything, a exploitation site for the Reich, and a amusement park for the Reichskommissar himself. Because if there truly is anything that Müller loves in this world, it is hunting exotic animals in all kind and shapes. The land, meanwhile, is exploited to everyone's content. Tons upon tons of natural recourses are taken through the ports of Zentralafrika on a daily basis, funneling the Reich's great expenses.

All he did nowadays, he thought, was sit around and sign useless documents that authorized worthless projects and initiatives. He stared longingly at the various trophies on his wall; it had been a while since he could really enjoy himself and let off some steam, and they were already starting to collect dust. His daydreaming about his next prey was interrupted by the knocking on his door.\n\n\"Hm? Who's there?\"\n\n\"Herr Müller? Are you available at this time?\"\n\n\"I suppose I am.\" Müller straightened himself in his seat, fully expecting a wave of bad news to hit him. \"Come in.\"\n\nA nervous aide sheepishly poked the door open, holding a stack of reports that had the admiralty's insignia sprawled over them. Müller already knew what the reports were about from the demeanor of the aide. He now had the unfortunate task of wasting his afternoon and reading them.\n\n\"Herr Müller, I am afraid to report that our fishing vessels were disrupted and mostly destroyed by the Brazilian navy. I am sure that this is a great inconvenience to you, and that I wil-\" Müller waved the aide off before he could say anything else, and the aide readily took the cue to give off a shaky salute before retreating out of the room. How was he going to break the news to the elite in Germania that seafood was going to double, maybe triple in price? He'd have one hell of a time figuring that out, and there was going to be plenty of yelling and arguing. Müller certainly didn't look forward to it."

 COG_Lobster_War.2.desc:0 "With his hands against the outside of the ship's cabin, Hans looked to the three other brave fishermen leaning there with him. At least, brave in his country. Here, they were nothing more than crooks, and the Brazilian walking up and down their line armed with a rifle was more than enough to solidify Hans' position as little more than a thief. Their ship had been caught totally off guard by the Brazilian Destroyer, and even now its soldiers were running around the lower decks like ants in search of food. With the abundance of Crabbing gear stored below decks, those insects were bound to find something to sate their appetite, not to mention justifying their boarding of the ship.\n\nIt was then that yelling from below deck confirmed Hans' worst fears and broke him out of his inner monologue. A pair of the soldiers ran down the stairs greased with the Atlantic's waters, while another ran up. Returning to what any sailor could recognize as the soldier's captain, the pair exchanged some words in presumably Portuguese, and the captain pulled at the collar of Hans' captain, Karl.\n\n\"You are not supposed to be here, you know this?\" The Brazilian threw Hans' captain to the deck, water splashing against the shoes of the men still standing as though in a firing line.\n\n\"Yes.\" Karl flatly retorted. Standing up, Karl grimaced at his soaked pants, then looked back to the Brazilian captain. \"We know what you think of us, and we know you'll do nothing.\" The Brazilian captain seemed taken aback, then his frown returned to his face. \"Fine. Have it your way, Herr captain.\" The captain spat in a mocking tone, as the crackle of a radio could be heard from behind Hans, as the Brazilian spoke in great urgency, not that anyone on the ship understood it. As the crackle stopped, and words managed its way out of the plastic brick, the Brazilian spoke again. \"You have one minute to be escorted back to Africa, or we ram you at 30 knots. Final offer.\""

 COG_Lobster_War.3.desc:0 "Lukas had just finished eating his breakfast with his fellow fishermen; they had been eating good ever since they started the job of fishing for seafood in Brazilian waters. When he left Germany to take on this job, he was seriously skeptical about how lucrative it could actually be, but Lukas had made a fortune and then some from this fishing contract. As he approached his vessel, he noticed his captain with a worried look on his face, which was never a good thing. Lukas walked up and gave the captain a firm salute, but the captain barely responded with one of his own.\n\n\"Men, I have some bad news for you all today. Our contract's been cancelled. Completely.\"\n\nThe shock barely registered with Lukas and his shipmates. Cancelled? They were bringing in 40 crates of seafood per trip: how could that not be profitable? \"Captain, why is it cancelled? We've been fishing well over our quota, and I can't see any reason why.\" The captain turned his back and stared at the sea for a second, before letting out a deep sigh. \"The Reichskommissariat has strongly suggested that we stop fishing in Brazilian waters.\" The crew shared several incredulous looks before the captain continued, \"Believe me, boys. I'm just as dumbfounded as you all are. Even though things have been peaceful, there's no guarantee it will stay that way. You boys will need to find new jobs. It was a pleasure to serve alongside you all.\"\n\nThe entire crew stared blankly into the sea that they would no longer traverse."

 COG_Lobster_War.4.desc:0 "Tears were beginning to leak out of Müller's eyes as he continued to read the most recent report from his admirals. Müller had been dealing with another boring day of paperwork when the report on how Brazil's navy was unable to even deal with some poorly armed and untrained fishermen. An official apology on top of sustained and significant damage to the ragtag pieces of iron they dare call a navy was too much for the Reichskommissar to bear. His stomach began to hurt, and he was nearly doubled over in his chair when the door to his office was kicked in. A shocked aide and guard barged in, but Müller couldn't help himself to stop laughing and wheezing, his face a crimson red.\n\n\"Herr Müller! Is everything alright? We were worried about how long you've been, well... laughing.\"\"\n\n\"I am fine, you fools! Why did you kick my goddamned door down?\"\" The pair looked in horror at the door, but Müller finally stopped his laughing to raise a hand to calm the two. \"No worries! I'll call Hans later to get that repaired. You are both dismissed.\"\"\n\nLike a schoolgirl reading a love story, Müller couldn't wait about what the report was going to tell him next. At this rate, was Brazil going to pay for the damages caused to the fishing boats? Müller couldn't help but flip through the reports to see what lengths Brazil was bending to the Reichskommissariat. The roars of laughter resumed shortly, and Müller slapped his desk several times to try and brace himself from the next round of laughter."

 COG_Lobster_War.5.desc:0 "Müller tapped his feet, anxiously awaiting an update from the navy regarding the state of his fishing boats. His mind was constantly racing between the deal the Brazilians had offered and his meetings with his admirals; had he been too rash with Salles? Were his admirals really supposed to be that confident in a bunch of civilian fishermen? Müller was lost in thought until he heard a knock on his door. It lacked confidence, much like himself.\n\n\"Herr Müller? The admirals have an update for you.\"\" The aide entered the room, and let a single manila envelope on his desk before ducking out immediately. Müller ripped open the file like a dog who hadn't eaten in a week, only to see one word stand out immediately: defeated. The fishing boats were apprehended and forced back to Zentralafrika by the Brazilian navy, and there were plenty of casualties on the German side of things, while the Brazilians barely sustained any.\n\nThe humiliation was immense for Müller and Zentralafrika. He dreaded the letter he would have to send back to Germania and the Führer. Simply put, there was no good way to phrase this embarrassment, and the Reich's main source of seafood was now cut off completely. Müller massaged his temple and tried to forget about this whole incident. Thank god he had scheduled a hunting trip earlier this week, he thought. The upcoming days would be nigh unbearable without it."

While the father and son had drifted apart in recent years, the two always found comfort in reuniting every night in their mutual friend's restaurant.

Around the trawler, I mean.\" His father took a moment to feign thinking. \"Hm... constantly, all of the time.\" He chuckled. \"You were there, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, hah hah, assuming that's a yes, would I have a job, now? Consider this an interview, I suppose.\" Nicolas sped up to walk backwards ahead of his father, down the sidewalk. \"You already know of my vast experience in the field, and that's not to mention how you've seen my work well in tense conditions, such as cooking with you and somehow burning eggs.\"\n\n\"Remember you're trying to persuade me, Nicolas.\" The pair pushed open the door to their customary meeting place. \"Now, what can I get for you?

Thing is, Brazil's not hurting for cash, is it? They don't have to scrape by, otherwise their funding is cut by rich uncle Germany hanging an axe over their head, do they?\" Uwe spoke up from his seeming concern over his own cards. \"Well, yes, but Brazil isn't exactly 'rolling in the dough' either, now are they? Have you seen what half their politics tend to look like?\"\n\n\"Fair enough, but there comes a point where we're entitled to some of this stuff, right?\" Hans countered. \"There's got to be some kind of a theft-to-righteous-claim ratio we've got the right to.\" Klaus and Uwe sat silent for a moment. Klaus spoke up. \"Well, I'd imagine that's up for the powers at large to discuss the specifics of, no?\"\n\nUwe snapped his fingers, and readjusted his posture. \"That's what I thought, too, but Brazil hasn't been open to negotiations without us totally conceding, so I suppose that if they're not looking to come to the table, then we've got moral free reign.\" Uwe cleared his throat."

While it wasn't quite like anyone actually paid any attention to the specifics of what they were doing for the week, it became hard to focus on work when it became too repetitive to not notice that something had to be going on behind the scenes. Lo and behold, looking at the list for the past few weeks, there was a steady uptick of fishing trawlers, bizarrely. Bingo. That was the American expression, wasn't it?\n\nLeaning against the wall of the office, Jean lit a cheap cigarette he managed to haggle from a Belgian businessman. Not that the interaction was easy to go through, of course he tried to sell the tobacco for more than it was worth, but that was to be expected coming from any stuffy Belgian, bitter as they were, and it certainly didn't help matters that the Belgian was selling something to a native. Even still, that didn't matter now. What did matter, however, was why fishing trawlers -of all boats to come in for repairs- were flooding into the ports. Jean snickered to himself, took another drag on his cigarette. Next were the exact documents on what the damages were, specifically. Opening the filing cabinet's correlating drawer, it came as a surprise that there weren't actually any folders from the last months. There weren't any from the last year and a half, in fact. Not even that the files weren't put in place in the first place, there had to be some kind of files registered, this wasn't exactly Schenck's hellhole after all, but even the folders themselves keeping the cabinet organized were gone.\n\nAcross the office, the elevator to the floor dinged. Jean took a last drag on his cigarette. Hastily throwing the registration files back into place, Jean made a run back towards the stairs towards the back of the office block looking across the south Atlantic. Having run down the emergency exit, Jean took a moment to look out across the grand ocean, as he felt a determination grip him like an iron vice. There was a reason that so many trawlers were coming back in pieces."

 COG_Lobster_War.9.t:0 "Just How Legal?"
 COG_Lobster_War.9.desc:0 "Something that Arthur had come to learn about shuffling papers in Müller's name, was that the benefits of choosing what happened and what didn't -at least so far as anyone in Germania was concerned- were so absolutely great, that there was no comparison in the world. Sometimes, sitting in his musty office in god-knows-where, Africa, was one of the most exhilarating experiences of his life. A thousand different \"enterprising individuals\" had all asked him for one favor or another, making some things disappear, or some others come into being, all for a reasonable fee, of course. The problem always came with \"balancing the budget\"- or rather, making up a budget that waved away all the corruption. So, when the notion of including the profits in crabbing within Brazil's waters came to mind, it was practically the perfect crime. Namely, that Arthur didn't actually need to state just how much profit had been accrued from the expeditions. If he handled it right, then it was entirely possible that Arthur could open up who-knows how much more operating room in his little \"operation\". The problem remained, however, that Arthur didn't know how Germania thought of such expeditions. Did they see it as illegal? They definitely knew about it, there was no way they couldn't have. If it was illegal, then Germania would have already cracked down on the operations. Did they decide to just look the other way? If so, then the bureaucrats in Germania didn't want a reason to know it was going on. Arthur took out the almanac of any respectable bureaucrat; the phone book.\n\n\"Hello, Arthur Davies of Zentralafrikan bookkeeping speaking, would you be able to tell me of the legality of crabbing within Brazilian waters? Where does Germany stand on it exactly?\" A pause between lines. \"Uhmm... I'm not sure if this is the place to call. Have you tried the...\"\n\nArthur took a moment to breathe. It was now midnight. This, then, is why Arthur was supposedly the first to hear of the potential in logging the profits in crabbing. Nobody knew how to, and Arthur could count himself among them."

Standing in the middle of the emergency meeting of the sailors and fishermen deep within Brazilian waters, the tension had been growing steadily since Ernst first walked into the dank room with a look of disappointment in his eyes, and a feeling of dread in his gait. Walking up to the one chair set in the middle of the room, Ernst leaned against the back of the strong oak, looking out at the assembled hardly-under-a-dozen sailors surrounding him. \"It's no wonder why we're all here. God only knows how long it's been since we left German waters, and even he doesn't know how long since our friends in the government said that Brazil's waters are officially off-limits. Why we're still here is obviously not up to debate so much as narrowing down specifics.\" Ernst gestured to one of the two mercenaries just walking in on the impromptu meeting. \"The necessity of a greater security presence has also gone not without notice, we've all met Hank, after all, haven't we?\" The American awkwardly half-waved at the crew, abolishing their formerly dominating presence over the past week in an instant.\n\nOne of the younger deckhands, Maxime, a Belgian, stepped forward. \"Wonderful, we're all on the same page. What I want to know is why we're here, Captain.\"\n\nErnst stepped away from the chair. \"Yes. Why we're here. Right.\" The Captain cleared his throat. \"Money.\" A light row of laughter shook the cabin, not before silencing itself in anticipation of what the Captain had to say. \"Well, to be perfectly honest with you all, it's just not worth it anymore. The Brazilians are locking down the waterways, and we've wasted the last two days rerouting our path to the point it's not even worth it anymore. As a result, I have taken the executive decision to cease a-\" A rumble of half-angered, half-understanding groans broke out across the cabin. \"Listen, I know this isn't ideal, but-\""

I'm not about to break that streak, so indulge me for a moment. Do yourself a favor, listen, and it'll only help you.\"\n\nKlaus seemed to be one of the more respectable Germans to work under Fischer's auspices, collared shirt, a proper German family, the whole nine yards. This came at the cost, then, of Klaus forcing himself into looking for greater pay. An admirable ambition, until it started digging into Fischer's pockets.\n\n\"What I don't understand is why you want out. You get good pay, your job security is secure as ever -regardless of recent events- and you're one of my most valued trawlers. So why?\" Klaus let out a deep sigh and leaned against Fischer's desk.\n\n\"Because, Reinhard, I can't pay for food. You haven't been paying me, assuming you haven't forgotten, and if you do not pay me, I do not work.\" Fischer unblinkingly stared at Klaus and leaned forward.\n\n\"You leave now, and I don't pay you.\" Klaus smiled and took a step back from the neatly aligned papers and pens on Fischer's desk.\n\n\"No trouble, Reinhard. My father's a busy man, and I'm about to join him. Schramme seems to be taking in plenty of us expendable labor nowadays, and I've always been welcome in his home. I only expect that to continue.\" Klaus was always a smug prick, and he certainly maintained the tradition of walking away from his job without his 2-week notice.

Walking past his shift manager, Manon glanced at the clock and smiled. \"Maurice, that's an hour, I get a smoke break.

Unveiling a lone cigarette from his pant pocket and hovering it over the front burner, Manon walked out the back door and walking out of the alleyway, Manon couldn't help but look out at the waves of cars struggling to get into the ever-esteemed restaurant.
