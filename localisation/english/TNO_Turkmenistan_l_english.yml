 TRK_Fragmented_Tribes: "흩어진 부족들"
 TRK_Fragmented_Tribes_desc: "The social and political fabric of Turkmenistan is made up almost entirely of the Turkmen tribes that live within its borders. Politically, they are the foundation of Poda's support, but also the greatest obstacle to some of his reforms.\n\nThe tribes do not wish to change their ways and support the development of Turkmenistan, finding a way to sway them without losing their faith is one of the most pressing matters that the young state faces."
 TRK_Question_Of_Identity: "정체성 문제"
 TRK_Question_Of_Identity_desc: "Turkmenistan is a country, but it is not yet a nation. In truth, what remains now is a vestige of a larger country- the Soviet Union- that lies utterly ruined and shattered. This has left Turkmenistan in a strange state of limbo, with no identity to call its own.\n\nWhat makes a Turkmen? Is it the ground upon which we tread? Is it the tribes that we call our own? These are questions that will need to be answered sooner than later, the ability for the nation to come together and act cohesively depends upon it."
 TRK_A_Modern_Silk_Road: "현대의 실크 운동"
 TRK_A_Modern_Silk_Road_desc: "History has a funny way of repeating itself. Back in antiquity, the Silk Road was the great trade route that ran through Central Asia, connecting the Far East and Far West of the ancient world. And so now as before, Turkmenistan finds herself at the heart of a new Silk Road.\n\nTurkmenistan acts as a beacon of relative stability compared to the rest of Central Asia and Northwest China, and as grim or callous as it may seem, this has attracted seekers of both asylum and profit to our doorstep, and embracing them with open arms has aided us greatly."
 TRK_Turkic_United_Front: "Turkic United Front"
 TRK_Advisors_Uzbek: "Uzbek Advisors"
 TRK_Ministry_of_Security: "Ministry Of National Security"
 TRK_Defense_Improvements: "Defensive Improvements"
 POLITICS_GALIYEV_DESC: "If any man in Central Asia today represents its traumatic and conflicting heritage from the last few decades, it is Mirsaid Sultangaliyev.\n\nBorn in Bashkiria, deep in the most Russified parts of Eurasia, Mirsaid was an early follower of the revolutionary ideas spreading like wildfire across Russia - seeing in them the solution to the imperialist oppression clamping down on the minorities and Islamic faith, and the way forward for the organization of these peoples. His time in Baku in the early tens and twenties pushed him further to the Bolsheviks' path, and when his time came to fight for the Revolution he did so with aplomb, using his familiarity with national movements in Central Asia to cripple the Whites - earning the trust of none other than Vladimir Lenin himself in the process.\n\nAll seemed set for a steady rise through the Soviet ranks as a representative of the Turkic nationalities of the USSR and its Islamic people - a rise which never came. The rest of the Party remained suspicious of his tolerance of regional nationalism and religion, and so Mirsaid remained marooned in Central Asia, far from the decision-making, working steadfastly to improve the local situation but without much hope of influencing the top.\n\nThat was, until the Nazi war machine crushed the USSR entirely and left its peripheral republics reeling in a chaotic void of power. Now, Mirsaid Sultangaliyev stands as a symbol of Turkic cooperation amongst those left standing - still believing in the end goal of Marxism-Leninism but adapted to truly serve the people instead of the Russian despots in a far-away capital."
 POLITICS_PODA_ANNAORAZOV_DESC: "When the Soviet Union fell, the Turkmens did not fail the Revolution. Their support for the Union and all it represented was unwavering in its resolve. But the Russians did fail the Turkmens, the bureaucrats and administrators fled to their homeland as Iran invaded Turkmenistan in the wake of the Union's collapse. In the end, it fell to a native son of Turkmenistan, a healer and protector, to rise to her defense. It fell to Poda Annaoarazov.\n\nLeading a rag-tag band of Turkmen tribesmen, Soviet partisans, and personal friends and allies, Poda repelled not only the Iranians, but a simultaneous Afghan invasion as well. This achievement sent shockwaves across Turkmenistan, and it seemed only natural that the hero of Samarkand be named Chairman. If only governance were the same beast as defeating armies. Poda has found the years following these victories to be more exhausting than any battle, or mending any grievous wounds, and these tiring years are starting to weigh on him.\n\nPoda guides Turkmenistan to the best of his abilities, but at the end of the day he is not an administrator. While a convicted Bukharinist, Poda finds himself being pulled this way and that by the buzzing swarm of advisors, ministers, generals, allies and bureaucrats that circle him at all times. Some of them hold to his convictions, while others hold respect for him- and he for them- but find themselves at complete odds with his Bukharinist principles, and as the years drag on, which is which only seems to grow less and less clear. Some days, it almost gets to be enough to wish for another war to fight."
 POLITICS_BABAKHAN_DESC: "Hailing from the line of Ahmad Yasawi comes another great Turkic scholar of the Islamic Faith. Ziyauddinhan Babahan was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and grew up among the faith, following in the footsteps of his father in the early years of his life and being educated by Shami Domla, whose theology and politics influenced his own greatly. When Kalinin accepted the request of Uzbek and Turkmen Imams to establish the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (or SADUM for short) during the Second World War, his life took a distinctly different turn, not one of mere theology, but of politics in turn. Though officially his father led the organization to start, as its secretary, much of the administrative duties fell to Ziyauddinhan.\n\nWith Islam in one hand and Marxism in the other, Ziyauddinhan sought to shepherd the faithful of his homeland fairly and equitably. Training of the clergy, the management of charity, and the publishing of religious material fell to himself and the organization that he ran. As the war took a sour turn for the USSR, it fell to him in turn, to be their guide and protector as the Union disintegrated, and more and more of the people of Central Asia turned to the faith for truth and comfort. Even after the war's end, Ziyauddinhan continues to fight this good fight.\n\nThese days, he is far from home, running SADUM from the safety and security of Turkmenistan. Both he and his organization represent a sense of continuity and structure remaining from the days of the Soviet Union. In spite of everything that has happened, the dual spirit of Marxism and Islam lives strong, and socialist thought justified by his interpretations of Islamic law provides an additional avenue to security and to justice in a world that so often lacks both."
