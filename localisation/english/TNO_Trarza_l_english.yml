 TRZ_idea_mauritanian_claims: "모리타니 주장"
 TRZ_idea_mauritanian_claims_desc: "The government of Trarza claims to be the legitimate ruler of the former french colony of Mauritania. These claims include vast regions currently controlled by Iberia. While few in the international community take Trarza's ambitions seriously, within the country they are vital to maintaining political stability. Without the claims, the ruling Military Committee for National Recovery would lose all reason to exist. It remains to be seen if they will even have an opportunity to press them."
 TRZ_idea_military_committee_national_recovery: "The Military Committee for National Recovery"
 TRZ_idea_military_committee_national_recovery_desc: "In order to secure the stability and unity of the nation, and prepare for the reclamation of Mauritania, the military leaders of Trarza have formed a junta and outlawed other political organizations, doing away with all forms of democracy in the name of eliminating political division and uniting the people. Trarza is a nation without politics, for the moment at least."

 POLITICS_MOUSTAPHA_OULD_MOHAMED_SALECK_DESC: "Moustapha Ould Mohamed Saleck was three when the war broke out in Europe. Born in the city of Kiffa, he was fourteen when the bombs started dropping upon West Africa. But Saleck's youth does not nullify his willpower, and now, he will bring in the new dawn of Mauritania, and unite the forgotten peoples of West Africa into a strong and free state, free of Iberian and French influence altogether.\n\nSaleck was a mere teenager when he joined the party of Moktar Ould Daddah, The Mauritanian People's Movement, as the French were pushed to the Ivory Coast and the Iberians secured their land with a pistol grip. Honing his skills, he rose up the ranks in five years until he was one of Daddah's most trusted generals. Whispers about how this young man personally beat back an entire Iberian regiment became an inspiration to the freedom fighters of Mauritania.\n\nBut Saleck had issue with Daddah, as did many. He saw nothing but weakness in the man, a socialist who held Islamic values about as closely as any other betrayer of the faith, a man who refused to make any sort of definitive large-scale move against the Iberian scum who were occupying Mauritanian lands. Eventually, plots were created, ideas were drawn up, and the military's scheme was put into action. Moktar Ould Daddah was asked to step down from the leadership of the party  with a gun to his back, as to cause as little alarm as possible, and the Mauritanian People's Movement was reorganised into the Military Committee for National Recovery, a group of Generals who were dedicated to the formation of the true Mauritanian nation.\n\nBut Saleck still faces opposition within Trarza, from both the more socialistic members of the population who wish for Daddah to return, to the rest of the Generals in his clique, and of course, there's always the threat of the Iberian people occupying their rightful land, he assumes waiting to strike at any moment..."
