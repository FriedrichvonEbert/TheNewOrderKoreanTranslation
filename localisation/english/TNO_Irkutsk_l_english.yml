 POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC: "옛 소비에트 연방 시절로 거슬러 올라가면, 겐리흐 그리고리에비치 야고다는 굉장히 유명한 인물이자 동시에 공포의 대상이었습니다. NKVD 국장으로서, 야고다는 내부 권력 투쟁 초기부터 지지해왔으며 이후 권력을 장악한 부하린 정권의 안정과 안보를 공고히할 책임을 가지고 있었습니다. 그가 지극히 간단한 명령을 내리는 것 만으로도 가장 영향력 있는 볼셰비키마저 갑자기 실종되거나 반혁명적 행보를 이유로 처형될 수 있었습니다.\n\n그러나, 전쟁이 발발한 이후 연방의 영토 대부분과 모스크바마저 독일의 군홧발 아래에 짓밟히고 말았습니다. 이어지는 혼돈 속에서, 야고다는 주어진 권한을 최대한 활용해 최고 소비에트 상임 간부회 상당수를 독일국으로부터 가능한 한 멀리 떨어진 동부로 피난시켰습니다. 마침내 그는 시베리아 깊숙한 지역에서 지배권을 확립할 수 있었습니다. 그곳에서, 그는 가장 강력한 연방의 후계국을 통치하게 되었습니다.\n\n하지만 옛 상임 간부회가 설립한 국가는 오래 가지 못했습니다. 야고다의 제국이 천천히 무너지면서 하얼빈의 증오스러운 반동분자들부터 중앙 시베리아의 \"민주주의자\"와 함께하는 장군들, 바이칼호 바로 반대편의 반역적인 수정주의자들까지, 수많은 국가의 적과 반역자들이 계속해서 자신의 영지를 수립해 나갔습니다. 하지만 이르쿠츠크 정부가 여태까지 겪은 모든 타격에도 불구하고 여기는 여전히 또 하나의 군벌 국가로 우뚝 서 있습니다. 그리고 이르쿠츠크 정부가 가장 우월한 점은 바로 정통성에 있습니다. 어떤 군벌도 옛 정부의 직접적인 후계자라고 자칭할 수 없기 때문입니다. 야고다는 현재 NKVD가 수호하는 혁명의 마지막 요새에서만 통치권을 행사하고 있으며, 한 줌도 안되는 부하린주의 정치인들만 통치할 뿐입니다. 야고다에게 남은 것은 그뿐이지만, 이 정도로도 충분할 겁니다."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BESSONOV_DESC: "소련의 정치인이자, 외교관이자, 공산당 관료일 뿐만 아니라 강력한 부하린주의자이기도 한 세르게이 알렉세예비치 베사노프는 독일의 침공 기간 동안 모스크바에서 정부를 철수시키며 그 뒤를 따랐습니다. 수많은 탈당과 분열에도 불구하고, 그는 다른 상임간부회 의원들과 함께 상임간부회에 남아, 이르쿠츠크에 정착하여 야고다 총서기의 내각에서 외무장관의 자리를 얻었습니다.\n\n그러나, 베사노프는 점점 야고다의 통치방식에 환멸을 키워나갔으며, 특히 권력이 국가 파벌에 집중되며, 진정한 부하린주의 국가의 권위가 취할 자연스러운 형태인 전연방 공산당에서 이를 앗아가는것을 강하게 반대했습니다. 당과 야고다 파벌간의 권력 다툼이 깊어지자, 베사노프는 자신의 충성심이 어디를 향하는지 깨달았고, 야고다를 몰아내어 다시 한번 당에 힘을 실어줄 때가 되었을 때 자신의 역할을 수행할 준비가 되어있었습니다.\n\n야고다의 몰락 이후, 감사의 의미로써 상임간부회에 의해 수상으로 지명된 베사노프는 재빨리 야고다 지지자들과 충성파를 권좌에서 몰아낸 뒤, 믿을만한 당 관료들로 교체했습니다. 그는 전적으로 상임간부회와 연방을 부하린주의의 뿌리로 되돌리고자 하며, 이를 통해 소위 '야고드시나'를 결정적이고 영구적으로 해체할 것입니다."

 IRK_mutiny_in_the_trenches_desc: "연방의 병사들은 상상도 못할 것들을 견뎌왔습니다, 그리고 우린 그들에게 더 버텨줄것을 요청해야합니다. 그들은 반역자들과 파르티잔에 맞서는 우리의 방패이며, 독일군들이 수년전에 시작했던 일을 끝내려하는 이들입니다. 연방이 살아남기 위해선, 전선에서 사우는 우리 병사들을 위해 가능한 모든것을 지원해줘야 합니다.\n\n식량, 장비, 무기 보급을 확실히 하여 병사들에게 제때 도착할수 있도록 함으로서, 시베리아 전쟁의 지옥 같은 상황을 조금더 버티게 해줄수 있을 것입니다. 우린 최전방과 예비군 임무를 순환할수 있으며, 전장으로 복귀할 때가 되었을때, 병사들이 회복하여 효과적으로 싸울수 있을 것입니다. 우리가 또 다른 위협과 직면하여 우리의 사기가 흔들리게 할순 없습니다."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_defense_desc: "The partisan's rebellion must be quickly crushed without mercy or hesitation. To this effect, Yagoda has ordered the Ministry of Defense to immediately shift the nation to a war footing until the eastern rebellion has been fully stamped out. Certain areas of the economy will shift production to military materials, while others will continue to operate, but in a modified fashion. Military rations will be temporarily prioritized over the civilian food supply, while several factories currently producing civilian goods will begin being converted to weapon foundries.\n\nAnother step the Ministry of Defense has been ordered to take is the issuing of the \"museum pieces\". These antiquated weapons date back to before the second world war and have until now been kept in storage. The Ministry will issue these weapons to our reserve units focused on hunting partisans operating in our own territory."
 IRK_mutiny_volunteers_for_the_union_desc: "연방의 봉사자들"
 IRK_mutiny_nkvd_guards_detachments_desc: "In the Union's darkest hour, it was the NKVD that rescued the Presidium and evacuated it to Irkutsk. Now, when we are forced to fight for our survival once more, the NKVD shall deliver us victory again. Some of the most experienced soldiers in our nation are members of the NKVD guards. Currently, these men are scattered in small groups across the country, serving as bodyguards, intelligence officers, and secret police, but they could be of greater use if we organized them into a full military division.\n\nThis new NKVD motor rifle division will be the tip of the spear that we will skewer the traitors with. The ragtag bandits won't stand a chance against the discipline and ruthlessness of the finest soldiers of the Soviet Union. Once we have defeated the partisans this new division will be instrumental to our reclamation of Siberia, and eventually all of Russia."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_construction_desc: "Irkutsk is the main economic and industrial hub of eastern Siberia, but we have been hurt by the rebellion. Large portions of our military industry and infrastructure have fallen under the control of Sablin's bandits at a moment when we need them most. To make up for this, the Directorate of Construction will have to make some accommodations for our military.\n\nFactory space that would have otherwise gone to other projects has been cleared for military production. Infrastructure projects that will benefit the military have been accelerated while civilian constructions have been postponed indefinitely. Until we have recovered our stolen industry, we must get everything we have out of what remains. We have to keep our army supplied and on the move, no matter the cost."
 IRK_mutiny_field_fortification_planning_desc: "야전 요새화 계획"
 IRK_mutiny_supplemental_labor_battalions_desc: "We need all hands on deck to defeat the Sablinites, even those who might have failed us before. The gulags of our nation are filled with physically capable prisoners eager to prove their redemption and earn their freedom, or at the very least a reduced sentence. We will create a program of labor battalions formed from volunteers from the gulags, who will supplement our military engineers and aid field constructions for the duration of the rebellion.\n\nOf course, we must be careful with these volunteers. Many of them have attempted to betray us before, and exposure to any rebel propaganda could easily incite them to do so again. To incentivize loyalty, any volunteers who complete their work without incident will be rewarded with a modest reduction of their sentence. The last thing we want is a mass prisoner revolt behind our lines."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_capital_desc: "Sablin's rebellion has exposed the key weaknesses within our central government. It is a travesty that the traitors managed to advance their cause to this point without the institutions of the state managing to stamp them out. Immediate steps must be taken to make sure that the holes in the government that led to the present situation are plugged.\n\nOnce the partisans have been crushed the government must be ready to quickly reintegrate the territory they stole from us and crack down on any remaining dissent that may emerge. We must also begin a review of our government to see how this rebellion escaped our notice. This will not be allowed to happen again, not if the Union is to have any hope of surviving."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_presidium_desc: "The necessary reforms to our apparatus of the state will be handled by the Presidium of the Soviet Union. In these troubled times the Presidium can serve as a beacon of stability to guide us through the storm. While the military and the NKVD handle the matter of crushing the rebellion, the politicians of the Presidium will work to make sure that normalcy is maintained as much as is possible in a time of war.\n\nInvestigations into the Presidium itself must also take place, both internal and external. If any traitors remain hidden within our government we must sniff them out. More important than that though, is the lack of oversight within the Presidium that allowed the rebellion's leaders to continue their plot. In the new Presidium such things will not be possible."
 IRK_mutiny_an_ironclad_union_desc: "This is no time for dissenting voices or questioning authority. The Union is facing a crisis that threatens to destroy it, a crisis which was born out of disunity. Some within our government see the rebellion as a chance to advance their own agendas or push for their pet reforms while our attention is elsewhere. If this backroom maneuvering is allowed to go on unchecked it could spell our demise.\n\nYagoda has ordered that all factionalism within the Presidium and the government as a whole must end immediately. For the duration of the crisis only authorized motions pertaining to it may be discussed and implemented. Anyone who attempts to subvert this order will find just how serious we are. There may eventually be a day when we can afford the luxury of allowing constructive criticism from within our ranks. That day is not today."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_shadows_desc: "The greatest weapon left in our arsenal is our intelligence apparatus. When Russia fractured it was the agents of the NKVD who kept the Union alive and carved out a new home for the revolution in Irkutsk. The operatives and spies of the NKVD are some of the most experienced in the world. The time has come to use them against Sablin and his gang of traitors, and tear apart the upstart rebellion from within.\n\nThe fragile new government across Lake Baikal is a perfect target for infiltration and sabotage. It is run by inexperienced amateurs trying to figure out how to run a nation as they go. Our agents will have no trouble infiltrating it by posing as traitors or double agents, and in many cases, they won't even need to hide their identities. Before long the partisans will be in disarray, with all their plans and secrets laid bare before us."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_state_security_desc: "When one is waging a war of subterfuge and espionage, defense is even more critical than offense. As we uncover the secrets of the rebellion, we must take precautions to make sure they do not uncover ours as well. The NKVD's internal service apparatus, the Directorate of State Security is responsible for this vital mission. Partisan operations are notoriously hard to stamp out, but if there is anyone who can do it, it is them.\n\nMembers of the government who display anything less than total loyalty will be placed under surveillance, as will anyone who was associated with known traitors before they began their revolt. Agents will be posted in every town and city, keeping their ears to the ground for any sign of trouble. Patrols will sweep the countryside to intercept infiltrators. Irkutsk shall become an intelligence black hole."
 IRK_mutiny_mobile_interrogation_centers_desc: "Sometimes time is of the essence and prisoners with valuable information cannot be transported back to secure locations quickly enough. Extracting information is already a time-consuming process without the added delay of bringing a captured asset to an interrogation room and then having to take the information they divulge back to the front lines. The solution to this problem is simple: bring the interrogation room to the front lines.\n\nBy refitting a number of trucks to carry intelligence officers who specialize in information extraction and \"wetwork\", as well as the tools they use to carry out their jobs, we can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of our interrogations of sablinite prisoners. As an added bonus, the trucks may acquire such a reputation that the unpleasant methods of our interrogators may be rendered unnecessary. The fear of the trucks alone will break even the most hardened partisan."

 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_propaganda_desc: "In times of war propaganda can make the difference between victory and defeat. It is essential that friendly morale be kept high and enemy morale be kept low. The current rebellion is no exception and the Ministry of Propaganda has been hard at work making sure everyone knows that our victory is inevitable. They have recently completed the preparations for a two-pronged propaganda offensive for soldiers on both sides of the front line.\n\nWe will inspire our own loyal soldiers with tales of bravery performed by their comrades, and by reminding them of the long legacy of resistance and heroism they are continuing. We will bombard the traitorous bandits with propaganda proving the superiority of our troops and exposing the misguided fools they have followed into battle against their own countrymen."
 IRK_mutiny_remember_the_revolution_desc: "Sablin has attempted to claim the mantle of Lenin's revolution, painting himself as a true Leninist and his band of scum as spiritual successors to the October Revolution. While this is obviously nonsense, many of our citizens have fallen under the sway of these lies. We must prove that we carry the torch of the worker's revolution, while the partisans are nothing more than deceitful reactionaries.\n\nThe Ministry of Propaganda will launch a campaign based on Sablin's messages - remembering the October Revolution, staying true to Lenin's goals, and so forth, but we will do it better. Sablin is stuck with a group of ideologues and intellectuals quoting theory at each other, while we have teams of professional propagandists working with a proper budget to spread our messages far and wide."

 IRK_mutiny_the_union_forever_desc: "Victory is at hand. After months of fighting we have finally driven back the traitors and are preparing to deliver the killing blow. These cowards sought to destroy the Union when it was at its weakest, but they failed to learn the lessons of history. If the Germans with the mightiest army to ever march across Europe could not destroy us, no one can. They knew their only chance was to strike while our back was turned and even then they failed.\n\nOnce our victory has been secured it will be time to begin rebuilding our fractured territory. This hopeless rebellion never had a chance of toppling the Soviet Union, but it will change it. Certainly we cannot revert to the old status quo that allowed this to happen in the first place. We will never be able to reclaim Russia if we are constantly occupied fighting rebellions and partisans. No matter what happens, we will go forward knowing our victory is assured. The Union shall not, must not fall."
 IRK_postwar_the_union_victorious_desc: "The people of the Soviet Union have done it, comrades! The rebellious Sablinites have been utterly smashed and we have emerged victorious from the battle in full glory! We have proven our strength once more and showing our neighbors that we will not go down without a fight.\n\nHowever, just because the battle has been finished, does not mean that this is time for celebration! It is time for us to regroup and bring justice to the Sablinites!\n\nIt is time for the Soviet Union to cut the final piece of thread that our opposition dangles off of, and to show the Sablinites that we, the people of the Union, still remain vigilant and powerful, even in our most dire state!"
 IRK_postwar_the_great_purge_desc: "The Soviet Union cannot allow a counterrevolutionary revolt on this scale to ever occur again. If Russia is to ever rise from the ashes and show the Union as a stable entity, then our regional administrations must not allow these rebels to ever rise up against our government. We need to strike the source of the problem: The Incompetent and Corrupt.\n\nA §VGreat Purge§! is sorely needed to ensure our government stays indivisible. Those officials that are incompetent to lead and administrate must be gathered up. What awaits them will either be a firing squad, a lifetime in prison, or expulsion from the party depending on the heinousness of their crimes.\n\nFor the especially corrupt however, an appointment at the back of the shed and a bullet in the head will be the most befitting course of action. One cannot have a stable Union if its people are being represented so incompetently..."
 IRK_postwar_assemble_the_commission_desc: "It is crucial that we enact a purge to effectively remove the filth lurking with our framework. In order to do so, however, we will establish a commission that is able to collect information from the suspected officials then disposing of them through any means necessary. The members of the commission, however, cannot be composed of regular NKVD officials in fear of them compromising our efforts, so we'll have to scout and recruit talented individuals from within the NKVD's ranks that possess necessary skills in order for our plans to come into fruition\n\nAfter all, it'd be impossible to commit to our internal purges without a proper commission to handle the dirty work in service of the people of the Soviet Union."
 IRK_postwar_recall_suspect_personnel_desc: "We have a lot of suspects noted by the NKVD for potential punishment, whether their track record are a lot more minor cases of simply sheer incompetence, or more extreme cases of corruption, we will need to remove them from their positions for the necessary steps of the Purge.\n\nHowever, while the people we are purging might have been incompetent at their job or might have had traces of corruption, we cannot just remove them from their positions and leave an empty void. Those positions will need to be filled.\n\nWe will instate some... \"temporary\" personnel to fill their shoes in their jobs, we cannot leave such a power gap or else we could be destabilizing the Union further."
 IRK_postwar_the_investigations_desc: "While nobody can remain out of the NKVD's grasp for long, it has become clear that some of the suspects we are closing in on are simply entrenched too deep into the political machine to be removed easily. Now that the commission has been assembled, we shall begin a wide series of investigations to gather evidence on those corrupt officials who foolishly assume they are untouchable. With luck, we will find something concrete and can continue to make arrests.\n\nOnce we have enough material on to start the crackdowns in earnest, however, the question remains as to how to properly deal with the arrested officials. With the evidence in hand, the commission will move to determine the severity of the suspect's crimes, and therefore the severity of their punishment.\n\nWhile most of these parasites will no doubt be found to be enemies of the state and will be purged for their idiotic crimes against the people, there may be some who are not too far gone and can be encouraged to realize the error of their ways. Once the evidence has been gathered and reviewed, the final decision on whether or not to show clemency with minor offenders will ultimately rest on Comrade Yagoda and the NKVD."
 IRK_postwar_zero_tolerance_desc: "We cannot condone any corrupt and incompetent incumbents to continue holding their governing positions. From the lowest bureaucrat to the highest minister, any person caught and prosecuted within our Purge won't be reinstated in any position under no circumstances.\n\nWhile no quarter shall be spared for any mice caught in our mousetraps, those that were spared won't ever be allowed to re-enter the political scene in our Union ever again. The damage done while they held power was already terrible, if we let them return, the amount of damage they could do to our administration would be immeasurable.\n\nThe Soviet Union cannot risk degenerate officials like them crawling their way back onto our administration lest they corrode the system once more."
 IRK_postwar_opportunities_for_forgiveness_desc: "There are a certain group of people within our reach that we could potentially use to our advantage in order to further re-establish our glorious republic. Their role in the prior administration was highly effective, but all that effectiveness ended up coming at a price - corruption.\n\nHowever, there is now an opportunity for us to rein in those administratively able ministers and incorporate them into our own government.\n\nIf we are to utilise these people to our advantage, we could promise them redemption. They could regain their original positions and we can cover their tracks, however, only under the stern condition that they do not repeat their... erroneous actions once more."
 IRK_postwar_the_irkutsk_trials_desc: "The time has come. Our investigations have been completed, our judicial approach has been decided upon, and we must now act to complete our purge of the state's enemies.\n\nWe will bring those identified as guilty, through whatever means, to trial. We will show the people, directly, that these counterrevolutionary elements, corrupt officials, traitors, parasites, and others, cannot escape judgement.\n\nAnd once they are finally gone, the state will at last be secure. We will make sure of it."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_the_mutiny_desc: "While their ideology of the Buryat Mutiny, the disgraceful Sablinite rebellion against the Soviet Union, was in the wrong place, and they were promptly crushed by the real Revolution they sought to revolt against, perhaps we should take some notes of their tactical ability against us.\n\nThe ability for the rebels to arm so many supporters is a curious one, and one we should be opening commissions into. We need to analyse how they were able to achieve what they had managed to, and see how we can adopt that to the Soviet Union's army!\n\nWhile the Sablinites might not have been good at using their tactics effectively, the Soviet Union will happily rebrand it as ours and use it more efficiently!"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_their_spirit_desc: "What was the driving force behind their rebellion, comrades? It was their hopes and desire of toppling the administration of the Union and superseding it with their own government that had inspired them to revolt.\n\nWe must take some notes from what gave the rebellious Sablinites the hope to take over, and note what we could gain from learning how they had formed their desire to replace the Soviet Union with their flawed system.\n\nIf we can ignite that same light of patriotism, not for Sablin, but rather for the people of Russia within the Union, then we have much to gain from this, comrades."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_sablin_desc: "While what Sablin did was an absolutely disgraceful betrayal of what the Soviet Union has stood for, it would be in our key interest to investigate his policies and possibly gain some benefit if applied.\n\nIt would be deemed necessary to implement some minor reforms that originated from Sablin's system in order to increase our popularity among his former supporters and make some usage out of the ideas he had fostered."
 IRK_postwar_rebuilding_our_legitimacy_desc: "The great and powerful Soviet Union has been shattered and we have all but disintegrated on the world stage - this is a catastrophe for every person within the Union.\n\nWe have been torn apart from the inside ever since the German invasion of our Union, falling apart piece by piece, until we have been diminished to our current state. But we won't give up so easily with such a set back. In order to accomplish our goals, our government's legitimacy must be restored, back to when we were truly recognized as the leaders of Russia!\n\nNo matter the means that we are to take our approach for the reclamation of the Union, we must regain our spot among the great powers once more and return the people of Russia to their rightful place on the world stage!"
 IRK_postwar_a_union_of_letters_desc: "Since the fall of our Union decades ago, opportunists, counter-revolutionaries, and fools alike have fought an unceasing war to destroy our legitimacy.The Sablinite rebellion was the last in a long line of betrayals and traitorous acts, each designed to lead the masses astray towards their own inevitable destruction.\n\nAfter so many brushes with annihilation, many in the presidium believe it is high time to turn inward. While we have always acted with their best interests at heart, It is clear that much of our population has lost faith in their government's ability to uphold the ideals of the revolution and provide for them.\n\nIn light of this, and in an attempt to expedite reintegration of the Buryat ASSR, we will begin a new campaign, one of \"1000 letters\".\n\nNamed after the 17th century \"republic of letters\", we will attempt to foster a similar culture of innovation. Open criticism in all levels of government will be encouraged, so long as it is constructive. Workers and Bureaucrats alike will be asked to mail in their thoughts and concerns regarding our reunification struggle.\n\nHopefully such actions will lead to an efficient administration, attraction of distant intellectuals, and a renewed sense of connection between the masses and their vanguard party."
 IRK_postwar_necessary_reforms_desc: "The 1000 Letters campaign has proven to be exceptionally fruitful! Peasants and bureaucrats alike have risen to the occasion, making use of this unique opportunity for critical expression directed to the presidium itself. We have received well over 1000 letters, each detailing workplace grievances and various administrative inefficiencies.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most encouraging result of our effort has been the expansion of legitimacy among the formerly rebellious Buryat ASSR. While it is true that the eastern shores of Lake Baikal were relatively timid in composing letters, those that we have collected have proven highly valuable. In addition, the lack of a crackdown upon those that spoke freely seems to have eased tensions. Acts of sabotage are steadily declining, and it appears we just might be able to deprogram those taken hostage by opportunism yet.\n\nNow comes the time of transformation. From words we have devised actions; Increases in low level pay, a tempered five year grain quota, and the closing of managerial loopholes. These programs, as well as other collected reforms, will soon be implemented to compound upon the trust we have built. Let us make haste."
 IRK_postwar_an_internal_affair_desc: "One of the core tenets of Leninism is the vanguard party. The party exists to protect the people from the capitalists, and help instill class consciousness. In order to achieve this goal, only the most educated and politically advanced people can run the higher functions of the state, not the average worker. To directly involve the people could risk needless inefficiency at a critical time, especially as we reorganize the Union. We must rely only on ourselves to reform the state, and not the people, as to maintain our Leninist ideals and prevent needless corruption, along with false consciousness, from ending the Union!"
 IRK_postwar_bolster_nkvd_presence_desc: "While we have managed to prevent ourselves from being conquered, the fact of the matter is that lawlessness is all too common here, especially in the outskirts of our territory, away from our centers of control. In order to rectify the situation, a decision has been made to increase NKVD patrols, and increase their presence in the outskirts. An open showing of security will force the criminals to retreat underground, and allow us to reassert our authority. Furthermore, we shall step up the duties of the NKVD from a law enforcement perspective, allowing them to assert their authority and beat back the lawlessness that has plagued our outer lands for too long!"
 IRK_postwar_a_peoples_union_desc: "For too long, the people of the USSR have seen the government as a distant and uncaring monolith. Such discontent with the system only breeds long-term issues, and it is a problem that we must solve. We must stress the idea that the Presidium and Yagoda care for the people, and the concept that it is the wellbeing of the people that comes first here in the Soviet Union. Speeches shall be conducted and propaganda to this end will be spread across our lands, but we must ensure that these are not empty words by actually supporting the people. It may be costly, but it will help us gain a sense of legitimacy, something that we need now more than ever."
 IRK_postwar_renew_central_authority_desc: "Even after the mutiny ended, there was still a large amount of discontent in the Buryatia territories. Furthermore, the mutiny required us to basically rebuild the bureaucracy, as we could not truly ensure the loyalty of many of the Buryatian bureaucrats. However, as we've increased patrols and begun the process of reintegrating, the discontent from Buryatia slowly died down, eventually dissipating entirely. Finally, our efforts have paid off, as the Buryatian lands have been fully reintegrated!"
 IRK_postwar_a_secure_union_desc: "The existence of the warlords throughout Russia has damaged many things, but perhaps the greatest thing lost is security. The people do not trust in our state's ability to ensure their safety anymore, which is truly disheartening. We need to show the people, through propaganda, speeches, and initiatives, that the USSR merely seeks to build socialism from within, nurturing it in order to protect the people. Furthermore, we must ensure the people understand that the Presidium, and Yagoda, do not exist just to be a distant ruler, but to ensure your safety and security in a time when that is all too rare. By increasing the rate of patrols throughout the cities, and having an increased presence of security in the countryside, we can hopefully express that yes, we will keep the people safe!"
 IRK_postwar_a_strengthened_mandate_desc: "It seems that all our efforts have paid off! The strengthening of security, combined with the propaganda showcasing the fact that the Presidium cares for the people, has allowed us to acquire a new mandate! The people trust us more and more, and believe that we are the best path forward for Russia. Even in Buryatia, the people now trust us over Sablin. This new sense of legitimacy means that we can embark on further efforts without having to worry about discontent from the people. The USSR may have been brought low, but we will restore its glory!"
 IRK_postwar_continuing_course_desc: "The safety of our Union was threatened by the revolt of the Sablinites. However, with their fall comes a new opportunity to strike out into our former territory. The time has come to once again set our eyes upon the motherland, and soon we will bring the light of socialist revolutionary power to the proletariat. Once the east is secured with our righteous fervor and might, we shall move deeper and deeper into our lost heartland, and drive the traitors who abandoned the Union back, either into retreat or into the ground. With the spirited guidance of the legitimate leader of the Union, Comrade Yagoda, our failure in the brutal conflicts to come is a near impossibility. The Rise of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will once again let us stand alone as a shining beacon in the darkness of this world."
 IRK_expansion_resecuring_our_hold_desc: "The restoration of the far east to our Union is paramount before we set our eyes westward to our beloved heartlands. To our east lie the lands of reactionaries and fascists. These are people who idealize the Russia of old, before the revolution. These are people who idealize the very system that brought our proud Union to its knees. This indignity cannot be allowed to stand. Through iron and fire we will show them that we are strong, that we have always been strong. From here to Kamchatka, our beloved socialist ideals will cause the hearts of the proletariat so wrongfully suppressed by the Fascists or the false Tsar to soar for the first time in years. To this end, the soldiers of the Union must be turned to men of iron. Their weapons must become the instruments of our revolutionary fire."
 IRK_expansion_mission_to_aldan_desc: "Years ago the partisans led by Gurzhap Ochirov in Aldan left our ranks with the idea that they could survive the wastes on their own. To their credit, order has been largely maintained within their little borders. The partisans seem to value their survival, and with the Sablinists taken care of, we are far better equipped to provide them with security in these dark times than any other power in Russia. That sentiment including themselves. An envoy should be sent with a message suggesting that the partisans acknowledge our claim over their lands and their citizens in return for friendship and a part in restoring the glory of the Union. Surely they will understand the gravity and importance of our cause when approached. If not, well, that bridge over a river of their own making can be crossed when necessary."
 IRK_expansion_a_negotiated_return_desc: "The Aldan partisans have sent their response and accepted our request to rejoin the Union and help return it to glory. Ochirov and his people have spent so long surviving on their own, and now we can offer them a better, safer way forward in these troubled times. A simple game of assurances of their leadership's safety and thinly-veiled implications of the consequences of non-compliance with the legitimate government of the land have won us this day and thousands of new comrades without a single drop of blood being spilled on either side. As their forces merge with ours a new song of cooperation faintly but firmly hangs on the air. The restoration of the glorious Union is a distant dream, but one that grows ever closer with every step along this path that we endeavor to take."
 IRK_expansion_our_northern_bastion_desc: "In the north lies a virtually unknown frontier where bandits and beasts alike stalk their prey. Every citizen of our Union that is beaten, robbed, or killed is a serious insult to every member of the Soviet Union. Our priority now that should be to transform the frontier into a veritable fortress against the northern wolves who might make victims of our citizenry. With enough men, guns, and concrete we can make sure that an assault from our north would be a fool's errand. Hopefully, with enough time and resistance to their excursions into our newly reclaimed territory, we may prove that they are fruitless efforts and stop them altogether."
 IRK_expansion_strike_at_the_traitors_desc: "Ochirov and his underlings have shown their lack of sound judgment once again by rebuking the entreaties of our messenger. He decided not to rejoin the Soviet Union as a brother and comrade in arms against the subversive forces that pillage our rightful homeland. Now we must take steps to liberate their citizens from under their small-minded boots. We must give the weak the protection that these Aldan partisans are unable to. Even if the citizens themselves do not believe in the necessity of these steps, we will show them the necessity with our own force of arms. After this, the citizens will be sure to support us as their hearts cry out to live under the banner of socialism once more whether they realize it or not. Comrade Yagoda has given the order, and thus we march to a song of reclamation and liberation."
 IRK_expansion_trials_for_the_partisans_desc: "Ochirov and the upper echelons of his command have been captured and publicly paraded to their imprisonment. The grave crime of betraying the Soviet Union in its time of most dire need must be addressed by our courts. In truth though, Comrade Yagoda has already decided their fate. The trials are a show, but a necessary one. Their cases are a coming storm that will shake the resolve of the less committed among us, but the strength and righteousness of our cause will be maintained through the silencing of their voices. No one may be allowed to subvert the truth of our cause with their rebellion, and an example must be made of those who would. A cacophony of gunshots ring through Irkutsk tonight. The short-sightedness of the so-called survivors has doomed them to an early grave."
 IRK_expansion_prepare_for_the_struggle_desc: "The final battle lies to the east of the Soviet Union, the fascists who lie on the coast, the access to the sea, the ports that were stolen from the people, backed by the god-forsaken Japanese to the south.\n\nBut that support no longer exists, that line is severed! People of the Soviet Union, begin to prepare, our destiny awaits, and it sits along the Siberian coast that borders the Pacific, our land that was taken from the people against their will, and used to fuel the disgraceful operations the fascists are doing!\n\nThis time, the people will remind the fascists where they belong, and the Soviet Union will make sure that they are sure of it, even if it means that we will point a gun barrel in their mouth to do so!\n\nIt is time to march east, and destroy the fascists once and for all."
 IRK_expansion_streamline_the_supply_chain_desc: "To fuel the reclamation of our former lands in the Far East, our supplies must be able to get to their necessary locations as smoothly as possible, and ideally without any interruptions or mishaps caused! Could you consider what would happen if our guns went into the hands of a would-be betrayer of the Revolution?\n\nGather the workers of the Union, and get them to work, and make sure these instructions are loud and clear: Build the roads that we will drive across! Construct the railroads we will deliver through! Standardize the equipment we will use! Prepare the infrastructure necessary to store supplies! The Soviet Union will gladly thank any comrade in the Revolution that helps to fuel the cause further. These distances across Siberia are vast, but with the help of the people, we can make them shorter!"
 IRK_expansion_dispatch_the_commissars_desc: "Our reclamations of the lands we lost may be fast, but we cannot know for sure that the lands that we take back for the people might contain fellow comrades following the Revolution. We need to make sure that the people who live in the land we take back will support us, and if that is not the case, we must send NKVD commissars into the field to ensure that!\n\nWhether that be through violent or more peaceful, 'convincing' measures, the people who reside within our newly regained territory cannot be people who have betrayed the Union! Fascists, Monarchists, Nazis and whatever else the people might have turned to, we need to make sure our lands are filled not with them, but with people of the Revolution, and of Communism!"
 IRK_expansion_ready_the_industry_desc: "Workers of the Union, be prepared! Our final fight of the Far East dawns upon us, a battle of liberating our fellow peers from the grasp of the Fascists to the East, while the army will fight them directly, the workers will be the ones to create the tools of war that will fuel the fight!\n\nWe need to get everything ready and in order, the production of guns that will be used to kill the enemies of the people must be kicked into high gear! The resources that will fuel the production of said guns will need to be extracted and processed! The factories that will house the creation of our weapons, we need every Soviet that is capable of working on the frontlines of industry!\n\nWhile the brave men on the frontlines against the Fascists will fight, the ones who will stay home and work in the factories will contribute to the fight just as much as the ones on the battlefield!"
 IRK_expansion_not_one_step_back_desc: "To the brave Soviets spreading the revolution back to the areas under the filthy fascists, remember, this is a fight the Union is not ready to lose, for the glorious revolution to succeed and for the will of the people to prevail over all others!\n\nNot a single step back will be permitted! No retreats, do not let the Fascists of the Far East win, we, the people, are ready to throw as much as we can at them just to prove that the Revolution is not the right bear to be messing with.\n\nIf this means we are sending our men to die in the fields of Siberia, then these men will be remembered as heroes of the Union! The ones who brought justice and liberated the workers suffering under the Fascists, and helped to restore the Union closer towards our former glory."
 IRK_expansion_the_far_eastern_campaign_desc: "Finally, with our industry prepared and our men ready to die for the good of the Revolution, there is only one step left. Advance! Move forward, soldiers of the Union, our test begins against the Fascists to the East, show them no mercy and slaughter them all!\n\nMarch forward into their houses of cards and knock them all over, kick the front doors of each and every one in and shoot the owners in the head! The Revolution returns to the Far East and we are ready to be here to stay, the people will show how they prevail without the need of turning to such disgusting ideologies, remind them all about how glorious Russia used to be under Communism!"
 IRK_expansion_operation_uranus_desc: "For the Union to begin flourishing again, we require sea access once more, and what better way to regain our access than to march East and eliminate the threats that reside along the coastline?\n\nThe people require their access to the coast of Siberia, and the fresh air of the Pacific Ocean, so that we may export the Revolution's influence further, while also gaining the ability for some import of necessary materials if need be...\n\nOur men and industry are ready, we must begin to draft our plans for Operation Uranus, it is a simple task - eliminate the army of our Eastern opponents, walk in and take it back for the Revolution, and capture their leader!\n\nAfter we have done as such, we can restore the old oblasts of before right where they belong, back into the hands of the people, and the eastern threat completely eliminated!"
 IRK_expansion_operation_miranda_desc: "While we were preoccupied with the treasonous revolters, the reactionary collaborationist factions to our east resolved their power struggle with violence. Now the \"moderate\" fascist Mikhail Matkovsky, a seasoned soldier against his own people, controls the coast under the mantle of a reformed Russian Fascist Party.\n\nMatkovsky's lack of principles are breathtaking; initially helping the Japanese oppress the people of the Far East, he has now painted himself as a loyal client of the United States. Not even an inch of the Soviet Union can be allowed to remain in the hands of fascist parasites. The NKVD will purge the Far East of these \"nationalist\" traitors and restore it to popular control."
 IRK_expansion_the_end_of_matkovsky_desc: "Our fight for the Far East has subsided at the moment. Mikhail Matkovsky and his fascist followers fought like cornered rats, but the streets of Magadan are now strewn with their bodies. At the moment, Matkovsky himself is alive in our custody. That shall soon change.\n\nThe leaders of the Russian Fascist Party will receive a trial befitting their betrayal of the Russian people. The prospective verdict and sentence are obvious, but the punishment of these traitors will be a fine example to anyone who even entertains their ideas. Anyone who puts the Soviet Union in jeopardy will be hunted down with prejudice and given exactly what they deserve."
 IRK_expansion_operation_ariel_desc: "The state of Chita sits to our East, and occupies territory that possesses resources vital to our needs. The solution is obvious and simple - Prepare the People's Army, prepare our guns, and march towards them and go to war!\n\nIt seems they need a reminder on how the Revolution always prevailed over the Russian monarchy, and so we must initiate Operation Ariel. The time has finally come to take back our rightful lands and confront the Monarchists hoping to restore the Tsar!"
 IRK_expansion_second_july_desc: "The Tsarists of Chita, while they may not be as evil as the fascists and nazis of the world, are still a roadblock in the Revolution, but the monarchy always leads to the will of the people taking over the country, just like how the people did in 1922!\n\nMikhail's government will be put on trial for betraying the Revolution and running back to those sad ideals such as Monarchism, and we will not be treating them any differently than we did the Romanovs back then! As for Mikhail, we will be giving him a...special trial.\n\nDown into the basement under the court he goes, with the barrel of a gun pointed at the back of his head, and with the fire of the gun, Mikhail is finally the Tsar of Russia he wished to be."
 IRK_expansion_operation_umbriel_desc: "The Bandit King of the Far East sits on one of the most important treasures to the Soviet Union, a treasure that they stole from us - Sea access, our access to the Pacific Ocean! A vital part if the Soviet Union is to ever rise from the ashes...\n\n...and like how the Bandit King stole from us, we will steal the rightful property of the PEOPLE back! The Soviet army will prepare for war against Amur, and the failures of Rodzaevsky will bite him, as the Soviet Union knocks on his door to eliminate his puny fascist state!\n\nWe will show no mercy, and we will eliminate their pitiful attempt at unifying Russia once and for all! Comrades, it is time for Operation Umbriel!"
 IRK_expansion_no_mercy_for_nazis_desc: "Rodzaevsky, the Bandit King, the leader of the now former state of Amur, betrayer of the Russian people and now, merely nothing but a rat under the thumb that represents the will of the people under the Revolution.\n\nWe cannot let the trial for Rodzaevsky's government go in their favour in any way, no matter how minor we let it. No, we will not allow the fascists to breathe for another day, we are the people of Russia, the Union! I say we show absolutely no mercy to the former government of Amur, we will make sure that absolutely no one leaves the trials without any punishment. If Rodzaevsky pushes his luck too far in the trial to prove his whatever nonexistent innocence he might claim...\n\nThe thumb that represents the will for the Revolution, and for justice for Russia, will crush the rat's skull with that same thumb."
 IRK_expansion_the_end_of_the_whites_desc: "The Whites, not content with their first loss to the Red Army, decided to avenge themselves on the people of Russia with the aid of fascist foreign powers. For well over a decade they ravaged the Far East, installing corrupt, thuggish governments that brutalized the working class. That era is over now. We, the Soviet Union's rightful successors, purged them just as fiercely as our predecessors purged their first generation.\n\nWith the region finally free of their taint, we can begin organizing and integrating their territories. Bringing back the old provincial boundaries and setting up local governments will make it almost as if the harsh years of fascist rule had never happened in the first place."
 IRK_expansion_operation_neptune_desc: "The area of Yakutia is one of potential vital importance to the development of the Soviet Union, providing us with the potential to gain many, many natural resources if we are to integrate them into our sphere, but we need to do it fast.\n\nThe fascists cannot be allowed to get to the diamond-producing state before we do! The precious resources that we could gather and use to help further move the Revolution into the future will be of spectacular importance to furthering our cause further, just as long as we can do it in time!\n\nWe will prepare the Soviet army to invade Yakutia, and we will begin to draft plans for a Sakha ASSR, once we have occupied the region, we must integrate it as soon as possible!"
 IRK_expansion_shining_bright_desc: "The Yakuts have been reintegrated into the Soviet Union, and with their liberation we have also rescued the fortunes hoarded by their deposed warlords. Famous for its massive diamond deposits, Yakutia is a mightily worthy prize for the General Secretary, and the proceeds of its riches could fund further campaigns across Siberia.\n\nYet, the General Secretary is a benevolent and caring leader, and always puts the interests of his people first. The riches won by Yagodia in Yakutia will go back to the Yakuts, helping to show the conquered people that they are not subjects of some new regime, but free people living in a strong state that looks out for the interests of its citizens."

We can simply knock on the door of whatever small building they have and point a gun at their leader's head, and they'll immediately surrender to us!\n\nThe Soviet Union will be glad to accept the people under the Mandate back into the Revolution, and to eliminate whatever small threat they may hold against us!

This is simply preposterous! We see again and again the results of an unguarded populace - the creation of reactionary regimes that have enslaved Mother Russia!

In a careful purge, the administration of the state now is left entirely to Yagoda and his allies, with the choice party officials that remain stuck in obsolete positions designed to keep them from true power. Now, with the USSR united politically and his preeminent rivals in ditches or the gulag, it is time for the dominant Yagoda to enact his philosophy, the Yagodaschina.\n\nTo epitomize Yagoda's beliefs in one word would be order.

Within the ranks of the NKVD there is a disease festering and growing, its malignance a hamper to the security of the Motherland and her loyal citizens! This was more than proven when thousands deserted the Union for that traitor Sablin. We must rip out this tumor from the ranks of the single most important organ of our administration and ensure it is unable to grow any stronger, preventing it from endangering the safety of our nation once again.\n\nTo be attacked are the issues of corruption and bureaucratic excess that have held back the NKVD from reaching the heights that we desire. A secret subcommittee is to be created to explore corruption, locating those who skim money off the top and target their political rivals. Lists of these individuals are to be sent to Yagoda for approval of their removal as part of the most recent purge. A separate subcommittee has been approved to investigate the issue of overwhelming bureaucracy, one that Yagoda firmly believes is paralyzing its effectiveness.

This has the two-fold effect of increasing loyalty as well as strengthening the security apparatus and expanding its reach.\n\nWhile rewards are given, it is important to ensure that previous issues with corruption are dodged, and so the subcommittee investigating corruption is to be maintained to ensure the integrity of the NKVD, and in turn, the security of the true successor to the Union."

In response to this, we have decided to consolidate our power and centralize the NKVD further, delegating less, ensuring that everyone is directly accountable, and putting our allies in positions of practical power while our enemies sit in prison at best and in meaningless offices at worst.\n\nCentral power and authority are key tenets of Yagoda's philosophy, and seeing it not fully carried out in his own base of power has made him suspicious that his government is not as unified as he thought he had made it.

A memorandum, suspiciously authored by some of Yagoda's close political allies, has suggested that the state, and therefore the NKVD, take closer and more hands-on control of these matters. Increased oversight as well as increased accountability has therefore been approved by the General Secretary's stamp and now all matters of state bureaucracy have been made openly available to the NKVD.\n\nThis will serve to increase our control over state affairs and create a more streamlined state approach. Corruption, excess, and waiting times will also all be cut down on as the aforementioned accountability forces public servants to not cut corners and work according to strict state deadlines. A culture of work, love of work, and fulfillment for state work will be fostered, and will be the backbone of a new nation."

In addition, those that show exemplary work in their respective fields are entitled to extra compensation in the form of non-monetary rewards, such as vacation time, watches, and even nicer apartments.\n\nThe cornerstone of this is to be the Antonovite Movement, so named after exemplary public worker Klavdiy Antonovich. He consistently shows an ability to organize the inner workings of the Union. His dedicated work is an example to all those who have the honor of offering their time in the support of the new Russian civil administration, and so he has been elevated to the head of the movement.

In the name of the Motherland our people march united, united in an unstoppable march of progress towards those bright horizons, where the light at the end of the tunnel lies.

One week a few token responsibilities would be transferred from the Premier to the Presidium, the next the army would gain a small measure of autonomy from the NKVD. Soon it was undeniable though. Yagoda's clique was losing control of the Union, and the more ideological members of the Presidium were stepping in to take charge. A silent, bloodless revolution was under way that would return the Soviet Union to Lenin's founding vision.\n\nWith their power now secure, the Presidium has drafted a bold set of new reforms to be implemented. From expanding voting rights to issuing universal identification, the party hopes to turn away from the cloistered dictatorship that Yagoda and the NKVD fostered. Under Lenin, the Union was strong and prosperous. Returning to his plan for Russia is the only way to reclaim all that has been lost."

 IRK_regional_a_return_to_leninism_desc: "When Bukharin took the reins after Comrade Lenin's death, no one could have guessed the consequences. The need for a strong state to guard the revolution was used as an excuse to establish a dictatorship more interested in maintaining power than advancing the revolution. Bukharin let the Union grow weak and failed to defend it when the Germans invaded. After Yagoda seized power the problems only worsened. He reduced the Union to nothing more than an NKVD client state that paid lip service to the revolution and nothing else.\n\nIt is far past time we returned to the original course Lenin set for us. There must be a true dictatorship of the proletariat, not simply a bourgeois dictatorship dressed in red. The liberation of the working class must always be at the forefront of our minds. This commitment to the revolution may not be popular with some of the old guard, but since when have revolutionaries cared what the bureaucrats think?"

 IRK_regional_sideline_the_state_desc: "The state faction, consisting of the NKVD, Yagoda's old guard, and the more conservative members of the Presidium, once ruled Irkutsk with an iron fist. Their pragmatism was essential to the Union's survival in the dark days that followed the collapse of the war against fascism, but now their time has passed.\n\nWith the Party consolidating its hold on the government, working across the aisle with those in the State faction is no longer necessary. We can begin relegating them to unimportant duties where they will be unable to obstruct our work. Many of our most talented bureaucrats and government workers are members of the State faction. The loss of their skills and experience will be something of a setback, but we cannot afford to have counterrevolutionaries sabotaging our government from within. Once we issue all of the reassignments the Party's control of the nation will be total, and the way forward to the Union's reclamation will finally be clear of internal obstructions."

They hold significant influence in the government, the party media, and in almost every industry in the state. While all of them are registered members of the Communist Party and claim to be dedicated revolutionaries, in practice they represent a new elite that rules over the workers while trying to run the nation for their own benefit. It is no surprise that the Nomenklatura are almost universally supporters of the State faction that would preserve the status quo they thrive in.\n\nIf we want to call ourselves a real revolutionary government, we have to put an end to this new bourgeoisie. There is no doubt that they will use their ample resources and influence to oppose us, or that purging so many experienced bureaucrats will hurt our administration, but these are the sacrifices a Leninist state must be willing to make to achieve a true communist society."
 IRK_regional_erode_the_security_edifice: "보안대 건물 잠식"
 IRK_regional_erode_the_security_edifice_desc: "Under Yagonda's rule the Soviet government became little more than a glorified rubber stamp, existing only to legitimize the real masters of the Union, the NKVD. Over the years the nation was transformed into a Securocracy, a government run by and for the intelligence services. Even as the NKVD-friendly state faction declines into irrelevance, many of the administrative structures and loopholes they put in place for Yagoda's henchmen remain.\n\nIf we eliminated these loopholes, it would go a long way towards relegating the NKVD back to its original purpose: protecting the revolutionary state, not controlling it. Reducing the NKVD's role in the government would also ease the administrative burden we are currently grappling with. Fewer people being consulted and improved delegation of responsibilities will make it easier for the Presidium and its agencies to take decisive action."

Since Lenin's original revolution there have always been people who refuse to accept our rule and attempt to disrupt our society, and there must be somewhere to send these people. During the reign of the NKVD the number of people sent to the gulags greatly increased, and many of those imprisonments were not justified. Men and women who were proud revolutionaries and dedicated members of the Communist party were imprisoned simply for questioning Yagoda and his allies. We must correct this.\n\nThe files of every political prisoner must be reviewed to see which ones are suitable for release. By officially redeeming these prisoners we will not only be regaining many bright minds and strong bodies that will serve the Union, but we will have earned their undying loyalty as their liberators."

Lenin called for a Dictatorship of the Proletariat, but this sort of dictatorship is not mutually exclusive with democracy. While the Communist party is the vanguard of the revolution and must always maintain control over the revolutionary state, a form of limited democracy within the party can be allowed.\n\nUnder this new system we will allow party members who have worked within the government for a minimum of 4 years and are found to be in good political and moral standing to vote on various matters. Of course, only communists will be allowed to vote and run for office, but even a limited form of democracy will prove to the people that we are not just another despotic government."

Their strong opposition to NKVD interference in their work made them our natural partners, but with our common enemy now reduced to irrelevancy, there is little left to unite us. To avoid allowing any distance to form between the Union's government and its military a few members of the Presidium have recommended striking a bargain with the commanders of the Red Army.\n\nThis deal would involve allocating more of the budget to the military to fund modernization efforts and improvements to the training curriculum. The generals have clamored for more funding for some time, and granting it to them will strengthen the bonds between the Communist party and the Red Army. It would also have the added benefit of strengthening our military for a future conflict, which seems likely if Russia is to be reunited."

We were told to stick to theorizing about the revolution and inspiring the masses to support the Union while they ran the show. They said we wouldn't know how to run a nation, and we would fail without them. We have proven them wrong.\n\nThere is no denying that at first there were difficulties. The bureaucracy had to be purged of those who tried to oppose us, leaving many of our departments gutted. The fact that we had just reclaimed a huge stretch of territory did not make establishing a new system any easier. But we learned as we went and we consolidated our control. Now our rule is unquestioned across all of eastern Siberia. Every town from Irkutsk to Kamchatka flies the red banner, knowing that they serve the Revolutionary state. Lenin's dream is not dead.

General Secretary Yagoda has triumphed over all of the combined forces of fascism, liberalism and anarchy that once beset his rule, and in doing so guaranteed the survival of the communist system he has helped to perfect. His enemies lie in graves, their ideas alongside them, and it is only a matter of time before all of Russia is reunified under the only true successor to the USSR. It is only a matter of time now before all of Russia from Vladivostok to Kiev is seized from its occupiers, and all the people of this great land saved from the enemies of the people that dwell within it.\n\nIt is not enough to say that the Soviet Union will merely survive this crisis: it will be strengthened by it. The rebirth of communism and the perfection of its form under Comrade Yagoda has rendered the system stronger and more proficient than ever before, ready and capable to both see to the needs of the people and to enact the destruction of their enemies. Our journey is far from over, but the ship of state is on the right course, and the best possible man to lead Russia and reforge the Soviet Union is secure at the helm. There is nothing that communism cannot overcome, no enemy that the Soviet Union cannot defeat, and no man that can stand in the way of the General Secretary any longer. Our victory is assured, but we are still earlier in our destiny, and there are many enemies yet to vanquish and struggles yet to suffer.

Peace and prosperity have returned to this war-torn land, and all across Siberia the people are celebrating our return to power.\n\nSome celebration is certainly due, but our task is far from over. To our west are traitors and warlords who seek to steal Russia for themselves. Beyond them lie the Nazis who still enslave many of our people.

The previous mixed system of rural agrarianism combined with the industrialization of urban centers is unfeasible within the present economic international realities. In fact, agriculture's contribution to an average country's GDP no longer constitutes the majority. The dominant economies of the world are approaching a new model largely oriented towards the service sector and the integration of recent technological development into praxis.\n\nWhat this means for us, simply speaking, is we need to catch up with the rest of the world. While some plans for rapid modernization have been outlined, it has been decided that the matter should rather be approached cautiously. Reckless transition straight to a service-based economy will only harm the Union in the long run. For now, we must go through an evolutionary path and focus on properly restarting the key industrial centers of the Far East."

However, many within the party are opposed to what they view as a betrayal of practices established by Bukharin, to whose Siberian Plan our government owes much of its current assets.\n\nTo prevent a disastrous split within the party, Comrade Yagoda has devised what he calls \"The Transitional Approach to Economics\". It has been described as a set of conceptual principles that pragmatically amalgamates major aspects of Lenin's and Bukharin's economic theories with Yagoda's own thesis. It declares the present state of the Union \"transitional\" between a market system and developed, \"true socialism\". Thus, it guarantees the position of both the state and private enterprise, satisfying both factions that have emerged over this dilemma, and bringing over the Age of Transition."

This will, naturally, rationalize the local management of the economy, increasing awareness of the problems in each given area.\n\nBut the greatest advantage of this policy, and the one we're after, is if we use the precedent of these zones' autonomous bureaucracies, we can establish separate economic legislation there. This would allow us to selectively loosen restrictions for foreign trade and investment, without compromising on greater national trade policies, while still bringing foreign capital to work developing our backward regions.\n\nConveniently, the region that would benefit most from this is the Pacific Coast with the zones there drawn around the urban ports, already promising centers of international trade."

And while the region has a proud history of brave settlers taming the frontier, and partisans fighting reactionary tyrants, it was regrettably neglected by previous instances of leadership. It was largely a backwater peripheral region in the days of the empire and was often underinvested into even by Lenin's administration. Comrade Bukharin did have plans for renovating its economy as part of the Siberian Plan, but they, regrettably, came to pass only partially, as the Union was ultimately shattered.\n\nThis centuries' worth of neglect's consequences are most prevalent in the transport sector of the economy. It has been, in fact, determined, that the regional industrial potential's greatest limit is the capabilities of the infrastructure, which are, even in the best cases, below satisfactory. Thankfully, the Transitional Approach takes transportation into account, with the new economic zones granted funds and economic authority to make the necessary investment in transportation facilities to achieve the goals set in the greater All-Union Plan."
 IRK_regional_form_the_special_economic_sectors: "특수 경제 부문 형성"
 IRK_regional_form_the_special_economic_sectors_desc: "Some of the economists within the government recently came up with an intriguing proposal. They suggest some regions be designated as \"Special Economic Sectors\", with free market-type regulations, flexible trade policy and tax incentives to promote the concentration of capital and technological investment.\n\nWhile initially proposed as an alternative to Economic Zoning, this initiative gained traction within the party, with pushing for adopting both policies alongside each other, arguing there would be mutual benefit from cooperation between the two new types of economic autonomies. Comrade Yagoda sees no reason to object."
 IRK_regional_invite_boeing: "보잉 초대"
 IRK_regional_invite_boeing_desc: "Among the foreign corporations who expressed interest in allocating some of their assets to the new sectors provided for investments by our Union, the Boeing Company seems to be the most indecisive, which has caused considerable difficulties due to our own aviation industry being quite underdeveloped. While the large distances between our urban centers create a sizable civilian aviation market and the applications of their military developments are obvious, the world's largest aerospace contractor sits on the fence, reluctant to cooperate with us.\n\nEvidently, the entrepreneurs behind Boeing distrust the proclamation of the Transitional Approach that we made. As the policy is nominally a temporary measure, it deters them from investing, fearing they would lose the funds when the transition to a fully state-controlled socialist model comes in the future. We must convince them, along with various other investors, that we are not planning on returning to War Communism anytime soon, and that their investments in the future of our Union will pay off."
 IRK_regional_a_rival_for_the_sphere: "공영권의 경쟁자"
 IRK_regional_a_rival_for_the_sphere_desc: "One key factor that many analysts and economical theorists of the Union have continuously brought up since the time of the Far East's reunification, is the greater international picture we now find ourselves in. Our main concern is the imperialist ambition of Japan, over the years culminated in the foundation of the so-called 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' - a periphery of satellite states clearly aimed at the exploitation of their resources and peoples by Tokyo. Unfortunately, as the dominant power in Asia, their empire theoretically enjoys a degree of influence and might far above the Union's.\n\nHowever, in actuality, the Sphere is a crumbling structure, built to inspire awe, but not to last. Recent developments have shown, that its diplomatic alienation deprived it of developed trading partners, which in combination with bureaucratic incompetence has significantly damaged the Sphere's economic potential, to the point where we can directly compete with them on the international stage.\n\nBy putting our efforts towards actively toppling Japan from its seat of economic power in Asia we can both benefit from replacing that position ourselves, and undermine one of our most dangerous regional competitors. After that, the bright future of our Union's economy shall be all but assured."
 IRK_regional_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan: "시베리아 계획의 메아리"
 IRK_regional_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "After a series of debates, including those on the role of the state in the economy, the anti-Bukharinist revisionist demagogues have been exposed and denounced by those truly loyal to the Party and its efforts in building socialism! The New Economic Policy has once rebuilt the Union from the devastation brought by the Civil War. It will rebuild the Union again from the ruins of a collapsed Russia!\n\nIt has thus been decided, that the Siberian Plan, which was aimed at developing the economy of the region after the union's government was forced to relocate east, shall be continued, albeit with a few corrections. Notably, with the party's main target being the complete reunification of lost territories, noticeably major share of investment is to be devoted to military production and heavy industry."
 IRK_regional_import_industrial_machinery: "산업 기계 수입"
 IRK_regional_import_industrial_machinery_desc: "As the old Siberian Plan mostly centered the state investments on heavy industrial buildup, our present economic apparatus shall toe this line. However, it faces a series of problems, the most important of which is the loss of a considerable amount of industrial equipment over the process of collapse and the subsequent restoration of soviet power in the Far East.\n\nWhile the existing production complex can be rerouted towards the machine industry to replace the absent pieces of machinery, it would completely derail the plan and serve as a completely irrational waste of resources. It has instead been decided to import the missing parts of the production cycle so that the domestic industry can focus on the original goals of the economic plan."
 IRK_regional_lessons_from_manchukuo: "만주국의 교훈"
 IRK_regional_lessons_from_manchukuo_desc: "The Japanese client state of Manchukuo to our south has historically been surprisingly developed, being at one point the third dominant industrial power in East Asia after Japan itself and the old Union. While the roots of this lie in Japan pumping resources and capital into its puppet state, their management of such resources presents a curious case.\n\nWhile retaining the core tenets of fascist state-monopolistic capitalism, the 'Manchurian Model' as it came to be known largely managed to avoid bureaucratic stagnation through rationalization of management, which allowed for the state to exercise its powers for the optimization of the wartime economy. This is especially evident in sectors of Manchukuo's heavy industry, which at times outperform those of Japan. While we won't resort to copying fascists, the Manchurian Model does illustrate a few principles we can learn from, primarily in the sphere of streamlining bureaucracy."
 IRK_regional_the_shipyards_of_amur: "아무르 조선소"
 IRK_regional_the_shipyards_of_amur_desc: "When we defeated the fascist clique of Amur, we reclaimed the small coastal town of Chumikan, long occupied by their so-called \"All-Russian Government\". While the most recent records we have from 1939 list it as barely more than a fishing village, it seems that Rodzaevsky's bandits developed its port out of necessity, so that the Japanese could properly supply their lapdogs with equipment and provisions. Fortunately, this crude transport hub can be repurposed into a proper trading port and shipbuilding facility.\n\nWhile the ports of Magadan and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky could fulfill the task already, they are poorly connected with the regional center. Additionally, sub-optimal climate may render them unusable over the cold period of the year. Thus, Chumikan has been designated as the 'most economically viable port', and is to be developed accordingly, so that our Union can establish a naval presence in the Okhotsk sea, challenging the crumbling Japanese hegemony."
 IRK_regional_develop_the_aerospace_industry: "항공우주 산업 개발"
 IRK_regional_develop_the_aerospace_industry_desc: "Since the pitiful defeat of the old Union at the hands of the fascist hordes, who truly demonstrated the full potential of aviation - the third dimension of warfare, many have expressed their desire to invest in the aviation industry. However, with the relocation to Siberia, we lost much expertise, and now is the first time we find our industry capable of rearming the air force up to modern standards.\n\nWhile the production base is already capable of producing airplanes, the main challenge we are posed with is the lack of technological insight. To remedy this, a curious proposal has been made by a group of theorists. It includes various projects aimed to increase cooperation between the military and the scientific complexes, to ensure that the Union will reach the skies, and perhaps, one day, the stars."
 IRK_regional_the_resources_of_siberia: "시베리아의 자원"
 IRK_regional_the_resources_of_siberia_desc: "History shows that many nations' efforts to industrialize were hampered by lack of a resource base. Some lacked the metals for heavy machinery, some were short on fossil fuels to supply factories. Fortunately, our Union finds itself fully supplies itself from the inexhaustible riches of Siberia.\n\nWhile a point has been made that a full-scale resource-based economy would be harmful in the long term, it's simply foolish to ignore the deposits of raw material that could become our primary source of income. And although it is universally agreed that the economy should be diversified, investments into resource gathering operations have been found necessary to supply our industrial complex in the process of modernization."
 IRK_regional_investments_for_the_peasants: "농부들을 위한 투자"
 IRK_regional_investments_for_the_peasants_desc: "While the party might be split over the question of what role should the state have in the process of industrialization, it is largely united when it comes to policies required to revitalize the agriculture of the Union.\n\nThough the present Economic Plan is largely centered around industrial development of urban centers, the quotas for predominantly agrarian rural areas have gone up as well, and several initiatives for intensification of their economies have already come up. One more ambitious proposal is to revive the Machine-Tractor Stations - local enterprises for ownership and maintenance of agricultural machinery, established in the late 1920s. These will allow the underperforming Sovkhozes to modernize with state investment, leading to a considerable increase in agricultural output."
 IRK_regional_compromise_on_imports: "수입품에 대한 타협"
 IRK_regional_compromise_on_imports_desc: "Ever since the bitter defeat of the Union and its relocation to Siberia, the question of protectionism dominated the disputes regarding matters of Soviet agriculture. With the soils of the Far East are far from fertile, especially when compared to fields of the Russian Plain, a certain amount of products will have to be imported, potentially harming local production.\n\nNow, with the Far East reunified under the rightful authority of comrade Yagoda's government, this question rises again. Fortunately, the Union's economists have found a compromise solution. It calls for a complex system that ensures import contracts are scaled in accordance with the fulfillment of the economic plan. This policy, if streamlined properly, will encourage domestic production of goods that would otherwise be imported without devolving into outright autarky."
 IRK_regional_the_paris_of_siberia: "시베리아의 파리"
 IRK_regional_the_paris_of_siberia_desc: "The city from which we reunified the Far East, Irkutsk, has a glorious history and was one of the most developed even before the old Union's demise. However, what once was known as the Paris of Siberia has come to be in a state of disarray. Many of its buildings are not up to present standards, its streets unoptimized for modern traffic movement, its universities, and industries archaic and obstructing the greater economic plans we have for the region.\n\nIt seems, that much like its namesake in 1853, the Paris of Siberia will require a series of renovations to become a modern urban center. While some comrades suggest postponing it until we again control all of Russia, Comrade Yagoda has ultimately decided that this renewal will be vital to the process of reunification itself and authorized to start it sooner rather than later."
 IRK_regional_urban_development_initiatives: "도심지 개발 구상"
 IRK_regional_urban_development_initiatives_desc: "With the recent drive to renovate Irkutsk, plans for similar projects in other cities of the Far East have been brought up by regional committees and individual urbanists of our union. While the present situation necessitates the majority of them to be put off, some of the ideas concerning major centers have been cautiously accepted by the according authorities.\n\nThese initiatives cover mostly matters of infrastructure, ensuring both better transportation within the cities and between them. A few of the accepted projects also deal with the education system, aiming to enhance its facilities to prepare a future scientific base for the Union."
 IRK_regional_redirect_the_transsib: "시베리아 철도 재조정"
 IRK_regional_redirect_the_transsib_desc: "One problem we face when managing urban developments is the Trans-Siberian Railway. While it's existence is greatly beneficial as the main axis of transportation between the cities of the far East, the TransSib only covers the southernmost areas of the Union, economically alienating areas unconnected to it, including the prosperous ports on the Okhotsk sea and resource-rich inland districts of Yakutia.\n\nWhile Sakha's oil and gas reserves need little more than pipeline, for Magadan, de-facto our main port, a railway connection is vital. Thus it has been found necessary to start constructing a new branch of the TransSib, going North, along the Pacific coast. While extending a railway through the depths of Siberia is no easy task, and some are already dubbing it \"The Construction Project of the Century\" due to the difficulties of the initiative, the task itself should be relatively simple to achieve."
 IRK_regional_invest_in_egalitarian_schooling: "평등적 학교 투자"
 IRK_regional_invest_in_egalitarian_schooling_desc: "It has become evident over the course of reunification, that in modern warfare, military technological developments significantly influence the outcome of the conflict. Many theorists within the party have thus turned their minds to optimizing scientific output to further the reclamation of Russia by utilizing new, advanced armaments, and ensure our Union's prosperity thereafter by developing civilian-applied technology.\n\nOne obvious method for that is to develop the Academia extensively, through the recruitment of new scientists. It has thus been found detrimental, that in the spirit of proletarian egalitarianism, potential intellectuals of all sexes, nationalities, and backgrounds should be provided the necessary education and resources to conduct research for the benefit of the Union. If we are to achieve this, first we must direct our efforts towards eliminating the few remaining prejudices of the education system. For instance, \"Minority talent initiatives\" can be used to educe those of ethnicities typically glossed over by higher learning."
 IRK_regional_education_is_the_future: "교육이 미래다!"
 IRK_regional_education_is_the_future_desc: "What little flaws the education system once had, we have eliminated! Thanks to our efforts of both realizing the Marxist principle of equality and enhancing the quality of education in our universities and life in our cities, the Union is entering a new age of knowledge and higher learning. Soon, even the most optimistic predictions will be surpassed, and soviet society will truly enter the technological age!\n\nOf course, this Utopia of the proletarian mind will not come by on its own. The academia must double their efforts on the cultural and scientific front of the revolutionary struggle, and with their sweat, a new future of the people will be forged. As such, the Union collectively and its' every citizen individually must strive to better their education, for it is the future!"
 IRK_regional_the_soviet_armed_forces: "소비에트 연방군"
 IRK_regional_the_soviet_armed_forces_desc: "When Voroshilov and his sycophants elected to cower in Arkhangelsk instead of joining the Presidium's evacuation to Irkutsk, the Soviet Union's hammer and sickle found itself without a hammer for the first time since the Revolution. Gone were its proud tank corps, artillery battalions and air wings - presuming the general's vainglory, all rent into bone fragments and scrap metal along the A-A Line. Subsequent struggles against reactionaries and revisionists further chipped away at the armed forces until only what remained of the NKVD and its auxiliaries flew the Red Army's tattered banners.\n\nSuffice to say, the Union has recaptured much of its glory since. Its reinvigorated position in the Far East has broadened our options for likewise restoring the Red Army's invincible might. Yet we must not dally in doing so, for Comrade Yagoda eyes westward greater threats to the revolution than bandits and petty warlords. These states' armies will offer us no respite or quarter.\n\nIn due time, neither shall we to them."
 IRK_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution: "혁명의 수호자들"
 IRK_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "The Red Army has never strayed from its principles despite its diminished state. Great Lenin sounded the call for a people's militia, intrinsically intertwined with the class-conscious, to protect the revolution; hence did our generals raise militiamen from Moscow to Irkutsk. Their bayonets were rusty, their rifles antiquated, and their ranks a far cry from the thousand battalions of Premier Bukharin's time - yet the Union's conscripted soldiery have nevertheless protected our proletariat as an old buckler shields its owner from cuts and crippling blows.\n\nWith the new glut of resources at the Union's disposal, we can now reforge our worn, splintered buckler into the unbreakable aegis that it once was. Soon the Red Army shall meet its foes with tanks, automatic weapons, and fresh divisions of disciplined fighting men."
 IRK_regional_a_coequal_branch: "동등한 부서"
 IRK_regional_a_coequal_branch_desc: "No matter the fortunes which had befallen our Union, the good men and women of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs never strayed from its side. They had loyally fulfilled their duties since the October Revolution and continue to fulfill their duties even when threats flank the Motherland's every vulnerability. So strong is the NKVD's sense of purpose that it even preoccupies itself with responsibilities beyond its charter, like supplementing the Red Army's equipment and manpower with its own.\n\nIt would be remiss of us not to acknowledge their loyalty simply because our situation has improved. Hence, the Presidium of the Soviet Union has decreed the formalization of the NKVD's de facto status as a separate branch of the Soviet Armed Forces. With this elevation comes a secure place in the Union's annual defense budget in addition to a large say over military affairs - appropriate recompense for a state organ that has proven its worth time and again."
 IRK_regional_trust_in_the_army: "군에 대한 신뢰"
 IRK_regional_trust_in_the_army_desc: "Midday in the snowy plains of Siberia. A Guards battalion spots ramshackle hovels clustered a distance away. Colonel and staff consult HQ's maps - a village, barely a dot, beside the route to their rendezvous point. The men decide to approach, introduce themselves to its elders, perhaps secure provisions to supplement their rations. They expected a welcome conferred to liberators - like in the trickles of Suvorov that made the trek to the distant East.\n\nThe battalion departed with neither welcomes nor provisions an hour later. Bloodshot stares behind rotting wood frames trailed their silhouettes until the horizon swallowed the column whole.\n\nMany more units report similar stories throughout our broad westward front. Each lend credence to an issue heretofore unaddressed: that the people have become so inured to warlordism as to treat any armed formation, even their own protectors, like common marauders. We must address this somehow."
 IRK_regional_recentralize_the_armed_forces: "군부 재중앙화"
 IRK_regional_recentralize_the_armed_forces_desc: "Delegating control of the Red Army's operational tempo to the frontline formations' field officers, rather than an all-seeing general staff, may have sufficed when its greatest engagements consisted of glorified skirmishes, raids and counter-raids against bands of organized thugs. Or when fronts could be measured in hundreds of meters, not miles. Or when signals equipment were worth their weight in gold for how few remained after years of combat losses and neglect.\n\nThese conditions have changed - and not necessarily for the better. Comrade Yagoda clamors for war against warlords our equals in strength and resources, and whose borders likewise equal Russia's breadth. The Comrades Field Marshal believe there is no better time than now to reassert high command's supremacy over the battlefield; doing so, they advise, will allow the Red Army to conduct operational art on a scale unseen since the Great Patriotic War."
 IRK_regional_hybrid_training_programs: "복합적 훈련 계획"
 IRK_regional_hybrid_training_programs_desc: "With new equipment comes new problems, as quartermasters and strategists are wont to say. Ours now suffer this peculiar curse with the reintegration of old luxuries - heavy armor and air support, in particular - into their divisions. Like a dilapidated truck left to gather dust for lack of fuel forgets how to combust its engine, the Red Army has forgotten how to fight like a proper modern army.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense has begun addressing this issue twofold: first, by expanding the Union's military academies so to accommodate lessons in tank and aerial warfare; and second, by organizing exercises which involve elements from all branches of the Soviet Armed Forces acting in tandem. Practice makes perfect; so too will it make an invincible force in the Union's hands."
 IRK_regional_tactical_reassessments: "전술적 재평가"
 IRK_regional_tactical_reassessments_desc: "When the Red Army's largest formations shrank from military districts to half-strength divisions, its planners emphasized small-unit combat over simultaneous, front-wide attacks. When the Red Army's air wings plummeted one by one in Barbarossa, its planners disregarded air power as a force multiplier altogether. And when the Red Army's heavier assets - tanks, helicopters, artillery - either stayed behind in the Urals or defected during the Siberian War, its planners utilized trucks with small arms to great extents. Shifting circumstances, after all, warrant a shift in priorities.\n\nNow the Soviet Union has regained much of the factories it had lost. Rearming our divisions with armor and fire support will take time, but the average division will eventually enjoy unprecedented levels of available firepower. We should reprioritize our war plans accordingly."
 IRK_regional_focus_on_equipment_quality: "질적 장비 집중"
 IRK_regional_focus_on_equipment_quality_desc: "Our desperate straits following the Siberian War reflected aptly on the Red Army's equipment: a haphazard mix of rifles, pistols, and support guns, some of which may have seen service in the Siege of Peking. Fortunately, the warlords that had surrounded the Union then were in no better condition.\n\nThis becomes less true as we push west, where the men will confront armies fed either by Siberia's industries or the trans-Ural's ample stockpiles. The Presidium, under Comrade Yagoda's advice, has given the Ministry of Defense Industry a mandate to mass-produce quality weapons for the Red Army's use. In this they will be assisted by near-every factory our divisions reclaim."

 IRK_regional_imports_from_the_west_desc: "No matter what the apparatchik boast, reactivating the Soviet Union's full industrial might takes both preparation and no small amount of time - time which the Red Army cannot spare if it intends to war with the western warlords at the soonest possible date. We invite stresses to the tenuous logistics networks we've established by committing to such a schedule... but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found a temporary solution.\n\nThe ports of the Far East - Magadan, Petropavlovsk, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur - are open for trading with the United States and its allies. Their boundless industries had supplied the Union's forces during the Great Patriotic War. Perhaps we should consider revisiting this old relationship?"

 IRK_regional_procure_antitank_equipment_desc: "Our men are steadfast, tough, and hardy in battle! In the face of armored units or hardened fortifications, however, these traits mean nothing. If our men can't damage these hardened targets, we will not be able to engage enemy armor on equal footing. Fortunately, there are many stockpiles of anti-tank weapons that have not yet been exploited. We need to go out and collect as many of these weapons as we can for our fledgling army."
 IRK_regional_asymmetrical_strategies: "비대칭 전략"
 IRK_regional_asymmetrical_strategies_desc: "Conventional warfare in Siberia is nearly impossible for us to wage. The frontlines are simply too long for the amount of soldiers we are able to field. Mobile units able to act on their own will be what wins the day for us.\n\nAble to coordinate over the endless tundra, our men will be trained to fight in the harsh, barren conditions. Hit and run tactics will be emphasised, and our men will be taught how to operate effectively in small units. As we have for years, we must make do with what we have, and perfecting our use of asymmetrical tactics will give us a much needed edge over the other warlords."
 IRK_regional_partition_the_army_commissariat: "군 정치장교단 분할"
 IRK_regional_partition_the_army_commissariat_desc: "One of our biggest issues is organizing our armed forces. Footmen aren't just expected to garrison towns or be on standby incase of attacks, but also procure their own equipment, maintain their own gear, buy and prepare their own food, and so on. There are no specialized units in our armed forces to supply our men. While acceptable for a small warlord, this situation is unacceptable; we will never be able to reclaim our homelands with our army in such a disorganized state!\n\nWe need a specialized logistics branch in our army. We need men who know how to procure equipment and transport it to men in faraway places. We need specialized trainers, mechanics, and medics! Every man will have purpose in our army, which will great increase our fighting effectiveness."

It has never been because we haven't wanted to, we simply never had the planes to justify the costs.

Why allow our enemies the chance to bomb our men on the ground in the first place?\n\nOur air marshals are pushing the policy of air supremacy for our newly organized airforce. Domination of the skys is key to winning wars in the modern age, as the Nazis know all too well.

With our hold over the Far East secure the time has come for the Soviet union to formally re-enter the world stage. Though much of our union remains in the hands of warlords and traitors, we cannot wait for total reunification before reaching out to potential allies and partners.\n\nRussia has suffered from diplomatic isolation for too long. As the home of the workers' revolution, we must lead by example. We cannot set an example for the workers of the world if we are seen as just another warlord, rather than the legitimate successor to Bukharin's Soviet Union.

 IRK_regional_develop_the_merchant_marine: "상선단 개발"
 IRK_regional_develop_the_merchant_marine_desc: "The first step of rejoining the international community will be engaging in international trade. Siberia is a rich region with bountiful resources that many foreign nations are eager to have access to. The north does not provide everything we need, however, which is why it is more important than ever that we trade with the outside world to import important materials like rubber. Some might say doing business with capitalist empires is a betrayal of the revolution, but the revolution won't get very far if our trucks don't have wheels.\n\nTo facilitate opening trade with the outside world, we have arranged for the purchase of 100 merchant vessels suitable for hauling large amounts of cargo. With this fleet we can kickstart a new soviet merchant marine and import all the resources we could ever need."

 IRK_regional_peaceful_coexistence_desc: "Our end goal might be global revolution, but for the moment it is just not practical to pursue this. The world is dominated by three giants, America, Germany, and Japan. Of the three, Germany is clearly the biggest threat. While America and Japan embody corrupt capitalism and tyrannical imperialism respectively, they hate the Germans almost as much as we do, so we will tolerate them for the moment.\n\nThe word allies is too strong for what we want. A better term might be collaborators. America and Japan would benefit from a strong Russian nation to oppose Germany, and we would benefit from foreign aid for our quest to retake the Union. As long as this state of affairs continues, it makes more sense for us to pursue peaceful relations until we are prepared for a more direct confrontation."

We fought on the same side of the last war, and unlike the Japanese the Americans did not seize part of our nation. While the United States supported the facist traitors in Magadan, we understand neither option is perfect, and between bourgeois capitalists and warmongering fascists, the choice is obvious.\n\nTo be more practical about it, the USA is an industrial and economic colossus. Aligning with them, even temporarily, would open doors to all sorts of arms deals and development plans the Japanese could never hope to finance. The time has come to rebuild the alliance that came so close to defeating fascism 30 years ago. We must send a delegation across the vast Pacific to tell the Americans that they can still count on the Soviet Union to stand with them against fascism. We have their back, just as long as long as they have ours."
 IRK_regional_request_american_recognition: "미국 승인 요청"
 IRK_regional_request_american_recognition_desc: "The United States recognized the Soviet Union's rule in 1933, opening the possibility of diplomacy and trade between our two nations. While that recognition technically stands as the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic is the legitimate continuation of the USSR, to say there have been some complications in our diplomatic status would be an understatement.\n\nOur emissaries in the USA report that the American government is conflicted over who to recognize as the legitimate government of Russia, as several strong contenders have emerged in recent years. A gentle reminder that they recognized us over 30 years ago, along with a request that they renew that recognition would significantly boost our credibility in the eyes of the Russian people. We must show the Americans that the upstart states to our west are nothing more than glorified warlords, and dealing with them would be a mistake."

We shall send a request for funding from the OFN to help train and equip our army.\n\nWith the backing of America and her allies, or armies will be unstoppable. Our soldiers will take to the field using the most modern weapons and equipment. No tank or plane produced in Russia in the last two decades can rival its American equivalent.

They are fascists who openly allied with the Germans in the last war and seized Vladivostok and our territory along the Amur while we had our backs turned. We have every reason to view them as an enemy, and if circumstances were different we almost certainly would. Times have changed, however. Now the fascists are at each other's throats, and while the Japanese stole a city, the Nazis took so much more than that.\n\nOn a practical level, it makes more sense to align with the Japanese than the Americans. Japan wants to see a strong, anti-German Russia as much as America does, but it is geographically closer and far more capable of providing direct support to us. We must set our differences aside, at least for the moment, and focus on the true threat."

 IRK_regional_mission_to_tokyo_desc: "Establishing a close relationship with the Japanese Empire will be no easy feat of diplomacy. The entire Japanese government is an imperial cult which is rightly afraid of our revolutionary ideology. It will take lots of work by our diplomats and negotiators to find an opening just to begin discussions. Only then will we be able to show that we are truly interested in setting aside ideology and focusing on pragmatic cooperation.\n\nOur best opening strategy will be a Soviet diplomatic mission right to the heart of the Empire. In Tokyo, our diplomats will be able to meet with their Japanese counterparts as well as influential politicians and military leaders. Once these connections are made we can begin strengthening our ties. Trade deals, embassies, joint development projects, the list of opportunities goes on and on."

 IRK_regional_expand_manchurian_trade_desc: "With the Japanese now more willing to do business, we can finally start to benefit from their support. Our nation is positioned on the edge of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the largest economic bloc in the world. While becoming too integrated into it would see us reduced to nothing more than puppets of Japan, doing business with the members of the sphere would be an enormous boost to our economy.\n\nTo our south lies the Empire of Manchukuo, Japan's pet project and a burgeoning industrial powerhouse. The Japanese have poured enormous resources into building up Manchukuo's heavy industry, and we stand to benefit from our proximity. We have abundant natural resources that we could trade for finished products. A deal with the Manchurians, along with developing overland connections between our nations is exactly what we need to kickstart the Union's economy in preparation of the reclamation."

 IRK_regional_sponsor_the_proletarian_movement_desc: "Across the world the proletariat still struggles under the oppressive rule of their masters, whether they be bourgeois capitalists or literal slavers. Without the Soviet Union, there was no strong nation to act as the guardian of the workers of the world. For three decades tyrants around the globe took advantage of our absence, abusing and exploiting the lower class.\n\nBut now we are back.\n\nOur financial and political resources are not what they once were, but they are now enough we can resume our support for socialist movements in foreign countries. While we struggled to reclaim our nation from fascists and traitors several other nations around the world took up the revolutionary banner in our absence. We should welcome them into the fold and begin working towards an international organization of socialist nations."

 IRK_regional_revolutionary_aid_funding_desc: "As part of our campaign to increase diplomatic ties between the socialist nations of the world, we must provide a good reason for socialist nations to work together, and more importantly, work with us. The best way to incentivise loyalty and cooperation is with generous amounts of international aid. Some might call this bribery, but that is preposterous. Bribes go to corrupt politicians, while this aid will be going to socialist leaders who stand in solidarity with the proletariat.\n\nBy targeting our donations to specific parties and causes that align with our interests, we can encourage our fellow socialist nations to follow our lead and discourage deviation from the path we have chosen. After all, the Soviet Union was the first nation to embrace the revolution. It is our job to set the course and to make sure the other revolutionary states stick to it."

By creating a system of permanent embassies, each staffed by trained diplomats, we will open up the possibility of ongoing negotiations and communication between socialist governments. Embassies will also allow for more nuanced diplomatic tactics. The Cubans do things very differently than the Russians, and while a delegation to Havana might suffer from culture shock, an embassy there could hold Soviet emissaries who have spent years familiarizing themselves with the island and its people. The same is true for nations from South America to Europe to Asia.\n\nEstablishing a new socialist embassy system is an instrumental step to creating a global proletarian alliance. We should send this proposal to our prospective allies as soon as possible. The longer we delay, the more time we give the fascists and capitalists to sabotage our plans."

The Japanese colonization of Korea is a tragedy that began in 1911 and has not ceased since. Not only are the Japanese attempting to erase the culture of the Korean people, but they are ruthlessly oppressing the workers of Korea and exploiting them for their labour. They are not unopposed, however. In Northern Korea the NAJUA, led by the freedom fighter Kim Il Sung continue the struggle for Korean independence.\n\nComrade Kim is a proud communist and a shining example of commitment to the revolutionary struggle. If we were to coordinate international support for the NAJUA from socialist nations, it would serve as an excellent show of our diplomatic potency and the strength of cooperation. This act of solidarity with the Korean people will endear us to all who struggle for freedom across the world."

It is time to unveil the culmination of our diplomatic efforts.\n\nWe will recreate the International as a new political and military alliance that will span across the entire world. This alliance of socialist and communist parties from around the globe will promote the revolutionary cause and fight against fascist and capitalist tyranny wherever they are found. The oppressors of this world will quake in fear when they hear of this new alliance. They have fought so hard to divide us, for they know that together we are stronger than them.

Four imposing figures wearing white camouflage coats and brandishing assault rifles began loudly demanding everyone in the room to surrender their arms. His heart sank as he recognized the badges on their hats. The NKVD had come for him. \"I'll never surrender, you bastards!\" the young officer boldly shouted at the assailants as he drew his sidearm. He scarcely had the chance to aim before the soldiers unleashed a vicious storm of lead, gunning down every man in the room besides Popov. Ears ringing and vision blurred by the blood of his comrades, the disoriented colonel felt his knees give in. The last thing he remembered seeing that night was the attackers' shadows looming closer and closer."

 IRK.5.desc: "The past decades have been an unrelenting disaster for true patriots of the motherland. Revolutionary morals, values paid for dearly in the tight streets of Leningrad and the long rails of Novosibirsk, have not been sufficiently practiced or defended.\n\nThe results are cataclysmic. From bickering politicians who refused to act in the face of fascist bandit armies, to the near collapse against the counter-revolutionary republicans in the 50s- much has been lost. Millions of lives have been sacrificed unwillingly by those who would dare to neglect the lessons of the October Revolution.\n\nThe Buryat 'Sablinites' are next in the long line of this ideological rot. It is a rot that has clearly spread beyond control, as Valery Sablin himself was once a promising NKVD commissar. After being foolishly entrusted to organize labor in the construction of hydroelectric power near lake Baikal, he seized a radio tower to spew his utopian, convenient revisionism.\n\nYagoda and the loyal remnants of the Presidium bear a gargantuan weight upon their shoulders. Years of defeat have left the Union crippled, and its people susceptible to opportunists and liars. It is all too possible that this burgeoning rebel army could spiral out of control, and spell doom for the last remnant of order and legitimacy in this Russian chaos. The scared peasants who tremble beneath Sablin's lies must be convinced to return to their senses, and the conniving men who lead them must be brought to swift justice."

On this occasion, however, the task was not as soul-grinding as usual, for each report painted small fragments of a much larger, optimistic picture: all of Yagoda's plans and hard work were finally coming together. One report stated clearly that any lingering Sablinite influence in Irkutsk had seemingly dissipated for good. It seems that all of the investigations and purges had borne fruit after all. Even now Yagoda couldn't help but feel remnants of anger and betrayal when he thought about the foolish exploits of the mutineers, and how their brazen defiance of the Union caused him so much trouble. At least now he could take comfort in the fact that they would never trouble him again.\n\nAfter some time, he had finally come to the real meat of that evening's reading: the Red Army's reports on combat readiness. What he saw was all the more promising. Not only did High Command report that the military was close to recovering all manpower lost during the mutiny, but also that the subsequent organizational reforms were going through without issue. Intermixed were various updates on the NKVD's espionage efforts into neighboring warlord states, and they had all come back with roughly the same conclusion: the Fascists' forces were hopelessly unable to match the Red Army in pitched battle. Once the proper plans of attack had been drawn up, Yagoda anticipated that the coming wars would be a mere triviality assuming the NKVD's reports were accurate.\n\nLighting a cigarette, Yagoda leaned back in his chair and began to think about the future. It was obvious that the war for the interior was coming to a close. From this point onward, his efforts would almost solely be focused on reclaiming whatever was wrestled away from the Soviet Union in its darkest hours. The uphill struggle to take back what was lost would soon begin, and the world would never be the same."

The door was pulled shut behind him, and the room was now silent, save for the clock on Yagoda's desk. \"Have a seat, Comrade Bulanov.\" Genrikh Yagoda always had a humorless look about him, but there was something especially troubling about his demeanor this time. \"Comrade Bulanov, I'm sure you are aware by now that I am rather displeased with the state of my administration?\" Bulanov could only guess where this was headed.\"Yes, comrade, I have heard rumors.\"\n\n\"Allow me to reveal to you how I really feel then. I'm absolutely livid, Bulanov. Ever since we defeated Sablin's merry band of traitors, it has become painfully clear that I am surrounded by corrupt buffoons who couldn't run an office to save their lives.\" Although Yagoda did not raise his voice, his eyes betrayed a great anger. \"I see, have you tried scheduling a meeting? Perhaps you could speak sense into them, comrade.\" Yagoda frowned. \"And continue to bash my head against a wall? Come now, Bulanov. I wouldn't have asked for my security chief if I intended to reason with these people.\" Yagoda then pushed a folder across his desk towards Bulanov. \"This is a dossier of 'troublemakers' I have been gathering for some time. I want the NKVD to start a full investigation as soon as possible.\" Bulanov noticed a smaller piece of paper attached to the folder. Upon closer inspection, it was a list of names and instructions. \"And what is this for, Comrade Yagoda?\"\n\n\"Those are people that I want behind bars or in front of a firing squad by tomorrow morning. I don't want my intentions to be misinterpreted by anyone, Comrade Bulanov. Our great Union is in for the wake-up call of a lifetime.\" Later that night, Pavel Bulanov arrived alone at the NKVD headquarters in Irkutsk. Only minutes later, a large column of trucks filled to the brim with NKVD officers left the compound under cover of darkness and rolled into the city to inflict terror upon the enemies of the people. The Great Purge had begun."

 IRK.9.desc: "For the past two weeks, the special NKVD commission had been meeting in their headquarters in Irkutsk every day to lay the groundwork for investigating the more high-profile targets of Yagoda's purges. Files were examined, evidence was reviewed, and men's very fates were to be decided upon. Those who were in the commission were a veritable who's-who of the NKVD's highest echelons. Among them was Security Chief Pavel Bulanov, and, on this occasion, General Secretary Yagoda himself.\n\n\"Now, comrades, that we are in the process of gathering enough evidence to arrest every man who has attained a Soviet political office in the past 10 years, there is still one question that we have yet to broach, and I figure now would be as good a time as any.\" Almost every man in the room looked to Bulanov in anticipation. \"Once these men are in custody, how do you all propose they are dealt with?\" Much to Bulanov's dismay, the room almost immediately fell into a deafening silence.\n\nAfter a deceptively long quiet intermixed with nervous glances and coughs, it was finally broken by a visibly irritated Yagoda. \"You mean to tell me that you idiots have been meeting in this place for almost two goddamn weeks now and still haven't figured this out? What a joke.\" After further silence, only one officer had the courage to speak up. \"Now that you mention it, that does seem like a rather important detail to leave open...\" Yagoda only sighed and buried his face into his hand in response. Bulanov attempted to alleviate the situation before Yagoda began demanding names. \"Comrade Yagoda, if I may, how do you think the punishments should be dealt? These investigations, after all, were your idea. Perhaps it would be best if you were the one to decide?\" Yagoda lifted his head to respond. \"We will show no mercy. These corrupt, incompetent parasites will be shot so that they may never trouble us again. As for those who are too useful to fill with lead, I will decide in due time. From now on, please do not make me do everything myself, comrades.\" With that, Yagoda left the room. The rest were not far behind."

What were once some of the highest-ranking bureaucrats in Irkutsk were now decrepit figures standing before what would become one of the most infamous trials in the town's entire history. The sad, condemned men gave a meek nod in response to the accusations. They had little strength left in them to resist the inevitable.\n\n\"The court hereby finds the accused guilty of all charges, and sentences them to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad!\" When these words were said, some men immediately collapsed to the floor and lost their nerve, while others remained standing in cold acceptance of their fate. In no time at all, a group of NKVD soldiers entered and began to violently pull the condemned men out of the ad-hoc courtroom and further into the depths of NKVD headquarters. As they were led through the claustrophobic basement halls, gunshots and panicked yelling could be heard all around them: poor souls who came before them being served their penalties from the barrel of a gun. Some of the prisoners in the group who were still in a state of despair were being dragged by their shirt collars against the ground, kicking and screaming as they went. If these men were going to hell, this place already made it look childish in comparison.\n\nEventually the group was led into a nondescript, concrete room with no windows and only a single dangling light. Some of the prisoners had pictured many places as being their final resting spot, but this glorified bathroom stall was probably the last one they would've expected. The NKVD soldiers ordered the prisoners against the wall, and forcefully shoved those who were too hysterical to move. Soon enough, everyone was lined up and ready."

Just watch our own forces try and mobilize that fast. It would be a goddamn circus act!\" Security Chief Bulanov knew that the Field Marshal was mostly joking, but he couldn't help in seeing the hints of some uncomfortable truths in his jest. When the mutiny began, the sheer size of Sablin's army was a cause for great concern amongst both the NKVD and the Red Army's High Command. Bulanov recalled that even General Secretary Yagoda himself was deeply troubled by the mutineers' ability to mobilize so quickly in comparison to his own forces. \"If I had the chance, I'd set about whipping the men back into shape as soon as possible. When the time comes to march against the enemy once more, I don't want to be caught with my pants down again, you know?\" Bulanov nodded in response as he took a drink. \"You should know, Comrade Field Marshal, that Comrade Yagoda had asked for me to open inquiries into the Sablinite war effort. While I do not doubt his stalwart bravery in all things, I do believe he is still somewhat concerned our forces haven't learned anything from the mutiny. What do you think?\"\n\nMaslennikov stopped to think for a moment. When he spoke again, he did so in hushed tones. \"You want to know what I think, comrade? I think that if we were to combine our tactics with that of the mutineers, there would not be a single force from the Urals to Kamchatka that could hold our armies back.\" Perhaps it was because he was just a little drunk, but Bulanov began entertaining the thought that Maslennikov's theory might be necessary. Even after he had stumbled home that evening, Pavel Bulanov still couldn't stop thinking about his discussions with the Field Marshal."

Was there some kind of problem?\" Maslennikov tried to maintain an air of martial professionalism as he spoke, but his tone betrayed a slight hint of fear. Yagoda stopped and finally looked Maslennikov in the eyes. \"What do I mean? Did you see them? That boy who sneezed looked like he was about to shit himself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they fear they'll disappoint you, Comrade Yagoda. Rest assured, the soldiers owe you their utmost devotion and loyalty.\" Yagoda was still not impressed, and it showed. \"The only reason they're loyal is because they're terrified of me, not devoted.\" After a pause, the walk continued. \"Do you remember Sablin's traitors, Maslennikov? Those bastards were willing to follow that damn boy into hell when it came to it. I shudder to think how those frightened souls back there would do in similar circumstances.\" The group finally arrived at Yagoda's staff car, and the time came for that afternoon's farewells. \"Make sure the men are in good order next time, Comrade Field Marshal. I will be in touch.\" After an exchange of salutes, Yagoda departed from the base.\n\nThe quiet ride gave Yagoda plenty of time to think. He knew that this problem was far more encompassing than just the army. The entire nation saw him as some kind of monster, despite all their efforts to hide these feelings from the public eye. Meanwhile, that bastard Sablin had transformed his image into that of a hero virtually overnight. Yagoda wondered if perhaps he should make some kind of attempt at softening his image. However, Yagoda also knew that he could not risk looking weak in these desperate times. By the time Yagoda had arrived at his office, he had made up his mind."

Are our policies really so terrible? It's not like they've changed much since Bukharin's day, and nobody was raising a fuss back then.\" Sergey Bessonov, Yagoda's foreign minister, thought of what to say next. Every so often the two would meet in unassuming locales to discuss things that they would never dare to speak of at the workplace, lest they draw the attention of the feared NKVD. This particular morning, they had found themselves in a sleepy cafe in Irkutsk's suburbs, and the subject was dangerously close to becoming more controversial than usual. Bessonov seemed to care little. \"Grigori... do you think that maybe his promises held merit?\" Grinko immediately halted raising his mug as he heard this, and looked up at Bessonov. \"What are you saying, exactly?\" He said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"His men were willing to lay down their lives for his ideas, fought us tooth and nail. We may not like it, but there had to be something worth looking at there. It just wouldn't make sense otherwise.\" Grinko resumed his drinking, his posture slackening once more. \"Eh, maybe. How do we know it wasn't just all talk, though? All you have to do is say the right words, and people will die for you. Sablin obviously knew that well, but we'll never know if it was coming from a genuine place.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But who's to say we can't succeed where he failed? It would surely go a long way towards endearing us to the people.\" Grinko looked up at Bessonov again. \"Most of what Sablin talked about was utopian drivel, nothing more. The truth is, you can't run an effective government on ideals alone. Though sometimes I think it wouldn't hurt if we reexamined how we approached certain issues...\" Bessonov leaned forward. \"It wouldn't, right? If only Comrade Yagoda would see it that way.\""

I just got off the phone with Bessonov, he says the partisans in Aldan have sent us a response defying our ultimatum and denouncing you as a tyrant!

We couldn't have asked for a better opportunity to strike.\" Field Marshal Lyushkov said as he gestured towards the enemy positions on the map, represented with lines of red marker. Lyushkov was not wrong. Intel on the situation farther east was not exactly ideal, but it all seemed to suggest that the Fascist warlords were too busy squabbling amongst themselves to offer any serious resistance to an invasion. Yagoda, his attention still focused on the map, spoke up. \"Lyushkov, how ready are our forces?\" Lyushkov backed away from the map and turned to Yagoda. \"As ready as they'll ever be, Comrade Yagoda.\"\n\n\"Then I think, comrades, it is time to put our plans into motion. These fascist dogs have blighted Russia with their toxic presence for too long. It would bring me great pleasure to see them crushed like the vermin they are.\" Yagoda paused for a moment. \"Remember that this is a very important step towards reunification, comrades. First we retake the Far East, then we liberate the rest of Russia and beyond. I will not accept failure, not when the fate of the Soviet Union still lies on the precipice.\" Yagoda's short speech would resonate heavily with all who heard. The next few months would see the lands of the Far East drenched in blood, and with a great deal of effort and a little luck, only the true heirs to the Soviet Union would remain standing once the smoke had cleared.

Today is a glorious day for the people of the Far East in Russia, as we have fully liberated the region and its inhabitants from their shackles. The power of the people has been shown to be triumphant over all others, and the Union stands, with its red banner flying high above all others!\"\n\nThe soldiers of the Soviet Army gathered around the hall came to clap, and slowly, the crowd cheered in celebration, at first, comrades embracing each other, proud of their victory.\n\n\"It is time! Go out! Drink! Party! It is a time of celebration, the day the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, finally returns to the world stage, where it rightfully belongs! We have shown the Revolution triumphant once more!\"\n\nPeople began to cheer louder, applause growing in volume and the occasional cheer for Yagoda himself, but the soldiers stomped their boots onto the cold, wooden floor to remind everyone to keep quiet for now and to let the leader speak.\n\n\"But that is not the end of our liberation of Russia, my comrades! Soon, we will march West, we will stomp out any fascists, any monarchists, and anyone who does not support the revolution, this is only the beginning! For now, it is time to party! Go, and be free!\"\n\nThe people cheered once more, louder than ever, as bottles of vodka and other liquor were popped open and people drank wildly, stumbling out into the streets to party.

Yet, now he watched in amazement as, in what was perhaps the first meeting of the Presidium where it was not a simple rubber stamp, the power of the NKVD was questioned.\n\nThe decree had been proposed from an anonymous member of the only executive body in Eastern Siberia. Knowing that they would have been effortlessly targeted and \"persuaded\" by the NKVD, whoever was behind this plan was careful not to reveal their identity, at least before the document had been presented to all Presidium members. For Yagoda, it was too late now - he knew all the deputies and their inclinations better than most, and the outcome of this vote was certain.\n\n\"Who is in favor of the dismissal of Yakov Saulovich Agranov as the Premier of the USSR?\"\n\nAlmost everyone raised their hands. The hesitant few who did not out of fear soon changed their minds, making the result of the vote, besides two persons, unanimous. One was Yagoda, still not eager to idly follow the wishes of the Party; as for the other, it was Agranov himself. The Presidium had taken advantage of a temporary absence of his in order to initiate this vote without his knowledge. Yagoda was aware that the presence of every single deputy was not necessary to pass a decree - a loophole that had proven extremely useful in the past, but had come back to bite him. Having been left with no other choice, he slowly raised his hand in approval.\n\n\"Effective immediately, Comrade Agranov is dismissed of his duties by order of the Presidium, to be replaced by Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov as Premier of the USSR.\" No longer was Yagoda's right-hand man in power. He had lost. At last, the Party was in control."

The current General Secretary, Genrikh Yagoda, will assume the duties of Premier while maintaining his current position and powers as General Secretary. Secondly, any votes held on the potential dismissal of Premier Yakov Agranov will be deemed as ineffective, owing to his missing at the time of the alleged decision. Comrade Konstantin Chernenko shall thus be instated as Commissar of Foreign Affairs, while Comrade Bessonov will be indefinitely removed of his current position.\"\n\nThe same faces that so recently were brave enough to stand against Yagoda and his closest allies in the Presidium's session now seemed obedient and almost terrified. No one dared to respond, they all simply stayed quiet. It was once again the director of the NKVD who had to break the silence.\n\n\"May I assume everyone approves the decree?\" There was no answer. \"Then it is in effect from now on.\"\n\nNot a single deputy had opened his mouth since Yagoda had described the plan to revert the revealed plots of the Party's officials, whose grand plan to climb to power had been shattered in minutes. The new Foreign Minister, the General Secretary's man, was allowed to enter the room again. As for Bessonov, he was escorted out by the two guards.

The Russian proletariat can rest assured that the true heirs to Lenin and Bukharin shall restore the glory and freedom which they lost to the Nazi menace.\n\nBut our work is still unfinished. There are still many menaces to the West who we must deal with. Having grown beyond the status of a warlord, we are now a fully functioning state and must develop our nation accordingly. We will have to make great investments into bringing our country up to the standards of the developed nations of the world, and we will now be able to take on a national debt in order to finance our expansion.\n\nOur people cry out for help, and the restoration of our Union awaits them.

Others said that the reunification of the Far East had proved the legitimacy of the Presidium's construction, and had allowed for a true proletarian nation to once again emerge.\n\nWhatever the true reason, none could deny that the state was a far cry from that of only a few years prior. Internal divisions had been removed. Lands had been acquired. Economic and social activities were increasing. Foreign relations were being established. And, providing the means by which all this had been accomplished, the Red Army stood as a modern, professional, experienced, and deadly force.\n\nThere would be many more challenges and tribulations in the future, those who thought about such things knew, but they would be overcome.

As we seek to alter our economic policy to fit the tumultuous world of the 1960s, we must turn our eyes to the past and recall what made Bukharin's economy so uniquely successful and innovative.\n\nHis staunch defense (and continuation) of Lenin's New Economic Policy tells us that it is necessary to build up the productive forces of the nation before entering a phase of true socialism. His bold Siberian Plan continues to pay dividends even in this era of anarchy and opportunist warlords, teaching us that we must industrialize even the most rural regions of Russia. His aversion to the collectivisation programs encouraged by some in the Left Opposition shows us that we must not allow ideology to prevent us from pursuing every economic opportunity available.\n\nAs Russians, as Soviets, as socialists, and as members of the Politburo, we are Bukharinists one and all, and proud thereof! As the Soviet Union is reborn by our hand, we must (and shall) adapt a truly Bukharinist model to the needs and wants of the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and create an economy strong and productive enough to establish socialism no later than 2050!"

On one side of the argument stood the NKVD who, as some of the only loyal forces who had accompanied the Presidium to Irkutsk during the evacuation, claimed that they should be increasingly militarized, to serve as the loyal core of a future army.\n\nOn the other side stood the professional military apparatus of the Red Army itself. They countered strongly by reiterating that they had remained loyal during the Sablinite rebellion, and cast doubt on the combat capability of the NKVD, claiming that to restructure the military to accommodate them would lead to an enormous decrease in both tactical and strategic performance.\n\nNone knew what the outcome of this argument, already underway among the highest echelons of government, would be.

It feels like we lost our souls somewhere along the line.\"\n\nVoroshsky gulped the vodka down and began pouring himself another. \"I'll tell you where we lost them, Comrade Yaktorovich. We lost them when we fled Moscow. Bukharin, for all his many flaws, was a true disciple of Lenin's word. So was Sablin, for that matter. The boy might have been an idiot but he read his theory. Yagoda lacks dedication to the revolutionary cause. He saw a chance at power, and he took it, and now here we are.\"\n\nYaktorovich grinned. \"You have to be careful what you say, Voroshsky. I could turn you in for uttering such things.\"\n\nVoroshsky chuckled \"You could, but then I'd have to tell the NKVD about all the traitorous things you start to mutter when you're deep in your cups.\"\n\n\"Fair enough\" Yaktorovich raised his glass. \"To mutually assured destruction. \"\n\n\"Cheers.\""

He had survived the flight from Moscow, the Siberian war, Sablin's rebellion, and the reunification of the east. Through all the trials and tumult the Union had endured he had served his post as the Undersecretary of Revolutionary Education, collecting a generous paycheck for his service while working as little as he was required to. He used to fear that his relaxed attitude towards his work might one day earn him the bullet or the noose, but eventually he'd come to see that his superiors didn't want ambitious and motivated men in the government. They wanted men like Vasily, who were looking to do as little as it took to live comfortably in an uncomfortable world. For almost three decades Vasily had thrived within this cult of mediocrity, content in the certainty that he would be collecting his paycheck until he died. It seemed the new bosses weren't as happy with that idea as Vasily was, as evidenced by the pink slip that now sat on his desk.\n\nIn the coming days Vasily heard from many of his coworkers who had experienced the same thing. No warning or hint that anything is amiss, and then suddenly one day the job you've held since 1938 isn't yours any more. Some of his comrades were righteously angry at their dismissal, insisting that they could never be replaced, that the Union was doomed without them. It was mostly hot air. The old men who now spent most of their days crowded into bars complaining to each other were not the type to give their life to the revolution. Vasily had spent three decades working twelve hour weeks and hadn't completed a single major project or initiative in the last ten years. His comrades were no different.

The last Undersecretary of Revolutionary Education had allowed the Union's schools to fall into stagnation, and thousands of children had been given inadequate educations as a result. Boris was going to put a stop to it. His head was already spinning with ideas and plans of how he would rebuild the Union's schools.\n\nThe first step would be creating a new generation of textbooks, covering everything from the sciences to Russian history. As far as Boris was aware, there hadn't been a new educational text published in Russian since the second world war, meaning that any school lucky enough to have textbooks was relying on information that was 30 years old at best. After the textbooks had been printed he could begin organizing a nationwide initiative to train and hire more teachers. After that the foundations would be laid for his most ambitious plans. New schools, both primary and secondary, would open in every city and town across eastern Siberia, heralding a new age of revolutionary schooling and societal progress. Perhaps even a new university to serve as the crowning achievement, or even...\n\nA knock at the office door broke Boris out of his daydreaming. He saw his assistant had returned with a tower of boxes containing the documents and records that Boris needed. Sorting through them all would take all night. Boris sighed, grabbed a box, and dug in. Before he could enjoy the glamour and perks of this job he would have to earn them. \"Oh well,\" he thought. \"Millions have given their lives to the Union. The least I can offer it is my time.\""

Reams of documents and posters praising Yagoda are quietly destroyed; statues of him, many erected triumphantly only months ago, come down in favor of more palatable statues of Lenin, Marx, or Bukharin.\n\nYagoda's supporters may lament the party coup as a betrayal of socialism and unity, but to the rest of the population his ouster is met with a cautious welcome. It may be the Soviet successor Yagoda built, but without him many believe his ouster is proof that the party can take a kinder path.

All of them were stolen, private snapshots of lives acquired via surveillance.\n\nUpon his hands there was much blood. Young and old, idealist and cynic, patriot and traitor. Each had met with Ilya's justice at one time or another.\n\nHe laughed quietly at the dramatic tone of his thoughts. What had made the Sablinites any different? The regret he felt now, the one that had seemingly turned him into an aspiring poet, was one he hadn't experienced in decades.\n\nPerhaps though, Ilya was the seal instead. A man haunted by his own pests, invisible to him for many years. The seal to a thousand lurking birds that had finally come home to roost.\n\nAs he stood up from the rock and began his long swim to shore, he made a decision. Ilya would not be returning to Irkutsk. All that had tied him to that place seemed shattered by whatever realizations the lake had bestowed. His duty was as faint as a distant cloud.\n\nSo it was that an NKVD veteran abandoned his duties, and set off for the Siberian wastes."

 IRK.72.desc: "Alexei grunted as his back struck the ground a yard or two below the rocks he had ever so carefully tried to maneuver over just moments before. Training had consumed most of the day, but it was relatively calm compared to other days. As the bulk of today's training had wrapped up, the officers had sent Alexei to fetch some things from camp. Walking there, the 23 year old had tried to walk along the rocks like a child trying to keep their balance on a brick barrier.\n\nDigging his gloved hands into the snow behind him, the young soldier hauled himself into an upright position. Now, face red and battered by the bitter winds, he found himself staring out at Lake Baikal from its bank. Dusting snow off his coat, he kept his eyes on the horizon. \"Couldn't hurt to sit here for a second.\" He argued, opening his satchel with a 'pop' and retrieving his cantine.\n\nAlexei watched the stars begin to shine brighter and the sky shift from purple to inky black over the course of 15 minutes. Just as he began to stand up, something white darted past his vision. Righting himself, his eyes followed the blur to the edge of the stones, where now a rabbit, white as the pure driven snow, munched on a plant struggling to grow in the frozen soil. Completely undisturbed by his presence, the bunny watched the clear lakewater.\n\nAlexei remembered his childhood pets, animals he had found out in the woods that his mother forced him to abandon. Hunching down, he produced his cantine once again and began pouring water into a small divet in the snow. Still undeterred by the larger creature's presence, the rabbit simply hopped over and began to drink peacefully. Glancing left and right, assuring there was no one watching him, the soldier scooped it up, opened back up his satchel with the same pop, and placed it in. Gripping the rocks, he scaled back over and began the walk back to camp, fully prepared to be chewed out by the brass."

 IRK.74.desc: "\"My calling is to the east, papa. I'm sorry.\"\n\nBoldyrev stared into his son. His face was hard as iron, his eyes a piercing blade. For the briefest moment, he did not know what to say.\n\nTen years he served Yagoda, ten years he had risen through the ranks of the NKVD. Blood stained his hands, but long had he rationalized it during sleepless nights; it was necessary. It was his duty. Before that, as a boy of just seventeen, he fought and bled for the Bolsheviks in the great civil war. He promised his life to the revolution, until the very end of his days.\n\nNow here was his son, about to betray the nation that Boldyrev had a hand in forging, with eyes that pleaded to his father; let me go. Let me fight for what is right.\n\nBoldyrev sighed, setting a hand upon his son's shoulder. \"I was only a bit younger than you when I too bled for Lenin,\" he began. \"In those days I asked myself one question every single night; was I fighting for the right side? What if I had made a horrible mistake?\"\n\nHe shook his head, smiling. \"I followed what my heart desired. I followed the passion that guided me, and it led me to the socialist revolution.\" Boldyrev swallowed, suddenly uneasy of what he was about to say. No matter who won this struggle, his words would doom him. \"But cruel men corrupted it, my son. And they brought me down a path I should never have followed. I am old now, and my passion has dried.\"\n\nHis eyes met with his son's, and tears swelled. \"Follow your heart, my son. Do what you believe is right, do not be constrained by old feeble men like me. But hold your comrades accountable, as I should have.\"\n\nHis son nodded, and the eagerness that filled his face was now mixed with longing. \"I will, papa,\" he said. As he watched his son step out of the house and to Buryatia, Boldyrev feared that he had killed him. Yet he could not restrain his boy like he did to so many others; his fate was for himself to choose. Now, there was only one hopeless wish he had left."

It was way past curfew, and Sergei had been forced to sneak his way slowly through the abandoned streets of Severobaykalsk. Their father, a loving but stern man well respected within Yagoda's party, had died many years earlier. He had left both of his sons keys to the property, and they had come here often since his death to catch up and reminisce. Both of them knew this time was different. They both pulled up chairs and sat across from each other, and poured themselves tall glasses of vodka.\n\n\"I know what you have called me here for Alexei,\" Sergei began, pre-empting his brother's plea. \"You know what my answer will be.\"\n\n\"Just hear what I have to say,\" he replied, his tone laced with sadness. \"There is no way out of this for you rebels, Sergei. Yagoda is going to crush Sablin's little rebellion in a matter of weeks. If you walk away now, I can make sure that you don't end up in front of a firing squad.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I'm sure you will be able to use your position in the NKVD to get me off. But that represents everything that is wrong with Yagoda's regime Alexei. The NKVD runs rampant, crushing dissent, killing anybody in its path with impunity, its agents routinely abusing their power for personal gain. Sablin is right. This is not Lenin's Soviet Union. There has to be a better way.\"\n\n\"Listen to yourself Sergei. Yagoda and the NKVD are the only thing that have kept Lenin's Soviet Union alive. You think that the Union would have survived a single year against the warlords and the fascists if not for Yagoda? The NKVD is the only thing keeping our enemies at bay.\"\n\n\"Whatever you tell yourself to help you sleep at night,\" Sergei said bitterly, downing his vodka and rising from his chair. \"Next time we see each other, it is as enemies.\"\n\nThe brothers parted without another word into the cold Siberian night."

Even as he went about his day, his anxiety only barely keeping up with his exhaustion, he looked at his front door whenever he could, hoping to hear a knock from his one and only son, hoping beyond hope that he had escaped capture by Yagoda's thugs. Alisa, bless her soul, worried about his own restlessness, even if she tried to hide it. If he knew Yagoda though, and he did, all too well, then he was not the one she should be worried about. Their son was in greater danger than most people could imagine.\n\nAs Boldyrev was reading a book early in the night, trying to calm himself and finally get some sleep, a knock came. He nearly fell on the floor trying to get up, and ran so quickly to the door he feared he might trip. When he reached the door and opened it, however, the excitement on his face vanished. This was not his son. This was an NKVD officer, his stare cold and unfeeling. \"A letter, for you, comrade.\" Boldyrev opened it, fear quickly building down to his very bones. It was a letter, one first thanking him for his years of service to the NKVD. Then it went on to explain that his son's body had been discovered at the site of the final capture of Sablin, identified by old NKVD friends of Boldyrev who had known his son as a child. It was signed by Yagoda personally. Boldyrev collapsed to his knees, tears streaming out of his eyes, which stared after the retreating back of the NKVD officer. It was useless, utterly useless. Nobody could oppose Yagoda, god damn his name, yet he had been foolish enough to let his son try. It was a choice he would regret for the rest of his days. Even when Alisa, who had been woken by the commotion, came to comfort him, he barely felt it."

Too many of Sablin's soldiers would never return home, and he had seen more than one weeping widow or grieving parent since the war had ended. The only question that remained was- would he be among them?\n\nIn the middle of the day, as Boldyrev was washing dishes at the sink, a knock came at the door. He nearly dropped the plate he was holding in his excitement. He wasn't expecting any visitors. Rushing to the door, he threw it open, and he could have almost cried at the sight that greeted him. There was his son, decked out in one of the finest uniforms Sablin's forces had to offer, with a big grin plastered across his face. \"I'm home, papa.\" His son said, his voice almost cracking. \"I'm finally home.\" They embraced, with Boldyrev patting his son on the back to comfort him.\n\nInviting his son inside, Boldyrev called over his wife, who was similarly overjoyed to see her son alive and well. They sat their son down with all the food he could want, and listened as he told them his best stories of the conflict, concluding with the fact that he had been appointed one of Sablin's guards for his distinguished service. For all Boldyrev cared, he could have been a deserter. He was just glad to see that his son was okay."

 IRK_superregional.21.desc: "\"You all stand before the court today accused of treason, first and foremost, but in addition countless acts of murder, arson, theft...\" The voice of the judge droned on and on, as though he had memorized a script. He probably had, Feliks Sokolov thought. They always gave the same sentences to so-called traitors anyways, the Red Army bastards, no reason to treat most of the sentences as special. While his supposed comrades might be shaking in their boots right now, Feliks was wise to this communist nonsense. He had fought against the communists since Barbarossa, was more despised by the reds than any of the younger officers on trial here, yet they would give them a fate no kinder than that in store for him. Why live in fear when facing certain death?\n\nAs the judge kept on reading and reading, Feliks found he just couldn't take it any more. Not the flat tone of the judge, not the pitiless glares of the soldiers, and certainly not the boys dressed up as men on trial beside him, unable to accept their fate. \"Enough!\" Feliks roared at last, slamming his handcuffed fists on the table before him. \"My charges and verdict are irrelevant. Get to the damned execution, you spineless freaks.\" Anger flashed across the faces of a couple of the soldiers, who raised their guns, but the judge motioned for them to stand down. \"Very well, Mr. Sokolov.\" Feliks was surprised the man even bothered remembering his name. \"The court hereby finds you guilty. Your sentence is summary execution. Comrades, escort these men out to the field, and tie them to your posts.\" As the soldiers approached him, the judge stared at Feliks, an indiscernible emotion on his face somewhere between pity and disgust. \"Do you have any last words, Mr. Sokolov? I'd like to hear them.\"\n\n\"When you get to hell, you bastards had better be ready, because there I'll kill you first.\"\n\n\"I see. Goodbye, Mr. Sokolov.\""

 IRK_superregional.22.desc: "When Igor signed up to fight for the Soviet Union against the next generation of fascist barbarians, he was expecting something more... glorious. Heroic last stands, liberating pretty towns with pretty girls, filling his chest with medals of valor. That sort of thing. Definitely not being here, in a shitty fort in the middle of nowhere, guarding prisoners who weren't even important. Everybody was bored, even the prisoners. Coming back inside after a smoke, Igor was surprised to hear people shouting passionately. Not a cheer or a poor attempt at singing (that they had done a week ago), but an argument. But what were they all yelling about? He got closer.\n\nIgor realized that, bereft of other ways to spend their time, the soldiers and prisoners appeared to be debating politics. \"How can somebody be a hereditary reactionary? That's just racism in Marxist language! Hitler called it 'national socialism' too!\" one soldier said to the assembled captives. His comrades nodded in agreement.\n\nA prisoner, seated on the opposite side, quickly retorted: \"Hitler wasn't a Marxist. Comrade Serov simply recognizes the fact that people inherit the class status of their parents, extended to entire bourgeois cultural groups, like the Jews. If it's genuine Marxist credentials you want to talk about, why is it that your butcher Yagoda slaughters legions of other communists and hands over the country's resources to the bourgeoisie?\"\n\n\"Is the red Hitlerite really calling us revisionists?\" butted in another voice.\n\nIgor wisely decided to stay out of the discussion. In a battlefield teeming with genuine chemical weapons, there was still nothing quite as toxic as political disputes left to fester."

It's therefore of the utmost importance that we restore the roads to working condition so that we may continue with our economic development. Started in the past decades as part of the Siberian plan, the M58 connecting Chita to Amur was left unfinished due to the §VGreat Patriotic War§! and the subsequent disruptions in communications. Organizing a supplemental labor battalion out of the RFP prisoners from the liberation of Amur should ensure the swift completion of the project. Justice will be dispensed as their masters in Berlin caused this unfortunate delay in the first place."
 IRK_complete_the_magadan_connection: "마가단과의 연결 복구"
 IRK_complete_the_magadan_connection_desc: "The M56 was an endeavor to connect Magadan to the more temperate parts of Siberia. Many laborers risked life and limb to achieve this monument to socialist progress, but just like they've destroyed so many things in the Soviet Union, the fascists that occupied the port of Magadan have let most of the oblast's infrastructure go to waste. Justice shall be swift, and the NKVD will make sure that a labour detail consisting of Matkovsky's captured men repair every last inch of the road that they wrecked. Once we have a decent road leading into Magadan, we can finally begin transporting goods to and from the port."
 IRK_restoration_of_irkutsk_hps: "이르쿠츠크 HPS 복구"
 IRK_restoration_of_irkutsk_hps_desc: "During the brief period during which the Soviet Union was limited to merely holding on to the area of Irkutsk, S.D.R.C. made the assessment that our temporary shortage of necessary equipment made it impossible to fully maintain the Irkutsk HPS. As a result, the power station visibly bears the scars of half a decade's worth of maintenance cuts and hasn't been operating at an ideal capacity for years. With the liberation of the Soviet Far East and its resources however we can finally resume the scheduled work and tie it into our plans to expand the plant in the future. Merely catching up on the maintenance work, however, would be more than enough to put us in a position where we can keep our industries going without needing to ration electricity."
 IRK_revive_amurs_agricultural_sector: "아무르 농업 지대 재활성화"
 IRK_revive_amurs_agricultural_sector_desc: "Previously under control of the vile fascists of the RFP, the fields of Amur have gone from being some of the most productive in Siberia to being a desolate wasteland due to the uprooting of the Soviet central planning of the region's farmlands. Ministry of Agriculture and Food have estimated the manpower needed to revitalize the yields and bring them back to pre-Siberian War levels and have suggested that we'll use the current state of hard-fought stability and peace to rotate some of our conscripted peasants back into their old work and draw on some of the recently liberated population belonging to less vital economic sectors to even out our numbers. While agriculture by itself is no longer a key factor in a modern industrialized economy as was the case during the birth of our Union, we cannot hope to fully transition into one when a good portion of our population can barely scrape by."
 IRK_expand_the_port_of_magadan: "마가단항 확충"
 IRK_expand_the_port_of_magadan_desc: "Magadan's importance to our economy cannot be understated. In order to open ourselves up to the global economy, we must first improve the harbor to increase its capacity for both imports and exports as well as expand our icebreaker fleet to the point where we can reliably keep the port open all year round. Once it's completed, we can embark on the next step of our Five Year Plan."
 IRK_rapid_factory_modernization: "신속한 공장 현대화"
 IRK_rapid_factory_modernization_desc: "With our improved access to the outside world comes the obvious benefits of having easier access to industrial equipment. While our landlocked rivals in the west struggle to get their hands on modern machinery as they're surrounded by uncooperative rogue states, our access to the sea changes the situation entirely. With the recent expansion of Magadan's facilities, we're in a good position to import the kind of machinery we need to revitalize our industrial economy."
 IRK_revive_the_mining_industry: "광산 산업 재활성화"
 IRK_revive_the_mining_industry_desc: "Beneath the surface of Siberia lies vast, untapped riches. Coal, gold, diamonds, iron ore and a myriad of valuable minerals are right at our fingertips, but sadly cannot currently be excavated due to many of our mines falling into disrepair during the anarchy. By importing equipment and schematics from abroad, we can undo years of decay in short order."
 IRK_trade_with_the_developing_world: "개발된 세계와의 무역"
 IRK_trade_with_the_developing_world_desc: "While our economy was never officially closed, it has understandably been struggling due to the anarchy putting development into a state of abject stasis. Despite the many disagreements that Yagoda and the Party factions have, this is one area where they see common ground as trade with friendly and neutral states in Asia and across the Pacific can work in harmony both with the old Bukharinite system and the coexistence between Marxism and capitalism envisioned by some of our newer economists. With products to offer the world and a profound need for goods to bolster our economy, we'll initiate efforts to restore trade ties with former partners in the developing world and seek out new trade ties as well."
 IRK_modernizing_the_irkutsk_hps: "이르쿠츠크 HPS 현대화"
 IRK_modernizing_the_irkutsk_hps_desc: "The turbines used in the Irkutsk HPS linger back to the days of the Siberian plan While not a direct target in any of the recent wars, the aftershocks caused by the fall of Moscow and the Siberian War can still be felt to this day. By purchasing equipment on the foreign markets and hiring experts to help us modernize the plants to the standards of this decade, the provisory capital of the Soviet Union will be ranked among the most important electricity production stations in all of Asia. Needless to say, this will go a long way to achieve the goals of our Five Year Plan by ensuring plentiful of electricity day and night, all year around for both common citizens, state industries and investors alike."
 IRK_the_economic_heart_of_siberia: "시베리아의 경제적 심장"
 IRK_the_economic_heart_of_siberia_desc: "Our renovation and revitalization of the current seat of Soviet power must not be a half-measure. As the most advanced city in the Soviet Union, Irkutsk will take the first steps into being a modern economy. Avoiding reckless marches into the unknown, we'll limit the Union's evolution into a more contemporary economic model to take the shape of gradual steps, starting out by tweaking the legal framework for businesses in the city as well as investing in the creation of state service companies. Whereas we relied on raw industrial strength in the past, the economy of the new Union will be known for its efficiency as well."
 IRK_the_open_coastal_city_of_magadan: "마가단 개방 항구 도시"
 IRK_the_open_coastal_city_of_magadan_desc: "As we advance towards realizing the Yagodaschina, it's time that we put theory into practice. Magadan will be the first cite where we will initiate a full-scale experiment in our new economic theory of two systems co-existing in the Soviet Union, reaping the rewards of a more modern economy while preserving the Marxist ideals our revolution was founded on."
 IRK_the_industrial_harbor_of_magadan: "마가단 산업항"
 IRK_the_industrial_harbor_of_magadan_desc: "With those seeking to betray the revolution and compromise with capitalism having lost the economic debate, it's time for us to move towards reaching the goals of our Five Year Plan- Through a heavy industrialization scheme that builds upon the successes of the Siberian Plan while also learning from its mistakes, we'll bring more prosperity to our Union."
 IRK_the_second_industrialization_wave: "제 2차 산업화 물결"
 IRK_the_second_industrialization_wave_desc: "In order to achieve our industrial goals, a second wave of investments into the state's heavy industry sector is needed. It'll be a broad push for industrial growth across the Union, seeing the construction and local modernizations of several factory complexes in all our major cities."
 IRK_expand_brigade_recruitment: "여단 모병 확충"
 IRK_expand_brigade_recruitment_desc: "With war on the horizon, we might want to look into expanding our volunteer recruitment and lower the standards for the volunteers that we do accept as well as providing volunteers with easier travel to the Union. While the influx of spirited men and women of strong socialist convictions is undoubtedly going to strengthen us, it will put a further strain on our efforts to train our army."
 IRK_special_economic_sector: "이르쿠츠크 경제특구"
 IRK_special_economic_sector_desc: "After taking the first step towards modernizing our temporary capital's economy, it's time to take the next one. Avoiding the mistake of taking a great leap forward, we'll limit the reform package to opening up parts of Irkutsk's central areas to foreign investments and provide generous legal and tax incentives to attract foreign capital with the state driving the push towards a service-based economic model for the city."
 IRK_yakutia_special_economic_province: "야쿠티아 경제특구"
 IRK_yakutia_special_economic_province_desc: "Back during the early days of the NEP's implementation it wasn't unheard of for British and Japanese mining companies to invest in the Soviet Union. Yagoda believes that with the right tax incentives, Yakutia could become a hotbed for foreign mining companies seeking to establish themselves on Soviet soil. Naturally, we'll make sure that our most important strategic resources remain firmly under the control of the State."
 IRK_blagoveshchensk_special_economic_sector: "블라고베셴스크 경제특구"
 IRK_blagoveshchensk_special_economic_sector_desc: "Despite our many disagreements with the CPS in the past, recent developments have necessitated economic pragmatism towards the Sphere. Opening up Blagoveshchensk as a SES would thus be an ideal move, allowing us to expand our economy while also signaling our intentions to improve our ties with Japan. By allowing Japanese Zaibatsu to establish themselves in the city, we can turn it into one of Asia's great industrial hubs."
 IRK_petropavlovsk_kamchatsky_open_coastal_city: "페트로파블롭스크-캄차스키 개방 항구 도시"
 IRK_petropavlovsk_kamchatsky_open_coastal_city_desc: "With our efforts to approach the OFN bearing fruit, the Chairman believes that we need to strike while the iron is hot. As our closest territory to America, we'll declare Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky as an additional OCC and use state incentives to create an investment climate that's attractive to American technology companies. Naturally, we will arrange matters so that we can benefit from their expertise as well..."
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_state: "9차 5개년 계획"
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_state_desc: "Chairman Yagoda's Eighth Five Year Plan has been a resounding success. The success of the Yagodaschina cannot be denied by anyone, for it was this measured approach to economics that not only saw our Union prosper again, but also allowed us to reclaim another portion of our Soviet Motherland from its illegitimate occupants. Now the time has come to launch an even more ambitious Five Year Plan - one that shall see us restore Soviet control throughout the Russian anarchy and beyond."
 IRK_third_industrialization_wave: "제 3차 산업화 물결"
 IRK_third_industrialization_wave_desc: "With our course set, we need to expand the industrialization plan beyond the great cities and allow the smaller cities to reap the rewards of Soviet industry. When we're done, every hamlet in the Far East will become a testament to the success of our laborers!"
 IRK_coal_mining_boom: "탄광 활기"
 IRK_coal_mining_boom_desc: "While those in the party that sought to undermine proper Marxist applications of economic theory speak of investments by foreign companies in the Soviet Union, we know that our strategic resources are too important to allow the forces of capital gain too strong a hold. That being said, as long as they're just merely under the ground it's hardly of any use to us. We'll expand our excavations of the South Yakutsk basins to bring more coal to fuel our industrial growth."
 IRK_increase_production_quotas: "생산 할당량 증가"
 IRK_increase_production_quotas_desc: "In order to achieve the goals set by our economists, it's become blatantly clear to us that we need to raise the production quotas in all state-owned factories. While unpopular, steps like this will be needed if we wish to avoid repeating the disastrous mistakes of the last administration."
 IRK_increase_industrial_trade: "산업 거래 증대"
 IRK_increase_industrial_trade_desc: "With our recent industrial expansions it's clear that we've made ourselves more competitive in the developing markets. By seeking to expand our trade deals with neutral states as well as the few handful of socialist states that still exist, we should be able to give a healthy infusion of cash into our state budget on a regular basis."
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_party: "9차 5개년 계획"
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_party_desc: "The Five Year Plan has been a resounding success. Not only have we bested the internal opposition and charted our own path towards improving the lives of our Soviet citizens, but we've also managed the difficult feat of liberating another piece of the old Union as a direct result of our diligent work. There's no time to rest though as the party has already approved the framework for a Ninth Five Year Plan, one that will allow us to modernize our recently liberated Siberian territories to the west of our temporary capital. Forward!"
 IRK_the_great_siberian_highway_project: "대 시베리아 고속도로 계획"
 IRK_the_great_siberian_highway_project_desc: "The M53 was a planned highway project meant to link Irkutsk with Novosibirsk. Fallen on the wayside due to the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War and with its finished sections tarnished by the neglect of the many petty warlords that occupied the areas of land where stretches of this road still existed, it's truly in a sorry state. Our economists believe that with the right investments, we could turn the old vision into reality and link every major city of Central Siberia to our capital. A massive boon to our economy at times of peace, and an equally great benefit to our logistics should our friends in the west not surrender the rightful Soviet territories they occupy without a fight."
 IRK_novosibirsk_special_economic_sector: "노보시비르스크 경제특구"
 IRK_novosibirsk_special_economic_sector_desc: "Novosibirsk is an ideal city to establish another SES. Its great industrial and technological capacities combined with its excellent airport makes it a perfect site for commercial and industrial investment. By opening it up to outside investors under a carefully controlled and planned framework, we'll be able to greatly enrich our Union while also reaping the benefits of the technologies that the foreign companies bring to the table when they establish themselves in the SES."
 IRK_kemerovos_palaces_of_industry: "케메로보 산업 궁정"
 IRK_kemerovos_palaces_of_industry_desc: "The mighty factories of Kemerovo are a testament to Soviet economic prowess, one that managed to survive several bloody wars and still go from strength to stunning strength. With this great city back under rightful Soviet control, we'll make it the lynchpin for our industrialization efforts in the region."
 IRK_western_companies_in_tomsk: "톰스크의 서방 기업"
 IRK_western_companies_in_tomsk_desc: "A great opportunity has arisen. Thanks to our improving ties with the OFN nations and the great scientific expertise that resided in the city of Tomsk, there's now talk of western medical companies seeking to establish themselves in the Soviet Union. If we accept, we can expect to be able to advance our own medical research sector as well."
