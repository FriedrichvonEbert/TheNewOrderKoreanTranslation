POLITICS_DENNIS_SKINNER_DESC:0 "There were many in London who feared that the Second German Civil War would carry with it the Third Civil War in England. Though the remains of HMMLR rose again, as many expected, the resistance against this by the collaborationist administration was almost none. Led by Arthur Harris, the New Resistance marched on London and enacted a nearly bloodless coup, removing the Reich's administration and setting up a government of their own choosing.\n\nDennis Skinner, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, was chosen as Prime Minister. An advocate for the common people of Britain and a tacit supporter of Bill Alexander, Skinner was well-known and competent enough that the Resistance considered him an apt figurehead for the resistance in England. Skinner, however, refused to be tied to what he perceived as a monarchist organization. There was a great deal of bickering, with Skinner eventually agreeing to lead a Republican Britain.\n\nSkinner has attempted sweeping change and reconstruction to aid the ailing Britain, working especially hard to aid those rendered out of home or work due to the German invasion and later withdrawal. These efforts have been somewhat hampered by the fact that much of the parliament, whether elected or appointed directly by the resistance, seem to view Skinner's proposals as entirely too radical. Many Scotsmen and Welshmen believe that the time of a united Great Britain has long since passed. Only time will tell if Skinner's new British state will stand firm in the face of this adversity, or if the "Beast of Bolsover" will fall like those before him."

POLITICS_DRAGOSLAV_RACIC_DESC:0 "One of the leaders of the Chetniks, Colonel Dragoslav Račić could not bear to see Serbia occupied once again. The German invasion led Račić to the Chetniks, establishing many companies and fighting against the intruders and their Croatian pawns in the Ustashe. While Račić had no love for communism, he fought alongside the Partisans on many occasions, being known by them as the "Good Chetnik".\n\nWhile his country suffered under the Nazi boot, Dragoslav Račić never rested, fighting a war of attrition and guerilla for many years against  Nedić's puppet regime and their German benefactors. As bullets flew in the Reich after Hitler's death, Račić's Chetniks were instrumental in defeating the German garrison in Serbia, bringing freedom to his homeland once more. However, this liberation did not last, and soon Göring's armies came knocking, as they fiercely devoured Serbia and drove the Chetniks and Partisans underground once more.\n\nLike the one who came before, this Nazi occupation could not last. Göring and his followers are cannibalizing themselves now, fighting a new Civil War, and Dragoslav Račić and his brave Chetniks have risen. Taking control of Serbian territories, he has vowed to struggle against the Reich as long as needed, remove all German influence from the Balkans and build a new Serbia, this time free."

POLITICS_VIOLETA_YAKOVA_IVANKA_DESC:0 "A Jewish woman born in Interwar Bulgaria, Violeta Yosifovna Yakova has endured much in her life. As the economic situation in Bulgaria worsened after WW1, her family moved from their hometown Dupnitsa to the capital Sofia, in search of prosperity. There, Violeta became a tailor's apprentice and had her first contact with leftist and zionist organizations, eventually joining the Bulgarian Communist Party, radicalized by her country's alignment with the German Reich.\n\nWhen the Tsardom of Bulgaria formally joined the Axis in 1942, a young Violeta joined the underground resistance, adopting "Ivanka" as her codename. She participated in many activities against the fascist-aligned tsarist regime, notably sabotaging factories that produced German uniforms. She led an operation that assassinated Bulgarian chief of police Atanas Pantev and lieutenant general Hristo Lukov. As the war ended and the Reich stood victorious, Violeta Ivanka and her comrades laid mostly dormant, quietly battling against fascism and antisemitism but also protecting themselves.\n\nThe Bulgarian status quo changed when the German boots trampled over the Tsardom. Now aimed against Göring's regime, Violeta Ivanka and her resistance have been a thorn on the Reich's side. With the Führer's regime collapsing, Violeta can now lead Bulgaria to new heights and achieve true freedom for its people."

POLITICS_KOCI_XOXE_DESC:0 "Considered by many the mastermind of Albanian communism, Koçi Xoxe's early life is mostly a mystery. Born in the later years of the Ottoman Empire, Xoxe joined the communist movement in his youth, where he became acquainted with other leaders such as Enver Hoxha, Fadil Hoxha, and Sejfulla Malëshova.\n\nSince the Italian invasion, Koçi Xoxe and the remaining leaders of the communists have lived in the mountains, working alongside Tito's Yugoslav partisans in their resistance campaigned against the fascists, rebranding the party as the LNÇ (National Liberation Movement).\n\nWith Fadil Hoxha's death in the German invasion of Albania, Xoxe has taken the reins of the partisans. Now, the German rule has weakened as they fight among themselves, and the LNÇ has seized the opportunity to lead the Albanian people in a revolution against their German oppressors."

POLITICS_HENRY_RINNAN_DESC:0 "While the Fatherland has fallen, Norway still holds strong. Rinnan is an SS man, kept around by Göring to manage Norway in the new Reichskommissariat Skandinavian. The truth is, Rinnan doesn't like the Burgundian System much, and is happy to be loyal to the rightful Führer. Germany just has to figure out who that is first.\n\nRinnan's parents were Norwegian nationalists, and are currently loyal Nazis. Rinnan enlisted in the Norwegian army at first, then was recruited by the Gestapo in June of 1940. From there, he made a career for himself in partisan-hunting. He and his fellow soldiers managed to disband hundreds of partisan groups just during the war, and with additional German support afterwards managed to capture countless others. Rinnan stayed neutral during the coup, stating his loyalty to Germania above all. He continued to dutifully catch partisans until the first German Civil War broke out, during which he fled to Sweden to avoid getting killed by a partisan or German. Rinnan returned to Reichskommissariat Norwegen after the Reich had successfully reestablished control over it, and was excited to hear of the Reich's plans to conquer the rest of Scandinavia. Rinnan continued to act exclusively in Norway even after the rest of Scandinavia was under the jackboot. He continued to do his job like he always had until the Reich collapsed yet again due to more political instability.\n\nRinnan decided to take matters into his own hands this time. He quickly rounded up a gang of loyal officers and stormed the local Norwegian government, declaring that Norway would be under his protection until the Reich was stable enough to manage Norway again. So far, Rinnan's rule has been chaotic, to put it mildly. While Rinnan despises the Burgundian System, he does have to admit that it does kill people very efficiently, and Rinnan has adapted Burgundian tactics into his rule of Norway somewhat. Unfortunately, driving the people you don't like into the mountains where they can hide form you doesn't make all the problems in your country go away. Rinnan now faces a disloyal populace, armed partisans who almost entirely own the mountains, and a benefactor that has nearly totally collapsed. While Rinnan has stated his intention to keep Norway under the Reich's control, who knows how long it can survive for without the Reich supplying it."

POLITICS_OLOF_PALME_DESC:0 "During the tenure of Tage Erlander as Prime Minister of Sweden, Olof Palme was seen as his foremost political protégé, and his natural successor. Beginning his political career as a member of parliament, he had made his way up to the position of Minister of Education before the German invasion. Notably, Palme had served as one of the leading critics of Erlander's pro-German policies within Sweden's Social Democratic Party.\n\nWhen the German forces occupying Sweden were drawn into the Second German Civil War, the Swedish people were quick to move to re-establish Erlander as the rightfully elected Prime Minister. However, Erlander refused, solemnly accepting the blame for the weakness of Sweden in the face of German aggression. Instead, he urged the party congress to choose Palme as his successor, to carry out the rest of his term. Almost unanimously, they obliged, and the Kingdom of Sweden was reborn into democracy.\n\nDespite his government being a continuation of the one that saw Sweden integrated into the German Reich, Palme carries with him a tremendous amount of popular support. As Sweden fights for freedom from the German boot, even the People's Party has agreed to work closely with Palme's government until the crisis is resolved. It seems that the Swedish people still dream of freedom and Folkhemmet, and Palme seems to be their only hope of achieving either."

POLITICS_SULO_NYKANEN_DESC:0 "Sulo Nykänen, a name that sends shivers down the spine of any Finnish Communist. Known as "Jaala's executioner", Nykänen is renowned and reviled across Finland for his exploits in doing things many would consider to be... unsavory to Communists. He signed the death warrants for many a red back in the Finnish Civil War, letting the world know that no Communist should ever step foot in Finland ever again.\n\nAfter the civil war, Nykänen served as a spy for the Finns in the Soviet Union. He gifted them valuable intelligence during the Winter War and the Continuation War, as well as reporting partisans to the Germans and aiding them in their occupation of the Baltic. His extreme tactics at rooting out Communists did not go unnoticed by the Germans. Together, the Germans and Nykänen managed to execute hundreds of Russian partisans before the war ended. Then, Nykänen returned to his beloved Finland, where he expected to have a very long and sweet retirement in a Communist-free paradise. When the Germans invaded, Nykänen gladly accepted their reign in Finland. To him, subjugation was better than Communism. He gleefully helped the Germans root out Finnish resistance against their reign during their time in Finland, coming out of retirement to do so.\n\nThen, the Germans collapsed. Finland was left in a state of chaos. Nykänen rallied the remnants of the Finnish collaborator army and declared an independent Finland. Now the aging man sits at the top of an unstable Finnish state, leading a coalition of nationalists against whatever Communist threat may arise to Finland during the German chaos. Nykänen rules with an iron fist, determined that there will be no opposition to his hopefully short rule."

POLITICS_EFREM_CATTELAN_DESC:0 "To some, Switzerland has surrendered. It has become a part of the German Reich, another province in the wretched beast of the Reich. Not to Catellan. To him and his loyal men, Switzerland never surrendered. What surrendered was a shell, a weak imitation of the true Swiss spirit. To him, Catellan and his army are the true leaders of the Swiss, as they are the true representation of the country's will to fight.\n\nCatellan knew this was coming. He had pleaded the Swiss government to build fortifications across the nation, effectively turning the entire country into an impenetrable bunker. With Germans to the north and west, Italians to the South, and the monstrosity of Burgundy to the East, the Swiss were quick to accept this proposal. The country was fortified, totally prepared for an invasion. And it fell all the same. The Germans invaded, and the Swiss government couldn't take it.\n\nCatellan was shocked when he heard news of the surrender. His immediate gut feeling was that he should switch sides, surrender and give up. He didn't. Instead, he sent a proclamation to what was left of the army: keep fighting, no matter the cost. And so the army fought. Bunkers fell left and right, the Fascist dogs began to take the mountains. For years, the resistance fought tooth and nail to survive. It was a race against time, after all. A race the Swiss would win. And they have won. The Germans have collapsed, and Catellan has declared the independence of Switzerland. He and his men will see their homeland liberated from the jackboot no matter the cost."

POLITICS_HERBERTS_CUKURS_DESC:0 "Herberts Cukurs is incredibly angry. The German dogs ravaged his homeland when all he wanted was a purge of the Jews. And what did the Germans do for all his help? Kill Latvians and replace them with Germans! Cukurs still killed Jews, of course, he didn't want them conquering his country again. Cukurs claims to have secretly opposed the Germans during his years of collaboration. Many of those who remember said years doubt this, though they are too scared of Cukurs's tendencies for... excessive violence to state these.\n\nCukurs was once a renowned aviation pioneer, flying across the entire world and setting new records. Then the Soviet bastards invaded his proud country after it had just become independent. Cukurs was quick to join the Germans as soon as they invaded, gleefully orchestrating the mass killings of Latvian Jews. After the war was over, Cukurs enjoyed the rest of his retirement within the great state of an independent Latvia.\n\nExcept he didn't. The Germans occupied the country and annexed it into Reichskommissariat Ostland. Then Göring took power and annexed Ostland, permanently putting an end to the dream of an independent Latvia. Then Germany collapsed. And Cukurs took power in Latvia, not even making pretensions about "keeping the region stable" like the traitors to the north of him. He wants to purify Latvia of the Judeo-Bolshevik menace, and he will do so no matter how many have to be killed or maimed to do it."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KSYANEVICH_DESC:0 "The grandfather of the resistance, Ksyanevich finds himself once again at the helm of Belarus. After the Germans won he figured that Belarus would be safe, and that Ksyanevich would never be forced to take up arms again. He overestimated them. Trusted them to not ruin his beloved country. He should've known not to trust foreigners with Belarus.\n\nDuring the war, Ksyanevich was a partisan. He fought for a Belarus free from Soviet control. He was the leader of the Green Oaks, a right-wing partisan movement back in the day. He helped the Nazis in their conquest, and Belarus was freed.\n\nWell, depending on your definition of freed. Ksyanevich knew that Belarus was still under the boot of a foreign nation, but he was tired of fighting. He resigned himself to quietly live his life in this new Belarus, and to only take up arms again if Belarus should be placed into danger once more. And now Belarus is in danger. The German occupiers have collapsed in on themselves, unable to bear the weight of their empire. Local partisans have taken over Belarus, and selected Ksyanevich as their champion. Ksyanevich is too old to fight now, and not good at governing. He serves as a single, unifying force for the partisans as the grandfather of the new Belarus. He does his job to the best of his ability, and is preparing for the day when the Germans come knocking again. This time, Belarus will not be enslaved."
