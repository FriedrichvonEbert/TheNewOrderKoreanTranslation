Exerting control over the massive territory will prove a big challenge, but it is one that is worth worth taking on. Extractive industries made RK Zentralafrika far and away the most lucrative of the Nazi colonies, wealth that should be made to work for the cause of freedom instead of tyranny.\n\nThe task set out for us will not be easy. We must defeat the remnants of resistance and extend our reach throughout the colony. We must identify native leadership candidates and make the Congolese see that working with us gives them the best hope for their future. We'll also need to convince the remaining Belgians and Germans, and the powerful corporate entities they control, that compliance is their only option.

Day by day, the ad-hoc arrangements set up to deal with these issues up to now are eating up more and more time and causing more and more frustration to our officers. Clearly, we need to formalize a more efficient administration to deal with them.\n\nWe currently lack firm support from the natives, and a lot of the other locals are still tainted by their association with the old regime. Compounded by our thus far minimal capacity to properly vet and recruit, we have a limited pool to draw on.

Leaving these men to their own devices might prove dangerous, as they possess connections throughout the Congo and a knowledge of local matters that outrstrips ours. Should they decide to work against us, they could be a big nuisance indeed. That must not happen.\n\nWe must convince them instead that their best choice for the future is to support our administration. The first step to that end is to show them that they can still have a role to play in the Congo, which we can begin doing by incorporating the most willing into the lower rungs in our hierarchy.

So will the prospect of safety from the CIA, who have been on his trail since the end of the war.\n\nBy offering amnesty and reliable pay, we could turn Steiner into a formidable asset for our administration. Through him and his long list of contacts, we will finally gain access to the formidable mercenary companies employed by Zentralafrika, and their decades of experience operating under the local conditions.

Our new administration will be built from the ground up by the good and trustworthy American men and women under our leadership, helped by those we've found to be dependable among the natives.

As we work to unshackle the economic potential of our Mandate, that state of affairs is sure to change.\n\nBeyond power generation, the dam is a key part of our infrastructure, as its sluices form the link between shipping on the Congo lake and on the Congo river. It's also the single greatest point of vulnerability for Central Africa. Should the dam fail, by malice or incompetence, the flooding will be catastrophic.\n\nThis makes the dam too important to risk leaving to unreliable local leadership. Instead, continued control by the Mandate is the best way to keep the structure in safe, competent hands.

While certainly in part a result of Müllers famously \"hands-off\" approach to governorship, we've reasons to assume this was also a desired state of affairs by many - we've already uncovered enough rackets going on in the territory to make anyone want to hide their trail.\n\nRegardless of its root cause, the lack of records means we have our work cut out for us even more than we previously believed. We still need to establish working knowledge on the myriad of territories, corporations, tribes and other groupings we find ourselves in charge of, and it's becoming clear that the last regime has left us little to go on."

While the official line painted this as a result of \"superior German administration\", it was well-known that much of the economy circumvented that administration almost entirely. In reality, the territory was a haven for foreign investors, both in its extractive sectors and as a gateway to the wider Reich.\n\nWe have started to go through the papers left to us by the old regime, and while Müller kept poor records generally, we've found some surprisingly detailed accounts on their deals with foreign entities. We should open these books and learn how these deals, investments, contracts and practices made the Zentralafrikan economy generate so much wealth."

This decentralization might be key to how Müller kept a functioning economy despite his other, major flaws and we might want to tread carefully to avoid upsetting it just yet.\n\nBefore we upend the old order, we need to understand how it works and how it relates to the economy. If we are to replicate the successes of Müllers system, we must learn as much as we can on how it operates. We'll take a deep dive into the papers and accounts we have left from the old days.

As things stand, the majority of the Germans, Belgians, corporations and tribal kings that keep the country running seem willing to work with our administration. Dissolving their concessions, trust territories and tribal kingdoms will only serve to turn all of these groups against our administration.\n\nWe certainly won't be as passive as the old regime, but we will maintain its decentralization.

The extractive nature of the Central African economy, while profitable, is very vulnerable to economic shocks and dependent on foreign refineries, processing plants and manufacturers. To remedy that weakness, the \"Belgian plan\" aims to direct significant investment toward building up a domestic resource processing industry.\n\nSchramme portrays this as the natural direction of the Congolese economy. New factories and processing plants will finally utilize the generation capacity of the great Congo Dam. The very low wages paid to labourers in the Congo means that they can pay premium wages by local standards, a great boon to the natives who will be staffing the factories, and still undercut foreign manufacturers. The backing of wealthy Belgians means funding will be independent of our administration.\n\nAll the Belgians need, he says, is assurance that their efforts won't be stymied by the corrupt and ineffective governance that is all too common in our territory. The only assurance they will accept, it appears, is to have their own men and women make up more of that governance."

The latter quality is one that we can't reproduce, the former is one that we won't.\n\nTo avoid replicating the unsustainable practices of the past, we must build our administration from the ground up. Overseen by the loyal men and women in our officer corps, the new system of governance will provide transparent, responsible administration to a territory sorely needing it.

When Siegfried Müller boarded his plane and fled North, many of them followed.\n\nWe need to get the economy back to its previous heights fast. A working economy will provide a legitimacy boost to our administration and generate funds we can use to expand it.

If their current owners won't get them running, we'll find new ones who will, and under the new \"Abrams Plan\" we will have a framework to do so. All places of business must report their activity to our administration or face expropriation, and these expropriated businesses will then be redistributed to selected American companies known for reliability and skill.

Old investors will be assured that we won't place undue burdens on their businesses, and new ones will be wooed by the promises of exploiting its resources under safe, American, custodianship.

As we've made the area more secure, however, we're finally ready to open it up again. Starting now, we will let anyone who wishes to do business on the lake start up shipping and transportation.

The mercenaries have valuable experience fighting all over Central Africa, and a knowledge of local conditions and terrain which far outstrips our own. And all it'll take to harness that expertise and make it work for us is money.\n\nAbrams will meet with mercenary leaders and offer them a deal.

I think it is not so unreasonable?\"\n\nThe man wasn't wrong. His requests weren't all that unreasonable. Guarantees on the pay and the method of payment, assurance that his actions under Müller wouldn't be looked at too closely and that the CIA would stop sniffing around, and continued autonomy in Katanga. All of it was doable. And in turn? The Belgian plantation owners, corporations and mercenaries, all loyal to the Mandate.\n\n\"I appreciate your directness Mr. Schramme. If you can uphold your end of the bargain, I think I can make it all happen.\"\n\nIt'd be another long night of phone calls to get everything organized, of course, but General Abrams was used to that by now."

The Frenchman had a reputation as one of the most effective mercenary leaders in Central Africa and had been an important asset to Müller's administration, having led numerous excursions throughout the territories, often overcoming tough odds to maintain the old order.\n\nThat order was now a thing of the past, of course, but where the political priorities in Central Africa had changed, the economic and geographical realities had not, and Denard and his ilk were both a source of worry and opportunity for General Abrams.\n\n\"Perhaps we should move on to the matter of contracts, General?\"\n\nAs expected, the meeting was a mixed success. Bob Denard, tight-lipped to a fault, would never be as great a source of operational intelligence as hoped, that was clear.\n\nHe was, on the other hand, very willing to work for new paymasters. A professional force, adapted to the local conditions and with no one to mourn them back home, and all they demanded was a steady stream of dollars.\n\n\"The contracts, yes. I think you'll find most of the clauses fairly familiar. I hope your men are ready, Mr. Denard.\""

He would be key to the mission and the future of Central Africa.\n\n\"The pleasure is mine, General. I hope we can be of help to each other.\"\n\nTalking through a translator was a little awkward at first, but a necessity. Fortunately, they soon found a rhythm to the conversation.\n\n\"...And so I am prepared to offer you a key position in my administration. If you take it, you'll act as the voice of the Congolese people.\"\n\n\"I am flattered, General. You will of course understand that I want some say in decisions as well. If I represent the Congolese in government, I will also represent the government to the Congolese.\"\n\n\"What do you have in mind?\"\n\n\"We must work to make the mandatory occupation a short one. Central Africa needs her independence, after all these years she yearns for it. We are happy to be rid of the Germans, and that will give you some time, but not if you seem to overstay. In the end, you must not be another foreign oppressor, not in the public perception or in actual fact.\"\n\n\"There is also the matter of local strongmen, particularly Mobutu. If they keep receiving support and leeway to maintain order, that order will collapse the moment you leave. We need a civilian government, General, not continued military rule.\"\n\n\"I think we see eye to eye on both accounts, Mr. Kasa-Vubu. It's good to have you on board, you'll be very welcome."

I must say I'm honored by the trust that you've shown us.\"\n\n\"There are many who only know the German times now, General, but I remember the steady path to self-determination we were on under the French. I'm eager to step back on that path now, with the OFN.\"\n\n\"Well, as long as you do, we're ready to offer you all the support you need to keep the west secure within the Mandate.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that, General. We have a lot of work to do. As I'm sure you're aware, many of my countrymen have a cynical view of your presence in Africa. We must hurry to show these misguided souls that what you provide is a clear path to stable self-government. Otherwise, I fear we may not be able to keep Africa tranquil for very long.\"\n\nAbrams paid little mind to the warning, he'd heard it repeated too many times before.

Apparently, the looters and squatters who'd broken into the place during the closing chapters of the war had done remarkably little structural damage, and the refurbishments necessary to reopen the resort could be done quickly and at reasonable cost.\n\nThe other folder contained an intelligence brief which detailed the pervasiveness of the compound in resistance propaganda and its status as a symbol of inequality and oppression. In the propaganda war, it cautioned, a reopening of the resort would play into the hands of those wishing to paint the Mandate as just another colonial oppressor.\n\nIt was proving a tough decision to make. On one hand, the resort was already drawing interest from adventurous businessmen, and he'd have no problem finding investors in the venture, which would give the ailing economy in the region a much needed shot in the arm. On the other, the opulent luxury of the place was a constant reminder of colonial excess.\n\nA decision was needed, and Abrams resolved to..."

The disruption to traffic extends to many of the surrounding areas, paralysing the entire region.\n\nOur forces have scrambled to close the road and limit the worst disruption, but we expect problems to persist until the obstruction is cleared, which will take a week at minimum.\n\nThis is just the latest and most brazen of a series of similar strikes, all aiming to disrupt our operations and force an earlier exit from the Mandate."

Worse, they were seemingly shifting their focus to target his administration and economic interests more specifically. It seemed the Germans were organizing into a more cohesive force, one which could wreak a lot of damage if left unchecked.\n\nIt was an unacceptable situation. The General couldn't, and wouldn't, let the Germans creep back in and undermine the mission and the Mandate. They had to be stopped!\n\nAbrams had already resolved to organize a new operation.
