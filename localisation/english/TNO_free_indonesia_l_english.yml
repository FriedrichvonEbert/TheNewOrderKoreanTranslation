 POLITICS_HATTA_FRI_DESC:0 "Mohammad Hatta was born in 1902 and raised by his mother's affluent family. Their wealth afforded him the opportunity to attend school where he learned Dutch. He took an early interest in politics after reading about debates in the Volksraad concerning Indonesian independence and autonomy. He continued his higher education in the Netherlands where he became an unceasing advocate for Indonesian independence, resulting in a six month imprisonment. Upon his return to Indonesia in 1932, his struggle for independence became more direct until the end of Dutch colonial rule and the start of Japanese occupation.\n\nHatta served as a member of the advisory council to the Japanese occupation government until 1950 when Indonesia was officially granted independence and Hatta was appointed Vice President. The next decade proved to be strenuous for the infant country, with frequent political infighting, deadly communist terrorist attacks, and an ever strengthening grip of Tokyo, despite Indonesia's official sovereignty.\n\nPresident Sukarno's declaration of martial law and final consolidation of military and political power has forced Hatta to face a revolting truth: Indonesia is still as much of a colony as it was under the Dutch. Striking a tenuous alliance with Islamists, communists, and disgruntled generals, he has become the face of the anti-Sukarno rebellion. His nation, Indonesia, tears itself apart in a final, ultimate struggle for freedom. Only time will tell if Hatta's dream will ever be realized."
 FIELD_MARSHAL_JOOP_WAROUW:0 "Joop Warouw believes in Indonesia. He believed in Indonesia during the National Revolution when he showed valor again and again in the fight against the Dutch. He believed in Indonesia during the first years of Independence, trusting in men like Hatta and Sukarno to build the new nation. His faith faltered with the passage of Presidential Decree no. 321/1965, but after Hatta's speech and subsequent revolt, it was inflamed once again. Joop Warouw believes in Indonesia and that belief may yet carry him through this conflict and, finally, to an Indonesia worth believing in."
 GENERAL_SUTOMO:0 "Sutomo \"Bung Tomo\" is, or was, one of the few men in the military with a conscience. The corruption, the abuses of power, and the dereliction of duty to the nation disgusted him. When rumours of resistance against Sukarno, whom Sutomo viewed as one of the worst offenders of self interest above that of Indonesia's, he covertly put as much support as he could behind the nascent revolution. With Hatta's speech and the declaration of a new, free Indonesia, he put his oratory skills, second only to Sukarno, to good use, convincing a decent amount of troops to defect alongside him in the struggle for a government that puts the good of the nation before the weight of its pockets."

Natsir wants an Islamic Indonesia, built on the Koran and united by faith in Allah.

Initial necessity promoted cooperation between the two factions, with large differences being conveniently ignored. With the Revolution in full swing, however, and a new status quo established, opposing ideas and beliefs butt heads openly, weakening morale and turning comrades against one another.\n\nEveryday the divide grows and tensions escalate. Soldiers establish informal gangs along political lines while their officers strike secret deals.

At least the communists had bothered to send a letter. The Islamists didn't even give him that courtesy.\n\nHe sighed. It wasn't surprising. Not really. Still, he had hoped. To hope against all odds is the worst hope, because one knows there is no chance, yet is disappointed to be correct. He wondered if there was anything he could have done. Maybe, but it was too late now.\n\nAll of his work. All he sacrificed. All that everyone in the whole fucking country had sacrificed. All the lives. All the hopes.\n\nHatta felt a flash of anger. He wanted to kill someone. He wanted to gut the communists. He wanted to fill the Islamists with lead. He raised his hand, preparing to slam it down on the desk. His raised fist, zealous and right, froze the air with cold rage.\n\nAnd then he lowered it softly. His fear and hatred vanished. He was alone in his office.

Suakrno was the enemy, not the comrades opposing him.\n\nThe leaders, ever orthodox, were less convinced. Their movement was their power. They would not surrender to Hatta's idealism so readily.

The communists were upset that Hatta, the reactionary fool, thought democracy was anything other than the dictatorship of capital. The Islamists were furious that Hatta had neglected to mention Allah even once. Everyone in between interpreted the naive call for unity as weak appeasement.\n\nThe leaders of the factions capitalized on the controversy.

He could feel the anger from both parties pass through him.\n\nThe meeting began with the expected bluster.\n\n\"We must nationalize all industry for the proletariat!\"\n\n\"We must declare Islam to be the state religion!\"\n\nHatta listened patiently, making subtle comments to ensure the arguments never turned to violence, or worse, the cessation of negotiations. Soon, the initial radical demands subsided. The raging accusations turned into something resembling a debate. Unity was not achieved, but, for the first time, the two heads of the Indonesian Revolution listened to each other.\n\nHatta felt the tension dissipate slowly. Although the distrust had not disappeared completely and there was much work to be done, Hatta could not help but feel pride. He had done the impossible."

It was impossible, yet real.\n\nThe leadership of the Islamists and the communists had formally announced their cooperation in the struggle to overthrow Sukarno and establish a democratic government. They called on their followers to, from this point onwards, avoid violence with the other.\n\nThis new spirit of camaraderie was not as idealistic as Hatta had hoped, however. The Islamists were motivated, not out of love for the communists, but hatred of Sukarno. They made this eminently clear in a slew of speeches and announcements, labeling Sukarno as the greater evil and the reds as allies of convenience. The communists, in a similar fashion, have vowed to do away with Sukarno first and break the chains of the workers second.\n\nStill, the importance of this truce, although temporary, cannot be overstated.

The dismissive, witty rhetoric that emboldened opposition. Stuck in place, a museum dedicated to his failure, available to inspect at his leisure.\n\n\"Please,\" he cried. \"We can resolve this.\"\n\nAs he spoke, time began to move.

Suddenly, everything was real: The shouts, the accusations, the proud bodies leaving the room, the altercations taking place outside.
