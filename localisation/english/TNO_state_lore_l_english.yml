 # Notes
 
 # [GetSLName] is a scripted loc used to get custom names, for example, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macaw's name is called "The Three Pearls" instead of the usual state name it's parented in, located in TNO_state_lore_misc_scripted_localisation.txt
 
 # INITIALS are preferably airport codes: for example LAX as Los Angeles, but not when it doesn't make sense, i.e. OPO as Porto. I chose to use POR in that case.

 state_lore_desc.3: "There exists few twin cities around the world, most cities differ in one way or another with their neighboring cities, but such is not the case with Yokohama and Tōkyō.\n\nAt face value, these two cities can be seen as carbon copies of each other. Tōkyō and Yokohama are the largest and second largest cities respectively in terms of population size, they are both economically vital to the Japanese Empire, and they are both large port cities with hundreds of ships dropping anchor there each day.\n\nThe city's prominence as a port city can be traced back from near the end of the Edo period, and it is where Commodore Perry first landed and forced in the modern age.\n\nToday, along with civilian ships, Yokohama is a major naval base for IJN fleets, enforcing the will of the Empire around the home islands as well as a base of operations for naval movements across the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Pacific Ocean."

These days only a small fraction of that number turn up for work every day, and a different flag flies over the warships that fill the harbor.\n\nAs one of the two Japanese concessions bordering the American mainland, the port of LA is a constant hotspot of world tension.

Though it has since been surpassed in size by the likes of Los Angeles and San Diego, it retains its importance as a center of American finance and cultural development.\n\nThe rolling hills and rail-lined streets of San Francisco have long been a home to America's more eccentric elements and the budding counterculture, most recently manifesting as the beat movement of the 1950s, though many suspect this is only a hint of what is soon to come for the city by the bay."

One of the farthest flung territories of the Japanese Empire, the port of San Francisco is a major asset to the sphere.\n\nThe tiny sliver of Japanese territory, along with its southern counterpart in Los Angeles, are constant sources of tension between two of the world's superpowers, but as long as the Japanese retain their ability to immediately threaten the entire west coast, they're happy to pay that price.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_desc.8: "The very definition of a city that never sleeps, New York City is the fruit of the labor of generations of hardworking individuals, with an astounding amount of commerce passing through it each and every day.\n\nFirst settled by the Dutch in 1624 as New Amsterdam, it changed hands over the centuries and now stands as a proud bastion of American freedoms, exemplified by the Statue of Liberty in its harbor. Countless different cultures have taken root in the city, long a relative safe haven for oppressed peoples from all over the world from tyranny in their distant homelands.\n\nEqually attractive as the open mindedness of the city, however, are its open markets, being one of the premier centers of international business and finance as well as the greatest display of American economic might. There's always something to do in New York City for any person willing to pay the right price."

 state_lore_desc.9: "To describe Washington, D.C. as just a city would be entirely inappropriate. D.C. is more than a collection of buildings or roads, it is more than the amalgamation of human will, forced together into an urban sprawl that defines D.C.\n\nNo, what defines D.C. best is the building on the hill- the home of freedom and security, in a world where such a commodity is hard to come by. Such freedom is not fought over for the denizens of this city, but fought with, in the halls of Congress, where issues of undeniable importance are fought over and where the future of the nation as a whole is decided.\n\nWith the stirring winds of democracy blowing strong, and the future uncertain as ever, these freedoms of democracy are more than something to ensure freedom, but something to hold on to in these turbulent times. May they protect us forevermore."

 state_lore_desc.10: "Rome, the Eternal City, stands as the jewel of the Mediterranean and the capital of the Italian Empire. Founded millennia ago by Romulus on the banks of the Tiber, few cities- if any- can claim such an expansive history. Indeed, there's not an inch of the city that isn't rich with the legacy of the Roman Empire, the pride of Italian history.\n\nDespite the invasions, plagues, and misfortunes that have fallen on the city before, Rome has always emerged from the rubble, ready to rebuild- and, in doing so, has cemented its place as the center of Italy. It is here where the King, the Pope, and the Duce stay, and it is here that the Italian government sits, along with artists, culinary geniuses, and romantics from across the world.\n\nMake no mistake- Rome has survived thousands of years before, and- barring the apocalypse- it will survive thousands of years more."

 state_lore_desc.11: "Previously devastated by over two years under siege during the Spanish Civil War, Madrid has recovered to become the largest and wealthiest city in Iberia.\n\nThe unique and varied designs of Madrid's "Gran Vía" is admired by architects and artists the world over. Most of the country's brightest minds attend university here, nearly all Iberian films are produced here, and most of Iberia's largest companies are headquartered here. destination in the country.\n\nAs Iberians increasingly choose to leave the countryside for the city, tens of thousands move to Madrid every year, this rapid expansion has made Madrid into one of the single largest cities in Europe--and there are no signs that this growth is slowing down."

 state_lore_desc.12: "At the mouth of the Elbe lies the Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the third largest city in Germany behind only Vienna and Germania itself. The birthplace of the Hanseatic league, since medieval times Hamburg has been the preeminent naval port connecting Germany to the rest of the world. In the post-war order, her stature only becomes more significant.\n\nBut little is stable in Hamburg. A hotbed of liberal agitation since the 19th century, Hamburg now finds itself torn between the reformists, the conservatives, and behind closed doors, even anti-fascist revolutionaries.\n\nBut for the subversives captured by the Gestapo, a horrible fate lies just a few miles upstream. There sits Neuengamme, the largest concentration camp in Germany proper, a symbol of Nazi tyranny in the eyes of nearly the entire world."

 state_lore_initials.13: "FRA"
 state_lore_name.13: "프랑크푸르트암마인"
 state_lore_desc.13: "Lying directly in the center of Central Europe's most densely populated and economically productive region, Frankfurt am Main is in many senses an enormous monument to German industry. Every year, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all the Reich make Frankfurt their home.\n\nBefore Hitler's rise to power, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all Europe would seek to make Frankfurt their home. Once the home of Germany's largest Jewish community, widely regarded as the birthplace of German liberalism, and recognized as a center of the European labor movement, Frankfurt has now stagnated for decades, as skill and ingenuity are abandoned for the convenience of slave labor.\n\nNevertheless, Frankfurt remains one of Germany's largest cities, and serves as the main railway junction between the Rhineland and the rest of the country."

 state_lore_initials.14: "MUC"
 state_lore_name.14: "뮌헨"
 state_lore_desc.14: "München, also known as Munich in English, has played a pivotal role in German history for centuries. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria, hosting thinkers and creators from Max Planck to Richard Wagner. But it took on a far greater significance in the last half-century: the cradle of the Nazi Party.\n\nFollowing the German defeat in the First World War, München was a chaotic place, as two competing revolutionary socialist governments clashed with the Freikorps in the streets. It was in this environment where a small group of nationalist ideologues and disgruntled veterans coalesced to form the German Workers' Party.\n\nOne of its members, an Austrian-born veteran named Adolf Hitler, would climb the ranks and become its leader, transforming it into the National Socialist German Workers' Party. It was in the beer halls of München that Hitler built his first power base, and launched his failed putsch in 1923. It was where the Nazi Party established their national headquarters. And it was where Hitler convinced the British and French to cede him Czechoslovakia to secure a peace he had no intent of keeping. München remains a bastion of Nazism today, and he who is most influential in it has the key to the Nazi heartland."

 state_lore_desc.15: "Sitting beside Iberia's most fertile estuary, atop a mountain of iron ore, Bilbao was always destined to become one of the great industrial cities of Iberia. But Bilbao is also the cultural capital of the Basque people, who have lived in Iberia for centuries and likely millennia, longer than the Latins.\n\nGradually stripped of their autonomy, and their traditional culture challenged by Spaniard encroachment, much of the city's youth views 'Iberian unity' as a polite euphemism for repression. Bilbao will no doubt be the site of many political battles in coming years."

 state_lore_desc.16: "The head and heart of Catalonia was the first of Iberia's cities to fully industrialize, but recent decades have brought immense hardship to the people of Iberia's largest Mediterranean city.\n\nFor two and a half years during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the capital of an abortive anarchist revolution. In a city further destabilized by repressive policies targeting the Catalan people, and further jeopardized by Atlantropa, the memory of that revolution lives on.\n\nBarcelona has suffered from steady economic decline in recent decades. Should the situation fail to improve, already widespread anti-government and separatist sentiments may become overwhelming."

 state_lore_initials.17: "POR"
 state_lore_name.17: "포르토"
 state_lore_desc.17: "Portugal's second largest city was the birthplace of the medieval Portuguese Kingdom, as well as the 1926 revolution which began Salazar's rise to power.\n\nThough the exceptionally fast growth of Lisbon has reduced the relative importance of Porto it remains the largest manufacturing hub in the whole country. The population of Porto is somewhat more conservative than the rest of Portugal, and support for Iberian Unity is much higher than in Lisbon."

 state_lore_desc.18: "The former Portuguese capital was largely spared from the past decades of conflict and upheaval in Europe. Untouched by the Spanish Civil War, the Second World War, or the Atlantropa Project, Lisbon has been allowed to flourish more than any other major city in Western Europe.\n\nIts shipping industry has nearly tripled in size since 1930, making it the largest port city in Iberia. Continued urbanization and an increase in immigrants from Spain ensures that this center of Portuguese academia and culture continues to be one of the fastest growing cities on the peninsula."

 state_lore_desc.19: "The heart of the old Spanish empire, Sevilla was one of the largest, wealthiest, and most magnificent cities in early-modern Europe. With the construction of the Gibraltar Dam, vast quantities of goods traded between the Mediterranean and the Americas now must pass through Sevilla to be shipped abroad, increasing trade activity in the city to levels not seen since the heyday of the Spanish Empire.\n\nThough its population is not rising as rapidly as that of Lisbon, Sevilla has resumed its place as one of the most prosperous cities of Iberia. Concerning to some and inspirational to others, Sevilla is also Iberia's most prominent centers of underground liberal political organization in the country."

Kings, Cardinals, and Emperors alike constructed fortifications all across Brest and used the city as one huge naval base.\n\nThe city both saw American forces land during the First World War and gave the German Navy a launching point during the Second World War. In fact, World War II saw the city almost destroyed completely from battle after battle.

Nowadays, Poitiers finds itself in an interesting position, halfway between Paris and Bordeaux.

The city has been in French hands continuously since the Fifteenth Century, and the citizens have been good to France; the city was the temporary capital during World War I.\n\nHowever, German dominance worked once again to stomp the French out of Paris and resettle them back in Bordeaux, and residents have been suffering ever since.

It was arguably the proudest city in Europe until Hitler's forces captured the city in 1940, desecrating centuries of French prominence in Europe.\n\nA decade later, in the 1950s, the city was shattered in two with the founding of Himmler's shadow state, stretching from Nord-Paris to the Benelux.\n\nThough families remain split between life and eternal torment, the southern half of Paris remains a bright beacon of hope for Frenchmen everywhere, a sign that one day, all will be set right as it once was."

It was established by Viking raiders in the 10th century, and became the first Norman foothold on the island in 1171. It spent the following 750 years as the center of English, and later British, rule in Ireland, until Irish independence was achieved in 1921.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland selected the city as their capital, the greatest gem in the Emerald Isle's crown.

It grew even further in the 19th century and became the heart of Irish industry, though its swelling population led to rising tensions between Catholic and Protestant residents. However, it was still a town dominated by pro-British Unionists, and became the capital of British North Ireland following the south's independence.\n\nThat all changed in the 1940s, when the Germans swept into Britain and the Republic took over the whole island.

Truro stands on the western periphery, in Cornwall, of the British Isles. From Truro, you would only need to take a trip to find yourself confronted by the omnipotent, seething waves of the dark, blue Atlantic. Many, during its long and storied history, have gazed into the ocean and thought of what lay on the other side of the barrier. Many cities in the New World were even named after the idyllic Cornish town when its inhabitants finally reached their shores.\n\nTruro can only cling onto those wistful memories now. When the Germans landed on British soil and forced England to bend the knee to the overpowering might of the Nazi Empire, they chose Plymouth as their personal fiefdom to lord over.\n\nWhile Truro is not yet under the Kruppstahl fist of Germania, Halder's men breathe down the neck of the resort town.

Originally a Bolivian nitrate mining settlement, the nascent "La Chimba" was the center of a massive Chilean immagration wave in the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\nA lucrative mining town with a large ethnic minority on an international border was, unsurprisingly, a center of conflict. Growing tension between Chile and Bolivia over territorial disputes and a Bolivian tax on Chilean nitrate mining companies would culminate in the 4 year long War of the Pacific. Chile, despite the odds, defeated the combined Bolivian and Peruvian armies over the course of the war, ultimately gaining the resource-rich Bolivian coastline, including the city of Antofagasta.\n\nNow, Antofagasta is the center of one of the world's largest nitrate and copper mining operations, and modern innovations in the field of electrochemistry mean that the mining companies have begun to tap into the region's large lithium reserves.

The Chileans arrived a single day before the French, who themselves were narrowly ahead of the British.

The city's location on the undisputed center of Atlantic-Pacific trade as well as the discovery of gold contributed to the city's massive growth in the late 1800s, and while the opening of the Panama Canal caused the city to fall from its mercantile apoapsis and stagnate, it is still a city of key strategic and cultural importance.

Independence movements and guerilla forces plagued the peninsula as the Japanese fought back with greater and greater force, with some insurgents even spreading to areas of outer Manchuria.\n\nPerhaps it is here, in Keijō, that this cycle was avoided, and its goals of Japanization and industrialization met in some aspects.

In any Chinese dynasty, Chengdu almost always headed Sichuan, and sometimes even the central government.\n\nIn the Second Sino-Japanese War, while Chongqing headed the government and military high command, Chengdu provided refuge to many military headquarters and provided a safe place for armies to regroup, if the skies stayed clear that is. Chongqing and Chengdu faced almost constant bombardment by Japanese bombers during the war, with the Chinese airforce unable to provide significant resistance. With Japanese boots in Chengdu by 1947, they found themselves in a city of rubble.\n\nWhile the city's large population and the plentiful resources of the Sichuan Basin resulted in a speedy recovery for Chengdu, being more than 800 miles away from Nanjing meant that when Japanese forces left China and the RGOC took over occupation, resistance cells activated en-masse. Communists, Nationalists, peasants, bandits, and countless more rise against the central government for a Free China, or simply for their own personal benefit.

With a history dating back at least 3,000 years, Chongqing has often been at the center of Chinese politics, with many governments having the city as their head. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang's Kuomintang was one such government. Being the head of operations for the Chinese and American armies in China and South East Asia, Chongqing faced heavy bombing by the Japanese. While much of the population was able to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the cities industry was hit hard by Japanese attacks, and when Japanese troops finally occupied the city during the waning stages of the war, there wasn't much left.\n\nOf course, Chongqing's population wasn't content with a ruined city. Chongqing's position in the Sichuan basin gave it ample resources to rebuild, and together with its large population, Chongqing was able to rebuild faster than most Chinese cities. Of course, to end here would be telling only half of the story.\n\nFar away from Nanjing and the central government, Sichuan has often been difficult for the RGOC to control. Communist guerillas, Kuomintang hold-outs, and unhappy peasants are in near-constant uprising and make Chongqing's wealth much harder for the central government to exploit. Unlike in other provinces, such as Shanxi, Nanjing is much more unwilling to give the riches of Sichuan to a power-hungry warlord. This arrangement means that while Chongqing is a city full of wealth and industry, it goes unused and unavailable.

That was until 1919 and the advent of the 21 demands, seeing Japan cement its hold over German operations in Shandong, including the vital Jiaoji railway that connected Jinan to the sea. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Jinan was targeted early on in the war due to its strategic importance.\n\nIn late 1937, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River and began marching towards the city. Chinese troops abandoned Jinan and were ordered to burn down government buildings, as well as the Japanese consulate. The ensuing power vacuum led to Jinan descending into chaos. Japanese forces arrived in the city less than a week later, quelling the chaos and beginning their harsh occupation. Jinan, being developed by both German and Japanese investors in years past, had large industries that the Japanese took full advantage of for their war effort.\n\nAfter the Japanese war economy began to demobilize and move out of the area, failings of the new central government began to arise.

After the capture of Taiyuan in late 1937, the Japanese exploited Taiyuan to its fullest extent. Taiyuan was able to supply the IJA well in its campaigns to root out the Communist base areas in Northern China. Taiyuan saw little growth during this time, as resources and material were shipped out of the mountains of Shanxi and into the war machine of Japan. Due to its manufacturing importance, Taiyuan was going to be an important city for the new central government to control.\n\nUnfortunately for the RGOC, the situation on the ground was becoming less and less favorable for the central government. Unable to control the outer reaches of China, the new government allied with Yan Xishan, granting him de facto control of the province. With Yan now dead, Fu Zuoyi ruled as his successor and proved to be much more conservative than Yan.

When the Northern Expedition reached Jiangsu, the Kuomintang government fought back and forth with local warlords and Beiyang splitters. Eventually coming under the control of the KMT in late 1927, Xuzhou was looking to be an important city for the government to occupy if they wanted to stay in control of the lands around the Yellow River.\n\nIn 1938, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in full swing, the Japanese army descended on Xuzhou, sending panic through Chinese high command. The defense of Xuzhou was rushed, and while they showed early success in nearby battles, the situation was determined unwinnable and orders for a general retreat were given. Chinese forces breached the dykes holding back the Yellow River to cover their retreat, and the consequential 1938 Yellow River Flood destroyed much of Xuzhou and other nearby settlements.\n\nMore than 20 years after the horrific flood that flattened the city, Xuzhou is once more a jewel of the North China Plain, but to call the wounds of the Second Sino-Japanese War healed would be inaccurate.

This is not to be unfair to modern Iquique; a wave of European immagration in the early 20th century as well as the city being declared one of Chile's two free ports led to immense development of the city.

Founded in 1563 as a town meant for mining silver, the city instead grew around the large iron deposits of Cerro de Mercado. The mining bonanza led to the construction of many colonial-era mansions in the city's center.\n\nDuring the War of Independence, many leaders were executed in Durango on July 17th, 1812. Durango joined the Mexican Revolution in 1911, but its capture and burning by insurgents in 1913 plunged the city into a decades-long depression. Recovery has only begun in the past decade as droughts and industrial development pushed rural migrants into Durango."

Founded at the intersection of the rivers Chuviscar and Sacramento, Chihuahua is nothing more than an agricultural center; it's simply a trading post for cattle on their way to the Golden Arches of the United States.\n\nWhen visiting the dusty, neon-stained downtown, lined with nothing but 12-foot glowing signs advertising a fermented escape, it is impossible to conceptualize the past and the future both of this city.\n\nChihuahua, behind its deceptive haze of lotus-eater-urban-ruralism, has been everything from the capital for Benito Juárez's government-in-exile to the headquarters of Pancho Villa's División del Norte. It has been the unwilling host to Miguel Hidalgo when he faced execution. It served as the de facto capital of Nueva Vizcaya, the first province of New Spain to be settled. Even the name "Chihuahua" is ancient, far older than the Spanish conquest; it comes from the Nahuatl language, and it fittingly means "between two waters." This moment in the city's history, the image of a desert Sodom meant only for the desperate and the foolish, this is only a momentary embarrassment.\n\nThe historical city of bankers and businessmen from the era of Porfirio Díaz will return, and with increasing American business opportunities just north of the border (and a few manufacturing plants just south of it), it is sure to return faster than anyone expected."

The name of both city and state is half derived from Louis IX, the saint and King of France, and half confusingly derived from the Bolivian city of Potosí (the logic of that being based on the hope that the nearby mines would become as deep and rich as the famously wealthy mines of Potosí, Bolivia).\n\nThe sprawling city is home and host to some of the key elements of the Mexican manufacturing industry, and its position at the heart of the triangle formed by Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey have secured its place as an economically vital city with a high standard of living. Historically, the region has been referred to as "El Gran Tunal", or "The Great Prickly Pear" due to the force with which the native people resisted the Spanish tide, and while the city is far from the days of conquistador and missionary, the people of SLP still hold their heads high with pride in their city.

During the dawn of the 19th century, Bogotá became a hub for republican and revolutionary sentiments, and after the fall of Spain to the Napoleonic armies, the Supreme Junta of the Kingdom of New Grenada. The city would change hands frequently between royalists and revolutionaries during the Hispanic American wars of independence, but it would ultimately be renamed Bogotá in honor of the Muisca people and declared the capital of the new state of Colombia.\n\nAfter more than 100 years of independence, Bogotá has seen a great deal of unrest and upheaval.

The island was intended to be the cornerstone of Britain's naval defence strategy in Southeast Asia, only to be captured by Japanese forces before the Royal Navy could arrive.\n\nThe city's multiethnic population of Chinese, Malays and Indians would once again find itself a pivotal fortress of foreign occupiers as result of the Malayan Emergency. In a time of uncertainty, who will rule Singapore by the end of the sixties remains an open question."

 state_lore_desc.177: "Once a small hamlet of Chinese and Malay tin miners, Kuala Lumpur was formally established in 1857, and later developed into a regional capital by British colonial interests. The city grew rapidly in the early twentieth century with the advent of the Selengor rubber boom, and is now the largest city in Malaysia.\n\nA major industrial hub and existing under no formal government, Kuala Lumpur has been both a key strategic point and a beating heart of exploitation under twenty years of Japanese military rule."

 state_lore_desc.178: "The seat of empires, and the undisputed throne of India - regardless of who rules, because for there to be a nation at all it must be ruled from Delhi. Even its earliest recorded history marks it as the foundation of a dynasty that conquered much of the subcontinent - hosting first the Delhi Sultanate, then the mighty Mughal Empire, and then falling under the control of the British, following which it lay dormant as the Raj found itself administered from Calcutta.\n\nYet even the most foreign rulers of India yet found themselves lured to Delhi, finally shifting the seat of power all the way west as the city once more found itself the nucleus of an empire, and transformed under their rule. Bearing the indelible heritage of its many overlords and occupants - architectural, cultural, and in demographics - Delhi as a whole is a microcosm of the mighty diversity that the Republic of India seeks its strength and legitimacy from. The British may have been kicked out, and India may be ruled by Indians - but power comes from Delhi still.\n\nWell, almost."

 state_lore_desc.179: "For being the home of the Government of Free India and the focus point of hefty forces of nationalism and patriotism, Calcutta was born not as one of the nations' innumerable settlements with histories stretching back into the dimness of the far past, but as an explicit incarnation of imperialist desire - specifically, the East India Company's desire to carve an empire using the forces of capital. As the Company's ambitions grew, so did Calcutta - till, inevitably, they went too far, and the oversized holdings of a corporation became the vast sprawl of a new colonial enterprise.\n\nNevertheless, as India entered the modern age, so did the city, sparking cultural renaissance, industrial revolution, and becoming the centrepoint of the nation's freedom struggle as it changed and transformed. Now, as the seat of the Forward Bloc and the movement that challenges Delhi for overlordship of an entire subcontinent, Calcutta finds itself once more the base for lofty ambitions encompassing the vastness of India.\n\nVastness to conquer, or vastness to be swallowed whole by..."

 state_lore_desc.180: "Situated near the mouth of the Indus river, Karachi serves a vital role in connecting the western regions of India with the rest of the nation - both via its natural harbour and extensive railway connections. This spirit of integration is reflected in its demography as well - with thousands of migrants from every far corner of the country represented, the city is one of India's major population hotspots, and military-industrial centres, being close to the frontline of the frozen conflict that looms heavily over the entire region.\n\nKarachi is also a hotly contested flashpoint between the Pakistan Movement and anti-partition organisations in alliance with the Indian National Congress - though if this contest should ever leave the realm of the entirely political, the city's diversity might be turned against it. As history has shown, the brotherhood of neighbours can be sacrificed at a moment's notice to the bloodlust of a mob..."

 state_lore_desc.181: "One of South India's most important centres since antiquity, Madras formed the crux of British India's control of the trans-Deccan - an area dominated by large princely states that had declared their allegiance early and thus preserved their fiefdoms. As such, even after the nation's sudden independence and the ignoble ends of those feudal realms, the city forms the core of the new Republic's policies in the South and remains hotly contested between establishment Congress stalwarts and the growing 'Dravidian' movement, between Telugu and Tamil linguistic movements, and even hosting a significant Forward Bloc subparty.\n\nEven outside the political realm, Madras is one of the most rapidly industrialising cities in the south, with several significant architectural and development projects planned in and around it. For better or for worse, the city seems to be transforming monumentally with every passing month as it reinvents itself into the future - a characteristic it shares with the nation as a whole."

 state_lore_desc.182: "When one thinks of India's great princely states, the first name that comes to mind is of course Hyderabad - the largest, strongest, and most fantastically rich of those realms that swore their allegiance to the British Raj. And yet, though the former Nizam may have been possibly the richest man in the world, his subjects languished under a feudal system that was downright mediaeval - a state of affairs that lasted unchanged till the sudden, ignoble end of the Raj herself. Suddenly free from obligation to an imperial overlord, the Nizam attempted to seize his independence and march Hyderabad onto the world stage as a nation of its own - until the Indian National Army marched to his borders, and he realised that obligations were not all he had lost - there was no longer any British Army to protect him from his own subjects.\n\nNow, Hyderabad exists as the grand capital of a nonexistent kingdom, the administrative centre of a state melding several linguistic minorities that seek to join states of their own majority or separate entirely, and a major centre of both Communist and (underground) Forward Bloc support within the Republic of India. With a reorganisation of Indian states imminent, only time will tell what the future will bring for the city."

 state_lore_desc.183: "Perhaps no other city received as much attention from both the British and the independence movement as Bombay - the city that was simultaneously the icon of the Raj and India (as perceived by the West), forming its financial and railway capital, and the place where the Quit India Movement that started the chain of events that led to the Raj's end was launched.\n\nWith a cosmopolitan demographics representative of all parts of the country, and a key position as the centre of Bombay State encompassing much of Western India, Bombay is also the focus of a fierce political struggle - as the Maharashtra movement gathers more and more steam, the future of both the city and the state that currently bears its name is in the air. However, with its exploding population, significant political mobilisation, industrialization - especially in the textiles field - and position as India's chief naval logistics hub, Bombay will remain the nation's gateway to the world, and vice-versa."
