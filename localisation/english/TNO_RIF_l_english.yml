 #Characters
 RIF_Mohamed_Choukri:0 "Mohamed Choukri"
 POLITICS_MOHAMED_CHOUKRI_DESC:0 "Mohamed Choukri never envisaged himself as a politician, preferring to write and teach instead. However, due to the chaos brought upon from Iberia, he now finds himself as the President of the rump state of the Rif republic. Born during a famine into a broken home with an abusive father, Choukri has only ever known strife whether it be homelessness, drug addiction, prostitution, or poverty; upon which he wrote extensively about. His magnum opus, "For Bread Alone", was an autobiographical account of his childhood detailing his struggle and its visceral detail showcased the determination and strength of Choukri's character to the people he now intends to lead. Having only become literate in his 20s, Choukri has travelled far in a very short amount of time and it remains to be seen how much further he will be able to go.\n\nChoukri's upbringing resonates not only with many of the people in the Rif, but all of Morocco itself where they see the lavish life of the Alaouites juxtaposed with their own poverty stricken existence. Despite this, his experience with drug abuse and prostitution has led to uproar from the more zealous of the imams and the general populace. Now, standing as the figurehead of the Rif Republic, Choukri aims to establish democracy in all of Morocco and to prevent any child from going through the dread he experienced in his youth, but whether this is possible relies on his ability to balance the variety of political parties that vie for power within the young republic and whether he can garner the  public support necessary to raise the armies needed to fight that despot, Hassan II."
