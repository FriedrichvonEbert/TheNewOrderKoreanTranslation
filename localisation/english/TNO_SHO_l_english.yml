 ###DESCRIPTIONS###
 POLITICS_YAMAMOTO_MOICHIRO_DESC:0 "For Major General Yamamoto Moichiro, Malaya was supposed to be one last hurrah in a storied, politically fruitful yet bloodied career throughout Japan's conquests of China and the former Dutch East Indies. When the Malayan revolt broke out following the collapse of the talks between the Marai Hokokai and the ever-increasingly centralising Republic of Indonesia, Yamamoto was reassigned from Java, being an important contributor to the negotiation of Indonesian "independence", to step in and lead the Japanese intervention.\n\nThe initial phases of the intervention were successful, as the United Malayan Anti-Japanese Front was driven out of major population centres in most of Malaya, barring the resource-rich and strategically vital regions of northern Perak and Pahang. Ever since then however, Yamamoto's last hurrah has turned into a rapidly deteriorating quagmire, with a disappearing enemy incredibly proficient in jungle warfare. However, the situation does not end there - in fact, it's even worse than expected.\n\nWith the Republic of India, and some say the OFN aiding the broad front of anti-Japanese insurgents, Yamamoto has resorted to escalation: a rational measure in his eyes, as the Malayan population has been incredibly resistant to Japanese efforts at collaboration. To this end, he has brought some of the original architects of Malayan victory, such as the infamous counter-insurgency strategist Nishiura Susumu. Time is against Yamamoto however, as his own retirement looms large - and so does the momentum of UMAJF."

 ##IDEAS##
 SHO_Zaibatsu:0 "Bounty of the Rising Sun"
 SHO_Zaibatsu_desc:0 "Shonan's position as a satellite state of Japan has led to many things both politically and economically, but a prominent example of the latter is economic domination by the Japanese conglomerates known as Zaibatsus. The Zaibatsus' poor Malayan labourers work with inhumane conditions for long hours and little to no pay, effectively creating a system of slavery. Malaya has the potential to shine as brightly as the star of the Prosperity Sphere, all we need is crush the rebellions once and for all."

 SHO_Dai-nijyugo:0 "제25군의 고향"
 SHO_Dai-nijyugo_desc:0 "The 25th, the proud upholders of Shonan!\nOn paper, at least.\nIn practice, the 25th is nothing but a shell of it's former self, the 10 years of constant fighting back and forth with the rebels have whittled the once proud army into an undermanned, underfed and underequipped force. What keeps it going, is the supplies from Japan itself, and the weariness of their enemies. For good or bad, the 25th needs to win, as another loss will be final nail in its coffin."

 SHO_minority:0 "A Divided Collaboration Network"
 SHO_minority_desc:0 "The long decade of conflict with the Malayan rebels left our network of allies, stretched thin as it started, even more radicalized, and torn apart. Informants we could trust turned as double agents, and individuals thought neutral at best turned into rebellion sympathizers. Not to say of our own "loyal" collaborators, transparent in their desire for personal power. Even so, it is what we have, and what Yamamoto will work with, for good or bad."

 SHO_Marai_Giyugun_Auxiliaries:0 "Marai Giyugun Auxiliaries"
 SHO_Marai_Giyugun_Auxiliaries_desc:0 "Local militia, sympathizers to our regime and Pan-Asianism still exist through Malaya, fighting against the perverse rebels and their western masters. While, in an ideal situation, their work would be rewarded with a nod, and not much more of it, the 25th's decrepit state means whatever fully abled person able to take a gun and fight is more than welcome."


 
 ###LEADER DESCRIPTIONS###
 ####EVENTS####
 sho.0.t:0 "Shonan- Light of the South"
 sho.0.d:0 "Malaya and Singapore found themselves as one of the old British Empire's graveyards. The total rout and surrender of it's commonwealth garrison in February 1942, while morale crushing, would not be the empire's last. Since then, the former colony found itself under the grip of the Japanese and their collaborators.\n\nEducation was now conducted in Nippon-Go. Veneration of the Emperor and mass celebrations of anniversaries in the imperial calendar were enforced. The local economy was squeezed dry to support Japanese efforts. To finalize this 'rebirth', Singapore was renamed to Shonan, the Light of the South.\n\nIn Malaya, the Sultanates were kept intact and given just enough autonomy to their relief, but Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were transferred to Thailand. Soon a wave of Japanese businessmen and emigrants made the peninsula their home.\n\nBy 1962, Shonan remains an important part of Japan's wider empire, with its rich raw resources fueling its blossoming population. Under the surface however, resentment against the Japanese has never been stronger."
 sho.0.a:0 "We are the Emperor's beacon on the equator!"

 sho.1.t:0 "The Light of the South"
 sho.1.desc:0 "On paper, the Sphere seems to be working like clockwork, bringing prosperity to all Asians and their allies in the Pacific, and to bind them all together in a harmonic network guided by Japan. Unlike the tyrannic shadow of the Einheitspakt, and the hypocrisy of the OFN, the Sphere stands to its true purpose: development and growth under Japanese benevolence - at least, when they toe the Japanese line.\n\nAnd yet, they can't hold on to it. Mengjiang burns, under the damnable revolt of Tsendebal, the Philippine Republic barely can hold back the Communists descending from the North, and the stranded Americans in the South. There is also the eternal problem of Malaya, the gravest threat of all if the UMAJF manage to reach Shonan-to.\n\nIno's telephone finally rings, and he dutifully attends, turning away from the windows of his office that showed the bustling activity from the streets of Tokyo.\n\n"We've held the cities, but the jungle's on fire - Thailand is not helping either, they can barely reach the border without getting harassed by their own guerillas." Yamamoto's grave, raspy voice came from the receiver, and Ino took a moment to ponder the situation.\n\nMalaya has long been a massive money sink, the repeated failures of the 25th Army constantly draining resources, as it was with Yulo's republic. Coupled with the rebellion on Mongolia, the cracks on the Sphere has been endured to exist for too long. It's time the opportunists remember why the Rising Sun shines brighter on the East, starting with the wayward Light of the South."
 sho.1.a:0 ""Secure Shonan-to - at all costs.""

 sho.2.t:0 "A Problem of Logistics"
 sho.2.desc:0 "Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and the planning staff at Indian Ocean Command wearily eyed the map splayed across the table, the lines and borders outlining the nations of Southeast Asia, from the vast Indonesian archipelago to the jungles of Indochina. Yet, for the moment, all eyes were focused on Malaya and the task of supplying the rebels on the peninsula.\n\n"Unless the rebels can secure a port, we can't do much." One of the lieutenants bluntly stated.\n\n"Thank you, officer, for pointing out the obvious." One commander snapped back, "but we're not in the business of the impossible."\n\n"We have the Perch, an old Balao converted for transport duties available. We might be able to shanghai the Sealion from the Atlantic too." Another officer replied. "It won't be much, but it's better than nothing."\n\n"Ceylon?" Ventured a third, pointing at the map. "Access to the base at Trincomalee would be a boon for our ability to reach Southeast Asia."\n\n"That'll have to go to the State Department." The commander replied. "Don't count on it."\n\n"How about MAC, Airlift Command? We can try running C-130s out of Cocos Island and use tankers to refuel them midway."\n\n"I'll have to talk to the Airforce about that," Moorer interjected. "They're going to have to do a few trial runs first, but I agree with the lieutenant until the rebels can get their hands on a port...""
 sho.2.a:0 ""Our hands are tied.""

 sho.3.t:0 "Echoing Cries"
 sho.3.desc:0 ""As you know we have been able to secure access to a port. This breakthrough now allows us to actually get some of our American boys onto the ground over here." Davis took a map off the table in front of him and pinned it onto the wall. "As you can see, the route is a pain in the ass to follow, and it'll prove to be an even bigger pain in the ass to actually travel through, but alas we have to be as careful as possible to avoid interception by the IJN or have Sukarno stuff his nose into the matter."\n\nA wide grin encompassed Davis' face, he was gleeful at the fact that American boots were finally going to march into Asia and challenge the supremacy of those imperialist Japanese maniacs. "You know, General Hafiz, was that your name again? I'm glad we can help you in this battle. The Japanese have blighted my own life. Those fucking bastards stole my children and my wife back in Hawaii, they took everything I treasured so deeply and just ripped them straight from my very hands." Davis' smile faded and his eyes flooded with tears, he might not have accompanied them on that fateful day yet the screams and cries of poor Marisa and Jack as they along with their weeping mother punted out their last breathes of air had continued to haunt him. His brain had betrayed him when it first thought to imagine their fates.\n\n"I had one child, Amin. He always used to play on the dirt and was always a bundle of joy. One day, back when those cretins first stormed the place, he had been out playing in the mud as usual. I and my wife Halima had tried to get him to go back inside, but he refused and when the Japanese showed up, he asked a soldier to play with him. The soldier did not even take a second to think before he shot him in cold blood, and I was left frozen at the window, unable to muster the bravery to confront the killer, staring on as his soul departed his body and his blood stained the ground."\n\nThe room was silent, empty of the usual grunting of soldiers, the only disturbance being the chirping of crickets. There in the muted hall sat the two men collapsed into each other's embrace and weeping a river with their guns in hand."
 sho.3.a:0 "They will avenge their loved ones even if it means their own lives."

 sho.4.t:0 "Morning in Washington"
 sho.4.desc:0 "The president was in a rare mood as the sun came up across the Tidal Basin. He'd enjoyed a full night's sleep for the first time in a long time. Haldeman had passed him a memo on some very promising polling coming out of Ohio. The headline on the Washington Post read "UMAJF DECLARES VICTORY IN MALAYA" and came with some very nice pictures of rebels raising a flag. Nixon liked that most of all. It was the kind of striking visual imagery that would stay in voters' heads long after they forgot where Malaya was or why it was important.\n\nNixon leaned against a pillar in the Residence and took a bite of his breakfast-cottage cheese and grapefruit drizzled in ketchup. He savored its milky taste. Not even Kennedy could ruin his mood.\n\nSure, the brat was probably, even now, talking to some goddamn liberal reporter at the Boston Globe or New York Times. He bet Sulzberger's boys were trying to find some way to pin this victory on their golden boy so that he could challenge Nixon in '64. At the end of the day, though, Nixon was president. He was the one who'd given the Japanese a black eye. He was the one who'd ended a years-long struggle in the Pacific and given America a strategic ally. All the pictures in the paper were his doing. Him alone. So long as America kept winning abroad, his re-election would be a breeze.\n\nThe president stood for a few moments longer, letting himself imagine all the good press he would get. He was determined to relish this moment as long as possible."
 sho.4.a:0 "Nixon, now more than ever"
 
 sho.41.t:0 "Midnight in Washington"
 sho.41.desc:0 "Richard Milhous Nixon sat on the White House steps with his eyes fixed on the blinking red light at the top of the Washington Monument-on, off, on, off-and thought about his political future. He'd gotten in the habit of these late-night sojourns whenever bad news came through the switchboard, whether it was the situation in Hawaii or the press roasting him over the civil rights fight. Tonight, the bad news came from East Asia. After years of sporadic fighting, the Japanese had declared victory over the UMAJF in Malaya. There were pictures, likely to appear in the Post the next day, of dead soldiers carrying American weapons and the gaunt, defeated face of Chin Peng.\n\nOn, off, on, off.\n\nIt was just another defeat in a long series of defeats, the president thought to himself, another Nixon blunder. There would be articles and editorials roasting the president for letting another ally fall to fascism, for weakening the OFN and letting America get cut off from valuable trade. There would be an endless parade of pinheads and commentators questioning whether he had the "stamina" to run again in '64-as though the Kennedy brat would do any better. At least Nixon knew how to suffer with a brave face. Kennedy wouldn't survive a month as president.\n\nThe light at the top of the monument seemed to go dark for a long time before turning on again. Nixon rose shakily to his feet.\n\nThe failure in Malaya was regrettable, but he'd move past it. There would be a few days of bad press, maybe a hearing before Congress, and then the public would forget Malaya even existed. There would be some new crisis that he and the boys could jump on, something big and splashy. All he had to do was find some new distraction and he could rally the nation behind him.\n\nNixon did not look back as he shuffled back into the White House."
 sho.41.a:0 "On, off, on off"

 sho.5.t:0 "The Sting of Mere Tolerance"
 sho.5.desc:0 "For the first time in his life, Tokunda found himself... disturbed? Uneasy? Shaken? He wasn't sure what he felt, but it wasn't good.\n\nWhen there'd been a call for volunteers to help the Shonan forces expunge the American puppet rebels in Malaya, he'd been among the first to answer the call. That there were those who were interfering with the unifying mission of the Co-Prosperity Sphere sickened him. For too long the people of Asia had been separated and turned against each other by Western foreigners.\n\nFor the first time, thanks to the Empire and the wisdom of the Emperor, Asia was in the hands of its people. No foreigners, no imperialists, only people coming together for their own interests. How could anyone not want to be part of such unity? Of course, he'd heard of rebels, dissidents, but they were nothing more than American and Nazi propaganda. Some people would do anything for money and power. Or so he'd thought.\n\nStepping into the Light of the South in person had been...sobering.\n\nThere was no proud Malayan army waiting here. The collaborators were exhausted, fewer than he'd expected, and undersupplied. It was quickly clear why they'd needed help. Yet what was more disturbing was that...he got an impression at some points that he wasn't wanted - nor the collaborators for that matter. He didn't feel like he was helping his Asian brethren push back against the American imperialists.\n\nHe felt like an interloper. An outsider. Someone who was tolerated, not welcomed. The people did not seem to be on their side. And he didn't know why. He couldn't blame this on the Americans, unless many in Shonan-to were secret spies. But why would they not welcome Japan's help with open arms? It bothered him, and he felt that this was going to bother him long after he eventually returned home."
 sho.5.a:0 "Unwelcome helpers."



 sho.7.t:0 "The Light In The South"
 sho.7.desc:0 "Shonan-to is a beautiful place in the Pacific dawn. Glittering skyfront touches earth and reaches the smog-cast sky, industrial and refinery flame glinting off the sides of zaibatsu windows. Chatter reaches the streets and spills into the tea-houses, the hotels and the factories in a garbled mix of Malay, Chinese, Japanese and residual English (the trade tongue of old has not yet been lost). Businesses open in the thousands and wait for the bounty of the trade-routes to reach their doorstep in lorries and automobiles, curling in from roads so overcrowded and undermaintained they have become a focal point of political debate. And the slums awaken too: the coolies and the workers of the new Light of the South, the burning oil under the blazing lamp, must throw themselves anew into the blazing brilliance of the Jewel of the Sphere. What does it matter if a few do not return?\n\nThe Politicians in the Diet worry, as they often do, about the thousand issues that keep the city down: trade infrastructure is falling apart due to frequent use and occasional Communist sabotage, the 18th raid on Chin Peng has ended in a self-declared victory and no body to show for it, the Malays and Indians are continuing to push for greater autonomy in self-funded schools (ignoring the generous Zaibatsu donations that made them possible) and, of course, the Sultans have it in for the annoyingly successful city in their rear. Above it all the Japanese population, proud and unbowed and utterly insufferable: and below them the Chinese, endless and long-suffering, like gargoyles supporting angels on a crumbling cathedral wall.\n\nIt's peace. Of a sort. But one thing is for sure: nothing ever lasts long in the swelter of heat and the glitz of the endless marketplace - and who can say what the next morning will bring, gold or fire?"
 sho.7.a:0 "The city that can't sleep."

 sho.8.t:0 "Fire At The Coffeehouse"
 sho.8.desc:0 "Most riots simmer long before the streets fill with fire and trash. They curl in the damp spaces too soft for the ears of the police, stretching tendrils of gossip and suspicion with every half-whisper, and it is there that the anger curdles to hatred - and then to violence. Riots are made long before they break out, long before the government catches word: and so this is where the Shonan-To Riot begins, outside a damp sake-soaked coffeehouse on the outskirts of the Central District, far beyond the ears of the Kenpeitai and the Diet, on a day that will fade from history when it is over.\n\nIt begins, as with most things, with a conversation that carries on far too long for comfort. The participants are lost to history, perhaps forever - the controversial has a way of being blotted out in Shonan, for the public good - but this is known: some at the coffeehouse on October 13th are Japanese businessmen, some are Chinese middle-class civil servants, some are Malay and Indian shopkeepers. All have been brought to gossip by the latest round of Zaibatsu import quotas imposed from Tokyo, but none have agreeing views on the matter. The Chinese civil servants are sharpest and most bitter in their criticism: the yoke of taxation and overwork is endemic, but falls hardest on them. The Japanese businessmen view the men in Tokyo as right, but misguided in their aims - the Indians and Malays, of course, are worried about the dominance of Japanese firms, and why shouldn't they be? Nobody can ignore the slow collapse of the old Indian-Malay economic holdings in a land that is still called Malaya by some.\n\nThree viewpoints, one point of division, an argument that feeds on itself and grows to inebriated, incendiary heights. The owner later testifies to a bar brawl that is only broken up by the police, but the main participants flee ahead of time. One of them promises that in a week, Japanese holdings will go up in flames across Malaya - and then he is gone, a Cassandra lost in the hot wind of the Malayan night."
 sho.8.a:0 "Is this a threat, a promise or a prophecy?"

 sho.9.t:0 "The Tinder, The Spark, The Match"
 sho.9.desc:0 "Anger continues to grow in the week after the coffeehouse incident (which is quickly shushed up by local authorities, lest it trigger the ever-watching and ever-tetchy Garrison Authorities), just not in public spaces. The Kenpeitai have toned down considerably from their monstrous heights, preferring calm corruption to brutality, but they are still capable and dangerously competent when it comes time for them to do their dirty work. The whispers grow and grow and grow to fever pitch, just out of sight, dancing like fireflies atop a placid lake, and then -\n\nOctober 17th: Sumitomo announces a round of minor economic restructuring in the Shonan-To branch, laying off a few dozen employees to integrate a new branch of Tokyo-based operation chain managers. Most of those laid off are Malay and Indian. Not many are affected, but to many already suspicious of the Zaibatsu concerns this is proof that the Japanese intend to push out local concerns and uproot native industry, yoking Malaya permanently to the Sphere. Security guards report fistfights at the factory and angered rhetoric in the ethnic enclaves of the East and Central districts, calls to action - and to arms.\n\nOctober 19th: A Chinese coolie is found murdered off a hotel. The details are sketchy at first reportage. Due to subsequent circumstances, the body is only partially examined before subsequent events make further inquiries impossible. Notable eyewitnesses to the body include several Japanese businessmen and managers, a few policemen - and a gang of Chinese from the endless slums of the central and north. The latter engage in a hasty retreat, but not before promising vengeance for the spilt blood.\n\nOctober 20th: mobs of Chinese, Malays and Indians are marching in the city, roused to anger by the fear and the rhetoric surrounding them. The Prophet's Birthday celebrations went off smoothly a few months back with adequate crowd control, but the local Guard make 2 critical mistakes: they send a single detachment, and every single member of the detachment is a Japanese officer."
 sho.9.a:0 "This doesn't sound ominous at all."

 sho.10.t:0 "Burning In The Dawn"
 sho.10.desc:0 "It's unclear what exactly triggers the riots, given the subsequent chaos that follows the riots. The exact circumstances are lost to police reports that burn with the rest of the government buildings. Some later voice suspicions that the Diet has had a hand covering up the evidence - these voices are quickly silenced, by means that are either legal or... well, there's plenty of room under the dockyards for those who will not abide by the rules of the game.\n\nThis much is clear: 2 mobs meet on Rochor Street, separated by a thin line of Japanese guards. The men are recruits sent straight from barracks, and limited in their comprehension of the local lingua franca: stuttering Malay does nothing to ease already troubled hearts, especially when some of those troubled hearts are Chinese. The detachment commander asks to speak to the head of the two demonstrations, believing that they are part of a joint protest. For his mistake he is mocked in languages he cannot comprehend, as the crowd swells beyond the bounds of the street, cowing local shopkeepers into submission. The Diet, of course, is silent. The crowds don't trust each other: the middle-class Malays and Indians see the Chinese as saboteurs and worse, the Chinese despise the Malays and Indians uplifted by Japanese benevolence while they have been struck down under their boot.\n\nFaced with a situation he cannot control, the commander radios his base for aid and backup: this is where accounts diverge. Chinese protestors swear up and down that he orders the police to fire on them. Indian protestors swear that the police are ordered to ignore the Chinese and push back the Malays and Indians. The news spreads to the entirety of the crowds in both variants, becoming exponentially more incendiary as it gathers pace and fury. Both mobs surge forward at the same time in a desperate attempt to pre-empt an attack they believe is inevitable, overwhelming the thin blue line. The commander is never seen again."
 sho.10.a:0 "Oh shit."

 sho.11.t:0 "Burning In The Day"
 sho.11.desc:0 "The riot rages on the street and spreads beyond it. Word of mouth is a powerful thing, and cannot be controlled - virality translates to memetic discourse very well. Threats, fears and pain become more dangerous as the crowds rush by huddled families, and the urge to revenge grows more tangible with the thudding heart. And underneath it all the resentments of the old years fester and break into a bloody blossom. Mobs and gangs raise hell on the streets, barricading factories and wrecking any house that seems, in the words of a gang member who is later interrogated, 'too rich, too powerful, too big, too Japanese.'\n\nViolence begets violence as the Garrison struggle to execute a collective response in the wake of unparalleled violence since the Conquest of Malaya itself. Residents retreat to enclaves, take up rusty parangs and bayonets, and prepare to kill those who seem a threat. (Many villagers protect ethnic outliers in their hometowns, an act of quiet defiance that goes more or less unnoticed by everyone else.) Rage quickly spreads to the economic dimension - and to the political, as the Police Commissioner's Office is burnt to the ground, along with many prominent Zaibatsu offices. The Diet faffles and waits for order to be restored, pulling soldiers from vital defense positions to protect itself. Malayan sultans unequivocally condemn the riots almost as hard as they condemn the Diet for its inaction. The Diet might be incapable of handling its own turf, but at least it can be roused to angry self-defense: the war of words that follows makes the entirety of Shonanese governance seem even more pathetic as the death toll rises outside the glass windows.\n\nIn a famous image, the burning of the city dusts the skyline and the horizon above it in a thick cloud of soot: reporters speculate that the smoke and soot come from the destruction of an armaments storehouse near Keppel, destroyed to prevent 'Communist Saboteurs' from reaching the warehouse and looting it. No evidence of Communist infiltration of the demonstrations is ever found."
 sho.11.a:0 "Zakennayo! Is no one capable of restoring order?"

 sho.12.t:0 "P. Ramlee Releases Labu Dan Labi!"
 sho.12.desc:0 "'It's a hot day in Kuala Lumpur, but not many seem to care: everyone's waiting for the opening of the cinemas. They say it's his best work yet, and even if they always say that every time he releases a film, many are still looking forward to the man, the legend, P Ramlee's next big film - '\n\n' - the buddy-comedy film was a surprising investment for the Japanese filmmaker, but according to our sources here in Central P. Ramlee has been a pleasure to work with and an enterprising director. We believe that this surprising precedent will only spell greater promise for the fledgeling Malayan Film industry - '\n\n' - the synopsis is deeper than you think. Look at the plot!

P. Ramlee is a mask, a smiling tribute to all who know him: and behind that mask is a brilliant nothingness, as far as Shonan is concerned. Who is P. Ramlee? The answer seems to be that he is anyone the people of Malaya want him to be - reformist, smiling establishment supporter, militant Muslim, cheerful secularist, anyone's ally and no one's true friend. Deflection is, after all, a form of reflection, and who doesn't want to see themselves reflected in Malaya's greatest film star. But who is Teuku Zakaria? When P. Ramlee takes off his mask and his suit and steps out of the limelight, who does he become?\n\nWe step into his house, a pleasant terraced house in the classier suburbs of Kuala Lumpur, and we're met with a strong scent of jasmine: apparently Saloma, or simply Salmah Ismail, as she likes to be called, likes the smell of perfume, and so Zakaria has made great efforts to buy perfume. He smiles at us and makes small talk about the weather as she bustles about the kitchen: despite their 7 year long marriage the two have never had a child, a fact the two attribute to their busy career (both of them have, of course, shared the set for a very long time in film and music).\n\nHis face grows serious when we begin to discuss his most prominent comments on the growing racial and economic divides in Shonan-To and in urban areas in Malaya proper: he brings up the subject of his childhood in an impoverished home and how the Japanese saved him from a life of penury by bringing him to Navy School and subsequently to Tokyo, where his career began. 'If not for the Japanese, I would have been poor all my life!' he chuckles, and then grows serious once more: 'So what makes me so different from the coolies and starving outside? Is it not in the words of the Prophet that we must, like Him, be a mercy to the worlds?'"

It's one thing to stir up a little trouble, but to invite it into our doorstep? Like this? I'm seriously worried Ramlee might invite the Army back into Parliament because he cares about the poor too much - '\n\n' - look, I don't care what it says, what matters to me is that I cried when Rosnah and Kunio said goodbye!

Frozen by the chaos wrought upon their supply chain, the 25th's operations were brought to an immediate halt, and a ceasefire was declared shortly thereafter.\n\nWith peace finally making its home in the war torn land of Malaya, it can be surmised that the frontline of tomorrow shall mark the borders of today, assuming, of course, that the peace lasts. With the Japanese currently hamstrung by their economic woes, however, it does not seem likely that a conflict will return anytime soon.\n\nNow that the war is at an end, we can shift our focus in regards to our relationship with the rebels.

Not much of an ideological hardliner, Boestamam wants to adapt socialism to make it compatible with Malaya, as he believes that blindly recreating Marxism-Bukharinism is not what the country wants and needs. Instead, his vision of socialism appears to be dedicated toward the rebuilding of the country, something it desperately needs after the utter devastation of the war.\n\nBoestamam's victory, while still better than the continuation of Japanese influence over the region, is something of a setback for us. Compared to Razak, he is not as friendly toward the OFN, and he likely won't be joining us in the foreseeable future; this comes off as a missed opportunity, given all the resources that we pooled into the conflict. Nevertheless, the fact that the Japanese are out of Malaya is still a victory to be celebrated, and we should rejoice in the fact that Tokyo's control over Asia has just been dealt a serious blow.\n\nDue to the outcome of the election, we have observed that the C-NPP has made a small surge in the polls recently. This can probably be attributed to the fact that the general public sees Boestamam's victory as a logical consequence of our support for the war, and thus as a direct endorsement of socialism on our part."

A conservative, Razak is exactly the kind of man we would want in charge: a moderate, amiable to the OFN, he seems to be dedicated to the rebuilding of the nation, something it doubtlessly needs given the devastation caused by the war.\n\nRazak's victory comes off as the best-case scenario for us: he is, unlike his opponents, quite palatable to our interests, and he will without doubt cooperate with us in the near and far future. As we are already in talks with him for Malaya to join the OFN as an observer, it is obvious that his victory has secured the status of his country as an American ally.\n\nHowever, we are not entirely done with Malaya yet. With its near-guaranteed entry in the OFN comes the need for economic and humanitarian aid, as we obviously cannot let Razak and the Malayan people deal with the devastation of their country themselves.

The station chief comments that despite the sympathetic feelings of the Wataniah administration towards the OFN. It is unlikely that Malaya will pursue closer relations.\nB) Ambassador Bell believes it is unlikely that Japan will tolerate an American presence in the straits of Malacca, and will likely pursue avenues to destabilize Malaya. (Comment: Japan's recent economic woes will likely preclude any significant efforts for the time being.)\n\nII. The Regime\nA) The insurgency has badly fractured the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Front, with moderate elements on both the left and the right having been folded into more militant groups throughout the conflict. Much of the nation remains under martial law. Troops remain in evidence in key population centers such as Johor, Kuala Lumpur, and Kelang.\nB) The military administration of Askar Wataniah, while outwardly popular, remains fragile amidst Malaya's delicate post-war condition. The Malayan Communist Party retains significant strength in rural areas.\n\nIII. War Damage\nA) The Malayan Peninsula has suffered heavily from the insurgency, with large swaths of the population lacking access to essential services or adequate infrastructure (see Appendix C: Martin Report).\nB) The aid requested by the Wataniah administration is significant, totaling an estimated $1.5 Billion per annum (Approx. 40% of the Foreign Aid budget).\nC) Malayan Reconstruction, coupled with conflicts in the Philippines and South Africa, will place significant strain on existing budgets.\n(TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY)\n-TOP SECRET-"

A convinced communist, Peng desires to rebuild Malaya across Marxist-Bukharinist lines, and his past actions indicate that he will stop at nothing to achieve his vision of a free, unshackled Malaya.\n\nWhile this may seem all well and good in theory, the fact of the matter is that Peng doesn't hold America and the OFN too close to his heart. Despite our good intentions, he thinks that we are not better than the Japanese, and that cooperating with us would only be trading one colonial overlord for another. As such, it appears that our cooperation with Malaya ends here, and that the country will go its own way, free from foreign influence.\n\nThis comes off as a major setback for us: had Peng's opponents managed to take control of the country, it is probable that it would be friendlier toward us, especially in the case of a Razak victory. At least, we can find solace in the fact that the Japanese are out of Malaya as well, which means that their influence has been dealt a serious blow.
