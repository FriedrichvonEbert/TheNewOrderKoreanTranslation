 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_GUTRUM_VAGNER_DESC: "서부 러시아의 엄청난 재앙, 주변 라이벌 사이에서 얻은 불명예, 알렉세이 알렉산드로비치 도브로볼스키는 특별하지 않은 배경을 가지고 있습니다. 전쟁 후 붕괴된 소련 세계에서 가족들이 겪은 고난때문에 그는 자아실현할 기회가 거의 없었지만, 그의 많은 동료들과 마찬가지로 어린 시절에 사회주의 국가, 지도자, 그리고 군대의 우월성에 대해 배웠습니다. 하지만, 모스코비엔 공격을 하는 동안 서러시아 혁명군에 의해 징집된 그는 이 군인들이 훨씬 더 강한 적들에 의해 학살되고 밀리는 것을 보았습니다. 양쪽이 가져온 대혼란과 파괴를 목격한 그는 아리안 검의 힘에 현혹되지 않을 수 없었습니다. 비슷한 생각을 가진 동료 붉은 군대 신병들과 함께 페름의 숲으로 탈영한 그는 독일 군단이 소련을 쉽게 짓밟고 슬라브족을 그들의 뜻에 복종시킬 수 있었던 이유, 진리 탐구에 전념했습니다. 그는 러시아 역사에서 그 답을 찾았습니다. 표트르 대제는 유럽을 여행한 적이 있습니다. 그리고 나서 러시아 사람들에게 그들의 거꾸로 가는 길을 버리고 더 문명화된 문화를 받아들이도록 강요했습니다. 이것이 아리안 정신의 진정한 의미입니다. 육신의 차이 뿐만 아니라 더 뛰어난 정신력을 의미하는 것입니다!\n\n(그가 되고자 했던)표트르 대제의 발자취를 따라, 그는 문학의 조각으로부터 독일과 아리아인에 대해 학습하였습니다. 아리아인 형제단의 퓌러를 자처하며 아리아식 이름인 구트룸 바그너로 개명했고, 충실한 추종자들을 끌어모아 퇴폐와 운터멘쉬로부터 러시아를 되찾아 유럽의 진정한 주인이 되려고 합니다. 서러시아 전쟁 후 그와 그의 부하들은 무정부 도시인 페름을 무리지어 아리아 부흥의 현장으로 선언했는데, 그곳에서 그들은 우월한 민족의 방식을 모방하고 탐닉하고 슬라브인 하층민들에게 공포와 굴욕을 안겨주었습니다. 단연코 러시아에서 가장 무자비하고 무서운 세력이며, 바그너는 아리아 문명의 요람으로 되돌리기 위해 러시아의 가장 먼 지역으로 향합니다."

 POLITICS_VALERY_YEMELYANOV_DESC: "발레리 니콜라예비치 예멜랴노프의 머릿속을 들여다보면, 아리아인이 하이퍼보레아 루스의 숲과 스텝을 지배했던 찬란한 과거의 환영을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 유대인과 그들의 반체제 인사들은 루스의 땅을 극악무도한 속임수로, 루스의 유산은 기독교의 세뇌를 통해, 그리고 루스의 과거는 역사왜곡을 통해 앗아갔습니다. 수 세기 동안, 아리아인의 슬라브 후손들은 어둠 속을 맹목적으로 헤매었습니다. 그러나 결국 잃어버린 진리를 재발견하는 사람들이 있었습니다. 그들은 빼앗긴 땅과 인종을 다시 빛으로 인도하고 피의 생득권을 되찾기 위해 무엇을 해야 하는지를 이해했습니다.\n\n하지만 예멜랴노프는 스스로는 결코 살아남을 수 없다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 그는 구트룸 바그너라는 동맹을 찾았는데, 그는 망상 더미 밑에 묻혀 있는 한 조각의 진리를 가지고 있었습니다. 바그너는 독일의 잡종 아리아인뿐 아니라, 아리아주의도 그들이 충분히 열심히 믿으면 이룰 수 있는 정신 상태라고 확신했습니다! 바보같지만 그는 진리가 뿌리내릴 수 있는 비옥한 땅을 만들었습니다. 그래서 예멜랴노프는 인종적 열등함의 이름과 겉모습을 숨기고 많은 추종자들이 공격할 수 있는 시간에 도달할 때까지 그의 시간을 바쳤습니다. 부랑자와 그의 미친 무리들은 이제 죽었습니다. 그들의 피는 흙에서 그 얼룩을 제거할 것입니다. 고위 사제 벨리미르라는 칭호를 받은 예멜랴노프는 아리아 일족이 조상의 고향으로 다시 돌아오도록 이끌겠다고 다짐했습니다. 그리고 모든 하이퍼보레아 루스가 거룩한 스와스티카의 상징 아래 단결되었을 때, 스바로그는 백성들과 그의 제사장에게 미소를 지을 것입니다!"

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEDVEDEV_DESC: "파시스트들에 대한 오네가 수비대의 혐오감은 공산주의자들보다 더 크지는 않지만 동등합니다. 특히 아리아인 형제단처럼 끔찍한 사이비 종교집단의 경우, 수년 동안 페름과 그 주변을 더럽혔다는 것이 사실입니다. 하지만, 이 모든 걸 없애버리겠다고 약속한 한 남자가 있었습니다. 알렉산더 에고로비치 메드베데프, 벌목꾼이자 전쟁 영웅입니다.\n\n우크라이나의 들판에서 다시 페름 근처의 사랑하는 고국으로 돌아가 싸운 후, 그는 조용한 삶을 살기로 결심했지만, 사정이 어쩔 수 없었습니다. 도시에 비열한 세력이 나타났고, 메드베데프는 이에 맞서 싸우기 위해 무기를 들었습니다. 수년 동안 그의 세력은 러시아 나치에 대항하여 페름 외곽에서 싸웠고, 그들을 북러시아 공화국의 위성으로 본 오네가 수비대의 구원이 도착했습니다.\n\n메드베데프는 이제 형제단의 잔당과 추종자가 모두 사라질 때까지 반파시스트 위원회의 군벌이자 지도자로서 지역을 자비롭게 통치합니다."

 ### Ideas ###
 PRM_aryan_cult: "아리아인 숭배"
 PRM_aryan_cult_desc: "The so-called Aryans have brought down the millenarian Motherland... but our neighbors are fools if they believe that they, the so-called Untermenschen, are capable of casting down this enemy. Clearly, they have proven themselves superior to us in all regards... and if you cannot beat them, join them. We will make ourselves into Aryans, and as the Aryans have proven themselves superior over the Russian, so shall we as Aryans prevail over our inferiors and join the Reich as rulers."
 PRM_aryan_cult_full_aryan: "아리아인 숭배 - 순수 아리아인 군대"
 PRM_aryan_cult_full_aryan_desc: "The Fate of the Aryan race will not be dictated by the weekly, feeble minded untermensch, but by the true might that once shook this land to the core, the true might of the superior race.We shall instill fear and terror in the vermin in this land, but this time...\n\nThey will have no where to run."
 PRM_aryan_cult_non_aryan: "아리아인 숭배 - 비-아리아인 군대"
 PRM_aryan_cult_non_aryan_desc: "The untermensch's fate is to serve their betters in every aspect, and their lives are of inherent less value. Instead of putting brave and irreplaceable Aryan lives to risk dying against the rabble, we will put them in officers and commanding chains, to guide our slaves to fight instead. They should be glad that we're letting them die for something meaningful for once in their unremarkable existence."
 PRM_amateur_gestapo: "미숙한 게슈타포"
 PRM_amateur_gestapo_desc: "라이히와 그들의 방법을 배우기 위한 연구를 통해서, 우리는 스스로를 위해 고귀한 평화 유지군을 재현하는 것을 시도했습니다. 아리아인의 지배는 동쪽에서 서쪽으로 뻗어나갈 것이고, 열등인종들은 우리 땅에서 자신들의 위치를 알게 될겁니다."
 PRM_heart_of_an_aryan: "아리아의 심장"
 PRM_heart_of_an_aryan_desc: "아리아인은 완벽한 인종입니다, 우리의 적들에 대한 증오로 가득찬 가슴과 그들 모두를 압도할 수 있는 신체를 가졌죠. 하지만 다른 무엇보다 중요한 것은 의무입니다. 정복의 의무, 지배의 의무, 밑에 있는 모든 것들을 지휘할 의무.\n우리는 우리가 세계에 대고 맹세한 의무에 겁을 먹지 않을겁니다."
 PRM_disciplined_raiders: "훈련된 약탈자들"
 PRM_disciplined_raiders_desc: "Terror isn't a butcher's job, but a hunter. Like one, we lie in wait, our weapons draw, while we wait our prey to reach our scope, breathe held, to lull them in a false sense of security.\nBy the time they realize something is wrong on their idyllic, pathetic existence, it will be too late."
 PRM_autonomous_raiders: "독자적인 약탈자들"
 PRM_autonomous_raiders_desc: "Terror isn't about how hard you bleed your enemies, but how many wounds they're bleeding for. If we let them rest, if even for a moment, they can recover, and create delusions of survival. Our armies will not give them a single inch of rest, until they're nothing but ruins trampling down our feet."
 PRM_aryan_control_5: "아리아인의 통제력 - 굳건함"
 PRM_aryan_control_5_desc: "The Untermensch can't help but look to the ground, in fear and pain at our radiance. Our control is absolute in every single aspect of our society, and they know. Russia will finally be back at the hands of the people it truly belongs, and nothing will stop our natural manifest shape into reality."
 PRM_aryan_control_4: "아리아인의 통제력 - 훌륭함"
 PRM_aryan_control_4_desc: "Small pockets of resistance are to be seen, but those don't bring us as much trouble as they used to. The Untermensch are learning their place in our society, and as long as we keep pressing the jackboots against their throat, eventually these delusions of freedom will sputter to darkness."
 PRM_aryan_control_3: "아리아인의 통제력 - 느슨함"
 PRM_aryan_control_3_desc: "Communications between our many brothers, and resistance to our rule is still present, even if manageable for now. While we have nothing to fear from rats scurrying about, if our aspirations to conquer this savage land are to shape into reality, we must ascertain our control, lest the situation escape our control."
 PRM_aryan_control_2: "아리아인의 통제력 - 최소"
 PRM_aryan_control_2_desc: "Our brothers are pinned by the untermensch, and chaos reigns through our chain of command. The Aryan right is one of dominance, and we cannot let vermin dictate their whims! Our actions must be decisive, to reascertain our control, lest we fail not only our brothers at Perm, but our kin in the west." 
 PRM_aryan_control_1: "아리아인의 통제력 - 존재하지 않음"
 PRM_aryan_control_1_desc: "We've failed. Our brothers lay dead or spread across our land, like headless chickens, and the untermensch march ever closed to our strongholds. Our enemies at our borders noticed our moment of weakness, and will soon strike us, despite our best efforts; we've failed our kin west, and we've failed our aryan duty."
 PRM_forced_labor: "비자발적인 노동자들"
 PRM_forced_labor_desc: "Living is a privilege, and the slaves are to be reminded of that. Their reward for work, is the right to be able to be alive tomorrow, to work more. If they complain, we can simply correct them by the way of lead."
 PRM_free_labor: "자발적인 노동자들"
 PRM_free_labor_desc: "Aryan or not, hunger affects us all. While we have no sympathy for the lessers toiling for us, as it is their sworn obligation by race, the fact is they are useless to us if they die of hunger. So by offering them food equivalent to their work, not only will they work harder to be rewarded more, but their loyalty to us will increase. After all, like a dog, they know what happens if they bite the hand that feeds them."
 PRM_rebuilding_industry: "산업 재건"
 PRM_rebuilding_industry_desc: "Berlin wasn't built in a day, and our empire will need many, if it is to one day rejoin with our kin west. Our industry will spill columns of black smoke, and our industry will forge the sword that will hang over the weaker races across Russia."
 PRM_revitalized_industry: "재활성화된 산업"
 PRM_revitalized_industry_desc: "Like a veil of smog, Perm became the beating heart of our land. Like blood, it pumps the weapons of the Aryan warriors through the land, to cast the untermensch back to where it belongs: In Chains and bound to factories, to toil for us." 
 PRM_true_aryans: "순수한 아리아주의"
 PRM_true_aryans_desc: "We've tolerated the meangering of for long enough. Shultz's betrayal finally revealed to us how insiduous and deep the machinations of the Jew spreads, to reach for the desperate, traitorous kin with our land. We will crush, and trample the very concept and idea of these races to dust, until there is only one distinction in Russia:\n\n§VThe Aryan, and the slave."

 PRM_our_own_army2: "슬라브-아리안 끈기"
 PRM_our_own_army2_desc: "Combat shapes the form of the perfect Aryan soldier, Slavo-Aryan tactics have proven itself reliable, and our superior army are no longer so just in name. We are survivors, predators, strong and tenacious. We will defeat everyone inferior to our might."
 PRM_our_own_army3: "슬라브-아리안 군대"

 PRM_untermensch_army_desc: "The Untermensh are perfect, in a sense that they serve their purpose as subhumans to become fodder for enemy gunfire to forward the goals of the superior Aryan race. They are disposable, cheap, and fully subservient to our cause. Unfortunately, this means that our army becomes impure, and defects could be seen here and there."

 PRM_warrior_priests: "전투 사제"
 PRM_warrior_priests_desc: "We will form detachments of priests to guide the brave Aryan soldiers to the battlefield, where they shall be asked to fulfil the legacy of their great Aryan ancestors, where they shall understand the glory within the war, and the glory within death."

 PRM_goad_unbelievers2_desc: "Our efforts to cleanse the unbelievers have been, for the most part, successful. They now understand their purpose under our heel, and they shall retaliate no more. The Aryan Race marches to glory, to the future of a world free of the Untermensh."

 PRM_work_for_your_life_idea_desc: "The purpose of the subhumans is to serve the superior Aryan race. This is no longer just a mantra, but a manifestation in our industry. For the rest of their lifes, they shall toil in the mines and in the factories for the sake of the Brotherhood."
 PRM_aryan_schematics: "Aryan Schematics"
 PRM_aryan_schematics_desc: "In order to rise above the drudges of the Slavic subhumans and their backwardness, the Brotherhood has started several initiatives to replicate Germany's awe-inspiring successes in industry, science and weaponry. Luckily for us, there are plenty of leftover equipment from the German collaborators in the West Russian War that our technicians can study. While this necessitates casting away the "fruits" of Bolshevik "science", it means that we may one day match the feats of German engineering - the greatest in the world."

Just as we, in ancient times, were a proud and powerful people, now laid low by insipid monarchy and degenerate communism, Perhmaym was once the industrial center of the region but is now a shell of its former self, devastated by war and resource shortages.\n\nWe know from the doctrine and example of the Germans that the only path to rejuvenate a race addled by defeat and degeneracy is war, constant war, without end and against all around us. Permhaym, too, will be lifted up from the brink of destruction by war. We need to put military preparation above all else. As many of our resources as possible will be moved over to producing weapons and munitions. This city will reach its salvation, and the first step will be a baptism by blood."

 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_bread: "빵을 위해 일해라"
 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_bread_desc: "Permhaym's industry is a starving beast. Two wars and continued German bombings have annihilated its factories, and the vermin that make up the majority of the Russian population have not had the mettle to rebuild them. At least, not without encouragement.\n\nAlthough we are loath to give aid to the undeserving, we may have to make exceptions for pragmatic reasons. Permhaym's undesirables have up until now been given a meager ration befitting of their race status. Volunteering for factory work may be taken as a sign of slightly greater racial vigor, at least in comparison to the rest of the sniveling horde. This does not mean that we will be kind. The work will be harsh and unforgiving, with long hours and difficult conditions. Though some among the Aryan caste may cringe at the thought of mercy to the savages, small concessions are necessary to keep the system running."

 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_life: "삶을 위해 일해라"
 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_life_desc: "For every day we neglect to reopen our factories, our chance to build a state even approaching the glory of the Reykh gets further away. Permhaym's industrial capacity has been severely diminished by the ravages of war. Our efforts to continue industrial development have been derailed in part because of the unwillingness of the non-Aryan population to work. While Permhaym dies around them, these subhumans refuse to make sacrifices to save it. Perhaps we should force them.\n\nThere are thousands of able-bodied men and women of the lower castes throughout Permhaym, more than enough to fulfill our industrial needs. Our raider squads, usually put to work acquiring manpower outside of Permhaym, can easily be redirected within it. The lesser races are more resources than men. Let us utilize every one we have at our disposal."

Despite his withered frame and worn clothes, Kiselyev woke up happy because he knew that he would be fed that day. The long hours, grueling to most others, and the utter lack of any safety precautions, that would certainly deter many a labourer, were disregarded by the middle-aged Russian. He had fought in the Great Patriotic War, and survived, only to witness the collapse of the Union. He survived not just the war, but genocide, harsh winters, bandits, and famine. Famine was the worst of all to Kiselyev, who dreamed only of the bits of bread and soup he would earn toiling away, making bullets for the Aryan Brotherhood. He cared not of their dogma; Kiselyev had lost his convictions long ago. Now, he only hoped to survive, and ironically enough, the Brotherhood was helping him do just that."

 PRM_AB_initial_ultranational_sweatshops_desc: "Dim lights, screeching metal, and harsh, barking orders. These were known as the "Aryan Three" by the workers of the Permhaym Munitions Factory no.12a, and that was considered to be an understatement of the true conditions of the factory. Even without the uncomfortably long shifts that all workers were forced to take, the outdated machinery, utter lack of any safety hazards, and the Aryan Brotherhood's overseers - perhaps more akin to slave drivers - were all endemic to all factories in Permhaym, which seemingly worked day and night to churn out weapons and munitions for the Aryan state. The treatment of workers who keeled over, simply unable to go on was monstrous; being shot was lucky."

 PRM_AB_initial_industrial_army: "우리의 산업군"
 PRM_AB_initial_industrial_army_desc: "While it is noble to fight with meager technology, as the Germanic tribes did in ages long past, a race must eventually adopt mechanized warfare in order to survive. This does not mean abandoning one's honorable traditions; after all, the Germans conquered most of Europe, and did so wedded firmly to their Aryan heritage.\n\nLuckily, we appear to be following in their footsteps. Our industrial recovery, aided by the labor of the lower castes we pressed into service, is progressing admirably. Of course, most of this production is military, as we need to prove ourselves in racial combat if we wish to survive. Munitions are obviously vital for front line battle, but a sustainable offensive cannot be mounted without fuel. The task now is to decide which areas we want to focus our resources on."

 PRM_AB_initial_munitions_desc: "Any empire is built on blood and iron. We have the blood; the racial purity of our ruling caste is impeccable. But, for a long time, we have not had the iron. Permhaym had munition plants once, churning out bullets and bombs for the Bolshevik vermin to tear down our morals and traditions. Although the Reykh's defeat of the Soviets in the '40s and their despicable residue ten years later opened the door for the creation of our state, it also destroyed much of Russia's industrial capacity. As a result, the armies of the Aryan Brotherhood have suffered from shortages of necessary equipment.\n\nNow that our industry has been developed to a satisfactory level, we can fix this pressing issue. Though it will still be a pathetic imitation of the Vermakht that conquered Europe, our military will have more than enough equipment to squash our enemies wherever we see them."

 PRM_AB_initial_refineries: "정유소 재가동"
 PRM_AB_initial_refineries_desc: "Oil is, in a sense, the blood of the Earth. It is also the blood of a modern society, the life-stuff that keeps its power running and its army moving. The veins of the Reykh extend across Europe, keeping the world's greatest empire alive. Before the glorious destruction of the Soviet Union by the Germans, Permhaym was a regional center of oil production. Since then, its refineries have remained mostly empty, other than during a brief period during the West Russian War.\n\nNow that our industry has progressed to the point where we can reopen them once more, not for the benefit of degenerate socialists but for the Aryan race. Our empire is still small, but, powered by the earth's bounty, our armies will travel across western Russia, spreading the domination of the Aryan race unimpeded."

 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_legions: "아리안 군단"
 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_legions_desc: "If there is one unifying quality of the Aryan race, it is its warlike nature. We are fighters, conquerors, storming across the land and sacking the soft cities of decadent cultures. For the past several years, resource shortages and the destruction of past wars have prevented us from realizing this racial ideal. Our soldiers have often experienced shortages of ammunition and equipment. At our lowest, we have had guards on patrol with empty rifles.\n\nNow that our munitions factories are pumping out shells and bullets at a steady rate, we will have shortages no longer. Every single Aryan soldier will have a rifle and the ability to do his racial duty without rationing ammunition. This is a vital first step towards our goal of a modern army, as well as towards our broader objective of an Aryan state ruling all of western Russia."

 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_cavalry: "아리안 기병대"
 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_cavalry_desc: "Migration and long-distance conquest have been the essential elements of Aryan life for centuries, and indeed the supplanting of a weak race by a stronger one moving into its range is a fact of nature. In the modern day, we express this racial instinct not via horse or ship, but by truck and tank. Mechanized infantry was the engine of the German subjugation of Europe, the premier demonstration of the Aryan drive to expand in recent history. We, restricted to Permhaym and its surroundings, have remained disgustingly sedentary for too long, as we have not had the resources to power our truck fleet.\n\nThe reconstruction of our refineries has finally allowed us to follow in the footsteps of our migratory ancestors, with a vehicle supply that is the envy of western Russia. We will be as the Goths were to Rome: a tidal wave of Germanic superiority, cleansing the region by force."

The shiftless subhuman majority has been put to work reestablishing our industry, and the weapons of war flow out of our factories in impressive numbers.\n\nPermhaym is now an engine of death, the nexus of the coming racial struggle against the scum, degenerates, and race traitors that occupy the vast majority of Russia. Besides the bare necessities required to keep our laborers running, it produces only what is needed for combat. Our blood is pure, our iron is mighty, and our hearts are full of righteous hatred. We have created the perfect staging ground for expansion across the region, and all that is left is to begin."

Every day when the planes pass, we look toward the sky and see not terror, but admiration. The Aryans that live beyond Russia have fulfilled their fate, and through merit alone, reached the apex position among the blood. These bombs and terror are their tools to secure their dominance in Russia.\n\nFollowing the example set by our German kin and superiors; we shall be the terror of the land and night, while they reign in the sky and day. No longer shall our inferiors find the darkness a refuge, as the brothers will ransack the countryside and aid the Aryans in their quest.

The brothers, mighty as they may be, are disorganized and confused, with an unclear command structure and rules of seniority. We look to our silent benefactors, the Germans: with a centralized doctrine and the power of their blood, they were able to put the entirety of Russia to its knees.\n\nFollowing their example, we shall amend the structure of the Brotherhood's military arm. No longer shall a brother and another bicker among themselves as to who does what. Our senior brothers, effectively the officer corps of the Brotherhood, shall be granted formal authority to command. With these reforms in place, we shall aspire to one day achieve the heights of the Germans."

 PRM_AB_initial_disciplined_raiders: "훈련된 약탈단"
 PRM_AB_initial_disciplined_raiders_desc: "From the archives of Permhaym, the officers and generals of the Brotherhood study the art of war. In their search for perfection to the Aryan ideal, they stumbled across an innovative German idea: the general staff. A body of centralized command that deliberates and calibrates the course of warfare, ensuring that everything goes to plan. It is popular among the higher echelons but is infamous with the lower-ranking soldiers of the Brotherhood.\n\nHowever, what do the junior brothers know of running the Brotherhood? We shall establish the general staff and its dependent appendages, ensuring that combat will always go as planned.

With independence and a minimum of control, these battalions become as effective as they are chaotic: attacking without orders from headquarters, unpredictable in temperament, and restraint.\n\nInstead of investing power into a general staff, we can instead give the informal practice of unprecedented operational freedom an official stamp. These battalions will become autonomous, free to raid the countryside as they please. They will tear through the lands of Russia anew, spreading terror without mercy or exception.

We shall no longer be content with raiding the rural villages and towns, as these prove themselves to be a waste to the staff's efforts. Instead, we will set our eyes on the choicest pieces Russia can offer: its small cities. The risks of attacking these are high, but the rewards are vaster.

By dividing the regions into smaller chunks and assigning more units, we can increase the rate of raiding to the point of suffocation on the enemy's part. The sheer quantity and rapidity of the offensives will deprive them of the ability to recover.

The time is ripe for a test of our power, a trial that will redeem the worth of our bonds.\n\nWe look to our neighbors. To the south lay Bashkiria, with its pretensions to independence and self-determination. Our kin pine for liberation from the Untermensh, and the blood wishes to heed their call. To the north lay Berezniki, where wells of oil, resources, and motorized plans await for their use in the hands of a brave Aryan. Whatever we choose, we must prepare.

The Bashkirs have deluded themselves into thinking that they can rule over the blood.\n\nIt is time to make them pay for this insolence. Rather than Berezniki, we shall focus our efforts against the Bashkirs. Their villages, towns, and even cities will be made to pay the price of their delusion and cruelty.

To gain an edge over the other powers in the region, Berezniki presents a lucrative opportunity to ease the burden of operating and running motorized divisions, as well as depriving the so-called Tsar of raw material\n\nWe must strike at once. If we decide to go after Berezniki, our officers will draw plans and assign battalions to specific areas of the border. Our attack shall be quick and sharp but without mercy.

As the Untermensh themselves prepare to reclaim Russia for their ends, so must the Brotherhood grow and challenge them.

From their holes in the ground, they will crawl out, ready to challenge Aryan rule over these lands again.\n\nIt's now or never. Before our enemies can rise against us, we must stand.

Their factories can churn out guns for the Brotherhood's armies, and their people can provide the necessary labor to ensure a steady, uninterrupted supply of weaponry.\n\nHowever, before moving into Bashkiria proper, the Brotherhood will prepare itself. We will redirect our raids against them, wounding them with a thousand cuts before the time comes to finish them off. At the same time, our new secret police, the Gestapo, will infiltrate the territories of Bashkiria on the lookout for secrets and weaknesses.

Though Russians and Bashkirs are Untermensh, the Brotherhood has found the blood to be on the side of the former.\n\nBefore any attack on Bashkiria itself can occur, we need to widen the cracks that emerge between them. Though not many will join the Brotherhood willingly, there are Russians from whom we can extract loyalty against the Bashkir state.

Giving guns to such poor stock seems uncharacteristically foolish for the Reich, but, as we know all too well, the Germans are wise beyond measure and do everything with a purpose.\n\nNow that we have toppled Vyatka, that purpose is all too clear: to give the loyal followers of the Aryan race the weapons they need to seize their birthright."

While there are countless Slavs who display the weakness and cowardice that marks them as Untermensch, there are many others that display the resilience and motivation we thought was only found among the master race. The Brotherhood used to explain this phenomenon by saying that Slavs demonstrating Aryan characteristics were either actually Aryans that had been indoctrinated by the subhumans, or Slavs attempting to deceive the Ubermensch by imitating them.\n\nAs our reach has expanded, we have encountered increasing numbers of proud Slavs displaying the qualities we expect from Brotherhood members. Shultz and his supporters have put forth an explanation for this bizarre phenomenon. It is possible to be both Slavic and Aryan! This goes completely against the established beliefs of the Brotherhood, but if it is true it could pave the way to our salvation. If the Slavic peoples can be convinced to embrace Aryanism as part of their heritage, the master race will finally have full control of Russia. We must expand our criteria for Aryanism to allow those Slavs worthy of the title to earn their spot among our ranks."

It was this infection that caused us to mistake the Slavs for Untermensch for so long. If the children of Russia want to reclaim the purity and supremacy of their race, they must purge the non-Aryan elements of their culture. They will not be alone in their mission. The Brotherhood is full of proud men who are exemplars of Aryan virtues that are willing to help the Slavs rediscover the ways of the Ubermensch. Together, we will restore the Slavic peoples to the Aryan ideal that they once embodied.\n\nThe first step will be to purge Russia of its decadence. True Aryans live a life of restraint and moderation, surviving on only what they need and happily sacrificing personal comfort for their society's betterment. All of Russia must learn to live this way. The Slavs will suffer greatly as we strip them of their belongings and their comforts, but this cannot be avoided. They must earn their purity through hardship, and we will cleanse their blood's pollution in a trial of fire."

As our membership expands and the people of Russia accept us as their rightful masters who will lead them out of darkness, it is time to start preparing for the next generation of Slavic Aryan rule.\n\nThe most important duty of an Aryan woman is to raise as many Aryan children as she can to help guarantee the numerical superiority of the master race. This is especially important in our realm, where despite expanding our criteria the sub-humans still outnumber the Aryans almost two to one.\n\nThe Brotherhood will start a nationwide fertility program, teaching women about their maternal obligations and the importance of siring as many children as they can. We will offer rewards including extra rations and financial incentives to mothers who have more than two children, with greater and greater prizes the more children a mother has. The Aryan mothers of our nation will secure our people's future in the east!"

It was a miracle because by the old standards of the brotherhood, Aryans were an incredibly rare breed in Russia. This meant our pool of available Aryan fighting men was very shallow and manpower shortages were a constant worry to our commanders. Now that we have expanded Aryanism's definition to include Slavs that can prove their superior blood, a solution to this issue has presented itself.\n\nThe recruitment standards of the brotherhood's Aryan military units should be expanded to match the definition followed by the rest of the Brotherhood. This would open up membership to the hundreds of thousands of young Russian men looking to prove their worth and make a living. Even if not all of them prove to be of worthy stock, many more of them will, and our nation will finally have enough men to field a truly grand army worthy of the Aryan people. This army, the living embodiment of Aryan Slavic supremacy, will sweep east and liberate the children of Russia from the false Slavs that tyrannize them now."

These specimens are simply unfit to be members of our Brotherhood and the Aryan race, but they are not completely without hope.\n\nWe have already seen how some Slavs resisted the pollution of their blood. We will give their brethren a chance to redeem themselves, to clear the infections within them and reclaim their Aryan heritage. Through service in the military and the factories these Slavs shall learn what it means to be Aryan. They will develop the work ethic, the perseverance, and the loyalty required to be part of the master race.

After centuries of being corrupted and oppressed the Brotherhood has finally led them back into the light.\n\nThere is still much work to be done. It will take decades to fully undo the stains left by centuries of Untermensch rule. Some in our government worry that Shultz has misled the Brotherhood, and has strayed from the teachings of the Germans, but they are wrong. The millions of uplifted Aryans in our nation prove that the German invasion was both a powerful example of the master race's might, and perhaps the greatest tragedy in the history of our race.\n\nWhile the misguided Germans sought to destroy their fellow Aryans, the Brotherhood is not so foolish. As Ubermensch, it is our duty to rescue all who are worthy of belonging to our race. The Brotherhood's most important mission is to see the Slavic race restored.

To sacrifice that purity now, in the face of widespread insubordination among the sub-humans, would amount to racial suicide. Instead we will follow the example of the Germans, who have never steered us wrong. When dealing with resistance to their rule, the Germans crack down and use brutal suppression to enforce their will. This is how an Aryan nation should be run, not by bowing to the desires of the lesser peoples, but by imposing the iron laws of the Ubermensch upon them and wiping out anyone who seeks to subvert or escape those laws.\n\nAcross West Russia our Brothers have fought resistance movements and carried out terror raids on uncooperative communities, but they have done so in an unorganized and haphazard fashion. If a new Aryan order is going to come to Russia, these actions must be organized and coordinated by the high command, becoming the hammer the Brotherhood will crush the Slavic upstarts with for the last time."

We will reform these battalions into a secret internal security force, which some of our generals have taken to calling the "Nachtryters", night riders in Deytsch. It is an appropriate name as these men will do most of their work in the shadows and under the cover of darkness.\n\nThe Nachtryters will travel across Russia, always striking where they are least expected. They will descend upon bandit camps and quiet towns alike. Where we suspect partisans live, they will burn everything to the ground, killing anyone they can find and not leaving a single stone atop another, because it is better to have a pacified wasteland than an unreliable sector. In areas that are compliant they will be more subtle, dragging off anyone who comes under the brotherhood's suspicion during the darkest hours of the night and leaving no trace of their visit. The sub-humans will be so busy worrying over if they are next on the list, they will never have time to even think of resisting our rule."

Many officers in our internal security division have argued for their own ideas on how to put an end to the insubordination once and for all. One of the most promising proposals we have received has been termed "population distribution," but plainly put it would be taking hostages on a national level. The Brotherhood will take one member of every Untermensch family to labor camps where they will be held indefinitely until the nation has submitted to our rule. If any sabotage, terrorism, or banditry occurs, the entire population of the nearest camp will be executed and new hostages taken to refill it. This will be a costly program to enact, requiring resources and manpower that are already scarce. If it can cause a decline in resistance, either through intimidation or by turning local populations against the partisans, it will be worth it.

The new gods of Russia are the Ubermensch. Our soldiers fight with a divine fury, knowing that no other race on earth can stand against them and survive. The Untermensch that infest Russia are beginning to realize this as well. They can no longer keep up their delusions of humanity in the face of our obvious superiority.\n\nBrotherhood propaganda efforts will expose this new reality. One campaign will remind members of the Brotherhood, especially those in the armed forces, that they are the pinnacle of creation, and they answer to no one but their fellow Aryans.

Conflict with these disgusting excuses for nations is inevitable, and we shall be ready when it comes. The master race is one built for warfare and conquest, so must the Brotherhood's realm be built for these. Everyone at every level of our society, from the Fyurer to the lowest slave, will be mobilized to serve a role in the coming war. Russia has been divided for decades, and before that it endured centuries of Slavic domination. We will not tolerate this any longer. Russia is drawing itself back together, and as it does so its fate hangs in the balance.

The militarization of the realm in preparation for the conquest of the eastern lands is progressing steadily, with more Aryans joining the Brotherhood ranks and ascending to the top of our society where they belong. The Untermensch seem to be finally learning their place in the world of the Ubermensch, and offer a bottomless pool of expendable laborers that the Brotherhood can use to complete its many projects.\n\nFor many Aryans it seems we are finally coming out of the darkness, and approaching the status quo Russia always should have had. There is still work to be done of course. Bandits are still active along the fringes of our nation, and there are still rumblings of sub-human revolts that must be monitored. But there is no denying that the Aryan paradise we have fought so long for is finally within sight. With the Aryan race reigning as the masters of Russia and the Slavs and their brethren fully subjugated at last, the natural order has been restored. Russia will soon be pure."

As our people forge a new state that will be the eastern home of the Aryan people, we cannot forget why we must not fail to meet these goals. The Aryan bloodline is the pinnacle of evolution, the biological expression of perfection. As we consolidate our control, we must undertake every effort to entrench this bloodline into Russia, so that it will never be removed from its rightful home. We cannot be satisfied with ruling Russia. The Aryans must become the true children of the motherland.\n\nThe Brotherhood will begin simultaneous programs of cultural assimilation and eradication. We will spread Aryan culture, traditions, and language, all to encourage our people to accept their new heritage. To increase the progress of our race's entrenchment, we will erase non-Aryan cultural elements from the east. The histories of the Slavs and other subhuman peoples will end, and the inferior Russian tongue will eventually be phased out entirely. While some may consider these steps extreme, they are necessary. We cannot allow the Untermensch to corrupt our bloodline again, not when we have finally achieved purity."

 PRM_AB_teach_deytsch_desc: "We share the untainted blood of our Aryan siblings in Germany. Despite being equal members of the master race, our technology is much behind theirs. Part of this is explained by the scientific communities of Russia being run by Slavs for centuries, giving us a much worse scientific base to work from. But even in recent years, as the Aryan people have reclaimed Russia, our advances have been few and far between compared to the marvelous stories we hear from across our western border. There can only be one sensible explanation for this: our language. Though we are of one race, German and Russian Aryans are divided by language. It is clear the Russian tongue, with its Slavic influences and archaic alphabet, is holding us back.\n\nLuckily a solution is already apparent. Years ago, some members of the Brotherhood's officer korps took it upon themselves to learn Deytsch, the language of Germany, as a sign of their admiration. This trend quickly caught on and there are many fluent speakers already within our ranks. We should formalize the teaching of this tongue, making it the official language of the Aryan Brotherhood. The Brotherhood will require every member to learn it, and all schools and universities within our borders will only be allowed to teach in Deytsch. The transition may be bumpy, but if we are ever going to catch up with our brothers in Germany it is a sacrifice we have to make."

While the Aryan people have taken well to the language, we could soon find ourselves in a nation where the master race speaks one language, while the slave races speak another. Some Brotherhood members believe this would be a good thing, helping cement the divide between our people and the untermensch, but it could create enormous administrative difficulties for us in the future. If the slaves only speak Russian, or Tatar, or any number of minor languages, those who oversee them would be required to speak those languages as well to make their orders understood. This would condemn many Aryans to having to keep their knowledge of the inferior Slavic tongues, and negate the purpose of adopting a superior language. As loath as we are to dedicate any resources to them, the Brotherhood must begin efforts to educate the slaves on at least the rudimentary basics of Deytsch, so that all Aryans only have to speak the language of our choice."

Unfortunately for them, the Brotherhood has made up its mind. There is no place for the Russian language in our nation, and we must abandon it immediately if our bloodline is to achieve its full potential. Our linguists will translate everything to Deytsch as soon as possible. Government documents, street signs, menus in restaurants, all of this and anything else that is written down will be changed. There will be some confusion, and even chaos, in the weeks that follow the switch, but that is the price we must pay for efficiency.\n\nOnce the first phase is complete, the next step of the plan shall begin. Everyone, Aryan and untermensch alike, shall be required to speak only Deytsch. Anyone caught speaking any other language will be publicly flogged, and those who we catch doing this a second time will be executed for their betrayal of the Brotherhood.

By enslaving all non-Aryans within our borders, we are creating the perfect recipe for an uprising that would spell doom for the Aryans of the east. We have enslaved over 90% of our population, but administering that many slaves has proven impossible. Questions of ownership have complicated matters further, leaving us in a situation where we must contend with the instability of an enslaved populace while failing to exert any control over the majority of them. Something must change, but our leaders cannot agree on what.\n\nShultz's reformists advocate for emancipating the slaves. As heretical as this idea seems, their case is good. The untermensch would still be fully subservient to the Aryan, but as free individuals the issue of slave ownership would be eliminated.\n\nHowever, others in the high command, especially those close to Fyurer Vagner, have labeled this idea Slavic treachery and an invitation for race-mixing. They argue that we can solve the issue with the same method the Brotherhood has solved its other problems: brute force. The slave system must be organized and the overseers must crush any signs of resistance without mercy. Both cases seem convincing but we are running out of time and must decide soon."

The entire fate of our bloodline depends upon the Brotherhood securing a permanent home for the race in Russia. As long as there are slaves, there is risk of uprisings, and as long as there is risk of uprisings, our people will never be safe. Shultz has drafted a plan that would put an end to enslavement and allow the current slaves to work their way to freedom over the next few years. While it is far from the ideal system the Fyurer first envisioned so many years ago, it will maintain the superior position of the master race in our society while also allowing for even a modicum of long-term stability.

Every Aryan knows that the untermensch are still slothful, degenerate creatures that need to be motivated to work. The emancipation plan is designed around this fact. Slaves will need to complete a certain amount of work to earn their freedom and the few rights that will come with it. The specific amount of work required will be determined by the type of labor involved, but it will equate to roughly three or four years of work in the field. The faster the work is completed, the more quickly freedom is earned. This will allow the younger and stronger slaves to earn their freedom more quickly, and through more dangerous work such as at munitions plants or in textile mills. The weaker slaves, the children, the elderly, and the sickly, will need more time to complete their work, meaning the slaves that pose less of a threat to their masters will remain under direct control for much longer. Of course, if too many valuable slaves are earning their freedom no one could stop us from extending their enslavement as long as is needed."

Our production numbers have increased almost across the board. Everything from farms to mills to munitions plants have shown increased output as formerly slothful slaves have begun working at a frantic pace. We should encourage this behavior from the untermensch. Publicly promoting stories of workers who have already earned their freedom and encouraging them to speak about the wonders of their emancipation will prove that the promise of freedom is not just a rumor or a lie spread by the Brotherhood.\n\nThe slaves know that the road to their freedom is not easy, or safe. The recent increase in work related fatalities is evidence enough of that. They do not care. As long as we dangle a chance at liberation in front of them, they will do whatever it takes to reach it.

We are working them harder than ever before, reaping ever-increasing rewards as they toil for the benefit of the ubermensch.\n\nThe decision to end slavery was not made because of childish altruism, but because it was a necessary and efficient step to guarantee the survival of our people. No true Aryan would have done anything different, and those who question the decision have exposed themselves as race traitors. They are not fueled by a love of their blood, but by a hatred for the untermensch. The untermensch are unquestionably despicable, but the first priority must always be our race and whatever is best for it.

A certain willpower is required to thrive under the rule of the Brotherhood, and this willpower is not exclusive to the ubermensch. No subhuman is equal to an Aryan, but not every subhuman is equally vile. There are those that can stand tall and provide for both themselves and the state, possessing certain Aryan qualities, even if they themselves might not be Aryan in blood. Then there are the others that are too weak to do this, who are truly the lowest of the low.\n\nThe freedom we are offering is a reward to those strong enough to claim it.

The only rest that will be permitted will be at the end of the day when the slaves have already worked themselves past the point of exhaustion. Without little things to hope for like a decent meal or an unexpected break, the untermensch will eventually forget how to hope for bigger things like escape or revolution. The next generation of slaves will grow up never knowing the feeling at all, and the generation after that will be physically incapable of wanting to improve their condition. They will finally have become the perfect slaves, worthy of their perfect masters."

This would also allow the Brotherhood to disguise some of our peacekeeping actions as enemy attacks on the slaves. Regional pacifications and extermination campaigns could be presented as Tatar raids and Slavic retaliations.\n\nThe sub-humans will be so busy focusing their hatred on one another that their resentment towards the Aryan race will become an afterthought in their minds. While they fight amongst themselves, we will continue to consolidate our control over every aspect of their lives.

Everyone in the Brotherhood admires the Fyurer's genius, but some have become worried about his refusal to even consider compromise in the face of existential threats to the race. These members have rallied around Zigfrid Shultz, the dark horse of the Brotherhood command and the self proclaimed "Savior of the Race". Shultz and his disciples advocate a radical theory that the Slavs are the true Aryan race and the Germans that the Fyurer admires so much are zionist puppets.\n\nBoth men refuse to back down from their views and the ideological war between them has reached a fever pitch. A victor will soon be determined, and the future of the Aryan race hangs in the balance. Russia is only big enough for one tyrant."

Now is the time to march east against the race-traitors who continue to defy our righteous rule and seize our destiny once and for all!\n\nAnd once the East has been brought under Aryan rule once more, our great host will not stop there, for there is still so much work to be done. To our west, the subhuman Germanic scourge that has defiled our sacred land arrogantly continues their unjust occupation of millions of Aryans. This tragedy has gone on for long enough! With Siberia secured, we can begin preparations for the final struggle against the Jew and their decadent German puppets!"

Although it is a fact that much of the world is still corrupted by sinister Judaean influence, it would still be prudent to begin making our first forays into the international community and make our voices heard. With our meteoric successes in uniting the region, the nations of the world will surely have no choice but to start taking us seriously.\n\nDiplomats of good Aryan stock will set out for foreign nations around the globe with the objective of getting our name out there, and making sure that the world knows that the Brotherhood is here and means business. No longer will West Russia be marked on maps as a blank no-man's-land. The Brotherhood's triumphs will be acknowledged whether the world likes it or not."

To the west lies our Germanic brethren in Reichskommissariat Moskowien, the easternmost administrative division of the esteemed Greater Germanic Reich. The Brotherhood owes much to the Germans for enlightening and uplifting us in the first place, and the time has come to finally let our unconditional gratitude be known in no uncertain terms.\n\nOur diplomats shall be sent to Germany bearing gifts and good will, and will make clear our intentions to aid them in their struggle against the eternal Jew however we can. From these foundations we hope that further, more ambitious possibilities of Pan-Aryan cooperation can be born. As our western cousins would surely accept all the help they can get in stabilizing their eastern flank, we have no doubt that they will be delighted to welcome overtures from their fellow Aryans with open arms!"

The pure Aryans among us now occupy their rightful places at the top of the social and military hierarchies and the Untermensch toil away at the whims of their betters. Our lands are not the only ones to contain men of pure Aryan stock, and surely there must be others whose hearts drive them to be better than those around them. Surely there are men outside our borders who will hear us and whose blood tells them that our ideas are correct. We must reach farther than our borders to find suitable stock for our Aryan upper echelons. Send the pamphlets, broadcast messages that tout the superiority of our race and the great success of our new society.

In this harsh world, all those of good breeding must stick together, lest they fall prey to the machinations of the Zionist enemy. It is for this reason that establishing closer ties with the Greater German Reich is an absolute imperative if our nation will survive in the long term.\n\nDespite our close proximity to them, the Germans have proven surprisingly difficult to contact. Our past messengers have not received even a word in return, and rumors (doubtlessly false) that the leadership of Reichskommissariat Moskowien dispute our Aryan status are beginning to spread throughout our ranks. It is no matter. If the Germans have by chance not yet seen our messages, the only thing to do is send yet more until they finally respond."

 PRM_AB_a_pan_aryan_congress_desc: "Our attempts to contact the Reich appear to have fallen on deaf ears. We cannot be certain whether the Germans have not received our communications or are simply ignoring them, but, in any case, our previous efforts have not been enough. It could very well be that the Reich does not take the Aryan Brotherhood seriously enough to consider negotiations.\n\nTo prove our faithfulness to the cause, a Pan-Aryan Congress is in order! Our agents will distribute materials to German officials and as many international believers in Hitler's ideals as we can reach. This Congress should suffice to prove our seriousness to the Germans and bring about a new era of international Aryan cooperation."

The Germans rule Reichskommissariat Moskowien; we rule the region ranging from there to the Ural Mountains. The great majority of Siberia still lies in the hands of Asiatic savages, and no Aryans can live in safety until the Russians are subjugated all the way to the Pacific.\n\nAs the Reich already struggles to control its share of Russian territory, it is up to us to finish the job. To do that, we must carefully investigate our eastern nemeses, starting with the West Siberians, our immediate neighbors. With enough information, our legions will know when is ideal to strike, and the great conquest can begin in earnest."

 PRM_AB_the_khazak_conundrum_desc: "Greater races crush lesser races under their heel and enslave them. This is the sole principle of nature. When even a formerly mighty race stagnates and falters, it risks its own annihilation. Any scholar seeking an example needs to look no further than the Kazakhs. Once a warrior people deserving respect as well as hatred, they have fallen far. To leave them be in their present state, as meek pastoralists, would be to do them a disservice.\n\nBy mercilessly pillaging Kazakhstan with a great army of Aryans, we will be following the will of natural selection. The Kazakhs have forgotten that every facet of existence is struggle, and to cease for even a moment is to surrender oneself to annihilation. It is too late for them to redeem themselves, but we can learn (and profit) much from their failures."

It is now our responsibility to emulate them, through the greatest characteristic of our race: conquest. The Germans have done well to push the boundaries of Aryan civilization as far east as they have. It falls to us to continue their advance, the great expansion of our kind to ever greater frontiers.\n\nThe remainder of Russia is controlled by pathetic vermin, but we must remember that even a rat can fight with vigor once backed into a corner. As we push eastwards, we must not grow complacent, as doing so would make us no better than those we fight. With courage and martial spirit, we will not falter, and our crusade for all of Russia will be the subject of great sagas long into the future."

 PRM_AB_we_stand_alone_desc: "To the nations of the world, "Aryan" has a very particular meaning: the Germanic peoples of northern Europe, who claimed the mantle with the creation of their continent-spanning empire. This title is undeserved: the Germans are a weak, servile people, the unknowing pawns of Jewish masters, who long ago swept in from Asia and displaced the true Aryans. The false attribution of Aryan identity has spread even into our own realm, a fact that must be rectified immediately.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood is the only legitimate representative of the master race, the Slavo-Aryan people distinct from the Asiatic German usurpers. No other nation on the planet is on our side, and we must abandon the idea of foreign alliances as we move forwards."

Certainly, it claims the mantle, trumpeting to the world its opposition to the Elders of Zion and their machinations, its love of traditional morality, and its loyalty to the cause of the white race. All of this, every last little morsel, is vile deception spawned from the rot that the Reich claims to cleanse.\n\nThe deep conspiracy that pervades every aspect of global civilization and corrupts all that is good did not disappear in 1933; it merely offered concessions, a fake Aryan state that sells out a small portion of the Jews in exchange for the continued domination, behind the scenes, of the real masters. In Aryan guise, the Jews have spread their rule even farther across Europe. We have clearer eyes. We can see Germany's true nature. And we will let the world hear its greatest, darkest secret."

 PRM_AB_deride_burgundy_desc: "What ridiculousness it is that even the most fervent aspirants to true Aryan purity fail to meet its basic standards! The fact that the Reich is morally polluted and controlled by Jews is something that Heinrich Himmler, like us, could see. The Reichsführer-SS established his Ordensstaat to fix Germany's deviations. Even with this, he did not evade the pull of the Zionists! Even now, Burgundy fills its SS with non-Aryan filth and lets its ruler live fat like a Jewish banker!\n\nOur criticisms of Burgundy will be a test, its final chance for redemption. If Himmler takes our guidance into account and reforms his state in the right direction, it proves these errors were simply that. If he does not, we have irrevocable proof that he too is but a puppet on the strings of our eternal adversaries."

The Jews seek to control our past so they can control our future. Only by knowing his roots will the Aryan understand his destiny, which is why they take such pains to hide it from us. The abominable false Reich would have us believe that northern Europe, its present location, is that homeland. What lies! What trickery! What utter dreck!\n\nThe truth is that the Slavo-Aryan race hails from Palestine, "burnt camp" in the ancient tongue. It is a disgusting insult that this is exactly the location the Jews today claim to be their homeland. The world must know that we no longer tolerate the millenia-old theft of our heritage. In time, our armies will sweep through the Levant, eject the inhabitants, and reintroduce our people to the holiest place of all Aryan-kind."

The first step on this path is erasing from existence our next-door neighbors, the vermin who purport to rule the region of West Siberia.\n\nEven with our superior faculties, we are doomed if we do not accurately assess the situation. Our agents will quickly gather vital information about the West Siberian government, its capabilities, and its intentions. We need to know every element of our eastern foes, every detail, or else the Aryan race will once again live in ignorance of its greatness under the boot of those inferior to it."

 PRM_AB_look_to_the_south_desc: "The Central Asians are warriors, but cannot be compared to the Slavo-Aryan race to any extent. To do so would be to compare a mangy hyena to a mighty lion, merely on the basis that both consume prey. Nevertheless, they have been a thorn in the side of our people for many generations, slaughtering and enslaving us while we were blind to our true glory. They must be dealt with preemptively, just in case they interfere with our expansion across Russia.\n\nAs we have no interest in toppling them for the time being, a great punitive raid should suffice to make the Kazakhs fear us. Let this be an example to all who stand against us: the Aryan neither forgives nor forgets, and even insults from centuries ago will be punished as harshly as if they had happened yesterday."

The rest is overrun by degenerate rats and Zionist puppets, from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. We have already come far, but we would dishonor our ancestors and the gods if we stopped here.\n\nFirst, we will take West Siberia and purify the territory. Then, we will march until the whole of Russia is in the hands of its one true masters. After that comes the capture of Europe from the German imposters, the conquest of our ancestral homeland, the annihilation of the weak races of the Orient, the obliteration of the Jewish citadel of America, and a thousand other conquests, until the unity of the world under the one master race becomes a reality at last."

A land of plenty, where its people knew no hardship, nor strife.\n\nTimes have changed, but our people have not. At heart, the Boreal Rus are still indeed the true children and inheritors of the world. We are the true Aryans; the Brotherhood had that much right.

Our true enemies are still the Jewish devils and Masonic leeches, but we must open our brothers' eyes. The roots of their corruption run deep indeed.

Those who are educated know that the 'German Aryan' is nothing more than a sub-human specimen who migrated out of their dungholes in East Asia. The true Aryans, us Boreal Rus, are the chosen peoples, with our rich heritage. It was us who were forced north from the Levant, chased out of our homelands by the Eternal, barbaric Jew.

We can not simply allow people freedom with blatant leniency, though. We would be no better than the degenerate Christians and Jews if we released prisoners with no penalties. Our ancestors, thankfully, knew a solution.\n\nTo prove their worthiness, those who petition us for release must face the Trials of Redemption, a series of challenges to weed out the disingenuous and weak from those deserving to be released as Hyperborean Aryans.

The crusade against the eternal Jew will only escalate from here, and the Reykh will need every single pair of hands that still does not hold a gun.\n\nThe slaves work tirelessly to manufacture war material for our purposes, but this is not enough. Those on the homefront too must do their part. If they cannot go into battle, they will go to work in the assembly lines.

During their invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans were able to traverse enormous spans of territory thanks to the near-total motorization of their forces. We should take yet another page from their book, and attempt to make an effort to increase the mobility of our own forces.

Now that the soldiers of the Reykh have wrested control away from the subhumans, the Aryans of this region can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nWe have no doubts that they will welcome their brothers with open arms, and join them in their arduous quest to forge a thousand year Reykh!"

We will repay their foolish delusions of grandeur in kind, and clasp them in irons.

Fyurer Vagner has it on good authority that the Germans are greatly interested in our efforts, and wish to see us achieve our goals on our own initiative rather than at the whims of another.

Meanwhile, the subhuman filth knows that we intend to stomp them under our boots and are digging in.\n\nThis war will be glorious indeed! The Vermakht stands ready to begin the attack, hardened by years of brutal fighting in the service of their Reykh. The enemies who stand before them may not be of pure birth, but they make up for this glaring inadequacy with an animalistic ferocity.

 ### Introductory Events ###
 PRM.1.t: "아리아인 형제단"
 PRM.1.desc: "Born after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aryan Brotherhood is the brainchild of Gutrum Vagner, known in another life as Alexey Dobrovolsky.\n\nThe shock of the Germans blitzing across Russia has led to the rise of many groups claiming that the Germans were right; and Dobrovolsky's small one was no exception. However, by gathering as much information as he could on the German regime and its intricacies, he soon enough managed to gather more and more of these small groups into one cohesive whole; the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nCoalescing around Perm and Tatyshlinsky, the Brotherhood continued to refine its methods of "sorting out Aryans" from the local populace via grueling physical and mental tests, preparing for the struggle for the remnants of Russia. A struggle which seems closer and closer by the day, and the Brotherhood shall stand ready. Not just to deliver Western Russia at the Reich's feet, but also, maybe, to have the chance to finish the Vaterland's job..."
 PRM.1.a: "Russia shall bow before the Swastika!"

 PRM.2.t: "형제단의 승리!"
 PRM.2.desc: "The glorious city of Permhaym and its' Aryan Inhabitants were engulfed in joy and celebration as our brave Warriors returned home from battle from the Bashkir whelps, full of stories of glory and plunder. The Bashkirs, as expected, fell under their furious onslaught, or turned tail like the cowards they were and slunk back into their caves.\n\nA glorious battle is cause for celebration enough, but more than this, we are now in possession of a sliver of their land - as it should be. As the Fyurer has proclaimed, once our mission is done, all of the future Reykh is to become living space for the Brotherhood."
 PRM.2.a: "Another Victory for the Aryan!"

 PRM.3.t: "바쉬키리아에서의 패배"
 PRM.3.desc: "Tragedy struck the streets of Permhaym today - the so called 'Aryan Warriors' we sent to decimate the forces of the Bashkir Menace returned not only empty handed, but with their tails between their legs, scurrying back to their masters like dogs. The Fyurer's rage was great, and he immediately declared all survivors of the conflict that ran from the front lines Untermensch.\n\nYet the Fyurer is not without mercy - the scum were simply put to death. They had earned that much, at least."
 PRM.3.a: "Curses!"

 PRM.4.t: "바쉬키리아와의 무승부"
 PRM.4.desc: "The Fyurer's mood was a dark one when he learned our Warriors returned home, bloodied and bruised, but their saving grace was that the Bashkirs returned home just as mauled. Though we are in possession of no new lands or plunder from the failed Raid, our Warriors have nevertheless proven themselves true Aryans - they turned a losing battle into a draw.\n\nAnd that is surely another victory for the future Reykh."
 PRM.4.a: "Disappointing."
 
 PRM.8.t: "The Brotherhood Needs Blood"
 PRM.8.desc: "The future of the Aryan race depends on renewal. As the weeks go by, the Fyurer knows, the untermensch become complacent and arrogant, descending into degeneracy and Jewry as the older Brothers fail to beat them hard enough.\n\nAs its control over the Reykh slips, the Brotherhood must restore itself through blood. By organising another Rite of Ascension, bringing into the fold new men to induct into the Aryan race, we shall cause the untermensch to cower in terror and solidify our own power. To fail to participate in this periodic renewal will see us weaken further, inevitably succumbing in future at the hands of our Aryan betters.\n\nThe Ascension shall be a violent one. To complete it, hundreds of men, women and children of the Slavic race must be killed by our inducted brothers. Their cries of pain and fear, the misery of weakness and death, can only be borne by the most ruthless murderers we find. Those who fail the task will die in turn."

 PRM_initial.11.t: "썩어가는 도시"
 PRM_initial.11.desc: "Dawn looms over Permhaym, illuminating the cobbled roads and rotten-smelling markets. Men and women, dressed in shabby rags, clamber out from their homes for the day's daily toil. Children play amid its quiet streets, laughing and keeping a watchful eye to the skies. Dressed in faux-feldgrau, The men of the Brotherhood patrol the streets and man the anti-air emplacements around the city. The thump of their well-shined boots sends the young ones scurrying to the shadows, their timbre more fearsome than any bomber can summon.\n\nIn one dilapidated and abandoned corner of the city walks senior brother Waldemar, alone, with his partner absent, writhing in bed, enduring a fever. Waldemar paid his worry no heed; if the man is Aryan enough, he will recover. Besides, in his absence, no one would rat out his dereliction of duty. The choice to spend this free time, however, is not nearly as liberating. In the district he patrols, there is nothing but broken and shattered buildings and rats, save for one squat and rundown bar.\n\nStepping into it, he hails the waiter, "This bar is a shameful establishment," says Waldemar, "I order a full cup of sour beer and be quick about it. The Brotherhood shall handle your payment." The owner, flushed-faced, went to fetch a dusty tankard and washed it in dirty water. Waldemar sighs. No other choice. A few moments later, his drink would arrive, foaming at its rims. He did not deign to drink it. Meeting the owner's gaze, he says, "You seem to be holding something in, Untermensh. Speak, slave, or forever hold your peace." The owner seemed struck, and began, "You people cannot do this to us; one day, the will of Russia will rise and crush you. Besides, are you not also Russi-" He held his hand up."I've heard enough," he says, "the Brotherhood has plans for us all, and you will not stop us." He stands and spits into his pint, "We will pay for this portion." He threw open the doors and stormed out."

 PRM_initial.14.desc: ""Brother Vagner," said a senior brother, dressed in an all-black uniform, "welcome to the training fields." In front of them stood several platoons of men, each dressed in the same outfit, standing at attention. "As you can see, we have prepared for your arrival. Examine the men before you to your heart's desire." They were the perfect Aryan specimen, standing proud on the dark, cold earth, points of Aryan light amid Russian darkness. Their arms bore the armband that all brothers of the Brotherhood wore. A piece of red fabric with a white circle in the middle of which was a swastika.\n\n"Thank you, brother Ditrikh," Vagner said, "it's an honor to examine these fine examples of the Aryan blood within us." Dashing they were, and tall, with a ruddy, reddish hue on their cheeks. Not one of them averted their eyes when they met Vagner's. Instead, in each were a fire, burning with enthusiasm, its crackle audible to his ears. "I see you have trained them well. Tell me, Ditrikh," the old brother turned his head to face Vagner, "did your men eat well last night?"\n\n"Of course, sir. The slaves assigned to this regiment were of the highest quality," Ditrikh snorted, "might I even say they make for excellent cooks. Thank you for that, sir. As well as," he pointed to the rifles and machine guns of the men, "the munitions and equipment."\n\n"No need to thank me, brother. A workman must have the best tools to do his task, must he not? You and your regiment have proven yourselves worthy of the labor the slaves have put into your tools."\n\n"Thank you, sir, and should we proceed?""

 PRM_initial.17.t: "도살자의 도시"
 PRM_initial.17.desc: "Gutrum Vagner, the Fyurer of the Aryan Brotherhood and greatest despot of West Russia, was proud of many things. He was proud of his blood, the mighty Aryan stock that impelled him towards great and terrible deeds. He was proud of his martial spirit, his leadership, his deep knowledge of the principles of politics and war, and his tireless will to reshape the world. He had a haughty admiration, unburdened by doubt or reason, for himself as the pinnacle of racial development. Looking out on the city of Perm from the Brotherhood's Folkshale, he felt prouder than ever before, not only for his own myriad virtues but for everything his people had accomplished.\n\nIt had a stark, brutal beauty to it. The buildings were concrete blocks, the decadent historic structures cleared away by war and demolition to make way for the needs of the race. The streets, once teeming with Bolshevist filth, were now filled only with quiet, orderly slave crews watched carefully over by Aryan overseers. New factories appeared seemingly every day, filling the skies with smog and pumping out nothing else but the finest weapons of war for his legions.\n\nVagner had taken the disorderly mess that was Perm and beaten it viciously into shape. Now its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, Aryan or slave, were seemingly of a single mind, united by force towards a single purpose: the utter annihilation of anyone who would stand in the way of the Aryan Brotherhood."

 PRM_initial.20.desc: "As he was led to the ceremony room, Dmitri Polachev tried to calm his racing thoughts. He recalled wisdom from the doctrine: the mind had a hierarchy of thoughts, just as the body had a hierarchy of blood. Fear, doubt, and anxiety were the brain patterns of vermin; Aryans thought only of strength and courage, violence and conquest. Nervousness was a vestige of the inferiority he would soon leave behind.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, he reached the end of the long corridor and entered the grand hall. Aryans, members of the organization, sat in a horseshoe surrounding the center of the room, with a cloaked higher-ranked member on an elevated seat in the center. Dmitri dropped to his knees instinctively."Initiate Polachev, rise." The hooded figure spoke in a soft voice that nevertheless carried through the chamber. He obeyed, attempting to mimic the dignified figure of the Nordic ideal as he stood.\n\n"You have performed admirably in the Trials, served with unflinching loyalty in all the duties of the initiate. You have sworn the oaths to Folk, Reykh, and Fyurer. You have proven yourself as one among the elect. Revel in the worthiness of your blood, Matyas Gertzfeld. Welcome to the Aryan Brotherhood."\n\nThe seated members clapped politely as Matyas received the proof of his superiority: a swastika pin, which he proudly attached to his lapel. His haughty posture, an affectation only a few minutes before, was now genuine. He felt pride and hatred pervade him to the bone. He was part of a small, elite class high above the millions of vermin that filled Russia, and he would die before relinquishing that status."

 PRM_initial.21.desc: "Dmitri's night was quiet. The German planes had stopped. In the woods where he lived, all was silent, save for the crackling of the campfire, and the still, whispering band of men sitting around it. The air stirred. He drew a long stretch of his cigarette, watching the embers bloom and fade to grey. Along with the aroma of the tobacco, the images of home and family entered his mind, filling his thoughts in a gentle, smoking haze. He shook the cigarette gingerly and let its ashes dissipate into the wind. Warm and comfortable, he felt his eyelids sag, and dozed off.\n\nHe awoke to the sound of boots trampling through the forest. Some of the men had abandoned their places already, leaving behind whatever they had taken to this sacred place. In the distance, Dmitri could hear the faint revving of a truck. Then the gunshots came. Men, dressed in black uniforms, emerge into the clearing. He and the rest of the companions huddled together, as the yoke of these men slowly wound themselves closer.\n\n"Do not be alerted," he heard a voice say. Its owner strolled behind his men, his hands clasped behind his hip."Rejoice, instead, for the Brotherhood has come to you this night to deliver neither death nor doom, but hope." He paused, looking at Dmitri. He went closer, into the circle, and squatted down, gently running his fingers through Dmitri's rough cheeks and beard."I can feel that we are of the same blood already, brother." He stood up, looking straight into Dmitri's eyes, and said, "If you would only still your shivers, then you would be worthy." Bending down, he put his palms on Dmitri's shoulders."But there is always an opportunity to improve, now get up." He offered his hand, and Dmitri grasped it without hesitation.\n\n"Good, good, brother," he said, swinging his arms around Dmitri's neck, "now follow us." He looked at the rest of the companions in contempt and said, "Liquidate the rest." Dmitri dared not look back, even as the screams ensued and ceased."

The guard tipped down his hat and returned Volfgang's papers."Do not cause too much trouble." the guard smirked and winked. Volfgang gave the man his thanks and proceeded into the building, opening the door to the din of the beer hall, with brothers young and old toasting each other while slave girls worked in the aisles of the tables, carrying towering tankards of the thick, sour brew.\n\nHe picked a vacant seat and sat in it. He ordered a drink from a slave, addressing her curtly and without affection. When it arrived, he did not even deign to thank her and took it without comment. While enjoying his pint, a group of boisterous young men barged through the doors, exchanging crude jokes with one another. They were men from his platoon. He waved at them to join him. Soon his table became crowded with comrades, brothers in arms, with whom he shared the highest bond, far beyond family, that binds them deeper and thicker than mere blood.\n\n"Quiet, quiet! Order! Order!" Men shouted as they cleared the center of the hall, leaving a lone, red-faced man standing on a table, stumbling drunkenly side-to-side in an effort not to fall. His friends laughed at him, jeering him to go on. He straightened his back, and, making an earnest face, drew his breath.\n\n"Comrades, brothers, countrymen!" He started, waving his arms wildly. He began his appeal, without adornment nor ostentation. Though without elegance nor panache, his words, railing against their inferiors, struck a chord with the crowd. His anger at the low station of the Aryans resonated with Volfgang. He ended his tirade, saying: "And this is what I suggest, brothers! A putsch! A putsch against fate! To rage against it, to burn out in the struggle, to rebel against our destiny, and make our own!" The hall erupted in cheers, and Volfgang found himself repeating the words."

He gets up and kneels at the bedposts of his small room, praying to the Trinity for his daily bread, after which he dresses up in his coarse garments. The landlord, an Aryan, never so much as glances at him nor wonder at his absence. All that matters to that squat, little man is his rent. Until recently, however, Sergei could not pay him, subsisting on hard labor and his pity.\n\nYesterday, however, caused a radical change in Sergei's life. The local Brotherhood patrol brought something other than terror: jobs. From six in the morning to ten in the evening, with extra rations and a little more pay, enough so that his landlord should not force him to sleep in the cold. Today, Sergei's pace is lighter than usual, happy that he has work, with money and food awaiting on the other side of the day. The plant is near his home, only a block away from where he lives.\n\nWhen he opened the doors to its floors, he found a few hundred men and women working on their respective tables, assembled into lines and ranks, with rusty and unwieldy tools laid in front of them. Deeper into the factory, the sound of heavy machinery laboring roared into the ceilings, bouncing off walls on its way down. The brothers, clad in their gray attire, watch them closely. Sometimes they would take an insubordinate worker outside and beat them, but so far, Sergei could not hear any gunshots. When lunch comes, the Brotherhood upholds its word, serving broth and bread before sending them back to work.\n\nAt ten in the evening, as promised, they let them go. The commanding officer gives them their pay, as well as some bread for dinner. Sergei has never worked as hard in his life, nor has he ever been in so much terror. As soon as he entered his room, he collapsed, forgetting his nightly prayer."

Russians were survivors, after all.\n\nA knock at the door, three hard "thumps" of a gloved hand on wood. Hundreds of doors, in fact, on apartments all over the city. A father rose, gingerly stepped over his sleeping children to answer. A young woman slowly crawled out from under her thin blanket, shaking out of a mixture of fear and cold. An old man stood shivering with creaking limbs, stowed his book away from sight and held his lantern close to his eyes as he crept to the door.\n\nAnother knock, loud and harsh, threatened to break the door down with its violence, and the residents of Permhaym quickened their pace. Finally, they opened the door; in each case, a weary homeowner came face-to-face with a rifle. Their eyes fearfully moved from the barrel of the guns to the chests, and then the face of the users. These were "Aryans", the pins on their lapels and the haughty look in their eyes marking them out as their betters. They spoke tersely, unwilling to waste even words on their inferiors: "Work detail. Now."\n\nPermhaym's new laborers, stumbling in the dark, were marched silently to the factories at gunpoint. They worked ceaselessly, taking short breaks only for bread and, when the guards weren't looking, sleep.

The place was dark, with a lone candle sitting on a bedside stand illuminating the air. The tiny bed is covered in a mountain of dirty laundry and with the lowest layer being their cleanest garments.\n\nA head poked out of the mess. "Mother?" a weak and trembling voice called out, "are you there?" Sofia rushed to her side, saying, "Nastya, Nastya, my dear, do not exert yourself." Sofia laid her hands on Nastya's forehead, "Thank the Lord that your temperature has gone down. Have you eaten the meals I prepared for you?" A nod. "Did you drink the medicine?" Some bitter herbs, better than nothing, but another nod. "Oh good," Sofia said, heaving a big sigh, "I have brought you some bread for you to eat." She saw Nastya's smile, the happiest moment in her life, and saw it fade and crumble as she asked, "Have you eaten?" Her stomach seemed to grumble in response, but she nodded her head. "Yes."\n\nThus began Nastya's dinner. Her mother broke off pieces of bread for her, and as she ate, Sofia took its crumbs and swiped it off the bed. When it was over, they talked. Nastya, now stronger with some fuel in her belly, led the conversation. "How's your work, mother," she said, "did the men in grey treat you well?" Sofia's mind flashed to the time when they struck her fellow worker, an aged man who was there for just the bread. "Yes, they have, and it's no cause for you to worry!" Nastya puffed her lips, "Good! Otherwise, I would beat them black and blue!"\n\nSofia laughed, something she hasn't done in a long time, and tussled her daughter's hair.

The guards stared at them in contempt and gestured to them to move quicker. One brother took a laborer he hated aside and said: "Tell your friends that if you don't do a good job, you will regret it."\n\nThe inspector arrived. Sergei could tell by the thump of the boots, the only sound that rises above the roaring of machines and engines, and the slow, steady bangs and squeaks in the work tables. The inspector's shadow grew longer until it pierced the doorway. A man, somewhat short, emerged in the doorway. His entourage preceded him, covering the corners of the room, in case of workers fleeing, Sergei supposed. No time for such thoughts, however. Sergei put his back to his work, screwing and polishing the rifles together without pause.\n\nA bomber loomed ahead, far above. The scream of its alarms drove Sergei to his knees, and he shut his eyes. The anti-air guns fired, the sounds shaking the ground under his feet. Silence, and then an explosion. He could feel the shrapnel tearing through the buildings near him. He opened his eyes. None of the workers had gone down to their feet, and the inspector stood in front of him. He felt his heart plunge, and he stared blankly at the inspector's boots.\n\n"Looks like you still have a ways to go," he said, "Untermensh." Before Sergei could even stammer out an apology, he felt the force of soles of those shoes in his face, loosening one of his teeth."Looks like we have one to make an example out of, boys. Take him."

Today, Vagner and the Council of the Brotherhood had given them a special assignment: the branding of slaves. In the hot fire-pits in front of them, were two brands. Both were red-iron hot, burning as if driven by a strange desire to subsume, to make another submit to one's will.\n\nThe new batch of slaves was coming. Rumors from the lower ranks, as well as the lowly servants that made the bulk of the labor force in the barracks, had stipulated that these bunch were especially pitiful. Short, thin, with a willowy complexion laid over them like a thin shroud of pale grey fabric. Ditrikh, an Aryan brother since the first days of the Brotherhood, pointed to one of the brands, whose end was shaped like a swastika.\n\n"Most of today's crew would probably use this one," he said, opening his palms against the hooked cross to feel the warmth emanate, and the cruelty flow, "means they would make bad slaves.

Twelve Aryan managers goose-stepped from the city to the refinery, several hundred bedraggled workers marching behind them at gun-point. One of them carried a flag proudly emblazoned with the swastika standard, as though the reconstruction of a Soviet refinery was an existential victory for the Aryan race. For them, perhaps it was. Just outside of the building, one of the officials signaled that he would speak, and the soldiers herded their prisoners into a loose audience with a few strategic rifle-butts. They stood with rapt attention as he began.\n\n"Long ago, far before even the ancient ancestors of the Aryans set up their majestic empires, millions of creatures lived and died, vanquished when they could not keep up with the pressures of natural selection. They were then drawn under the earth by the passage of time, their remains crushed and blasted by enormous weight and heat into what we recognize as petroleum. In a sense, they have been smashed under the planet's boot. It is fitting, then, that our state, built upon the backs of those too weak to claw themselves a place in it, relies so heavily upon oil. It is the lifeblood of the Earth, and it will be the potent blood of the next Reykh!"\n\nThe soldiers quickly started clapping, and, after being persuaded with several solid kicks, the workers reluctantly followed.

The Soviets, their arch-enemies, had provided the Brotherhood with the means to build the new order. A world where the lesser would learn their places in the hierarchy.\n\nAn explosion rang from within, a muffled cacophony of a thousand cracklings, steadily getting louder and louder, before fading away to silence. A brother stepped out, hands over ears. He approached the distressed Aryan, questions bubbling in his mind. Perhaps this man can answer for him the most central of them all: to punish or let go.\n\n"Heyl, Hyer Inspektur," the man said, "I am sorry for causing you concern, but I am fine."\n\n"No problem," the inspector said, "what is your name, brother?"\n\n"Villem, sir."\n\n"What happened back there, Villem? An accident?"\n\n"You could say that. Someone set off an old munitions cache. Six people are dead."\n\n"Any of them Aryan?" Villem shook his head. "Good, continue as you would, brother."

This was risky business; the Brotherhood's soldiers were renowned throughout the region for their sheer aggression and brutality, but their presence outside of Permhaym was limited enough that it was worth the risk. After all, that brutality only made the peasants more willing to purchase a means of self-defense.\n\nHe hummed a half-remembered folk song and drummed his fingers on the dashboard. Things could get dull on the road, with only the engine's growl keeping him company. His thoughts quickly drifted to other matters: the payment he'd get after completing this latest job and finding a mechanic out in the countryside, a difficult task. The truck was an old one, driven in rough conditions, and the engine had been making disquieting sounds for a while. Perhaps he needed to get it checked.\n\nThe sudden rip of a gunshot through the morning air interrupted his worries. Looking behind him, he could see who was responsible. A convoy of brand-new trucks roared behind him, eagles and swastikas painted on their sides, and their occupants, a rowdy band of "Aryan" raiders, fired rifles in the air with glee. He quickly pulled off the road as they sped by, either not noticing him or simply not caring. As he watched them thunder into the distance, two new thoughts entered his head. The first was that his customers would probably not survive the next few hours. The second was that he needed a career change."

In the last few days, the scouts of the Brotherhood had marked blind spots in the German bombing and indicated these in their maps as training spots. There, they would reveal and study the mysteries of war, to train themselves closer to the Viking ideal.\n\nVilem, a new initiate to the Brotherhood, stood at attention in the firing range, while a senior brother explained to them the uses and ways of the rifle. He put the stock against his shoulder and shot, hitting a target. He repeated this two more times, kneeling and prone. He reloaded it and instructed them on how to clear a jam in the firing mechanism.\n\n"And that is how you use a rifle," he said, "a weapon so simple that even you maggots can't fail at it." He walked up and down the line, abusing every member of the platoon. When it came to Vilem's turn, he said, "You fake Aryan! I bet that you will fall on your rifle and shoot yourself. But today, I am feeling optimistic." He laid his index finger on Vilem's chest, pressing it down to emphasize every word, "You will go into the firing range, and you will prove yourself worthy of bearing the blood, am I understood?" Vilem shouted, "Sir, yes, sir!" The brother gave him a slight smile."Good."\n\nAfter all this was done, the recruits took their turns in the firing range. Vilem proved himself to be a capable marksman, singled out by the brother as being the best in his platoon. At the day's end, the Brotherhood gave him the ultimate honor.

He drew his sidearm from his holster and disengaged its safety, pointing it at them.\n\nMikhail's life was not always like this. He still remembered when they came to take him. Writhing in pain and clutching his stomach, he remembered the day when they had come to take him. Gunfire, screaming, the village burned, and its older inhabitants put against the wall and shot. When he arrived at Permhaym, the Brotherhood greeted him and his fellow captives. They divided the group into two, one for labor, one for war. The Brotherhood shepherded the latter out from the city, plainly dressed, in the middle of the day, under watch from sharpshooters.\n\n"Stand up! How long will you lie there?" the Aryan screamed at him. Mikhail got up slowly."Good. Pick up that rifle, and try again." Turning towards the slaves, he said, "We have to teach you harshly, for you cannot understand." Mikhail shivered and held it straight, correctly this time, against his shoulder. The Aryan wheeled around to find the muzzle of the gun pointed at his forehead. He heard it click and smirked."We are not stupid, you Untermensh." He drew his baton and struck Mikhail across the sternum. He beat Mikhail savagely until he was black, blue, and bleeding.\n\nSidearm drawn once again, he cocked it.

They had been captured in a raid launched by these so-called "Aryans" against Gayny, and had only surrendered once the ammunition had run out. Evidently this had made an impression on the opposing commander, as instead of shooting them on the spot he had chosen to escort them back to the Brotherhood's territory.\n\nNow that very same commander stood before his assembled prisoners again, and began speaking.\n\n"It is lunchtime, as you may know, and within our barracks," he gestured toward the considerably more well-kept structure behind him, "we are serving hot food and water."\n\nIvan perked up upon hearing this. He and his unit hadn't had so much as a breadcrumb to eat ever since he had been captured, and his only hydration had come from a leak in the roof during the rains of the previous night. Indeed, one was even able to see the faint outlines of the rib cages of several of his comrades.\n\n"But good food," the officer continued, "is something that only the worthy are deserving of. In the fighting three days ago, you all showed that you had the potential for this worthiness, the potential of being Aryan. Potential alone, however, is not enough." At this he drew and presented his pistol, a shoddily-made copy of a German model. "My proposition is simple: Any of you who can use this implement to kill five of your fellows will have proven themselves Aryan enough to join us at the table immediately. Do not," he looked to the soldiers who stood at either side of him, "try anything funny."\n\nIvan considered the officer's words for a long while. After all, had not food and water been the reason he had joined the military of Gayny in the first place? Then his mind wandered to his comrades. The friendships he had developed, how they had fought side-by-side to the last round. No, he thought, shaking his head, he wouldn't do it. At first it seemed as if his friends were of a similar mind, but after a moment had passed, one stepped forward, and took the pistol."

Where would he go? He had no idea where his village was, or even if it still existed, and what if the ones who considered him less than human caught wind of it? The fate of the last one who had openly voiced disobedience sent a chill down his spine. He had concluded that his only hope would be to surrender at the first chance he got, but even that seemed a remote possibility. For all he knew they would just shoot him on sight, or even worse, he would be immediately recaptured. He doubted whether he had even the ability to throw down his gun, given how thoroughly the idea that it should never leave his hands had been beaten into him.\n\nAnd so he marched onwards, doing whatever his masters told him.

 PRM_expansion.3.t: "로마노프 가의 끝"
 PRM_expansion.3.desc: "For the second time this century the enemies of the Romanovs, the last true monarchs of Europe, have scattered the dynasty to the winds. While their first collapse was inevitable, for a time it appeared the anarchy that followed the West Russian War might give them a chance to reclaim their birthright. Under Vladimir Kirillovich's guidance they claimed part of their homeland for themselves and prepared to reunite the lands of Russia under the divine rule of the Tsar. But it was not meant to be.\n\nThe Monarchists and White Russian officers serving under the new Tsar had spent years preparing themselves for a second confrontation with the Communists to their north - a rematch between Royalty and Bolshevism that would decide the fate of Russia once and for all. None of them could have guessed their defeat would come from the south, not the north, at the hands of a far viler enemy than the Communists.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood had resolved to do what the cowardly, weak Soviets could not, and finish off the filthy Slavic monarchy that had returned to deny the Aryans their own birthright. The two sides clashed in a vicious struggle, but in the end, it was the Brotherhood that was proven correct as their armies overran the Tsarist untermenschen and rampaged across the fields of central Russia.\n\nNow memories of the brief Romanov revival are already fading. The Brotherhood's victory reduced what might have been the rebirth of a great empire to a historical footnote. In place of the failed dynasty, a new master of the east is rising, not defined by faith and tradition, but by race and violence. Aryan soldiers have burned and defaced the imperial portraits. They have melted the crown jewels down for their gold. In place of the old flag of the empire, the swastika now flies over Vyatka."

 PRM_expansion.4.t: "The Final Subjugation"
 PRM_expansion.4.desc: "For centuries the Slav and the Tatar have battled for control of Russia. The Slavs rose up countless times to drive the Tatars back east, only for the Tatars to return. This cycle of warfare on the steppe has gone on longer than recorded history, and it seemed destined to continue even into the twentieth century. After centuries of Slavic oppression, the Tatars took their fate by the reigns as the West Russian Revolutionary Front shattered against the might of the Germans. They seized their territory and built a new nation for the Tatar race where they could rule themselves. The Tatars knew from experience that the Slavs would not abide their freedom for long, so they prepared for the next violent chapter in the long history their peoples shared.\n\nHad it been the Slavs that invaded, it is likely the cycle of war between the two subhuman races would have continued indefinitely as it always had. But for the Aryan people to prosper, order had to be brought to the east, and the cycle of violence had to be ended. The Tatars met the soldiers of the Brotherhood with a fierce, barbaric resistance that surprised our Commanders in its intensity. The Tatar soldiers reminded us that the sub-human's inferiority does not make them any less dangerous. Despite this ferocious struggle, our race's supremacy was clear as they were driven back. Even their desperate attempt to ally with their ancient enemy, the Slavic peoples they now ruled, could not halt our attack.\n\nNow we have relegated the Tatar and the Slav alike to their natural status as slave races. We have put an end to their bickering by stripping both peoples of their delusions of freedom or independence. Both are Untermensh, both serve the master race. Any distinction between the two bloodlines is insignificant, and under our rule their fighting has finally ended."

 PRM_expansion.5.desc: "Standing in the bombed-out shell of a church, Hans found himself in an unusually philosophical mood. In his hands he held an old Bible he had been flipping through while Gunter and Yohan searched the ruin for any valuables. He had opened it to a random page and found a passage that stood out to him.\n\n"For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth."\n- Deuteronomy 7:6\n\nThe passage left him conflicted. His parents raised him as a Christian. Of course, they also raised him as a degenerate Slav, so that wasn't saying much. The Brotherhood was not explicitly anti-Christian so much as against non-Aryan beliefs. The recent war to crush the Order had certainly exemplified the way that policy could lead to highly anti-Christain behavior. Hell, Hans had participated in his fair share of sacrilege both during and after the fighting. But this passage had him questioning that. Maybe Christianity and the Brotherhood's beliefs were not so different? Maybe the Aryans were God's favored people, a noble race of holy warriors He had sent to reclaim the world and destroy the false prophets who claimed to represent Him? Maybe-\n\n"Hey bookworm! Quit reading and give us a fucking hand for once!"\n\nHans looked up and saw Gunter and Yohan trying to pull a large chest from where it was wedged under the rubble.

 PRM_expansion.6.desc: "It was only a few months ago that Fyodor had considered himself lucky to live in Vologda. In the chaotic sea of western Russia, the neutral state had been an island of stability and prosperity. The only threat had been the German bombing runs, and even those had come to an end. His life was not prosperous, but it was peaceful, and as Fyodor's mother had taught him it is better to appreciate what you have than to obsess over what you lack. With this lesson in mind, he went through life quite content.\n\nUntil the Aryans arrived.\n\nEven under a declared state of neutrality, Vologda was not immune to the skirmishing and raiding that defined West Russian warfare, but it was usually confined to the border regions. That changed one day when the army placed Vologda under martial law without warning. Soon reports of an invasion filtered in, along with stories of horrific fighting occurring closer and closer to the city. Fyodor recalled the night a low thumping noise awoke him, and only later had he realized it was the sound of artillery in the distance. A few days after that he was in his apartment when a shell struck the building across the street. The army attempted a futile last stand within the city proper, but they were swept aside and Fyodor got his first look at the invaders.\n\nThey wore uniforms of black and grey, wearing coal-scuttle helmets. They moved through the city like a devouring swarm, smashing windows and looting as they saw fit. Most terrifying of all, they flew a flag bearing a symbol Fyodor hadn't seen since his youth, the symbol of the Germans.\n\nA few days after Vologda fell Fyodor ventured out into the streets looking for food. A patrol of the invaders spotted him and dragged kicking and screaming into the back of a truck. It had taken him to the prison camp where he was now. The other prisoners told him that they killed most of the young men they found. They only kept the ones they thought might be recruited."

 PRM_expansion.7.desc: "If any state represents the failings of democracy, it was Komi. The dozens of flailing political movements and parties that once dominated the city each fought for their own agendas more than for the people they hoped to rule. Is it any surprise that even in the face of our invasion they failed to unify? While the pathetic politicians squabbled and bickered over the minute differences between their false ideologies, they forgot the reality of their situation: They were at war. Bullets do not care about ideology, a lesson they learned too late as our armies bore down on them, bringing the full might of the Master Race with them. Through violence and bloodshed, we have shown them that politics and parties are no more than glorified clubs, their members playing at rulership while the true masters of the earth know only one thing matters: power. Our race has the power to conquer, so their race will suffer what it must.\n\nThe gutters of Komi have been filled with the blood of politicians and party members of every variety. Communists and socialists, liberals and conservatives. The Brotherhood is even liquidating fascists of subhuman blood as we secure control. Their beliefs are unimportant to us. All politicians are inherently weak, compromising creatures trying to cheat their way into power. The Brotherhood has no place for them. In death their ideological differences are meaningless and they are exposed for what they really are. Pests, that the Brotherhood has exterminated. We have taught the people of Komi a lesson that all Aryans have known for years, that democracy breeds degeneracy and corruption that can bring low even the greatest of peoples. It is no wonder that a race as pitiful as the Slavs could not resist its effects. The Brotherhood has cleansed this stain from Russia, and the arguing politicians have finally been silenced."

 PRM_expansion.8.desc: "As he sat in a prison camp outside Samara, Jakob Becker thought back to the day he knew his life was over. It had been four months ago, the day his unit received their new orders. They were being sent across the border of the Reich, to help train the soldiers of some warlord in Samara the Wehrmacht was propping up. Many of the soldiers, Jakob among them, felt a sense of impending doom at the news. Somehow, he knew he would never see Cologne again, never make the triumphant return home he had dreamed of making. His fears had proven correct when the warlord statelet was attacked by some other bandit horde. The armies of Samara went to battle, and Jakob and his fellow "advisors'' went with them. Their presence made no difference. These invaders that flew the swastika for some incomprehensible reason had crushed the well-equipped but poorly led soldiers of Samara and within a few weeks of the conflict's start Jakob had been captured and taken to the prison where he currently wallowed.\n\nHe was snapped out of his self-pity when he noticed a prison guard approaching, followed by a man dressed in an ill-fitting Wehrmacht officer's uniform from the last war. The guard pointed at him and the "officer" stepped forward.\n\n"Are you a German?" he asked in halting, heavily accented German.\n\nJakob hesitated before answering. "Yes. Why?"\n\nThe officer's face broke out in a huge grin. "Oh, that is great! Please follow me. I am so sorry about the confusion. I want you to know we would never keep an Aryan imprisoned intentionally, especially with the Untermensch!"\n\n"Where are we going?" Jakob asked in confusion.\n\n"To my quarters! I'll give you a chance to clean up and eat a proper meal first. After that I want to introduce you to all the other Brotherhood members here. None of us have ever met a German before!""

 PRM_expansion.9.desc: "Some of our commanders hoped that entering the driver's seat of an armored fighting vehicle would awaken something in the Aryan bloodline, a latent talent for motorized warfare that resides in all Ubermensh. Unfortunately, this does not seem to have occurred. Several vehicles stalled out or broke down shortly after our test crews finally got them to start. One driver even managed to get his reclaimed Pantser to start, but proving unable to work the steering or the brakes, crashed through a building before driving into a ditch. It seems that even the German soldiers must learn their mastery of Blitzkrieg, not just inherit it. This has been a source of great frustration and disappointment for both the Brotherhood's military commanders and most trusted racial scientists.\n\nLuckily, some Pantser operators from the ranks of the motor bandits have proven to be of superior blood and are more than willing to train their fellow Aryans in return for expedited admittance into the Brotherhood. Some members of the Brotherhood have protested this, claiming that these men have not purged their Slavic corruption as every Aryan must do. What these fools do not recognize is that by mastering Germanic warfare, these men were already close to pure Aryan status before the Brotherhood even liberated them. Already this decision has borne fruit. Every day more Aryans are being re-trained in the art of Blitzkrieg. Every day more Pantsers roll out of the factories, ready to carry brave warriors of the master race into battle against the unclean hordes.\n\nOur commanders have been eager to adopt the Pantsers into their strategies. They have modified their once infantry-focused doctrines to accommodate quicker, more powerful strikes concentrated on small points of the enemy line. Soon the Brotherhood's armies will be so magnificent that even the Germans shall admire the military prowess of our race!"

Each pump of his heart was a bludgeon, beating suffocation into the very fiber of his being. After minutes of paralysis, Alexi finally stirred. His feeble legs found themselves wobbling. He lurched to an infirm posture, suspended over a railing for support.\n\nSomeone shouted, "Comrade Novikov! Push the motherfucking button!" Fighting the overwhelming pain in his chest, Alexi leaned sloppily towards the console to his right, mustering what little remained inside to raise the ship's anchors.\n\n"I have done it!" he shouted as tears welled in his eyes. A sudden explosion followed his exclamation, finishing his descent towards the cold steel floor. A panic attack, then unconsciousness.\n\nA gunshot woke him up, but a severe concussion prevented full awareness. Alexi's fluttering eyes could see the black uniformed men approaching, and on some subconscious level he understood. With little time remaining, memories flooded his mind. A serene picture book to quench his anxiety.\n\nHe thought first of his mother. Her sandy blonde hair and soothing tone comforting him in the candle-light of their Moscow apartment. He tried to savour the moment, remember the boyhood stories she had told him of Lenin and the revolution. However, the historical details evaded him, far less potent than the woman herself.\n\nThe men grew closer in his peripheral vision, punctuating their summary executions of his comrades with disgusting jeers of "untermensh". They would not destroy his newfound serenity. He thought next of those early days in Plesetsk. Sleeping next to his bunkmates, both nervous and excited to serve. Like the stories of old, before his family had fled, he would too serve the people. A sense of purpose in the chaos.\n\nThe pistol swung before his eyes, and they finally closed for the last time.

Vagner snarled as he almost tore the package out of the postman's hands. He slammed the door to his office shut, sealing himself from the outside world. His generals and councilors with their incessant updates and questions would have to wait. He had been patient for weeks and now his commission was finally here. He removed the cap from the tube and pulled out the rolled-up paper it contained. He hurried over to his table and unfurled it to take in its full magnificence.\n\n"Well that is beautiful." he muttered under his breath.\n\nHe was looking down at a newly commissioned map of the Aryan Brotherhood's realm. The cartographers had delivered a beautiful piece of work. He'd made it clear they would have to. He struggled to believe that the massive territory that stretched from Erzengel to Kazakhstan had started from almost nothing, just a tiny scrap of land around the bombed-out ruins of Perm. Of course, his race's superiority had meant this conquest was inevitable, but gazing down at the map, seeing the Brotherhood standing proud next to Germany and her colonies, it made him realize the huge odds he had triumphed against to build a pure nation in such a chaotic and impure land. He couldn't help but smile. Somehow, he was sure the great Fyurer was looking down on him with pride.\n\nHe glanced to the eastern side of the map, past the Urals. There were no nations shown there, just a black area labeled "Die Slawische Anarchie." There was still work to be done. Russia was not yet cleansed or safe for his people. But the Brotherhood had proven the Aryan race is unstoppable, and they would not rest as long as there was a single subhuman staining the land of old Russia."

 PRM_regional.2.t: "The Devil's in the Details"
 PRM_regional.2.desc: ""For the last fucking time I don't give a shit about hair color. I have dark hair and I'm more Aryan than any of you snakes."\n\n"But I heard the Germans believe you aren't a real Aryan unless you're blonde!"\n\n"Are you seriously suggesting the Germans are that stupid? Because that's borderline treason if you are. I have half a mind to execute you right now if you don't shut up."\n\nThis sort of arguing has become common among the Brotherhood's leadership in recent days. With western Russia finally united under Aryan leadership, the time has come to answer several unsettled questions about the Brotherhood's laws. The most important and most divisive of these issues is the official racial policy of the brotherhood. Behind the simple goal of establishing Aryan supremacy lurks a complex web of intricacies that have divided the Brotherhood into competing factions. It seems every officer has their own answer for how the Brotherhood should formally define and divide the races, and any plan other than their own is a betrayal of Aryanism and a Slavic plot. Screaming matches and even brawls have occurred over everything from the legal status of half-Aryans to the different shapes of untermensch skulls. Fyurer Vagner has become increasingly agitated as he has watched this infighting bring the Brotherhood to a grinding halt. To finally resolve the issue, he has announced he will form a council that will formally define the racial castes of Russia. The Fyurer will head this council himself but it will include several other important figures in the Brotherhood, most notably Zigfrid Shultz. Shultz has become the leader of a faction advocating for an expanded definition of Aryanism that he claims would act as a safeguard against instability and provide a necessary boost to Brotherhood membership. The Fyurer is personally repulsed by his ideas but his supporters are too significant to ignore any longer. When the council assembles in a few weeks' time every faction will have a chance to make their case."

 PRM_regional.3.t: "A Rational Debate"
 PRM_regional.3.desc: ""... and lastly, I don't know if you and your thugs are Slavs, traitors, or just cowards!" Vagner roared at the man across the table "But I know you are weaklings and you want to see the Aryan race weakened with you!"\n\nShultz stared back at him. He had hardly spoken all night but somehow that silence was louder than all the Fyurer's shouting. Vagner paused his tirade to catch his breath and Shultz seized the opportunity.\n\n"My Fyurer, I am no coward. I am a proud servant of the Brotherhood, but before all else I serve the Aryan race, and the Brotherhood is failing them. Right now, there are millions of Aryans in Russia who would make exemplary members of the Brotherhood. But they are enslaved. You have labeled them untermensch because they fail to meet some arbitrary standards you set years ago. It shows strength and wisdom to admit you were mistaken, and yet you refuse to. If there is a coward in this room, it is you."\n\nFor the first time that evening Vagner was speechless. He had entered the room confident of his victory. He had expected the council to be a mere formality, a chance to berate his advisors for their squabbling before they all fell in line. Instead he had watched the tide turn against him. The more Shultz spoke, the more the men seated at the table seemed intrigued by his promises of an Aryan majority within a generation and an end to the slave unrest. Even some of Vagner's closest allies were struggling to hide the doubt on their faces. And now this upstart had the balls to call his own Fyurer a coward!\n\nVagner could see that he still held some support in the room. If he acted now, before Shultz could tip the scales any further, he might still prevail. "I'd recommend you be more careful who you call a coward" he said. "I don't care how many of the boys like you, I won't tolerate another slip-up." He turned to address the rest of the councilors. "Now I say we settle this the only way that seems fair. A vote.""

They remained unfazed by the insults and curses he hurled at them and forced him into a chair facing the long table where Vagner and the other members of the Brotherhood's leadership sat. There was a moment of silence as Shultz tried to recover his breath. He locked eyes with Vagner and tried to lunge at him with his shackled hands, only for the guards to wrestle him back into the chair.\n\n"ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?" He shouted. "You won't get away with this! The people won't let you. They'll shoot you down in the streets like the Zionist rats you are. You're all fucked without me! Do you understand that?"\n\nShultz flailed wildly in his chair looking around the room. Most members of the tribunal looked away as soon as he turned towards them, desperately avoiding making eye contact. The Fyurer smirked and leaned forward, reading off a piece of paper he held.\n\n"Zigfrid Shultz, you are accused of betrayal of the Aryan race, of seeking to corrupt the blood of our people and empower the Untermensh. You are also accused of trying to promote the cause of the ancient enemy, the Slav, and of spreading pro-Slavic propaganda. Lastly you are accused of slander against the German people and attempting to divide the Aryan peoples. How does this tribunal vote?"\n\nThere were awkward murmurs of "guilty" from the other men seated at the table. Vagner smiled. "Guilty. The vote is unanimous. Zigfrid Shultz, this tribunal has found you guilty of the crimes I have read to you. As punishment for betrayal of the Brotherhood and the race I sentence you to death." He turned to one of the guards holding Shultz in the chair. "Do it."\n\nThe guard drew his pistol from its holster and before Shultz had a chance to protest he shot him in the back of the head. The other members of the Brotherhood recoiled as Shultz's body slumped to the floor but Vagner walked towards it and gave it a playful kick.\n\n"Leave him in the woods, traitors like him don't deserve a burial.""

 PRM_regional.5.desc: "Gutrum Vagner hunched over his desk, reading a memo without understanding it. His mind was elsewhere. His control over the Brotherhood was slipping away. Every day it seemed like his title of Fyurer was more and more ceremonial, while Shultz and his gang were giving the orders. Something had to be done. He could not allow them to destroy the Aryan race, not when it was so close to victory.\n\nHe heard the door to his office open and he looked up, startled. He had ordered his guards not to let anyone interrupt him. Standing in the doorway was Shultz, staring at him.\n\n"Zigfrid, what are you doing? I'm not taking appointments now. Go find my secretary if you want to meet."\n\nShultz walked towards him, his hands clutched behind his back, not speaking a word. He wasn't even looking at Vagner. He was surveying the office.\n\n"I don't know what the fuck you think you're doing but I am out of patience with you. You have 5 seconds to get out of my sight before my guards come in and teach you not to interrupt me again."\n\nShultz met his gaze, and Vagner noticed something had changed. The calm arrogant attitude he usually had was gone. His eyes were wide and there was sweat on his forehead. He began walking towards the desk. Vagner pressed the button underneath his desk that would call his guards into the room.\n\n"We have let your tyranny continue for too long, Gutrum." Shultz finally spoke in a hoarse whisper as he rounded the desk. "You have butchered and enslaved the true Aryans and worshipped the Jewish puppets in Germany. It cannot go on! The race must survive."\n\nVagner slammed the button again and again but no one came. He started to open the drawer where he kept his pistol but it was too late. Shultz pulled a dagger from behind his back and plunged it into his neck. A stream of blood sprayed across the wall as Vagner fell to the floor. After a moment it was all over. Shultz wiped the blood from his face and turned towards the door. One of the guards was watching him. "Are you alright sir?" the man asked."

The rattle of dozens of hammers striking rocks over and over surrounded her. The women of the 89th Komi slave battalion had been out here since before dawn. The sun was now high overhead, beating down on them as they toiled away. Nadya was feeling faint. They had cut the morning meal last week, and it would be hours until it was time for the evening one. She hadn't had anything to drink since last night and it was getting harder and harder to focus on her task. Her mind kept slipping back to the time of the republic. It felt so long ago. Had she really been an organizer with the Communists? It was hard to imagine that there had ever been a version of her that was so outspoken. Surely someone like that could never wind up where she was, smashing rocks at gunpoint for genocidal madmen. Maybe it was all a fantasy, and she had always been the quiet, cowering creature she was now.\n\nA moment's distraction was all it took. The angle of her swing was slightly off and her hammer came down six inches away from the rock, directly on her left foot.\n\nNadya let out a howl of pain and fell to the ground, clutching her shattered foot. The slaves around her looked at her but only paused their work for a moment. They all knew the consequences of stopping.\n\nThe sound of approaching footsteps cut through the agony, and Nadya turned to see who it was. The chief guard was approaching, his rifle slung over his shoulder. He reached out his hand to her. Astonished, Nadya accepted it. He helped her up and put her arm over his shoulders. "What is your number?" he asked.\n\n"3842" she replied.\n\n"Well you won't be any use with that foot. Let's get you into the shade. Don't worry about working for the rest of the day."\n\nShe nodded, unable to believe her ears. The guard helped her into the shade of a tree and helped her lie down. The pain in her foot was now a dull throb, but Nadya paid it no mind. She had not seen mercy like that in a long time."

 PRM_regional.7.desc: "Hermann stood in the shade of the trees, watching the slaves hammer away at the rocks. It was astonishingly dull work. Being appointed a guard had technically been a promotion but he sometimes wondered if it was really a punishment. His old sergeant never liked him, and he would have been the one to recommend anyone in the squad for slave duty.\nOne of the slaves stopped for a moment and walked towards the pile of rocks. Hermann eyed her, wondering if she would try something. He halfway wished she would. It had been months since the last attempted escape and he'd gotten a chance to actually use his rifle. The slave grabbed a rock and carried it back to where she had been and started hammering away at it. Hermann grumbled under his breath "Bunch of fucking cowards." There was no question at all that if he were in their place he wouldn't just lie down like a weakling. He would use his hammer to bash the skull of the first guard he found and lead the other slaves in a revolt. How fun that would be! Of course, you couldn't expect that kind of genius from the real slaves. They were untermensch, after all. Their brains weren't developed enough to think freely.\nHermann was thinking this over when a cry cut through the sounds of the hammers falling. He turned to see the source, and saw a slave across the yard curled on the ground, bawling and clutching at her foot. He unslung his rifle and started to walk over to her when he saw sergeant Blumfeld was already on it. He watched his sergeant reach the slave and, to his astonishment, help her to her feet and guide her over to another tree. Hermann couldn't believe his eyes. Sergeant Blumfed was one of the proudest, most patriotic Aryans he had ever met, and here he was showing mercy to an untermensch! The sergeant set the slave down, then turned away from her and walked over to Hermann. "Private Stahlman," he said. "Could you take a note for me?"\nHermann pulled a notepad and a pencil from his bag. "Certainly, sir."\n"That creature's number is 3842. Remind me to have her shot in front of the other slaves when we got back to camp tonight. They must learn I will not tolerate slothfulness.""

 PRM_regional.9.desc: "Pytor had passed every trial thrown at him. He'd hiked naked through a blizzard. He'd been beaten for an hour without crying out. On the first day of his training there had been over a thousand men standing with him. Now there were less than four hundred. Pytor was still standing, but there were more trials ahead. One day the instructors broke them into groups of 25. Pytor's group was led to a concrete shed and ordered inside. The interior was a bare windowless room with a dirt floor. Once everyone was inside the instructor told them their trial was to stand silently until ordered otherwise. He locked the door and left Pytor and his comrades standing in the dark.\n\nThe first day wasn't difficult. Pytor's eyes adjusted to the darkness. His legs grew stiff but he avoided cramps by shifting his weight. His stomach started to rumble in the evening but he was no stranger to hunger. The most difficult part was staying awake. One of the men fell asleep and toppled to the floor. Almost immediately the instructors opened the door and dragged him out of the room before relocking it. He didn't even protest as they carried him away.\n\nOn the morning of the second day one of the instructors opened the door and asked if anyone wanted to forfeit. No one stepped forward. The instructor nodded and locked the door. Midday was when the hunger really set in. Pytor could feel his stomach protesting, demanding something, to fill it. He tried to focus on the rewards that awaited him when he passed this trial, the privilege and prestige of being a part of the army. He had wanted that for so long and now he was close. His stomach was getting louder.\n\nOn the morning of the third day the door opened again and two men crept out. The survivors were ordered to insult them and for the first time in 60 hours Pytor heard his own voice as he hurled verbal attacks at the cowards. The third night would be his breaking point. After three days without food or sleep, three days of licking condensation off the walls for water, he snapped. He started to sob. It seemed like the only sensible thing left to do. The door opened and two instructors came in and pulled him out of the dark room. Pytor couldn't care less about the mockery from the men still inside. He looked up above him and saw the stars shining in the night."

Igor was one such scholar. Long called a madman for his theories about the Russian people and their genesis, his work had found new life under Velimir's new regime. Now with proper funding, Igor was finally able to do the work he always wanted: to unlock the secrets of Russia's true ancestors: the ancient Hyperboreans.\n\nToday, Igor had stayed up late reading a tome containing particularly fantastical accounts of the ancient super-race which he believed all Slavs, and therefore the Aryans, descended from. In the book, which was barely holding together from decades of wear and tear, the Hyperboreans are described as a highly sophisticated race that once dominated the entire planet, and were potentially extraterrestrial in origin. Igor found himself completely flabbergasted by this claim. Could it be that more Aryans existed beyond the very stars in the sky? The hours went by, and the night dragged on, but Igor was still intensely captivated by the book. The wild theories, the mythical origins, the innate superiority! Even an old fool like Igor couldn't help having his mind race thinking about all the wonderful possibilities this book had implied about the Aryan people.\n\nWhen the sun rose that morning, Igor had achieved little sleep, but had gained nearly more esoteric knowledge than his mind could handle. With his vast notes in hand, Igor excitedly reached for the phone on his table, eager to share his newly-found wisdom with his superiors in the Brotherhood..."

In front of the Fyurer was his propaganda minister, who eagerly awaited his leader's input.\n\n"Fantastic. Simply fantastic", a grinning Fyurer Vagner said, his focus still on the leaflets he was rifling through. "These papers are to carry our message across the world. I want them in every town, on every street our neighbors have. They will know, one way or the other, that their future is Aryan." The pleased propaganda minister standing before Vagner took a bow. "You honor me, meyn Fyurer. It shall be my great honor to help spread your word."\n\nLater that day, the propaganda machine of the Reykh was officially kicked into high gear. The very leaflets that had earlier graced the desk of the Fyurer were loaded by the millions into trucks and planes, and began their journeys into the lands of the Rekyh's neighbors.

The leaflets claim that all of the "Aryans" of Russia who find themselves oppressed can rest easy, for the "Reykh" will soon come to their aid to free them from their predicament. On the other hand, the leaflets denounce those who would consider themselves "allies of the Jew", and state that all "sub-humans" of Russia will soon be "shown their proper place as subordinate to their betters". Accompanying the text is a heroic depiction of a soldier in a German uniform, clearly inspired by Nazi iconography.\n\nIt is not hard to figure out where this propaganda is coming from. The Aryan Brotherhood, the strange Germanophiles who border our nation, have long been both a curiosity and an annoyance. This propaganda clearly implies that they intend to expand their influence across Russia through hostile means, and tension in the region may be on the rise very soon.

Furthermore, they assure us that Russia will trouble us no more, and that their "Reykh" will dutifully see to it that the entire country and its culture is squashed under an Aryan boot by "finishing what you, our German brethren, had started".\n\nThe Foreign Ministry was utterly baffled and completely unsure of what to make of these messages.

The Brotherhood states that they would be honored to have their presence at the congress, where they intend to discuss the future of the Aryan race and its place in the modern world. Similar invitations have also gone out to the Reichskommisariats, and we have already received messages from them asking for guidance on how to respond.

Fyurer Vagner had been ranting like this for what seemed like hours, while Shvartz had been deathly silent. The young Fyurer suddenly stopped in his tracks, and turned to Shvartz. "You! It was YOUR responsibility to ensure our messages reached the Germans. What if they never even reached them?! Explain yourself, fool, before I begin to question the purity of your blood!" Shvartz went completely pale.\n\n"Meyn Fyurer, I assure you I made every effort in my power to ensure those invitations reached their destination! Please, I beg of you, I would never dream of endangering my beloved Reykh with such an incompetent mistake!" The minister was practically begging for his life at this point. Vagner's demeanor softened, and the Fyurer sighed as he took a seat at his desk. Shvartz let out a small breath of cautious relief, and used this opportunity to get back in his Fyurer's good graces. "Perhaps, meyn Fyurer, you still have not proven yourself as a worthy Aryan in their eyes?"\n\n"That's preposterous. I've done more than enough to demonstrate the strength of my blood.

The chanting grew louder until the Brotherhood itself joined in, singing of ancient glories and the wrath of Belobog, who shall soon descend to the Earth and cleanse it of degeneracy.\n\nAn hour later, the choir had ceased and the last of the worshippers left the room. Velimir then spoke: "Brothers, I am honored to accept the position of High Priest of Hyperborea and all Rus. Destiny lies before us, woven by the norns of yesteryear, whose moving voices shape history. They have visited me in my sleep and claimed that we are the heirs of the Aryan race. Our future is to the East and West, to reclaim the rest of Russia from the heathen, to liberate the West from the degenerates who styles themselves superior." The Brotherhood nodded in approval, dark figures applauding the High Priest, their hearts trembling as they sensed what they were destined to accomplish.\n\n"But Hyperborea is just the beginning. Perun wants us to fly Southward, towards old Palestine, ruined by the Jews. We must not hesitate in our push into Asia, where the ancient lands are being settled by Eastern filth. And of course, the North awaits once we are finished, for us to ascend to Asgard and take our place alongside Belobog.""

Velimir turned from the mangled corpse and walked over to the balcony's edge, observing his empire, Hyperborea. Dozens of feet below, pious laborers toiled away, their struggle so that by the final day the flag of the new Russia would fly over Germania. Velimir gazed at the stars, Like angels, they observe us. Civilizations rise and fall, but they remember old Hyperborea. May Belobog illuminate the righteous path.\n\n"They are here, my lord." Velimir turned to the door, and guards brought forth eight prisoners. Velimir recognized them: former Brotherhood members, petty generals, traitors.\n\nHe pointed to the body lying next to him: "Heathen, do you know who that was?" he addressed one of the captives.\n\n"N-no, your holiness. I h-haven't seen that m-man in my life!" he stuttered, a pathetic husk of a man, once proudly an Aryan, now playing the fool.\n\nVelimir shook his head in disapproval: "You lie, disciple of Moses." They fear me more than death. A deserving fate for those who would undermine Hyperborea. "This man was caught yesterday, trying to cross the border into Moskowien. Identification revealed him to have been a former agent of Vagner's, set to venture into the forsaken land of Germania and weave lies about my just rule." The prisoners exchanged worried glances. "After being subjected to Svarog's flame, he confessed to being deployed on this task on the orders of fellow brothers."\n\nSome prisoners begged for forgiveness; one pleaded for a fair trial. "And a fair trial you shall have!" answered Velimir, as he brought Perun's hammer down upon the head of the traitor. The prisoners scrambled, only to be caught and held by the guards. "Germania is full of degeneracy - there are none worse than those who pretend to be Aryan!" proclaimed Velimir. "All who associate with the West are traitors, Jewish plotters, heretics and will be treated as such!""

The natives of Russia plot in the darkness, in coalition with the Jewish and Masonic conspiracies, to overthrow the blessed empire we have revived from the dust of history. For the sake of our Aryan descendants, all laws pertaining to the protection of Slavs, Jews, and any other impure race are void and null.

The Aryan mindset is still dormant within much of the Brotherhood, but the High Priest believes that practicing social responsibility will awaken it...\n\n...All indigenous units in the military are immediately to be subjected to corporal punishment for failing to meet Aryan standards of proper devotion. Punishment shall include lashing, attacks by dogs, and decimation. Punishment will be deemed sufficient only when the unit confesses to any and all crimes and pledges their undying support to the Aryan race after said decimation...\n\n...To reinforce inferior mentality, all native populations are to be accounted for, and abled bodied males pressed into service and immediately subjected to above purification..."

He fell upon frozen grass, and he saw a group of officers unloading other 'cadets' from trucks. His arms scrambled until they caught something furry - he twisted, a whimper, a thud. The hounds backed off. Alex stood up only to be knocked out by a crowbar. His last vision was that of a rabid soldier standing over dead meat.\n\nAlex was awoken by the firing squad. He grabbed his head, memory betrayed him - flashes, he remembered a village, a patrol car, a shovel... The barrack door opened, in came the priest. Alex stood at attention, but his spirit was dying. Before he knew it, he was dragged off to the center of camp, alongside a thousand other degenerates. A man pointed a gun at Alex and ordered him to run ten miles on the track, lest he go to Niefelheim. He struggled and heaved, encouraged only by cracks and thuds, unworthy cadets purified by lead. Alex looked at the barracks in the distance, for a moment he thought a woman stood there, begging him to defend home.\n\nAlex cried, but the days came and went with no relief. A thousand slavs became a hundred walking dead, and they envied failures. Every morning before the barn's feeding, an officer would read them charges: "Failure to pray, to achieve Aryan devotion, to appreciate the High Priest's justice..." Alex had gotten used to the beatings too, thirty lashes for dissidents, a thousand for 'conspirators'. The last trial arrived, but Alex didn't know how much time had passed since he was brought here; his mind was occupied by faint memories of defending those he couldn't remember. He was told to run across twenty feet of burning coals, the final task to be considered worthy of serving in Aryan infantry. He witnessed many men fall, scream, burn, and die. On his turn, he flew. Even thunder in the distance could not silence the priest, an unending lecture of defending the Aryan race. As Alex passed the test, he could only hear the shouting of the priest, of race, until past and present became one, until his body could last no more, until he smiled and remembered:"

Their lies spread like wildfire, coming from secular texts that attempt to hide under the guise of progress. All law enforcement units, in addition to local military elements, are to conduct staged and precise raids against ALL holdings in their designated region (see attachment).

A massive map of the Afro-Eurasian continent, titled 'Greater Hyperborea', decorated the wall. The High Priest drew a long stick and traced a path from Africa to India, Europe, and Russia: "We Aryans are the product of eons - we have existed since time immemorial, before Abraham walked the Earth. When Moses split open the sea and saved his vile race, we were forging civilizations in the North. When the Church of Rome first breathed heresy, we were there in the shadows. And when the hordes of Islam marched across the dunes, we feasted in Asgard with our forefathers."\n\nThere was pause as the Brothers clapped in agreement, until Yemelyanov raised his voice: "But we never forgot the ancestral land! What they call 'Levant', 'Jerusalem', we have always known as the birthplace of Aryanism! It is our legacy, the norns tell me, to reclaim it! Even if we must incite nuclear war, threaten the degenerate Germans and cowardly Italians, pass through the smoldering ruins of Kaukasia and the mountains of Turkey - we will reclaim the Holy Land!"

He praised the innovations of a military doctrine which would put the German blitzkrieg to shame, a testament to the might and speed of Asgardian craftsmanship. He sang the song of yore, rhetoric of national reclamation and racial purification of the Levant, evicting Italians and all conspirator races. When the generals told him of their plans, he listened. And when one officer claimed the task to be impossible, his brains decorated the rugs.\n\nSo the High Priest wove tales of conquest as he planned to slaughter Germany and plant the banner of Hyperborea over its corpse. The Palestina would follow. Be it through nuclear war or the end of ages, the Aryan race shall return and purify its land."

He gunned down the rest of the unit from the cover of bushes, but never shed a tear.\n\nLeon killed his father at the age of sixteen, when the old man tried to take his prized luger away - the fatal shot was heard by none. From then on, Leon wandered the Earth as a soldier without borders, seeking fame in hamlets, stealing food and women and ammunition and all the treasures a warlord desires.\n\nOne day, Leon heard of a trial to purify himself. So he strolled over to the new authorities, whose hands he shook, whose tasks he passed with 'Aryan accuracy'. So Leon became Leon the Slayer, and he led many raids on the enemy, so that by the age of eighteen he was a famed warrior in Samara. He wielded a battleaxe gifted to him by a priest of Perun, which he used to decapitate degenerates.\n\nWhen the High Priest spoke of Hyperborea, Leon looked back at the past and decided that he was of divine descent - how else to explain his success?

Velimir's people were still pretty awful, but at least Ivan was human in their eyes.\n\nApparently, the High Priest was leading the festivities himself this year, and he clearly had changes in store for the winter holiday. High Priest Velimir led a procession of masked and costumed priests, chanting jingoistic hymns as a procession of quite-uncomfortable citizens trailed behind them. He led Ivan and the rest of the procession to a large effigy, but not an effigy of the eponymous hag. It was instead an effigy of King Solomon, the Jewish king of Biblical legend. Velimir and the other priests now stood upon a large podium, and the High Priest addressed the crowd. As the effigy burned behind him, he spoke of the restoration of "Ancient Slavic Aryan traditions," and that the burning of the Jewish effigies would celebrate the eventual reclamation of the Holy Land by the Slavic people. The Holy Land? What was he talking about? The Slavs were from Moscow and Kiev, not Jerusalem and Bethlehem!\n\nWith his speech concluded, and several screaming goats and lambs now sacrificed to the "true gods of the Slavic Aryan civilization," the priests began dancing around the burning effigy, singing those same, awful hymns again. Ivan watched in horror as these madmen twisted this wonderful tradition of Ivan's youth in the name of their gods. Where was the music? The joy?

In their place rose monuments to gods of old; in the walls were etched swastikas, and at the altar stood a monument to Perun, the Lord of Thunder himself. The Zionist den of lies was no more; this was now a house for the Aryan.\n\nOr so they told Leonid, an attendant to this small church. Ever since he was a child he had come to this church every Sunday, in the darkest of times and the brightest of days. When Russia consumed itself, he prayed to Christ for his most distant of kin to be safe. When the Aryans thundered into his town and slaughtered all those who refused to kneel, he prayed for God to guide these martyrs to Heaven.\n\nThen they told Leonid that if he did not bend to the will of Perun, his blood would stain the very church he spent so many years in. In a moment of weakness, he agreed. The grief of betrayal ate at him. He felt he had turned his back to the true savior of mankind. Judas possessed his soul to serve the devil and his minions.\n\nBut even then, with that pain born deep in his heart, the light of the true god shined bright. The god of Moses, the god of the Jews. Leonid was now like the first Christians in Rome, forced to conceal their beliefs, but still faithful deep down. And even as the pagans assembled his church's altar for another blood sacrifice of his neighbors, even as the knife dug into their chest as they screamed, he prayed.\n\n"Lord of Lightning, take this offering as our gift to you," the priest began, and the others repeated. But Leonid prayed to another.\n\nLord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on them, the sinners. Give unto them what they could not give to others.\n\nAnd into the night, over a humble house of worship, a thunderstorm approached."

His parents explained to the scary priest man that Alexei was sick and needed healing badly, and the scary man nodded and started doing one of his scary rituals. He took a bowl of blood, dipped his right hand in it, and reached out to touch Alexei's face. Alexei wanted to run away, but his parents had him trapped as the priest man painted Alexei's face in the icky blood. After saying some prayers Alexei didn't really understand, he declared that Alexei was healed, but Alexei didn't feel any better.\n\n"That didn't work! Mommy, Daddy, I want to see a real doctor!" Alexei protested in between coughing fits. The scary priest turned around, his weird smile replaced with something far angrier.\n\n"Now, now, young man, you don't want to see a doctor. They use modern medicine, which was invented by the Jews to weaken and poison Aryans. Your parents haven't been feeding you any of that Jewish filth, have they?" His parents shook their heads, and the priest's smile returned, and he seemed to relax. Alexei was allowed to wash his face off, and his parents took him home, where he returned to bed. Ivan had gotten the same thing last summer, and the doctors had made him all better, and yet the scary priest man didn't help at all!

However, things had quieted down as the relatively remote village had seen nothing of the mysterious nationalists. But as Marat poured his tea as he did every day, a deafening sound laid claim to the morning's silence.\n\nMotors roared through the village as the wheels of trucks dug into the dirt road leading through the hamlet. Stepping over to the window and parting his curtains, the old Tatar watched swastika emblazoned vehicles roll into town. The lead truck's door was thrown open and out of the passenger seat slid an officer who approached the first person he saw. The bearded captain pointed at a young woman watching intensely from her porch. She froze as the man began speaking to her, and though Marat could not hear their conversation, it still shook him to the bone. After a curt exchange, the woman nodded toward Marat's front door.\n\nA knock came soon after, and Marat reluctantly went to answer it. Pulling the creaky old thing open, he found himself standing face to face with the officer. With a gravelly voice, he began to speak before Marat could get a word out. "Are you in charge?"\n\n"Y-yes, what seems to be the issue?" Asked Marat.\n\n"On orders of Velimir, a natural preserve will be built nearby."\n\n"Oh, well, well that's lovely. What's this got to do with us?"\n\n"We'll need help from the locals."\n\n"Well, alright. Where is it to be built?"\n\n"Here." The old man froze as he noticed the officer had cocked his gun. After a split second of pregnant silence, a shot was placed directly between the Tatar's eyes. Marat was dead before his already cooling corpse struck the ground.

Through his teenage years, he only did acceptable in school work because that was what he was supposed to do as an Aryan. And, once he entered college, he joined the SS, because it was better than getting some nonsense job in Germania. And, when his squad, the Dirlewanger Brigade, charged into Russia after some failed uprising in the capital, Stefan followed them, because it was easier than doing something else.\n\nHe stole. He butchered. He even raped. And during it all, he felt nothing. An empty vessel, traveling through, wandering, always transient. Even when Dirlewanger himself died, and the brigade was no more, he followed some of his fellow bandits, only because it was easier than finding something new.\n\nNow, though, as he wandered through the towns of Russia, the place of the inferior Slavs, he was not only tolerated, but welcomed. The magistrates and authorities, more often than not, gave Stefan special privileges, including the raiding of so called 'inferior villages'. Stefan was confused, more often than not -- hadn't he been one of the men responsible for some of the most evil atrocities imaginable? Hadn't he been a monster?\n\nStill, Stefan did not question it, however, much like the rest of the former brigade. Perhaps, Stefan thought, in the innermost recesses of his mind, they were just as unwilling to think of anything differently."
 PRM_vagner.8.a: "An empty mind is easily filled with nonsense."
 
 PRM_vagner.9.t: "Same War, Different Day"
 PRM_vagner.9.desc: "Janis Mendriks wandered the broken down village, smog and soot falling as the few survivors tried to put out the fires on the church. Glass crunched under his feet as one of his men gave him an update to the situation.\n\n"These raiders, calling themselves the 'Aryan Brotherhood', have burned down half of our strongholds, but military and civilian. What they haven't taken they're burning, and what they aren't burning they're raping and murdering."\n\nMendriks didn't respond, and simply thought of how long he had been doing this. For over two decades he had been the leader of the Guard, the first line of defense against raiders. He had tried to protect the people to the best of his abilities.\n\nAnd yet, had it all been for nothing, as this new group, the most evil and powerful group he had encountered, had taken over Russia and was now salivating over the new, untouched victims of the Urals? Had every sacrifice been for nothing?\n\nNo, Mendriks thought. The Guard has always, and forever would, be the protector of the people, even when everything seemed hopeless. As long as there was a man or a woman in danger, they would be there, even if they had to fight from the shadows, in the darkness of inns and cellars.\n\n"Sir?" said the adjunct, concerned.\n\n"Evacuate as many civilians as possible. Once that is done, we must move further South, making whatever contacts we can."\n\n"Yes sir."\n\nThe adjunct left, leaving Mendriks to his own thoughts, as the church began to collapse in on itself."
 PRM_vagner.9.a: "The Guard will never stop to protect the Russian people."
