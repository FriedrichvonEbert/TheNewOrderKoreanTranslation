LATAM.10_lott_title: "An Offer from the Andean Pact"
LATAM.10_lott_desc: "Henrique Teixera Lott had not left much to chance during his term in office. He sometimes liked to think that fate had rewarded his diligent work. More often, however, the president had no time for idle speculation. All that mattered were efforts, and results.\n\nOn this late afternoon, late into his presidential term, Walter Salles and Tancredo Neves had both taken the time to visit the president. The matter was of great import; something once merely overheard in whispered rumors had now come to pass. Chile and Peru had gone ahead and united their strength into a new economic union. The Andean Pact, as it was named, would seek to do what had not been accomplished in hundreds of years of European presence in South America: a unified regional economic market. Hence the presence of the two essential ministers\n\n"Then, gentlemen, your thoughts?" Asked Lott. Neves spoke first, his eyes gleaming.\n\n"The possibilities, Mr. Lott! A regional common market, where we are free to progress on our own, not beholden to Washington D.C. or Tokyo."\n\n"I agree with Mr. Neves." Said the foreign minister Salles. "The benefits from joining in are likely to be great, both from increased trade as well as better ties with our neighbors."\n\n"With all of our neighbors but Argentina." Said the president.\n\nSalles nodded. "Mr. Denys is lukewarm on the idea of a pact." The foreign minister said. "He argues that those who don't join in the pact risk being irritated and set up rival tariffs and alliances. Better to coast on neutrality and good relations with all."\n\n"An interesting case." Lott sighed. A final matter of his presidency. A decision would need to be made, eventually. But which? The president asked himself, sitting opposite his two ministers."
LATAM.10.lott_a: "Call Santiago, this opportunity is too good to pass up."
LATAM.10.lott_b: "We cannot join now. Brazil must weigh its options carefully."

LATAM.10_quadros_desc: "Rest from the day's work. Da Silva poured the president another drink. Arinos played with his lighter, awaiting the next round of toasts.\n\nThe three men were in a good mood. Alcohol thinned the edge of excitement. Words chosen carefully, lest the avalanche of thoughts turn into a cascade of words and ideas.\n\n"A regional economic alliance the likes of which South America has never seen! Just think of the possibility!" One of the three men said. Another pointed out the risks. "Tokyo will no doubt try to get in."\n\n"Or America will sabotage it."\n\n"You two worry too much."\n\nQuadros drained his glass. Refused another one. Serious events were a foot, serious conversations were held. He and his foreign policy partners in crime were amazed by the news coming out of Santiago. The Chileans and Peruvians were planning a new trade bloc, the Andean Pact. For a president determined to steer Brazil free of foreign imperialism, this was one of the major upsets of the decade. Of the century, perhaps!\n\nThe conversation rolled on and on, occasionally dimming to embers, oftentimes roaring back by blazing passion. Should Brazil join in? Try to take a leading position, or work in concert with other factions. What of Argentina, and others that refused to join in? Should Brazil sit on the sidelines, and observe how events unfolded?\n\nOn and on the discussion went, until something of a consensus emerged."

LATAM.10.quadros_b: "Sadly it is not in Brazil's interests at this time."

LATAM.10_jk_title: "A Proposal from the Andean Pact"
LATAM.10_jk_desc: "Neatly arrayed maps on the walls of the Palácio do Planalto meeting room. Precise reports on various infrastructure projects, chief of which was the Trans-Amazonian Highway. Columns after columns of methodically arranged numbers. President Kubitschek's check up on the health of his various initiatives were often gently mocked by various staffers as the patterns of a country doctor making sure the village's children were growing up strong and healthy.\n\nThe day's topics, however, reflected foreign affairs. Minister of Foreign Affairs Negrão de Lima had come in with the incredible news from Santiago. The Chilean and Peruvians were announcing a new trading partnership, open to all nations of South America.\n\n"A phenomenal opportunity!" Said Roberto Campos. "With our booming industry and with the integration of all our provinces through the Trans-Amazonian highway, lowering tariffs with our neighbor would be pure profit. We can carve out an economic niche away from the overbearing influence of the Americans, without selling out to the Japanese."\n\n"A great opportunity indeed. If we are to be winners, are there going to be any losers from this Andean pact?" Asked Kubitschek.\n\n"It's supposed to be a win win for everyone. Word on the street, however, is that Argentina has declined joining it." Said the foreign minister.\n\n"If that's the case, Brazil would be by far the biggest member of the bloc."\n\n"A good point." the president looked to the array of maps. "Regional balance will be severely affected. Argentina will never buy our policy of friendly neutrality if our partners surround them."\n\n"It need not be such a big deal, I think." Negrão de Lima said. "If we stand as the first among equals within the Andean Pact, we can lead it and use it as a tool toward greater peace and development throughout the region."\n\nCampos and Kubitschek nodded. The discussion went on towards a few more topics. Eventually, the president made up his mind, weighing both options up."

LATAM.10_lacerda_desc: ""Then this story, has it been proven to be true, Leitão? That Chile wants us into their new trade zone?" Asked President Lacerda.\n\nHis Foreign Minister nodded. "Chile and Peru have reached out to us through informal channels to sound out how we feel about their proposed trade union."\n\n"A danger to regional balance. Perhaps also an opportunity?" Asked Lacerda. Leitão da Cunha thought a few moments, before replying.\n\n"A good opportunity, sir. If we play our cards right. Argentina will certainly not join."\n\n"Any news from Washington?"\n\n"They've kept mum so far. Official line is that they celebrate every relationship between free nations."\n\n"We'd probably have heard about it if this really irritated them." Said the president. "They are probably waiting to see how it shakes out, like us. Hmm..." Carlos Lacerda did not find himself often at a loss for words. "Were we to join, the Argentinians would be blindsided. This could be a great opportunity to promote OFN interests across the region."\n\n"The facts are as they are, sir." The Foreign Minister said cautiously. "The decision about what to do is yours.""

The president indulged occasionally in the excellent meals provided by his chef. His ministerial cabinet was more often than not included in the bounty, as was the case on that evening.\n\nThe most recent news had encouraged Adhemar to invite Foreign Minister Leitão da Cunha and Economy Minister Barreto to partake in the rich food. News that Chile and Peru had jointly declared the creation of a new trade bloc, the Andean Pact. Adhemar and his associates discussed this business opportunity over several courses. "Gentlemen, what are your thoughts on this recent development?" Asked the president.\n\nThe conversation that ensued flowed from topic to topic. Encouraged by the president, Barretto discussed the potential benefits to the Brazilian economy, jobs at risk from free trade, potential electoral gains from the resulting economic boom, as well as factions within the business community and their likely opinion on the new trade zone. Over dessert it was Leitão da Cunha's turn to discuss foreign policy implications of the trade deals; generally positive for Brazil, with the possible exception of frosty relationships with Argentina, a country unlikely to join the pact.\n\nAt the end of the delicious meal a bottle of Port wine was passed around. The two ministers looked at their president quizzically. "Your thoughts, sir?" asked Leitão da Cunha. "We've done most of the talking"\n\nAdhemar smiled, and spoke..."

LATAM.10_goulart_desc: "He was back. Brasilia was still a new and uncertain thing to Vargas - when he had retired, all the back-stabbing and backroom deals all happened in the shadow of Cristo Redentor. It felt too modern, all too sleek and streamlined as a machine had designed it. Rio was overcrowded and underdesigned, but it was unmistakably Brazilian. What that meant, Vargas really couldn't pin down. Times were rapidly changing for Brazil, and if this quiet conversation went the way he hoped - then the entire continent would follow suit.\n\n"Ah, our man of the hour!" a man with thick-rimmed glasses came to shake his hand. "We were just waiting for your arrival. My name is Hermes Lima, Goulart and Neves and the rest of the cabinet is just in the other room." Vargas followed the eager man into the conference room. It was small, and there were no windows. It was a shabby room - like a relic from his Presidency - but he gave a thin, knowing smile to himself. It was in places like these where history was made.\n\n"Getúlio! I'm glad you could make it here." Goulart got out of his seat and shook his hand firmly. "My apologies for the haste, but we must press forwards." Vargas nodded in acknowledgement and took his seat. It was hard not to notice the eyes of the entire room on him. "Okay, people. Now that we're all here. Let's get on. I propose that a defensive alliance between the nations of South America should be made, to protect ourselves from foreign influence. I know that most of us are for that, but does anyone have suggestions?"\n\n"This is ridiculous!" one cabinet member shot out. "Getting ourselves involved would imbalance Latin power imbalances and throw our nation into chaos! This alliance would have us pouring gasoline all over the continent to put out an ember!" the entire room dissolved into a tense quiet.\n\n"It is not enough." Vargas broke the silence. "It is not enough to have an alliance and hope for the best. This alliance, or pact, must be strong enough to bend but not break. What good would it have us if Ecuador and Colombian squabbles disrupted our unity? We must take the reins and lead the continent - not as Emperor - but as a guiding force!" Some in the room nodded and murmured in approval - especially Goulart and Lima."

LATAM.10_castelo_title: "A Foreign Policy Opportunity?"
LATAM.10_castelo_desc: "President Castelo Branco found out rapidly that whether in civilian or military life, leaders were expected to process an endless stream of unexpected events. Thankfully, that day's set of news had been a more fortuitous one than usual, for Chile and Peru had gone ahead and declared the birth of a new trade bloc, the Andean Pact. This new voluntary group of nations was intended as an area of lower tariffs and an avenue for better friendship between the region's countries. So thought the president, discussing the news with his foreign minister in the Palácio da Alvorada\n\n"You speak of improving the economy, and furthering our economy, sir. What do you think is America's likeliest reaction to all of this?"\n\nCastelo Branco sighed. "They are our greatest allies in protecting our institutions."\n\n"It's always hard to figure out their thinking."  Magalhães said. "If we join the Andean Pact it might raise a few alarms in D.C. That said, our economic size would likely help us take a leading role in the bloc, and help steer it toward OFN interests whenever the Americans need it. With a bit of hard work we could really make use of this opportunity to strengthen our regional position and impress our allies. Our, ah, friends in the American business community could help us make our case to the D.C. foreign policy wonks.\n\n"Nothing is ever free." Castelo Branco rubbed his temples. "We'll have to convince our own business community. The upcoming president will also have to be made to see things our way, so that he doesn't derail everything. Still, perhaps it's an opportunity...""

LATAM.11.t: "Trades And Borders"
LATAM.11.desc: "João never knew how many diplomats smoked like a chimney. The grand hall was practically choked in ashes and haze, forcing him to keep his breaths shallow and quiet, else he choke on the fumes - and he doubted the tense atmosphere needed some secretary breaking into a hacking fit to help relax the tension.\n\nIt seemed his services would be unnecessary as the Pact representatives organized their papers, their leader standing. "The first order of business today," the man stated, peering through his glasses at his agenda, "is to negotiate proper terms for the borders of the Brazilian nation, in relation to the other members of the Pact. Shall we begin?"A quick glance up to the Brazilian delegation, whose leader merely nodded in response, and the man went back to his paper.\n\n"In the interests of our member nations, we must recognize the current state of border infrastructure as quite unsatisfactory, and would work to repair and improve on that. In relation to trade agreements and border restrictions, we request that the Brazilian delegation agrees to renegotiate its deals with our member nations, and relax its limits on Pact nations. . ."\n\nJoão tuned the man out as he began speaking in legalese, forgoing the details as he considered the offer. New trade deals, less border restrictions? A double edged sword, perhaps - cheaper goods at home, but the potential for Brazilian jobs being lost over the border to her neighbors. He knew, however, that some sort of agreement would need to be negotiated on the issue, regardless of integration into the Pact or not.\n\nWhat would Brasilia want?"
LATAM.11.a: "These terms are more than acceptable."
LATAM.11.b: "The border policy is fine, but these trade terms are too much."

Someone had gotten it in their head to open a window, thank God, João would kiss them if he knew who it was, but even then the haze had hardly abated. The only way to keep him focused was a series of key words that he knew would start fires - words like "political integration". By the reaction of the rest of the delegation, he wasn't alone.\n\n"Cooperation on military matters, economic matters, diplomatic coordination." the man continued. "Generally, our integration would be aimed at keeping the members of the Pact united and powerful through cooperation. Perhaps some multinational training exercises, a few diplomatic meetings - keeping each other on the same page." He looked through his glasses at the Brazilians, waiting for their response.\n\nAs João leaned in towards his superior, his mind whirled through possibilities. It made sense, sure, but he couldn't help but remember that neither Chile or Peru had been too enthusiastic about this prospect either. It gave him leeway, at least. He could already picture nationalists back home yelling about loss of sovereignty if they went too far just as easily as he could see those internationalists who had pushed for the Pact in the first place raging about their reluctance.\n\nSomeone's going to have to be upset."

There were only six men in this cramped room, hidden away from the rest of the complex - the Chilean and Brazilian diplomats and their two best aides. It was no small honor that João was here to witness this.\n\n"The elephant in the room?" his superior started, prompting a tired nod from the Chilean. "Of course. It's always the Argentines."\n\n"Always." The other man said. "They're unstable, aggressive, and strong. You know just as well as we do how dangerous they can be. We want cooperation - shared officers, mutual defense agreements, military cooperation-"\n\n"And you left the Peruvian delegation out of this, I see."\n\n"We did, yes. They don't understand it like we do. To them, Argentina is just another nation. We can't risk a security leak like that over something as important as this."\n\n"Indeed." The Brazilian responded. "This is. . .quite an escalation, you know. Buenos Aires would be furious if they figured it out - maybe provoked enough to fight. I must say, my friend, Brazil does not want a continental war on its hands."\n\n"Of course, but that doesn't mean you can simply ignore the threat."\n\nThe diplomat turned to João, and he felt his stomach jump into his throat.

Too many demands, too many sticking points. Eventually, the other parties had tired of their delegation's so-called "intransigence", and had ended the talks.\n\nHe had taken it harshly. It was a failure, after all, and João had not come with the intention of failing. On a lesser scale, it would certainly not be the bright note on his resume that he had hoped for. On the grand scale, of course, it meant Brazil would not be able to reap the potential rewards of the Andean Pact, or cooperate as effectively with its members. What an opportunity they had blown! It almost made him sick thinking about it.\n\nStill, though, they had demanded too much. He soothed his mind with that line of thought. They had asked for too much, and Brazil had no choice but to defend its sovereignty. The nationalists would welcome the delegation back warmly, at least, even if the government would be displeased. It wasn't a good silver lining, but it was something.\n\nStill, as João looked back at the rapidly receding properties, he couldn't help but feel like a real opportunity had been missed.

LATAM.16.t: "The Handshake Across the Andes"
LATAM.16.desc: "Over 4,000 miles long. Over 400 miles wide. Nearly 14,000 feet tall. The Andes stretch through the beating heart of the Latin world. Now, for the first time since the enforced solidarity wrought by the Viceroyalties of Spain, an extended hand reaches across the mountains. Among the weathered stones of the Pinkuylluna, near the city of Cusco, a group of men shake hands. No negotiations have taken place here (the old storehouse is no place for modern statesmen), but the symbolism of the old capital of the Inca is too great to pass up.\n\n"Goddamn it's cold up here". The Brazilian representative looks out across the ancient fortress-city of Ollantaytambo. At his core, he is deeply moved by the morning mist that fills the sacred valley before him. He is moved by the historicity of the moment, the change in course of Latin American history. He has a strong sense of hope for the future; he truly believes in the power of the Andean Pact. All the same, he is enslaved to machismo and politics - his hope and his passion have no place in international diplomacy - and so, he comments on the temperature and bundles his hands under his arms as a surrogate for emotional depth.\n\n"There is nothing wrong with cool mountain air! It invigorates the body, mind, and soul." The Chilean representative, one would expect, ought to be tied down with the bonds of masculinity far harder than the Brazilian. For this man in particular, on this day, elation has won out over social mores. South America has been hypothetically free for over a century, since the days of Bolívar, and yet it has always been tied to one of the political poles of Earth-- Madrid, London, Germania. Now though, with the Brazilian entry into the Andean Pact all but assured, these nations might begin to walk proud and tall.\n\nThe Brazilian delegation has agreed to work towards a unified Andes, but such a proposal must first pass the Brazilian Congress and through the jaws of Brasilia. To the quiet Peruvian representative, this is merely the first step on a much longer road. He silently prays they do not stumble."

For the majority, however, the decision not to join the pact was met by a sort of muted disappointment. The president's proud announcement that Brazil would take its place as a leading nation in South America had been followed by a defeat speech where the president meekly admitted that the time had not yet come for such a momentous occasion.

Far away from anything as unseemly as public debate, the national congress passed the president's decision just as routinely as it did any other bill. Voices of dissents were of course permitted. The army was not, after all, doing anything out of the constitutional norm. Yet now that it was purged from radical anti-democratic elements, the country's political class generally spoke in one voice. And that voice followed the requests of the president more often than it did not.\n\nThe real debates took place not within the congress, nor within the public, but in the rarefied air of high level military politics and corporate interests. Those officers who felt that Brazil had to gain from joining the Andean Pact had negotiated, cajoled, threatened, bribed and insisted on those who did not.

While pro-democracy advocates breathe a sigh of relief, some have voiced concern that the continuation of Argentinian civilian government had less to do with the strength of civilian institutions than the outcome of a factional struggle within the military.\n\nFresh elections are expected to be called soon, and whatever path Argentina may take, it will be under the guiding hand of the 'Azul' military faction. Comprised of moderate antiperonists, largely drawn from Army cavalry officers, they have publicly indicated their desire to preserve democratic institutions, and to allow Peronism to continue existing as a political force."

Arturo Umberto Illia has clutched the presidency with around twenty percent of the vote, owing his victory to the electoral college rather than the people. To make matters even more complicated, the election itself was of questionable legitimacy, with nearly a quarter of all cast ballots being blank in protest, as many Argentines used them to express support for Perón and Frondizi.\n\nThough scattered protests have been staged across the nation, thus far no extraordinary action has been taken against Illia or his administration.

Their last remaining strongholds across the nation are being snuffed out and their leadership and soldiers are dead, imprisoned, or fleeing.\n\nThis of course means that the stabilized state is now fully under the control of the members of the Guión Rojo faction, who had unceremoniously forced the previous dictator Morínigo out and replaced him with a leader of their own choosing.

His opposition, dispersed by the recent collapse of the Second Democratic Union, disputed the fairness of the election, which the candidates of the Radical, Conservative, and Socialist parties all spent in a jail cell.

This resulted in the creation of enough momentum for the opposition to organize and strike under the leadership of the now-President Stroessner.\n\nThe new regime has already become well-known for its ruthless and brutal dismantling of the fascist regime's legacy, but just as much for its tendency to brutally crack down on anything it considers subversive."

Eventually, after threats of a civil war drew worryingly near, the coup members surrendered. Now, Colonel Viaux lies imprisoned and awaits trial. Whatever the case, it appears that the Chilean government has proven their capability, and have utilised it well, as a slim chance to return stability to the shaken nation appears."

LATAM_news.117.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Herrerists Elected in Uruguay"
LATAM_news.117.desc: "The 1962 Uruguayan elections have come to a close, and the winner is the Herrerist-Ruralist coalition of the National Party. Alberto Arocena is expected to head the Council for the first year of the new government.\n\nThe elected coalition faced off great internal opposition from a faction of Orthodox Herrerists, being a close race. In the end Arocena won, but word from Uruguay is that the faction leadership is concerned about the division of the Herrerist movement, and so the alliance with the Ruralists is on the line.\n\nThe Americanophilia of the Ruralists stands in sharp contrast to the anti-Americanism of the Herrerists, an issue that was ignored but can no longer be. With the confrontation between the two factions being inevitable, all what Uruguayans can do is hope that they don't collapse the country in their infighting.\n"

LATAM_news.118.desc: "The 1962 Uruguayan elections have come to a close, and the winner are the Ubedistas of the National Party. Daniel Fernández Crespo is expected to head the Council for the first year of the new government.\n\nA man who left the Herrerists for considering them too right-wing, Crespo was one of the founders of the "Unión Blanca Democrática" (UBD), a political wing of the National Party which united various non-Herrerists currents under one banner. Widely recognized as centrists, their victory came thanks to the Herrerists splitting their vote between the Herrerist-Ruralist coalition and the Orthodox Herrerists.\n\nCrespo's economic plan bears some resemblance to the ideas of Developmentalism, but its implementation will depend on his ability to form a coalition.\n"

LATAM_news.119.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Catorcistas Elected in Uruguay"
LATAM_news.119.desc: "The 1962 Uruguayan elections have come to a close, and the winners are the Catorcistas of the Colorado Party. Óscar Gestido is expected to head the Council for the first year of the new government.\n\nA retired General, Gestido is considered a hero for his role in helping the victims of the 1959 floods. His fame was enough for the Conservative Batllist faction "Unión Colorada y Batllista" (UCB), who found in the General the person they needed to win an election, as they now have done.\n\nHowever, the UCB is a sector that hosts unsavory elements, the most evident being the group around ex-President César Charlone, known Fascist-sympathizer. While Gestido has managed to name a cabinet with some left-wing figures to keep the unity of the Colorado Party, maintaining it will be a task that will require Military discipline.\n"

LATAM_news.120.desc: "The 1962 Uruguayan elections have come to a close, and the winners are the Quincistas of the Colorado Party. Luis Batlle Berres is expected to head the Council for the first year of the new government, that being the third time he will be leader of the country.\n\nLuisito, as he is known, represents the Orthodox faction of Batllism, being Batlle's nephew. As such, he has promised that he and his government will not deviate from Batllism principles, promising a return to the policies that made Uruguay the Switzerland of America in the first place, a declaration that his critics have taken as meaning that he will promote the same policies that crashed the Uruguayan economy in the 50s.\n\nFor Luis his victory means that the National Party winning an election was a unique event. Whether that's true remains to be seen.\n"
