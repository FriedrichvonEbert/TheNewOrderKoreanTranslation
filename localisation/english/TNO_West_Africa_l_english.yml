The gunfire outside began to dim as the beat of a Huey descended upon the roof. Mark pushed through the crowds racing up the fire escape stairs and saw a line of people sitting on the helipad, as the Huey rose into the sky. Mark hardly registered it, as he pushed through the crowd that bled into the line of despairing accountants and bureaucrats, looking for faces. Aside from the lobby, his floor would have been the last to the roof. Cora worked on the second-highest floor, and God willing, she'd gotten out. Mark watched as the Huey flew to the shore, where there was supposed to be some kind of an evacuation effort. Mark let out a sigh of relief, and turned around, where he saw Cora smiling at him with tears in her eyes."

Then, they'd save the day and leave.\n\nThis wasn't the case, and it didn't just disappoint Carter, it was terrifying. This was going to be a real war, not just an intervention. They had a good chance of victory even still, but it was now apparent to him that they weren't coming to the rescue so much as they were joining the slaughter. Carter gazed warily down at the forming trench, realising it may yet be someone's grave."

He'd stared out the window for a while, surveying the gorgeous countryside with the occasionally ugly blotch of wartorn territory, but that had grown boring. He glanced at the pilot, a surprisingly young man in uniform of light skinned African complexion, much like himself. \"Hey, I missed my briefing earlier, would you mind giving me a sitrep on well... everything?\" Daniel hadn't missed much of the briefing, but had to be removed when all medics were called for an emergency. Still, he was starved for conversation.\n\n\"Oh, of course!\" Replied the pilot, surprisingly chipper despite the circumstances. Finally, someone was talking to him, he thought to himself, \"The situation was... interesting. We, as France, met more and more resistance every day. It is hard, you know? We are alone out here. Although, we had our privileges to make things easier.\" He spoke stiltedly, as a new English speaker might. Daniel cocked an eyebrow, beckoning the pilot to go on. \"Well, France has er... well, we make a web, like a spider. A web of people and places who help us. The Germans bombed us less, the neighbors got... less upset. Life was better, for France.\"\n\n\"Well, this wasn't what I meant by sitrep but, that's helpful. Say - I never caught your name.\"\n\n\"Agyeman Pelletier. Father is French, mother is a native. Life is not easy for her, or me, but like France, others protect us - father. Others are not so lucky.

 west_african_crisis.206.desc:0 "Colonel Teruzuki wondered if his oncoming migraine was due to this being his sixth cup of coffee in as many hours, or the incomprehensible nature of the map presented before him. Back in his day, there were regular forces belonging to nation-states, and there were partisans. The Chinese understood this, even if they understood little else. Presently, however, just this small patch of swamp was a mess of national armies, ideologically-driven partisan organisations, tribal militias and mercenaries with questionable loyalties and alliegences, bandits, 'humanitarian organisations' and panicking civilians across both sides. His orders were to assist the defeat of French exile forces in West Africa, but were even they set in stone? Would they be walking lockstep down Abidjan in a week's time, Kimigayo following La Marseillaise in a long march of madness?\n\nNaturally, such an... unorthodox battlefield would need a competent strategy in order to secure victory, such as it could be called. And Teruzuki had been entrusted to bring it about. The hours had passed, and he had brought himself no closer to a solution. There were just far too many uncertain variables. He didn't know how many of the enemy there were, how many men he could rely on besides the token Japanese force he commanded, how willing his allies would be to do their jobs or listen to him, what side everyone between the national armies would come down on. Far too complex, far too mysterious. It was like walking an army into the proverbial abyss.\n\nAn idea came to him. Of course, if it was this way to the Japanese, it was likely the same to all the other factions at play. The natives might have more of a cultural awareness of the region, but even they had no hope of coherently tracking any of this. This game was not chess orshogi, but mahjong or poker. If nobody knew what they were doing, the one side who acted as if they did was at an advantage. If they didn't waltz right into a trap or an untenable position. But they had to do something, and so it was a risk Teruzuki would have to take, lest he be castigated for doing nothing."

One moment, he had been headed in silence somewhere he couldn't recall, as his brain clawed at threads of memory, desperate to form a coherent narrative. Next had come a slow realisation of the presence of something his half a mind likened to a hornet's nest. Then, he'd felt the alien sensation of nothingness in his leg, replaced soon by searing pain.\n\nThe first sensation that returned to Patrick beyond agony was the blurry sight of asphalt spattered with his own blood. His busted nose throbbed from its collision with the road, his left leg burned with genuine and phantom pain - torn off at the knee, and both his arms were nearly flayed by road burn. The ringing in his ears gave way to muffled shouting of orders, screams of pain, and the staccato rattle of gunfire. It took him a moment to realize he, too, was screaming. Someone hauled him to his foot, supporting him with their shoulder. \n\nAs Patrick slung his gaze up from the ground and saw his unit racing between the squat, bombed out concrete ruins and down the tight streets of a Ghanan city, his memories pieced back together. They were to take the city, but something he couldn't remember had stopped them and his squad and 8 Ghanan militia had found themselves scrambling back to French lines. They had proceeded quietly through the urban jungle, evading ambushes and traps, until... the hornet's nest: An IED, then an ambush.\n\nNow there were only 8 men, dragging him along with them in their hasty retreat along a narrow road towards a blurry french barricade. The Ghanans were nowhere to be seen, and they had long since passed the initial ambush point. Fighting to speak against the choking pain, Patrick asked: \"Where are the others?\" He was told the squad had to get to French lines. \"Where are the others?!\" He pleaded, this time to no response as they passed the barricade."

Regardless, it was an important affair to all men and their nations' interests, and the faux pa had been let slide.\n\n\"I still believe our only option is an airlift. This city is in peril, even without the PALF knocking on its door like others. The partisans have blown the tracks, smashed up roads and sabotaged vehicles.

Besides, what if they have rocket launchers, or if the Japs gave them some?\" Replied the American.\n\n\"Send them with escorts, then! I'm not letting my people starve because you don't want to take that risk.\" Blurted the Ghanan, \"I keep the tallies on supplies here, I know you have more than enough food and water for those poor people.\"\n\n\"He's absolutely right. We can't withhold aid because of a 'maybe'. This is war, people die and planes wreck - what's the difference if they do it saving those civilians? Besides, we'll need all the territory we can get, and the place is a sitting duck without food and munitions.\" Added the Frenchman. The American sighed - they were right.

Nakajima then helped a young, but smart looking Cameroonian Volunteer into the chair at the front of the cannon. After a few minutes of aiming and words of encouragement, the volunteer successfully fired 3 shots into the sky, one managing to down a lone Canadian transport plane that happened to be passing by.\n\nNakajima then signalled to their commander that the demonstration had concluded, and walked back to his tent over the hill.

I'll see you guys tomorrow - try not to be hung over when I see you.\" The men nodded, cracked one or two more jokes, and sent Charles off with a wave and a smile before turning back to the bar."

 west_african_crisis.221.t: "Watching Too Much Television"
 west_african_crisis.221.desc: "Anthony had been as lazy as the rest of his day had been. Late to wake up and late to go to sleep, the atmosphere was thick, sweaty and hazy. He barely even looked at the recommended documents for his engineering degree, instead choosing to read through a novel he had purchased a year ago. Now, he had put page down for screen, watching the flickering screen as his father wielded the controller.\n\n\"They put a bunch of crap on these things, don't they?\" Anthony Senior wasn't as big a fan of TV as his son had been, nonetheless he sat still, flicking through a series of news channels. He caught a glimpse of a debate focused between an NPP politician and his Republican counterpart, a documentary on the aftermath of the Guyanese intervention and a myriad of other shows too quickly flicked through to understand.\n\nFinally, Anthony Senior landed on an interview, and this time, silently decided to stay there.\n\n\"You ended your career in Guyana, correct?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's right. The last \"good\" war it's called nowadays. Swift, sharp, decisive, all the words the generals and their ilk like. They don't tell you we're still in there, they don't tell you Americans are still fighting for our little 'intervention'.\" He stopped for a second, sipping on his glass of water. \"They don't tell you we're still dying.\"\n\n\"Why did you decide to quit the military, Mr Gualtieri?\"\n\n\"What's the point? We had no business in Guyana, and we have less now. Whatever damage was made by that backwards dictator has been amplified tenfold by our involvement, so what was the point? So that we could sell a couple more Coca Colas for a few bucks less? That's why I quit; I'm dying for a fucking Coke.\""

 west_african_crisis.222.desc: "Kane had the easiest job in the unit. While the PALF forces he worked with required tons of material, all he had to do was add a couple 0's to the end of whatever item they required on his report. From binoculars, lighters, gas masks, radio kits and the other weapons of war a militia force required, Kane would seek them out. It was a simple, resource managing job. Almost like banking, he remissed.\n\nAs he filed away his most recent report to his secretary, he couldn't help but wonder what would happen to this portion of the world after he was gone and somebody else took his role. West Africa gobbled up a lot more resources than it produced for Japan, a fact the corporations of his homeland knew very well.\n\nStaring out over the army barracks, Kane decided to tuck that little thought away. He had no business questioning the morals of his operation. His job was little more than to ensure that the men he took charge of had a weapon in their hands and a full belly while holding it. The future was an interesting prospect, but his job came first."

 west_african_crisis.223.desc: "Shuichi sat hunched in his office, sorting the grimmest of paperwork. The lights in the room were dim, and he preferred it that way. After hours working in a morgue, the sterile brightness of a medical facility and its intense feeling of mortality tends to ruin one's taste for bright light. No, Shuichi was happy with his little desk lamp fending off the evening's darkness.\n\nCharting the dead was not only a demoralizing experience, but a mind numbingly boring one. The first hour a week ago when Shuichi had signed on to remain behind and help count the dead was frightening and tragic, but eventually the names, causes of death and other minutae began to blur until they were simply squiggles on a page to be transferred to a letter and sent off. Jotting yet another scribble down, Shuichi took a sip of his tea and winced. While he was grateful for the Cameroonian's hospitality, giving him room and board so long after the withdrawal, their tea was terrible.\n\nShuichi nearly chuckled to himself. Why did he take this job? He could be at home with his family, sipping real tea, and reading a book. It was absurd to have volunteered to stay back to count the dead and it was even more absurd that his only complaint was boredom and foul tea. Shaking his head, he reassured himself that the pay would be worth it.\n\nSuddenly, Shuichi's eyes fell upon a familiar name in the sea of casualty reports. Imada Taro. He didn't recognize the name Imada, but the name Taro chilled his bones. It was his brother's name. Shuichi knew for sure that this Taro was not his brother, yet he could not help but wonder who's brother this man was. All of these names, once scribbles but quickly fading back into legibility, were suddenly much more humanized. Shuichi rubbed his nose and shook back to reality, jotting the cause of death - landmine. He finished the letter, then flicked to the next, someone else's brother. Private Yamada Ichiro, artillery blast. He wrote another letter."

 west_african_escalation.1.t: "How It All Starts"
 west_african_escalation.1.desc: "\"It's on all of the stations.\" There was static for a moment as the television searched for the next station, only for another image to appear- once more of a bombed out village in Free French territory, displayed in all of its smoking, bloodsoaked glory as the flag of Cameroon flew in the distance. \"Can't get any news if it's not coming out of West Africa.\"\n\n\"I don't get why they bother so much with it.\" Howard entered the room with a bowl of stew and a disquieted expression as he turned to sit on the couch. His wife, Judith, was still fiddling with the knobs on the television before she gave up and joined him. He gestured idly with his spoon towards the television as it displayed a glamor shot of a Free French bombardment. \"We have no truck with this one. It ain't even France the Cameroons are fighting, but just a buncha lost soldiers in Africa.\"\n\n\"People are worried Howard, we all know what happened last time fighting started up in Africa, folks wanna know if we're going in for round two.\" Judith pointed out before retrieving a bowl of her own stew.\n\n\"Those were Nazis, Judith. No one has a problem with killing Nazis.\" Howard opened his mouth to continue, but Judith interjected again.\n\n\"Except for Lionel, you know, down the street? He had a lotta problems with killing Nazis when that whole thing started.\"\n\nHoward sighed. \"Yes, except for Lionel. Point is, whatever that fight became, it started out in a good place. Y'know. Protecting the free world. Stopping the German advance. That whole thing. This though? This is a territory squabble.\"\n\n\"Ain't stopping Washington hon. I heard they're gonna be sending advisors.\" Judith's remark drew a raised eyebrow from Howard. \"And yeah, to the French.\"\n\n\"They aren't even France though...\" Howard grumbled as he pinched the bridge of his nose. He, and so many other Americans like him, had a very bad feeling about this one. So he, like many other Americans like him, kept their eyeballs glued to the television set."

There was only a road between Louis and the great white north.\n\nWar was coming to America again, and once more, it would send its young men over to die in some pointless struggle in Africa. He had been fortunate enough to have not been drafted for South Africa, but that was no guarantee he'd be so fortunate for West Africa.\n\nHe passed by a mile marker, northbound.\n\nWhy should he go and die fighting for a bunch of misplaced Frenchmen on the Ivory Coast anyways? It was one thing to go and fight Germans- fighting Germans was practically an American pastime at this point! But Cameroonians? What guff did we have with the Cameroonians anyways? Louis didn't even know where Cameroon was. Or what you called someone from Cameroon, even. Cameroonian? Cameroonite? Just call them a Cameroon? Who even knew?\n\nAnd here he was, fleeing his home of twenty two years because if he stayed, he'd be put up to fight some poor bastard from there, who probably was being told to do so with just as much reluctance as he would have been.\n\nHe passed by the two mile marker, northbound.\n\nHe'd always considered himself a patriot, he'd voted for Nixon even. Maybe not the proudest decision he'd made, in hindsight, but he was hardly some America-hating hippie like they described on the news. He just didn't want to die in a pointless war, that wasn't wrong, was it?\n\nAt the third mile marker, he pulled off to the side of the road. The tears had made it hard to see ahead of him."

 west_african_escalation.3.desc: "8 AM. The smell of coffee was in the air as Joel descended the staircase towards his chair. Before breakfast, before coffee, before the thought of work even entered his mind, he reached for the morning paper and turned towards the page with the foreign affairs on it. More news on the War in Africa. Not that it would do him any good.\n\nIt wasn't as if it'd tell him if his son was there in whichever battles were being described there, those little border skirmishes where the French took one place, the Africans would take another, they'd swap back another week later, all described in the papers as if it mattered. None of it mattered.\n\nToday's edition described the victorious capture of some poor African village by an American platoon, and the picture provided showed some poor black son of a bitch raising his rifle in victory, as if it was something to really be proud of. Joel crunched the newspaper into a crumpled ball and let it fall to the side of the chair as he sighed.\n\nMary emerged from the kitchen, a cup of steaming hot coffee in hand as she went to check the mail. Joel's thoughts turned back to his son, Max. Out there, fighting. He wondered where he was now, somewhere out along the Ivory Coast. His wandering mind was interrupted by a shriek of anguish, followed by the smashing of ceramic as Mary dropped to her knees.\n\nJoel rushed to her side, and with her face hidden behind her hand, only tears and sobs escaping. Her other hand handed an opened letter up towards Joel."

Spittle and debris was thrown from the crowd ahead of them, splattering into the face of the stoic line between the protest and the President's residence. Batons and dogs remained at the ready, their low growls drowned out by shouts of exasperated anger in the distance.\n\nIn the midst of the crowd, a college student raised his fist in anger. No fewer than four of his friends were set to be shipped off to go die for a failed government's hold on land that they didn't even properly claim. How the President didn't see the absurdity of the whole situation, he didn't know. Would he be next? Would he lose four friends to a single general's stupid little war? Not on his watch. He held up a burning slip of paper, the greatest blow he could strike against this war no one asked for.\n\nIn the front of the wave of protestors, black and white arms linked together in unity and solidarity, with a simple auto worker at the core of it all. He'd been here last time the government sent good boys off to die in a pointless war, he was far too old to be drafted into the meat grinder, but he took his stand all the same. Everyone knew that sending young black Americans off to die fighting their fellow Africans while there was so much work to be done here was wrong, it was a sin, and yet, it took until now for so many to speak up with him. Better late than never.\n\nA thousand individual dramas, a thousand particular motivations lined up before the representation of American political power, and all at once, in unison they chanted..."

A small group of African American youths had agreed to meet with a good friend they'd met in the recent protests, who now sat in front of them. They'd never seen him in his beret though, nor in the leather jacket or combat boots that were kicked up on the folding table.\n\nIt was hardly the most auspicious place for a meeting, some abandoned storage shed. But it was spacious, it had to be, because further inside there was a whole crowd of similarly dressed men and women. \"You didn't mention that you'd had friends with you.\" One of the young women responded from the back, her arms crossed over her chest skeptically.\n\n\"I hope it's no trouble.\" The Black Panther stood, gesturing for his protest-friends to follow him inside the warehouse. Save for a couple who excused themselves to slink back home, they did, into the gathering of a couple dozen jacketed African American men and women. It was only once they were inside that they realized that all of them were armed. And they were listening to one of them speak on a makeshift stage made up of a few empty cargo crates.\n\n\"Is it any wonder why we're going where we are? Out to Africa? To fight our brothers and sisters back on the home continent, who want nothing more than to cast off the colonial yoke?!\" The firebrand up on the cargo crates spoke with decisiveness and fire, while the crowd, in individual barks rather than a mass shout or singular chant, yelled back their approval. \"The white yoke!\" She finished, to a more concentrated roar. She went back to talking, and already a solid half of the guests had joined in with the crowd, intrigued by what she had to say next.\n\nUp on the wall behind her, the flag of Cameroon was plastered above her, but with the black fist of defiance and rebellion emblazoned over its middle stripe."
