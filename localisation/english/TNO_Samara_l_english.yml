 POLITICS_ANDREY_VLASOV_DESC: "붉은군대의 변절자 장군 안드레이 안드레이예비치 블라소프의 이름은 많은 러시아인들에게 여전히 민감한 주제입니다. 그의 몇 안 되는 지지자들에게 블라소프는 군사적으로 우월한 정복자에게 현명하게 굴복한 다음 그들의 후원을 이용하여 장차 강력하고 독립적인 러시아 국가를 위한 발판을 마련한 이반 1세의 현대판 인물로 묘사되고 있습니다. 그러나 대부분의 옛 소련 시민들에게는 그의 이름이 유다에 버금가는 가장 극악한 배신의 대명사로 불리고 있습니다. 물론 블라소프의 실제 성격은 그것보다 훨씬 덜하긴 합니다만.\n\n망신을 당한 장군이 독일군의 총검으로 적군의 위협을 뚫으려는 진심 어린 열망에 이끌렸는지, 아니면 나치와 동맹을 맺었을 때 살아남고자 하는 단순한 충동에 이끌렸는지는 말하기 어렵지만, 어떤 동기를 가졌든 독일군 최고사령부는 결코 그를 주목할 만한 동맹으로 여기지 않았고, 그의 조국이 독일의 군홧발에 짓밟히는 것을 후방에서 멀찍이 지켜볼 수 있도록 해주었을 뿐이었습니다.\n\n 블라소프가 독일인들과 러시아인들에게 재평가를 받을 만한 마지막 기회가 서러시아 전쟁 중에 나타났는데, 이때 그의 러시아 해방군이 서러시아 혁명 전선의 공세에 맞서 전세를 역전시키는 데 일조했습니다. 비록 그는 소비에트를 물리치는 데 도움을 주었고 이를 통해 사마라 인근의 영토를 획득하였지만, 독일인들은 여전히 그를 짧은 사슬에 묶어 두고 세심하게 지켜볼 개 이상의 존재로 보지 않았습니다. 그의 주인들에게 능욕을 당하고, 러시아를 해방시키는 데 있어 그의 비굴한 태도를 장애물로 여기기 시작한, 한때 믿을 만했던 장교들 사이에서조차 인기가 떨어진 블라소프는 러시아를 재통합하는 것이야말로 혐오스러운 배신자라는 그의 비참한 별명을 없애주는 유일한 길이라 믿는 나약하고 고립된 인물이 되어 버렸습니다."
 POLITICS_MILETIY_ZYKOV_DESC: "밀레티 알렉산드로비치 지코프가 러시아 해방 운동의 심장이자 양심이라는 것은 과언이 아닙니다 - 나치의 원조 아래 결집한 블라소프파 장군들과 민간인의 산만한 조합을 '운동'이라 부를 수 있다면 말입니다. 선동가로서의 재질을 인정받은 지코프는 러시아 해방군의 이념을 빚어내고 소련의 폭정에 맞선 투쟁에서 중요하게 작용한 민주적 이상을 내세웠습니다. 비록 이러한 이상이 전쟁의 현실에 빛이 바래긴 했어도, 지코프는 꾸준히 개신된 러시아 민주주의를 옹호하고, 지배자와 피지배자를 동시에 섬긴다는 파멸이 확정된 해방군의 대의가 그토록 필요로 했던 정당성을 부여했습니다 .\n\n지코프의 의중은 그의 동료들에게조차 풀 수 없는 수수께끼로 남아 있습니다. 자기 자신에 대한 그의 모순적이고, 때로는 터무니없기까지 한 말은 그의 과거를 둘러싼 소문의 거미줄을 더욱 넓힐 뿐입니다. 자신이 니콜라이 부하린의 옛 부관이자 마르크스주의 사상의 지지자라 주장하는 지코프는 자신을 볼셰비즘의 필연적인 몰락을 내다본 러시아 공화주의의 일원이라 생각하기를 좋아합니다. 한편으로는, KONR 내부에 있는 그의 수많은 정적들은 지코프를 기만적인 기회주의자이자, 비천한 유태인 볼세비키 작가로서 오직 자기 신세를 보전하기 위해 해방군으로 도피한 이후로는 포퓰리즘적인 어필과 이상주의적인 허울로 스스로의 영향력을 넓힌 사람으로 봅니다.\n\n안드레이 블라소프와 가장 가까운 사람들 중 하나이자 그의 가장 열렬한 지지자 중 하나로서, 지코프는 장군의 호의를 사 블라소프의 죽음 이후 해방군의 권력을 노려볼 수 있게 되었습니다. 그가 어떤 신념을 가지고 있던, 그 신념은 그의 선동적인 주장을 거부하는 보수파들의 망치와 그가 진 반역자라는 짐의 모루 사이에서 버텨내야 할 것입니다."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_DESC: "세르게이 쿠즈미치 부냐첸코만큼 러시아 해방 운동에 기여한 사람은 몇 없습니다. 16살일 때부터 붉은 군대의 병사였던 그는, 러시아 내전과 제 2차 세계대전 양쪽에서 다른 누구보다도 많은 전선과 전투에서 싸웠습니다. 그는 카프카스 지역의 사령관 자리에 올랐지만, 전세를 바꾸는 데에 어려움을 겪었습니다. 저 멀리 본토에서는, 부하린의 정권은 그를 붉은 군대의 실패를 덮어씌울 완벽한 희생양으로 보았습니다, 설령 소비에트 연방이 스스로를 방어하는 데 완전히 실패한 것은 그의 책임이 아니었다 해도 말입니다. 그로부터 머지 않아, 용맹한 역습 작전의 도중에, 그의 부대는 포위되었으며 그는 사로잡히게 되었습니다.\n\n부냐첸코는 악명 높은 서러시아 전쟁까지 사회에서 분리되어 유형지에서 형을 살았습니다. 바로 그때, 그는 서러혁전에 맞선 싸움에 참전해 그가 그토록 증오했던 공산주의자들에게 복수할 기회를 제안받았습니다. 그는 블라소프와 러시아 해방군의 편에 서서 용맹히 싸웠습니다, 해방군이 사마라에서 군벌 국가로 자리잡게 될 때까지 말입니다. 그곳에서, 그는 지역을 통치하고 제대로 된 군대를 길러내는 데에 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 이로 인해 그는 정부 내에서 높은 자리를 차지할 수 있었으며, 마침내 국방부 장관에까지 오르게 되었습니다.\n\n블라소프의 죽음 이후, 부냐첸코는 사마라의 권력을 거머쥐는 데에 성공했습니다. 군국주의자인 부냐첸코는 공산주의자들을, 그리고 서쪽의 독일인들 역시 처리하기 전까지 멈추지 않을 것입니다. KONR의 수반으로서, 그는 자신의 이익을 위해 이를 사용하는 데 거리낌이 없습니다. 그렇지만, 그가 평의회가 비효율적인 기관이라 느낀다면, 그는 권력을 회수해 가는 데에도 거리낌이 없을 것입니다."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_70S_DESC: "Sergey Kuzmich Bunyachenko's life has been one of war without end. Having done the impossible and secured all of Russia under his control, Bunyachenko now fights a final, terrible struggle: the battle for legacy.\n\nUnder his watch an ordered society has taken shape within Russia. For many, president Bunyachenko is the lawgiver, the man who has given them homes, given their children schools, given their elderly parents pensions. His most loyal supporters are found within the ROA, the once despised German organized militia Bunyachenko found himself helping to lead during the West Russian War. For the ROA veterans Bunyachenko has brought them respect, purpose, and the dream of going home, of going west.\n\nFor many, this legacy of hope and progress rests precariously on a bed of lies, blood and ashes. Thousands of people once aligned with communist factions have disappeared. They are joined each week by dozens of those who agitate for worker's rights, for democracy, for accountability by a government and president who sees the population as naught but cogs within a military-industrial complex gone out of control. His harshest critics mock the former German dog as having replicated Moskowien's unfree society, at a much larger scale.\n\nSergey Bunyachenko fights for legacy. He dreams of washing the sins of his past, of being remembered as one of Russia's greatest patriots instead of as one of its greatest traitors. Yet as the weight of years grows on his shoulders, the military president increasingly fears that no man can be truly free from the crimes of the past. No matter what, however, Bunyachenko stands tall. He will face his fate heads on, fighting for his legacy until the very end."
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_OKTAN_DESC: "Charitably described as a 'complete bastard', Mikhail Alexandrovich Ilinich's ascendancy to the position of Chairman of the KONR marks the beginning of a new and dark chapter in Russia's story. Known by his pseudonym Oktan, he's cynical, manipulative and professing a slavish loyalty to the Reich, it is no surprise that he found his calling in managing the unruly Russians on behalf of his masters - first as a newspaper editor and self-proclaimed governor, then as chief propagandist of the KONR. Under his supervision, propaganda efforts after the West Russian War were ramped up tenfold, reeling in thousands of fervently anti-Bolshevik followers while driving out those loyal to a feeble, 'free' vision of Russia.\n\nFew would have foreseen his sudden rise to power, however. Once, Oktan was known as little more than a vicious, treasonous, anti-semitic drunk. Even in the early days, Oktan despised Vlasov for his softness and lack of radicalism, alienating the would-be dictator from his colleagues. His snivelling appeasement of the Germans and desperation to enter the ranks of the Russian Liberation Army's leadership ensured that when he finally began to climb the ranks, he faced staunch opposition from the camps of Zykov and Bunyachenko. His rivals spared no effort informing the people of his cowardice, laziness and lecherous conduct, but that effort came to naught.\n\nNow, they say nothing. Those who dare to whisper of Oktan's disloyalty to the Smolensk Declaration and the principles of the KONR soon find themselves arrested to face 're-education' - or worse. Having learned much from his past friendship with the Gestapo, Oktan has proven merciless and brutal in the suppression of his opposition and unwillingness to compromise on anything that might jeopardize his absolute rule. As a man who once enjoyed the full confidence of the Germans, there is no telling what horrors Oktan's rule might have in store for the people of Russia."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_POLYAKOV_DESC: "Much like his colleague to the northwest, Viktor Nikolayevich Polyakov was a simple factory director before power was thrust upon him. Born in Siberia, he found himself in the right - or wrong - spot at the right time to be sent as an industrial advisor of a rapidly collapsing WRRF to the city of Samara on the banks of the Volga, and for the next few years, that was where he operated. Polyakov rose fast in the vehicle industry, even competing against Katushev in the same market.\n\nIn the end, that profession was what made him well known in the city, and when the time came, got him elected as the leader of the local People's Assembly and mayor of Samara. Polyakov now balances a life of economics and governing a primitive and fragile democracy in accord with North Russia's wishes.\n\nWhile ruling as a warlord can be hard for someone with little experience in that regard, Polyakov knows to turn to the fellow magnate in Nizhny Novgorod when things really get tough."

 SAM_The_Committee_Prevails_desc: "Amid a significant amount of political turmoil among Samara's elite, the committee of officers responsible for making all of our statelet's important decisions has decided its successor. Even with Zykov advocating his idealistic \"democracy\" and General Oktan promoting the worst kinds of corruption, the committee has thankfully chosen the rational path and nominated Sergey Bunyachenko as the new head of the ROA.\n\nGeneral Bunyachenko is competent and disciplined, perfect for the continuation of the ROA's mission. His first task: to restore stability to our fractured political situation, remind the various officers who really is in charge, and begin shaping the ROA into a force capable of governing."
 SAM_Work_with_Zykov: "지코프와의 동업"
 SAM_Work_with_Zykov_desc: "Although we all accept the leadership of General Vlasov, the ROA has substantial internal factions, each with its own idea of how best to run Samara. General Bunyachenko, for instance, is a fairly standard advocate of a single-party right wing state. Zykov, on the other hand, has far more peculiar opinions. Zykov is an unabashed liberal who campaigns relentlessly for greater democratization. The fact that he had to collaborate with the Third Reich to do so does not seem to faze him.\n\nAlthough we see eye to eye on very few issues, our faction and his do have the capacity to reconcile. Zykov's supporters, more than anything, desire at least surface-level improvements in the common people's situation. If we can achieve the veneer of progress, we may be able to form a mutually beneficial relationship."
 SAM_Nominate_Him: "지코프 임명"
 SAM_Nominate_Him_desc: "Miletiy Zykov is an impressively principled advocate of democracy. His soaring speeches and firm convictions make him one of our greatest assets in terms of propaganda, performing sorely needed work to rectify the Russian people's perception of the ROA as traitors and assets of the Reich. He is also a snake who should not be trusted with any position of power, lest he steer our army towards his mad dreams of liberalism.\n\nNevertheless, snakes have their uses. Zykov's way with words makes him the only major politician in Samara with any form of public support. Giving him a prestigious yet powerless sinecure will show the people that we have their best interests in mind, or at least convince them that we do."

 SAM_Celebrate_Vlasov_desc: "Ah, the great General Vlasov--what an underappreciated man! He defected from the criminal Red Army and brilliantly played the Reich in order to gain the leverage to liberate Samara from the Bolshevik scourge. Now he benevolently leads the ROA, preparing to one day liberate Russia from communism once and for all! Unfortunately, the vast majority of Samara's population does not quite see the situation this way. Most believe him to be a German toady and a traitor to the nation.\n\nIf we are to gain any sort of legitimacy, we need to combat the false narratives about our leader and founder. With the help of Zykov and his propagandists, we can tell the Russian people that Vlasov is a hero worthy of respect. In time, they may even believe us."

 SAM_First_Among_Equals_desc: "The officers' committee that runs Samara is a democratic institution of ROA generals committed to managing the liberation of Russia. However, as in any organization, certain figures are likely to become disproportionately prominent. General Vlasov, of course, is our most respected leader, owing to his heroism in fighting the Soviets. However, General Bunyachenko has himself rapidly risen in importance following his election by the committee.\n\nTo the uneducated masses, this might appear to be evidence that Samara is a military dictatorship, where power is consolidated in the hands of one man. This is naturally a misconception, but one that needs to be corrected to increase trust in our government. Bunyachenko is merely the first among equals, obeyed out of admiration rather than fear. At least, not yet."
 SAM_Demote_Maltsev: "옥탄 강등"
 SAM_Demote_Maltsev_desc: "The generals of the ROA are loathed by many Russians as traitors and collaborators, and none more so than Mikhail Oktan. Oktan embodies every negative characterization of our organization; he is corrupt, sleazy, greedy, and infamously close to the Germans. Overall, a man of shockingly little moral fiber. He drags Samara down with every day he spends in its senior ranks, but is disconcertingly influential among some less scrupulous officers.\n\nNeutralizing Oktan as a powerful player in the ROA's politics is a necessity in order to limit the corrosive influence he has on our discipline and popularity. A demotion should do wonders to cut him down to size, as well as showing the skeptical populace that we are capable of dealing with bad actors within our hierarchy."

 SAM_Sideline_the_Germans_desc: "Out of all the brands and slanderous titles that have been applied to Vlasov and the ROA, none have been more devastating than the accusations that we are German-backed traitors to the motherland. Also quite devastating is the fact that they are entirely true. In order to strike out against the Bolsheviks, General Vlasov made a tactical alliance with the Third Reich. Inconveniently, many German advisors sent over during this period are still present and fairly visible.\n\nThe advisors have been far more trouble than they are worth. We have all the weapons we need, and the Reich is not exactly a reliable partner. In the long run, erasing all remnants of our collaboration with Germany will redeem us in the eyes of the Russian people, and our legitimacy as a nation is far more important than our reputation in the eyes of a country that seeks to keep Russia weak and divided."

However, with the unfortunate collapse of the country, they believe they have a chance to rise again. We must prove them that this is their greatest mistake. They are our neighbor, and so it shall be easy for the great Russian Liberation Army to march on and crush any hopeless resistance they offer.

We will start by integrating the populations living in these lands, whether they be Russians or Tatars. They shall all become loyal to their new overlords, whether that is through education, propaganda, pressure or violence. Furthermore, the small Tatar economy and industry needs to be integrated into Samara, and its factories need to be working for the Russian Liberation Army. We must make Kazan and its surrounding region integral parts of our state."

 SAM_Earn_Their_Loyalty_desc: "The truth is that we never hated the Tatar people. As long as they are loyal to the true Russian government, and do not follow a separatist warlord ruling over their lands, we can tolerate them living within our country. For that reason, Chairman Vlasov has proposed a plan that will allow them to both rebuild and gain their loyalty to Samara. Should it succeed, the problems presented to us by the north will end.\n\nFirstly, communities in Tatarstan shall be generously provided funds and subsidies, which will be used for many purposes. That can be rebuilding the towns ravaged by the endless German bombings, or creating new buildings and factories. Although it could be considered a waste of our budget, this will make the Tatars support the new government and will reduce the chances for any unrest."

The city is rich in industry, being well-known not only for its famous tank factories that fuel their war effort, but for other production facilities as well. It has become quite clear to the Committee that in our road to Russian unification, they are the next target, and their industry must become ours. For that reason, a new military build-up must begin, in order for us to be ready to face the armored units of Gorky and defeat them with ease. Soon, they shall fall too."
 SAM_Anti_Armor_Tactics: "대기갑 전술"
 SAM_Anti_Armor_Tactics_desc: "If there is one thing the warlords of Gorky are known for, it is their tanks. Sitting on top of one of the largest tank factories in Russia and with enough resources to operate it, they have managed to create a fleet of armoured fighting vehicles that are quite capable on the battlefield. To combat this problem that could hamper our efforts in conquering the city, the Russian Liberation Army must be prepared for this style of combat. Anti-tank equipment shall be built in our factories and distributed to our troops, while the soldiers will be trained in tactics against armoured forces through regular military exercises. Therefore, when we attack the armoured hordes, we will be more than ready."

 SAM_Grind_Gorki_Into_Dust_desc: "The time has come for yet another proud expansion of the territories held by the true government of Russia. The tank armies of Gorky shall be crushed under the weight of the Russian Liberation Army, and the city shall fall to us. We will raid, loot and pillage everything in our way, and we will only stop when every last soldier of the armoured hordes has surrendered or died. In the end, no resistance shall remain to fight the ROA, and we shall reign supreme over the territories across the German frontier. Yet another step towards the reunification of Russia will have been completed."
 SAM_Exile_Their_Leaders: "아베린 추방"
 SAM_Exile_Their_Leaders_desc: "So as to assure the loyalty of the citizens of Gorky, no matter their ideology, to Samara, we must follow a simple trick: make the leaders of the opposition disappear. Should former members of the warlord government and resistance leaders vanish from the political stage, there will be no unifying figures to rally around, and the people of Gorky will have no choice but to be loyal to us, seeing as the alternate options are gone. Hence, all the former leaders, from Averin to political ideologues to top members of the bureaucracy will be forced to leave their lands, and shall be exiled somewhere where they cannot threaten our strong grip over Gorky."
 SAM_Offer_the_Loot: "전리품 제공"
 SAM_Offer_the_Loot_desc: "The conquest of Gorky has given us new lands we can exploit. Still, administering these new territories has proven to be difficult, and often partisans and resistance movements appear and dare to resist the government of the KONR. To solve this problem, we have decided to practice indirect rule.\n\nWe will allocate and distribute the lands to our own commanders and officers of the ROA. They shall be granted territory to live, cultivate, and make a profit out of, while helping keep tight control over it. Of course, more prestigious generals will have the opportunity to be granted more lands, especially if they helped in bringing down the warlord state of Gorky itself. With this plan, we might just solve the problem of unrest and instability in the towns and countryside around the city of Gorky."
 SAM_The_Lying_Monarch: "The Lying Monarch"
 SAM_The_Lying_Monarch_desc: "Now that we have conquered Russian lands to the north, we have come across a warlord state centered around Vyatka, strictly adhering to reactionary beliefs under Tsar Vladimir. Still, despite the strong anti-communist sentiment we both share, our ideologies are strictly opposed.\n\nThere was more than one reason that five decades ago, the Tsar fell, never to return; the incompetency, corruption, and above all the ignorance of the will of the people meant the end of the centuries old regime, by the people themselves. Following the legacy of the February Revolution, we must take steps of our own to bring down the die-hard supporters of the Tsar. The only true Russian government is that of our own Committee."
 SAM_A_New_Revolution: "새로운 혁명"
 SAM_A_New_Revolution_desc: "Just like in 1917, the people have come together to end the despot rule of the Tsar. Under the banner of Samara and the Committee, we will march onwards and destroy any forces the Tsar has to offer. Still, with the support of the people against the autocratic tyrant, it should not be hard for the ROA to swiftly conquer the lands under Vladimir and bring them under their full control. Vyatka shall crumble, another domino falling in West Russia, soon before the truly hardest battles begin."
 SAM_Recruit_White_Officers: "백계 장교 영입"
 SAM_Recruit_White_Officers_desc: "While the officers that led the Imperial Army under Vladimir from its foundation in the West Russian War until its final demise with our conquest were supportive of the Tsar, their ideological views are vaguely aligned with the Committee's. Being opposed to communism and ready to fight for the Russian cause, it would be a shame for such talents to be wasted because of small differences in beliefs. For that reason, our army will attempt to find and recruit as many of these generals as they can, for them to join in the common goal of destroying communism and uniting Russia."
 SAM_Put_the_Czar_on_Trial: "차르를 재판장으로"
 SAM_Put_the_Czar_on_Trial_desc: "The Tsar never intended to work for the people. All he had ever cared about was his own power, and he made sure to establish an autocratic and purely self-serving system in his fiefdom in Vyatka. However, now, what little control he had over a part of the country has ended, as the glorious Russian Liberation Army has destroyed the Tsarists. For that reason, he must be held accountable for his crimes against the people of Russia: a trial will be held, for our courts to decide what the fate of this man shall be. Once a decision has been made, he will have to pay the price for going against the nation and his insane ideological inclinations, and the government of Samara will ensure that."
 SAM_Vologda_Will_be_Ours: "볼로그다는 우리 것이 되리라"
 SAM_Vologda_Will_be_Ours_desc: "A long time ago, General Ivanov had taken the forces he commanded, and declared the area around the city of Vologda a \"neutral zone\", wishing for neither German or West Russian troops to march on the land. The truth is, though, that as much as this effort might seem noble and courageous, Ivanov has merely set up a warlord state for himself and his clique, just as that has happened in many other areas across Russia. As they are nothing but a hurdle in our struggle to unify a country torn apart by war and chaos, they must be invaded and crushed at all costs.\n\nFor that reason, the experienced army of Samara must prepare for a full invasion of the territories under Ivanov's army. We are in a good position to invade from the south, and with our industry, equipment and manpower, we will surely be able to crush any resistance that Vologda has to offer."
 SAM_Infantry_Assault_Tactics: "보병 공격 전술"
 SAM_Infantry_Assault_Tactics_desc: "Our wars against the numerous warlords of Russia have provided us, aside from valuable territory and resources, important lessons in the battlefield. We have fought many battles in the fields and forests of West Russia, and our generals will have certainly noticed mistakes in our tactics and what we can do to improve them.\n\nTherefore, Chairman Vlasov will contact the commanders of the army to discuss possible ways to improve our troops' combat skills and tactics. Then, new programs shall begin for the military to learn and master the new ways of the Russian Liberation Army. Should this succeed, we will have a much better shot at continuing the war for the reunification of Russia."
 SAM_Neutral_no_Longer: "Neutral no Longer"
 SAM_Neutral_no_Longer_desc: "With our army prepared, the time to strike has come. The warlord state of Vologda will be attacked by the full force that Samara has to offer. Our troops and tanks have proven quite effective so far, and they will continue their advance to liberate Russian territory. Some might cry out for us to respect the territory's neutrality, yet such neutrality can't exist when talking of rightful Russian lands.\n\nIn fact, the small city-state of Kostroma, protected by its despotic allies surrounding it, shall not be spared either. Being full of wealth and Russian citizens, we will enter that city as well when their protectors are gone for good. These two threats to us must be neutralized, before we move to fight a bigger foe, the West Russian Revolutionary Front."
 SAM_Silence_Their_Voices: "Silence Their Voices"
 SAM_Silence_Their_Voices_desc: "With the territories formerly belonging to Vologda and Kostroma liberated, we must find a way to effectively govern and pacify the lands we have conquered. The solution for this has been provided by some of our high-ranking officials and commanders and has been already tested in other areas we have integrated. It is to give the land to them.\n\nThe government will distribute these unstable yet fertile and rich lands to officers and generals of the army, who will be responsible for pacifying these areas by force and will have some profit out of them. With this approach, everyone will be satisfied: our government will stabilize these territories, our army will be earning profit and have their own land to grow and settle, and the people there will live without fearing of instability, raids and attacks. We will all be happy, and any voices of discontent will be baseless, or so it will seem."
 SAM_Seize_the_Wealth: "Seize the Wealth"
 SAM_Seize_the_Wealth_desc: "Before the Russian Liberation Army arrived, Kostroma was well-known for its neutrality. The city-state was stable, and focused on trade, not only with Vologda and other Russian warlords, but even with Reichskommissariat Moskowien itself. This had a profound effect on the town, as earnings from trade came there, which allowed Kostroma to become rich and somewhat developed.\n\nNow that it has come under our control, we must use this to its full potential, and thus, we will ensure that all of its wealth is confiscated and put to use for our own purposes. This could be a boost for the government in Samara, which will use it to improve the economy and develop the country as it heads for reunification."
 SAM_Mopping_up_the_Rest: "Mopping Up the Rest"
 SAM_Mopping_up_the_Rest_desc: "Before making our deadly strike against the West Russian Revolutionary Front, it would be useful to have a good base to strike from as well as additional resources and support in this large war. West Russia, despite all our attempts, is still home to several warlord states that refuse to bow down to our authority, usually adhering to insane ideologies and leaders. Whether that is the monarchists of Vyakta, the theocrats of Gayny, the Bashkir nationalists or anyone else, these forces will all have to be defeated and subjugated to ensure we have better chances against the WRRF. When that is done, then the communists to the north will be the only hurdle stopping us from achieving dominance in West Russia."
 SAM_Destroy_the_Muslim_Tatars: "Blot Out the Bashkirs"
 SAM_Destroy_the_Muslim_Tatars_desc: "A part of the Idel-Ural region, the region of Bashkiria is home to many Bashkirs, a Turkic ethnic group. Even though they were conquered by the Russian Tsardom centuries ago, they would continue advocating for their independence and participated in many revolts. After Bukharin's Soviet Union collapsed, it was a perfect opportunity for them to rise up and form an \"Islamic Republic\". Still, no matter what those Islamist fanatics may think, Bashkiria is nothing more than an integral part of the Russian state, and the ethnic Russians living there must be liberated from their oppression. It should be a rather easy and quick job for the Russian Liberation Army, and so any Bashkir nationalists will be crushed."

 SAM_ROA_Imans_desc: "Our nation will gladly integrate the Bashkirs of the area we recently conquered, as long as they are eager to cooperate. To convince them to do so, we will contact the Imams who are loyal to the KONR and our cause. Being closer to the liberated Bashkirs than we could ever be, they will become their figureheads. Under the leadership of the wise Imams, they will be guided to follow the views and ideology of the Chairman and the Committee for a united and indivisible Russia."

 SAM_Wipe_out_the_Fractured_State_desc: "Beyond the frontier of the West Russian Revolutionary Front rests a state that boasts for its democracy, and it is Komi. However, it seems that day by day the nation is becoming more chaotic. Being democratic and a safe haven for all ideologues and radicals, the country has become a battlefield between several groups and movements, from monarchists to communists and from fascists to liberals. Even the experts of our own government struggle to understand the complex system and delicate balance of power that keep the country alive. For that reason, we will make things simpler for them by invading, and taking back these lands. If anything, the citizens of Komi will be grateful that we have brought unexpected stability to the area."
 SAM_Incorporating_Komi: "Incorporating Komi"
 SAM_Incorporating_Komi_desc: "Komi has fallen, and with it, the endless power struggle that dominated its politics did as well. All that is left for us to do before we continue our expansion is to ensure its smooth transition from a chaotic republic to a province of the Russian state. Aside from the usual method of giving away land to our own generals of the Russian Liberation Army, we will also have to find locals eager to cooperate and align with our goals.\n\nBeing an extremely diverse state politically, it is practically guaranteed we find people and groups who will support the KONR and could act as local leaders and figureheads. Maybe even some who were hesitant to support us at first will see our success and will join, to see Russia rise again. With their help, Komi's endless instability and clashes will end."
 SAM_Frag_the_Fanatical_Monks: "Frag the Fanatical Monks"
 SAM_Frag_the_Fanatical_Monks_desc: "The government of Samara supports Christianity and Orthodoxy as the true religions of the Russian nation, as that has been the case for centuries. While Orthodoxy should play a role in the lives of our people, that role isn't in the form of a fanatical, theocratic warlord state in the fringes of West Russia that is a threat to the Committee's authority. Therefore, as we continue the reclamation of our lands, the clique of monks in Gayny that have embraced theocracy will have to fall.\n\nIt should not be too difficult for our strong and proud army to simply march in and seize the area. After all, what resistance could the monks hope to offer against the rising power that is the KONR?"

 SAM_Redirecting_Their_Anger_desc: "While we may have conquered their lands, the supporters of the former regime in Gayny still roam the area. However, some in the Committee have proposed that we could use this to our advantage. In reality, it is more than likely that these priests turned to these radical beliefs with the invasion and collapse of the country. Being mad at the state of Russia, they coalesced around a leader, Grandmaster Mikhail, and formed their own warlord state.\n\nNow, we could use the fact they are supporters of the old order and Christianity to gain their support against the godless communists we are trying to defeat. Their anger will be vented through the struggle against the WRRF, and any other opponent we find on the way to Russian unification. That way, those who used to be our enemies could become allies against the common threat, the threat against our government."
 SAM_Silence_the_Syncretists: "Silence the Syncretists"
 SAM_Silence_the_Syncretists_desc: "Born out of radical elements of the Russian émigré movement, the Mladorossi movement adopted an absolutely insane stance, never seen before in politics: they believed the Tsar and the Soviets could exist together, peacefully and harmoniously. Of course, not only is this unlikely to ever happen, but both systems have also lead to the demise of the nation. Every Tsar further weakened Russia, only for it to fall under the communist jackboot in 1917. The Bolsheviks themselves also took care to destroy Russia forever, by succumbing to the Germans and making the rest chaotic wastelands.\n\nIt is our duty to fix this damage, and so the charlatan Alexander Kazembek and his clique of equally ridiculous supporters must fall. Berezniki will be invaded and crushed, and the Mladorossi movement will be buried, never to be heard of again."
 SAM_Imprison_the_Syncretists: "믈라도로시 투옥"
 SAM_Imprison_the_Syncretists_desc: "Now that Berezniki has come under the fold of the KONR, we must secure our control over it and end the ideological abomination that is Kazembek's Mladorossi movement. Our army and our police units will search these areas thoroughly to find and arrest every single politician and citizen sympathetic to the syncretists, for the support of the movement to be completely eradicated and to not have to worry about it again. Not only is it a failed system, but it goes against the beliefs and ideals of our own government.\n\nFurthermore, we will use the system we have tried and tested several times to govern the region with stability. The land we have conquered will be seized and redistributed to the officers of the Russian Liberation Army, who from that point will be responsible for keeping this land under their control and using it for their own purposes. This has already worked perfectly in other areas, so it should bring a sense of stability in Berezniki as well."

 SAM_Neutralize_the_Nazis_desc: "Germany and the National Socialist regime ruling over it have become hated by everyone still free in Russia, and even we are reluctant to cooperate with them. However, there is one warlord state that, for inexplicable reasons, has embraced Nazi ideology beyond normal limits. The warlord of Perm, named \"Gutrum Vagner,\" has formed the \"Aryan Brotherhood,\" a group which believes that Russians are part of the Aryan race as well, and wish to collaborate with Germany.\n\nOf course, the Reich likely wouldn't want to cooperate with the \"untermenschen\", nor would it know of the Brotherhood's existence. To preserve the glory of our country, we must cleanse Perm of these insane radicals, and establish total and direct control over the area."

 SAM_Get_Rid_of_the_German_Lovers_desc: "As expected, our armies have reigned victorious over the Aryan Brotherhood, and are working hard to pacify the region. Of course, we will make sure to comb the population of the area for any members and supporters of the Brotherhood, since the last thing we would want is for their absurd ideology to make a return. Additionally, we will follow the strategies we have implemented in other recently liberated lands. That means we will have to win the hearts and minds of the local population, as well as integrate the small economy and industry of Perm into our own. Of course, to accelerate the integration effort, we will distribute the land to army officers that will help us in our endeavour."

 SAM_An_Old_Score_to_Settle_desc: "When the Germans invaded and the Soviet Union collapsed in the face of the massive Wehrmacht, the Committee hoped that the communist system which had governed the country for over two decades would be gone forever. That hope was crushed with the emergence of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, which re-emerged as the leading communist resistance force. Despite the severe hit it took in the West Russian War, it still lives on in Arkhangelsk and the large nearby area. Having conquered large swaths of territory to the south of them, we must finish the job and invade the bastion of socialism which we have fought against for so long, finally ending the reign of terror socialism brought in Russia."

It is a logical assumption to make, and when the time comes for us to fight the WRRF, we must be prepared to face a bitterly cold climate that could make the job easier for the defender. For that reason, it would be prudent for the ROA to prepare itself for winter combat, starting with the production of specific equipment. This equipment will make combat even in the most extreme environments easier for our soldiers, and could significantly help our effort to defeat the WRRF once and for all."

Now, isolated in a corner of Northwest Russia, they could barely be considered a formidable opponent, especially against the strong forces of the Committee of National Liberation. In our quest to end communist tyranny over our lands, we must face a large enemy, yet not an invincible one. Should we make our moves carefully, and win both the wars on the battlefield and the support of the people, victory will be inevitable. And with that victory, West Russia will be ours. Thus, we must call the people and the soldiers to fight for the motherland, until the true Russian flag waves above Arkhangelsk!"

However, to ensure that these lands are properly governed and integrated into the Samara government, some measures similar to the ones we have already adopted will have to be carried out, albeit on a much larger scale. Firstly, we will have to root out any possible communist leaders and officers for the sake of safety and stability. Once that has been done, we will replicate the practice of distributing land to officers across the conquered territories of Northwest Russia. With their support, the army will begin intense counter-insurgency operations there, in order to pacify these areas from dangerous communist remnants and other bandits or partisans.\n\nThis will have to be done, if we ever want to see West Russia under our direct control and continue our battles against enemies of the nation."

Many enterprises and organizations in the WRRF's economy were actually owned by the government itself, which had created a state-planned economy. Of course, we are strongly opposed to such practices, and so this must be completely changed. All these enterprises, by decree of the government, shall be privatized, to support their integration into the West Russian economy. Of course, for their help in defeating the communists, many of our officers will be granted some of these businesses, to ensure their interests are aligned with the government's."

There is no greater example of this than the perfidious Finns. Not only did they steal all of Karelia for themselves but they carved out the statelet of Onega to shield themselves from any Russian nation that sought to retake its rightful territory. We will not allow this betrayal to stand. We will restore the border of 1936 by any means necessary.

The warlord era has ended, and in its place has arrived a victorious Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia.\n\nWe stretch from Samara to Arkhangelsk, and have asserted our full and direct control over these lands. Now, the world will finally begin to see the KONR for what it truly is: the true Russian government.

However, there is hope. The Reich has fallen into chaos and disarray, and the Luftwaffe has more urgent business to do than target practice on Russian villages. Now, it is time to rebuild the city, and all our territories as well. Houses, factories and infrastructure like roads will be repaired or built, to serve the people of Samara. Hopefully, this will show the people how much the KONR cares for them and what they do for them. Popular support is, after all, a key to keeping control."

With less spent on unnecessary bureaucratic expenditures, we can focus on new projects, from roads, to industry, to radar defences.\n\nWe have seen the results of a strong bureaucracy; that is a nation that slowly strangles itself from the inside.

Do we wish a strong Samara? One capable of creating a strong Russia? Then this all must change.\n\nWe will embark on an ambitious road-building campaign.

We will provide to them funding, laborers, areas to open new factories, and lucrative deals that will encourage them to produce for us. In addition we will ensure that no one company gains a monopoly by encouraging strong but healthy competition between these forces.

In the modern age of lightning warfare leg infantry has been made obsolete and we must understand such. If we wish to see our flag fly from the capital of a free Russia, the first step is modernizing our army.\n\nWe shall contract out to various Samaran automobile factories orders of hundreds of trucks and jeeps to equip our many infantry divisions for the fight that is surely soon to come. By contracting to multiple factories we can hope that they will compete to create more efficient vehicles, and the one that shows it can produce motorized equipment at the highest capacity and quality will receive the most funding from the Samaran government.

Instead, we must prepare for the worst while hoping for the best for all the Russian people.\n\nUsing slightly antiquated radar technology \"bought\" from a German base in the RK Moskowien and then duplicated in Samara, we will set up radar stations across our borders at key military installations to keep a careful watch over our people and their safety.

Now that we have the industry to keep our troops supplied with the basics of equipment, such as rifles and ammunition, some of our regional commanders have turned their production to heavier guns.

Obviously, we cannot tolerate having an island of steppe savagery in the midst of a rebuilt Russia.\n\nA quick invasion, supported by ethnic Russians within the region, should allow us to regain control over Kazan and its environs.

 SAM_Restrict_Tatar_Rights_desc: "Despite our annihilation of the Tatar state, its people are not content to know their place. KONR administrators sent to what was once Tatarstan have received extreme amounts of opposition from the locals, to the point where several have been lynched and strung up as a warning not to interfere further. This situation is obviously intolerable, and there is only one way to deal with it: smashing the power of these troublesome anti-Russian minorities.\n\nWe will teach the Tatars a lesson by taking away all of the power they have on their own soil. Mandatory IDs will be issued, assembly will be banned, and the disease that is Tatar culture will be expunged wherever it is seen in favor of that of their betters. If the unrest continues, we will implement far less lenient measures. We are a country made by Russians, for Russians, of Russians. There is no room for anything else, even in this so-called \"homeland\"."

 SAM_Send_in_Russian_Settlers_desc: "Our efforts to repress the Tatar people have so far failed to disperse their resistance. Although Russianization initially seemed very successful, they continue to practice their culture in secret, and they still resist the KONR in pockets scattered around former Tatarstan. It is clear that we have not been nearly hard enough on them.\n\nLuckily, we can look to the Germans for one of their best ideas on minority unrest. If the Tatars don't like being here so much, we'll give them a one-way ticket out of our land and give their possessions to Russians who can much better appreciate what we do for them. Soon, Tatarstan will be to Russia what Ostland is to Germany. Long ago, Ivan the Terrible took Kazan for the Russians, and now we follow proudly in his footsteps."

Their rags long soaked black by oil, these red bandits plunder Russian territories both within and without RK Moskowien. Now that the overstretched Luftwaffe has stopped threatening them, their armored brigades roam ever further away from their base of operation.\n\nWe cannot let these over equipped bandits threaten our flanks as we expand north. Nor can we risk their equipment falling into the hands of our opponents. These mad tankers must be stopped in their tracks."

Many local women and men not of fighting age made a living by helping the young tankers on their raiding expeditions.\n\nIt would be a shame to let these mechanics squander their hard earned skills. We have a great need of specialists to maintain our own fleet of armored vehicle, and uneducated peasant cannot be trusted to maintain these vital weapons. Gorky's men and women will be encouraged to serve us voluntarily, of course. Any technician that refuses will be conscripted and given half pay, their family kept as hostages to ensure cooperation."

A lot of old Soviet vehicles, scavenged German armor and slapdash creations of Gorky's workshops are not worth integrating into our army. The best way to make use of these acquisitions is to strip everything of value off these vehicles and reuse them for our purposes. Machine guns can be given to our infantry, tank cannons can be reused as direct fire artillery pieces, and armor plates can be salvaged to repair our own vehicles."

We can not say the same, however, about the people of Vologda, which has been a self-proclaimed \"neutral zone\" since the West Russian War. Since then it has been peaceful and prosperous, at least by Russian standards, as well as a regional trade hub. Its riches make Vologda a fine addition to any empire, and, although it is guarded by Red Army remnants, should be easy to annex considering a total lack of foreign support.\n\nThe Vologdans believe that they can live in safety by appeasing both the Reich and the warlords. Let us show them how utterly wrong they are."

Having started out their career as communists, by definition opponents to all that is good about Russia, the men of Vologda abandoned the WRRF after the fifties war ended. No amount of whining by their former subjects about \"a fair government\" and \"loyal Russian patriots\" can redeem these vipers.\n\nA set of military tribunals and executions shall process every former Vologda leader.

This free trading capitalism is laudable; but Kostroma's riches shall be used far better by the brave men of the ROA. Letting our boys sack the city will increase morale and show to our ever growing number of citizens that men who love their country are loved in return. What's more, Moskowien's smuggler will no longer have an alternative to trading with us, giving us a fair better share of the international trade with our western neighbors."

This does not mean that his own brand of failed regime can be allowed to fester anew throughout Russia.\n\nVyatka's laughable court must be scattered to the winds, and the Tsar must encounter his ancestors' fate. Imperial Russia failed to grow our nation into a strong and prosperous one, and its weakness allowed the reds to seize power.

The men of the Imperial guard fought hard to save their tsar, and can be proud of their bravery. Now that the Tsar is gone, an offer has been extended to the imperial guardsmen to join a new unit: the Komrchiy guard. This elite unit will help the ROA liberate Russia.

For a decade the bastards have licked their wounds in and around Arkhangelsk, scheming and plotting their comeback. The start of the Russian unification wars has brought the reds out of hiding and sent them on the warpaths. They shall not rest until all of Russia falls under their renewed domination.\n\nThe brave men of the ROA have fought the communist menace before. Our men are armed and experienced.

Fortunately, the ROA's leadership knows better. After the fifties war the northern population exploded as refugees fled with the Red Army. These willing helpers of the Front willingly remained in the frozen north to help their diabolical masters prepare a new set of wars on Russian soils.\n\nThe decommunization will be long, and harsh. But as long as a guilty red lives there can be no justice. Those who led will be executed. Those who followed them will be sent to work camps. Finally, those who merely hoped for a Communist renewal will see their assets stripped.\n\nOur men must have no mercy. Good plants are sacrificed to remove every weed from a field.

The prisoners of the Communist regime will be freed and given the opportunity to join our ranks.

The only thing that really matters about the region is its population and whatever scraps of industries Kosygin and Voznesensky have managed to build up over the years. The ROA needs it, and it needs it quickly, lest the Front takes it first.\n\nThe soldiers of Komi are used to fighting one another, and make quite the capable defensive force.

 SAM_The_Savage_Syncretists_desc: "Out of the past two regimes that ruled over Russia for an extended period, both the Tsarists and the Communists have proven weak and ineffectual. Despite this, many pathetic ideologues seek to bring back one or the other. Alexander Lvovich Kazembek, however, has proven himself more pathetic than most of Russia's lunatics and radicals, as he and his clique of \"Young Russians\" advocate a political system with traits of both. Although he rules his own fiefdom out of the city of Berezniki, Kazembek pledged allegiance to the now dealt-with Tsar in Vyatka, who was decidedly less enthusiastic about their relationship.\n\nThe Young Russians are weak and without their benefactors in Vyatka, making the invasion of Berezniki a simple task. Now that the Tsar is dead, all that remains is to mop up this moronic ideology so that monarchism will once again be confined to the dustbin of history."

Reconciling these wildly incompatible schools of thought requires a simply staggering level of cognitive dissonance that we have no interest in understanding. Now that we have crushed their armies and absorbed their territory, we will wipe the last vestiges of their foolishness from the earth. Their leadership will be dissolved along with the more devoted followers.

 SAM_The_Nutjob_Nazis_desc: "It is rare to find people in Russia who sympathize with the Third Reich. Most see the destruction of the Soviet Union as a tragedy that doomed the country rather than saving it. We are already highly unusual and unpopular for our ties to the Germans. There is, however, one faction in Russia that goes beyond pragmatic allegiance and into a bizarre, cult-like devotion. These freaks have claimed the city of Perm as their own and have tried to remodel themselves into an \"Aryan\" ideal, taking German names and practicing a facsimile of German culture.\n\nEven the mere existence of this \"Aryan Brotherhood\" gives former partners of the Reich like us a bad name. Luckily, their lunacy means that the madmen of Perm are perhaps the only people in western Russia less popular than we are. Returning sanity to the region by force will be easy, and good for public relations to boot."

 SAM_I_am_Your_Fuhrer_desc: "The Germans have been of great help to our cause, but we have always made sure to stay on the right side of the line separating respect from devotion. To say that the Aryan Brotherhood did not would be putting it mildly. The hierarchy they imposed across their territory, though based on meaningless racial pseudoscience, was not a bad idea. If they had not been led by a madman doing a poor imitation of Hitler they might have even amounted to something. Now the Brotherhood's leadership is dead or missing. Its troops, some of the most fanatical and ruthless soldiers in Russia, serve the true Kormchiy of Russia, Mikhail Oktan."

We will not let this go on any longer. The illegitimate state of Onega will be destroyed, and their Finnish puppet masters will pay for their cruelty towards the people of Russia.

From our base in Samara the ROA struck north, crushing every warlord and traitor who sought to keep Russia weak and divided. Now we rule over a massive stretch of territory and must consolidate our hold on it. From Balakovo to Naryan-Mar millions of Russians are enjoying peace and stability for the first time in decades. They owe their gratitude to Oktan and the ROA, the defenders of the Russian nation, for vanquishing the tyrants that once terrorized them and bringing stability to western Russia.

If even a single veteran wonders how he will afford his rent or pay for his next meal we have failed. Their pensions must be increased, so they do not have to work in their old age.

However, the Grand Marshal made it so that each fief given out was approximately the same size as the others.\n\nWhile this means that each one is a fair parcel of land, it also means that by necessity, there's a whole bunch of them that were parcelled out.

Thus, the Grand Marshal has gone about assigning the task of transforming the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia into a truly political party that will ultimately be a very, very long arm of Mikhail Oktan.\n\nLocal branches of the KONR will be established in towns and cities, membership will be encouraged, and the tenets of anti-Bolshevism and support of the Grand Marshal will be instilled in all those who join.

Our President has made this possible, and the ROA will make sure that the envious Germans are not able to violently bring it all down. Some may call this a propaganda campaign. How can the spreading of truth be mere propaganda?"

This does not mean that the Sphere's moneymen are perfect; in their hubris, the Japanese have failed to put checks and balance on their financial systems. This came crashing down when piles of bad debts destroyed the Yasuda Zaibatsu and started the Japanese Economic Wars.\n\nTo avoid this fate we can use our central bank as a tool of defence. Every Kombinat will be forced to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, and keep an up to date plan to deal with a market downturn. Every year or so, agents of our government will be allowed to announce a surprise inspection, to verify the stability of each firm's finances. People trying to fudge numbers will be dealt with severely.\n\nThere will be no hubris here. We've come too far to let mere greed upset the stability of Russian recovery. The Kombinats are given great powers; they will owe us great responsibility. For the good of all."

Our government has also inherited a lot of state owned enterprises from the fallen regimes of West Siberia.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and his advisers recognize the importance of maintaining government ran businesses in critical sectors, such as energy and national defence. Our government of course also realizes the importance of a free market in a free and strong Russia. Nevertheless, many of these businesses in the eastern provinces are run by people with ties to opposition groups, or by personnel with little interest in our glorious national rejuvenation. As such our bureaucrats are drafting lists of corporations that need to go. Their assets will be auctioned off; their subsidiaries acquired by various Kombinats. This will raise money for the central government, and help the growth of our business partners, all the while reducing overlap in business."

It is time to extend this policy to business men, journalists, and anyone else that controls the narrative about Russia. To aid this process we can send out our own people. Businessmen, yes, but also our youth. It is time for Russian youth to be given a chance to study abroad, to see the world that the German ogres have endeavored to deny them. They will be our ambassadors, proof that Russia endures!"

In the meantime, the political structures built by President Bunyachenko are still fragile. It is important to continue the elimination of the old officer's clique, even as we transition the ROA into the apolitical Republican Army.\n\nNo sacrifice is too great for the final war of liberation.

The first step in this process is to hold elections for the Duma in the east, ensuring that Russians on both sides of the Urals are represented in the lower house of the government. We should schedule these elections as quickly as we can, as they will legitimize our government in the eyes of many people who might otherwise resent our new rule.\n\nOf course, the Duma does not hold any real power in the government by design. We will be able to hold free and fair elections knowing that the outcome will not matter. While the people pick their candidates and believe they are participating in democracy, we will continue to steer Russia down the correct course, free of burdensome legislative restrictions and bickering politicians."

Under Vlasov's rule officers and generals held all the power, and the government was barely more than a rubber stamp for their plans. This state of affairs hampered our efforts to reclaim Russia, politicizing the army and making the government inefficient. It is the role of the military to defend the state and the role of the government to administer it. Luckily Bunyachenko's ascension saw this problem begin to end as the old generals retired from both the military and politics. We should encourage this depoliticizing trend, appointing qualified and loyal commanders who understand their job is to serve the government, not run it."

From its inception in the West Russian War to the anarchy of the warlord period to the bloody conquest of western Russia to the reclamation of western Siberia the soldiers have fought diligently for years, and we owe them our gratitude. There are more conflicts on the horizon, but before they begin our generals need time to plan and prepare.\n\nWhile the high command prepares for the next battles, we can reward those who will fight them with a vacation. Maintaining the morale of the soldiers on the ground is vital, and nothing boosts morale quite like a trip away from the barracks and the front lines. By the time the next war begins our troops will be refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to bring glory to Russia once more."

Now we are able to build a new generation of cutting edge Russian weapons that will stand with the finest products of Germany, America, and Japan. New interceptor aircraft will knock enemy planes from our skies, keeping our cities safe, while long-range missiles capable of striking anywhere on earth will force the great powers to take us seriously."

As we prepare to retake the far east of Russia and finally reunite the nation we should work to secure Japanese support for our endeavours.\n\nInviting diplomats will deepen our ties to the imperial government, while accepting Japanese businessmen will open the door to economic investment from some of the largest corporations in the world.\n\nIf all goes well, once we have reclaimed eastern Siberia there may even be further opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation."

Our domestic industries are now strong enough to stand up to foreign competition, and there is no one we would rather compete with than the Japanese. After the success of our diplomatic overtures to Tokyo, it is time to formally allow Japanese corporations to begin setting up shop in Russia.

Long, flat stretches of territory with few defensive features to shelter behind, it was a conqueror's dream. Now, as conflict with the Germans looms once more, our western provinces are under threat again. Just like last time our territory stretches for thousands of kilometers, but the majority of our industry is located within a few hundred of the enemy border. We must change this. All factories, especially those that produce military goods, capable of relocation will move east of the Urals towards central Siberia. This will place them out of reach of all but the longest range bombers, and make sure our industry remains out of enemy hands."

It seems there is no limit to what the Japanese can invent and we would be fools if we did not try to acquire some of their wondrous equipment. Our technological industry is not advanced enough to replicate these designs on our own, so we must ask for help from our new partners in the Pacific. It is quite unlikely the Japanese will be willing to give up their secrets for free of course.

 SAM.1.t: "The Old Man"
 SAM.1.d: "Vlasov's aides walked constantly to-and-fro the old man's office, the tidal nature of their movement echoing the old man's current situation. Even in these desperate times, few could stomach working directly for the traitor general himself. Those that managed to either ignore or muster indifference towards the accusations against Vlasov found themselves buried in drudgery: bored out of their wits instead of merely disgusted by the stench of treason. Better, perhaps, to pray for an assignment on the border instead where death and starvation dispelled the lethargy.\n\nVlasov stood on political quicksand, his position shifting and changing by the day but never improving. Some of his aides suspected that the old man would have preferred being genuinely hated by his generals instead of their current indifference. In the college of traitors that filled the ROA's upper echelon, Vlasov was not particularly liked, but nor was he disliked. Whatever coalition or common ground he tried to build usually disintegrated within the month.\n\nBut if the old general could not be liked by everyone, he could at least try to gin up love and hatred within specific factions. Under him Zykov's democrats constantly agitated against Oktan's war profiteers. In between, schemed the officer's committee, General Bunyachenko their puppet.\n\nVlasov had long pondered on which factions to cast his full and hollow weight behind. His remaining scraps of authority would tip the balance. Now that the time for a decision had come, the general's own aide could scarcely guess which side Vlasov would choose, nor how the ROA's future would play out as a result."

While not officially on the officer's committee, Milety Zykov had wormed his way into a comfortable office in Samara's principal headquarters. Supporters of his faction could be seen streaming in and out at various times. A few stacks of pamphlets rested on the office's varied furniture.\n\nZykov almost yanked the package from the aide's hands after his swift introduction and began leafing through it, whistling all the while. \"Interesting...interesting,\" were the propagandist's only comments. For his trouble, Vlasov's aide was given a new package. \"Bring it to your boss, alright?\" Zykov said, with characteristic cheer. Moments later, the aide found himself escorted back outside. The stream of visitors had brought even more officers to the corridor, all waiting for a chance to speak with Zykov.\n\nNone of them appeared too surprised to see one of Vlasov's own aides coming out of the office, expecting the commander to keep in touch with his own prime propagandist. Still, some looks followed him through the corridor, with Zykov's voice ringing out from behind closed doors.\n\n\"Menshikov, you handsome bastard! What's the news?\""

The room was austere, with no luxury other than a small furnace in one corner. The aide waited as the general read through a few of the sets of documents. One paper in particular gave the general pause. The aide recognized Vlasov's signature at the bottom. Bunyachenko read the letter a few times, before sternly looking up.\n\n\"Who else knows the content of this bundle of documents, soldier?\"\n\n\"Only I and Vlasov, sir.\"\n\n\"Good.

Ever genial, the General stood up to greet Vlasov's envoy with a handshake.\n\n\"Can I invite you to indulge in some tobacco? Fresh arrival from our western neighbor.\"\n\nThe aide glanced at the box of expertly rolled cigarettes. It had been so long since he'd last had a proper smoke. The thought of owing something to Oktan, however, no matter how insignificant, gave the aide some pause. Still, good tobacco was good tobacco. \"Thank you, commander.\"\n\nThe aide placed on Oktan's desk the package he had been tasked to bring, and then helped himself to a few cigarettes. Oktan smiled.\n\n\"I've heard good things about you, soldier. If you ever find yourself looking to carry out a couple of favours, please come visit me. I've no greater concern than my men's quality of life.\"\n\nA tempting offer for sure. The aide nodded again to Oktan and followed the guards back outside. One of them offered him a light.

Outside his relatives wailed as men of the ROA dragged out the unconscious body. The poor bastard was placed on a cart, his family given a few bags of food to help cushion the loss of a working age man.\n\nThe garrison's captain reviewed his troops as they continued digging out the pantry and salvaging as much of the food as possible. One recruit, a young lad from the nearby villages, looked particularly grim as he shovelled bits of concrete out into the yard.\n\n\"Why the long face, soldier? It's not the first time the Germans bomb us, yes?\"\n\nThe young man paused and saluted the officer stiffly. \"Sir, ah, hmm.\"\n\n\"Speak\"\n\n\"It's just, uh, sir, the men of the village, they said that the ROA had a deal with the Germans, uh, sir. That their bases were not bombed.\"\n\nThe officer laughed. \"Is this what they say in whatever shithole we dragged you out of? That the Germans have an ounce of mercy? That they give a shit about their old conscript army?\"\n\n\"Uh, yes, sir!\"\n\n\"Well, there's your answer.\" The officer gestured toward the collapsed building where the other soldiers were pretending to work. \"There's the answer for all of you.

Nor would the supplies be taken at gun points from terrified civilians. Requests would be put in through both official and unofficial channels for more German supplies. Ammunition, rifles, clothes, food, whatever the Reich deigned to give or sell to the ROA. Pragmatists in RK Moskowien had long accepted that having part of the long frontier with the Russian Anarchy be controlled by something other than bandits or Russian revanchist was worth its weight in gold.\n\nOf course, Oktan had to explain a share of questions and accusations from skeptical officers. Complaints that relying on official German shipments would undermine the ROA's reputation were defty addressed. Those inclined to hate the Army of National Liberation would continue to do so, while neutral Russian citizens could dismiss these rumors. Others accused Oktan of simply trying to score a big contraband take. To this the general smiled and patiently explained that his network of contracts would make the whole operation possible, and that every shipment could be audited by an independent commission if needed.\n\nIn the end the objections would not sink down the idea. It was too good a way for the conservative officers and the Zykovites to save face. Even allowing Oktan a little profiteering was deemed an acceptable price."

Other times, inhabitants of the region could be forgiven for forgetting the existence of the so-called army of liberation. There were few bandits in the area, and so the ROA's did not bother with much more than token patrols.\n\nToday, unusually, the soldiers were marching out and about. From the garrison depot on their convoy snaked through to the small hamlets, horses and men weighed down with cargo. As it turned out, the ROA's new policy of redistribution had begun.\n\nVillages in areas generally deficient in food were given rations and grain. Communities that had lost men and workers to bombing, drafting or injuries were compensated with dozens of work hours from the local garrison. In a few places, it was gleefully reported, astonished kids received candies from the quartermasters.\n\nThis calculated generosity impressed the weary villagers in its cynicism.

Each prisoner would go through a battery of psychological tests and brutal examinations, before being sorted into one of three groups. Those judged too dangerous or that would never comply to orders were executed. The next group was filled with men who despised the ROA but who were too docile to stir up trouble by themselves. These men were escorted to various work camps, where their labor would help maintain the state that kept their families safe. Of course, the laborers would be paid and fed. Good behavior might even see some of this hard earned money trickle back to their families.\n\nFinally, there were those that would do anything to earn their freedom. Joining communist or bandit groups had been for them a tremendous lapse of judgement. These men paid a punitive fine to the ROA, and were allowed to walk free. Their path out of the prison took them in front of the holding cells, where angry men of their hometown could see who had bent the knee. Back home, the freed prisoners would only find work and safety through continued submission to the ROA.\n\nPolitical prisoners were tossed in daily, but at an ever slowing pace.

He was expected by the officer committee fifteen minutes ago for a standard meeting before the announcement, but he hadn't bothered attending. The aide, one of the few allowed into the chairman's room, silently observed the old marshal. His brow was furrowed, and despite the rather chilly temperatures of the office, it seemed that his face glistened with sweat. He was intensely staring at the script, scribbled by hand onto a piece of paper - not reading it or editing it, just staring. The aide checked his watch. \"Sir, I-\" he tried to hurry the marshal along, well-familiar with the punishment he may receive for Vlasov being late of his own accord. Vlasov however put up a hand as soon as the aide spoke, silently terminating the aide's hope to get things moving. The marshal stood up, slowly, and delicately folded the piece of paper up into his pocket. \"Shall we?\" he asked the aide. \"Yes, sir.\" the aide responded.\n\nThe old marshal stood in front of his officers, some of them having been with him since the earliest days of the ROA. He looked at all of them - seeing familiar faces, but, for the first time, more than a few faces that he didn't recognize. Could they be new? Vlasov asked himself, the silence in the room deadening as all looked to him and waited. Or had he simply forgotten who they were?

His uniform was dishevelled and his eyes were bloodshot.

The web he's spun himself is far too wide; he controls too much.\" Zykov concluded, edging out any of his more hawkish supporters in their over-enthusiasm to deal with the individual.\n\n\"But that's not to say, of course, that we should merrily leave him to prepare a coup. He operates on a system that centers around his ability to buy his supporters, which means that for a certain price, almost all of them can be bought back.

We may not be able to take him out, yet, but we can whittle him down. Does all of that make sense?\"\n\nAides had been busily writing down the chairman's orders, but all nodded in unison as the chairman looked for their understanding.

And who was better to clean up Marshal Vlasov's image as a German bootlicker than Zykov, the chief 'PR' man himself?\n\nIt was a test run at first, to see how far they could get with a little bit of glorification.

Then it expanded to constant radio bombardments of the 'real' history of Vlasov's supposed 'betrayal' - which was, according to those announcements, was in reality a last ditch effort to protect the Russian people. Then, when that was done, the minor financiation of a couple of cheap plays, depicting the Great Patriotic War, with Vlasov as the tragic hero of the War that broke Russia into a thousand pieces.\n\nThen, as the people began to think that, perhaps, just maybe, they had been wrong, it was time to bring out the tears: show the faces of the men whose families were in concentration camps, their broken, shattered faces being reminded of the horrible fate that awaited them at the death camps. Then make them stare at the camera or, in the most effective cases, have them say, with no hint of sarcasm or dislike, 'Vlasov was only trying to do what was best for me and my family.'\n\nIt was a good show, Bunyachenko admitted, especially considering how Zykov found an actor that could emote so well.

And they still command significant influence.\" Another sip. \"Far better to keep discrediting them, make use of their power until we've eroded it completely.\" The grid widend. \"Then, we can crush them.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say boss. So this first assignment. An... acquaintance of ours will give me a package.\" A nod from Oktan. \"I'm to leak its content to the proper channels.\" Another nod. \"Are you sure this will not get back to commander Bunyachenko?\" Oktan' smile deepened further still. \"I'm certain of it.\""

 SAM.25.d: "Despite the selection of Oktan as Deputy-Chairman, and the ensuing morale blow to his own faction of democrats, Miletiy Zykov worked harder than ever. Of course, part of this workload was caused by his ever dwindling staff.\n\nIt felt as if every other day began with a resignation, or its silent equivalent of the staffer simply not appearing for work. Those who had appeared in front of him to hand in their resignation had been gently questioned. Most insisted they were simply retiring from politics. One or two of the honest ones explained that deputy-chairman Oktan had offered a better deal. Land, money, positions of importance, it seemed that the good deputy-chairman never ran out of agreeable rewards for those who befriended him, thought Zykov.\n\nAll this was not good, but it was not extremely bad for the moment. In a way, it was a good thing to see those not entirely dedicated to the cause just up and leave. The remaining core of Zykov's organization would be more motivated than ever to see justice and democracy be restored to Russia. Oktan's constant war on the democratic faction (as well as on the officer's committee, Zykov suspected) would not go unacknowledged however. The former journalist sighed, and picked up the phone. It was time to organize a few meetings of his own. Some of the democratic faction's best assets, after all, did not operate in the light, either."

 SAM.26.d: "Commander Bunyachenko's usual dour expression did not seem to account the luxurious location in which he now sat. A few tasteful paintings hung on the walls of Oktan's office. Deputy-Chairman Oktan returned from the wood and crystal cabinet, holding a bottle of Georgian cognac and two glasses. The dour military officer did not offer any thanks upon being served a glass. He did, to his host's surprise, offer a toast. \"To Russia. \"To Russia!\" Replied Oktan.\n\nBoth men were barely seated when Commander Bunyachenko leaned forward. \"Why did you invite me, Deputy-Chairman?\" \"For a dr-\" \"Don't even finish that sentence, please.\" Bunyachenko cut off Oktan. \"You are in a position of strength. My organization is not. Have you invited me here to gloat?\" Oktan scoffed at the question. \"How rude such a thing would be. And besides, why do you speak of your organization, commander Bunyachenko? The officer's committee uses you as a mouthpiece, yes? Because you've been here-to entirely unconcerned with political games of your own.\"\n\nBunyachenko took a sip of cognac. His expression was still neutral. \"Hereto, deputy Chairman?\" He finally asked. Oktan laughed pleasantly. \"It is no secret that of late you've been dissatisfied with your patrons, and their inability to stand up to me. Why not ditch them? I've use of men who will fight for Russia.\" The stern officer swirled the cognac around his glass. He finally replied:\"What of Zykov's faction?\" Oktan laughed again. \"They've received a similar offer. I've a need for people who want to fight, commander. The Front, and those idiots in Vyatka, they're tough opposition. We need to come together if we're to win western Russia.\"\n\nOktan thought he saw the hint of a retort in the other man's eyes. Yet Bunyachenko kept quiet. Emptied his glass. Stood. Finally, he spoke. \"My loyalty is to the ROA, its chairman, and its deputy chairman. Thank you for the drink, commander Oktan.\" He saluted, before leaving the office, without waiting for Oktan's reply."

A proposal of diplomacy.\n\nAccording to them, before taking any hostile action against the Neutral State or the government in Vologda, we should first extend an offer of peaceful re-integration. Of effective surrender, from them to us. Though some officers dismissed the idea immediately, others have spoken of its inherent merits.\n\nSending such an offer would show, not only to other states but also to all the peoples of Russia, that we at least attempted peaceful actions before resorting to forcible ones. A perception that could be of significant assistance in the future. In addition, any such offer would also implicitly make a threat of subsequent invasion clear.\n\nHowever, it has been brought to our attention that such a course possesses significant inherent risk. Should the Neutral State prove resistant to our 'offer,' they would be made aware of a likely imminent invasion, and be given the opportunity to prepare defenses and other plans of their own.\n\nThere are merits and flaws to either course of action, but a decision must be made.

In essence, they are asking for our surrender, and threatening hostile action should we decline.\n\nMembers of our government are split. On one hand, several argue that the Neutral State does not possess the strength to resist such an invasion, and that agreeing to the proposal could not only save lives, but also perhaps allow us to secure certain protections or concessions in response. Despite reservations at extending trust to the collaborators, they argue it is the only reasonable option.\n\nOthers, however, disagree vehemently, calling it madness to trust such criminals, and that the only thing this 'offer' gives us is the opportunity to prepare for an invasion we now know is coming. That we now know is inevitable. This knowledge, they claim, could be enough to turn the tides in our favor in any conflict.\n\nRegardless, however, a response must be given. What should it be?"

And our officials will work very closely with them to ensure that the procedure, in its entirety, goes smoothly.\n\nIf, and when, it does, it will serve as an example to the other statelets of Western Russia that the Russian Liberation Army exists to do just that, in as peaceful and cooperative a manner as possible. It will prove that our word, long denigrated - and not without cause - as that of German collaborators, can be trusted. It will show that we have the moral capability to lead.\n\nBeyond that, however, it also offers us a large expansion of territory, many new resources, a large population pool to leverage for conscripts, and a better strategic position within our region, all properties that we intend to exploit to the fullest. The decision was a gambit, yes, and was much criticized among parts of the Army's officer corps, but it has paid off.\n\nWhile we cannot count on further bloodless victories in the times ahead, we can at least take pride in this one, and in the conservation of military strength that it promises."

But that is not the primary concern.\n\nTheir refusal has denied us the opportunity to prove that we are more than what we are seen to me. That we are no longer simply German collaborators. That we can give our word, that we can promise equitable and peaceful reunification, if permitted, and then follow through. And now we must, yet again, use force, and accept the repercussions of its use.\n\nSo be it. We will secure the lands of the Neutral State by military force, and incorporate its resources, its people, and its strategic position into our own, improving our ability to pursue further campaigns of regional unification.\n\nWe can only hope that this failure does not portend similar diplomatic failures in the future.

His fellow ROA officers had been lobbying on his behalf for years and now that he had ascended to his new position he would take full advantage of his new powers. The ROA was in dire need of restructuring. Mikhael Oktan and his clique were a threat to Bunyachenko's new position and to the Committee as a whole. The man would need to be demoted. As much as Sergei would rather kill the bastard, he was simply too influential at the moment. If he did not take care then he could easily find himself dead in the night, with Oktan all too willing to take power.\n\nThere was another thorn in his side as well. Milety Zykov was something of a decent man, though a little spineless for his tastes. It could only be beneficial to bring him towards Sergei's way of thinking. With Zykov's support, he would have an in with the people. The people of Samara, and of all of Russia itself, would need convincing that the ROA was capable of creating a strong Russia, free of the problems that plagued the Tsarist and Communist regimes. Zykov was just the man for the job, he was a master of propaganda and could surely curtail any thoughts of revolt amongst the masses.\n\nHis pacing came to an end and he took a seat at his desk. With a resolve rarely seen in the Russian anarchy, he began to write orders that would go out across KONR territory. The people needed work, the ROA needed guns, and the Chairman needed to know that he would be up to the task of forging a Russia that would have the strength to overcome its enemies and rise to the levels of the great powers."

Bunyachenko held much respect among them, his actions in the West Russian War had managed to cement his place as the leader of the ROA in truth, if not rank. Then there was Zykov, the spineless worm. He held sway over the people of Samara, his ideas of democracy and freedom for the people were poison in their minds. Such ideas had no place in the Russia he would rule, such as it was.\n\nWhile Vlasov still drew breath, he would need to tread carefully.

For now, he would need to be patient. Just as he had throughout the Great Patriotic War, the West Russian War, and the chaotic years that followed.\n\nHowever, that did not mean he could not act against his rivals. Vlasov had given him wide latitude for change within Samara and he intended to mold the ROA into a more preferable form. Now, he had a choice. He could risk the repercussions and move against Bunyachenko and Zykov immediately. It would come with risks but, at the same time, it could remove the biggest obstacles to his power right away.

Three days of mourning had been declared across newly liberated lands. A few genuinely upset citizens had thronged the general's coffin. Vlasov had been admired by a few across Russia. His relentless drive to free Russia from the communist menace had been admired by many. In the dark days of the Western Russian Revolutionary war, areas liberated by the chairman's men had been spared the brutal retribution killing of the Wehrmacht. During the dark decade that followed, he had done as much as possible to shield the people of Samara from his former German backers.\n\nBut the mourners were far outnumbered by a mass of stone-faced civilians. Whether secretly angry or entirely apathetic, General Bunyachenko could not tell. He knew that an overwhelming majority of citizens thought Vlasov the lowest of lowest in all of Russian history. A pathetic dog of the German occupier, that had led Russian troops in a fratricidal war to crush the resurgent Red army. Soldiers with live ammunition had covered the funeral procession, lest rioters try to smash the old Chairman's coffin.\n\nReading a hastily prepared speech, Bunyachenko felt out of his element, standing as he did in front of the sea of blank faces. He had always wondered why the detested Vlasov had lived day after day in hope of redemption. Now the wave of cold contempt threatened to drown KONR's new leader. Russia stood on the brink of unification for the first time in decades. A fact one could hardly imagine from the assembled citizen, too tired even for despair at the take-over of their land by former German collaborators.\n\nBunyachenko mumbled the last few words of the funerary oration.

Other garrisons have simply gone silent, failing to reply to our transmissions.\n\nAll hope is not yet lost, chairman. It is likely that much of the confusion within our ranks can be dispelled by loyalist units. We can address discontent amongst the troops with minor reforms: Such as increased pay or longer permissions now that the wars of unification are complete. As to the remaining mutineers, they will be crushed, and their sponsors will be smoked out.\n\nWe will make sense of this situation."

The Vlasovites seemed disunited, and he was certain that he had heard shots from their positions, down the street from his own barricade. As the days passed, however, he grew confused. Why wasn't the militia advancing? Why was the commander, the man who had spoken so passionately about revolt and had somehow secured such high-quality weapons, now just sitting in the command post?\n\nHis confusion was only heightened when the commander suddenly ordered them to stockpile their weapons and assemble in formation before himself and his hand-picked officers. And then, as a car drove up and a man emerged, a man Maksim recognized as the local black marketeer and a functionary of the hated General Oktan, it all became, at last and far, far too late, abundantly clear.\n\nA satchel was handed to the commander, the commander gestured to his officers, and the officers raised their weapons. Maksim managed only a half-step before the bullet pierced his skull.

Sobol was a man of the military, ultimately, and his assignment to meet with the American Central Intelligence Agency was because years ago, he had experience dealing with Soviet intelligence. \"An oxymoron, I know\", he liked to joke with other ROA members. There was nothing humorous in the man who sat at a table in the back, poorly illuminated by a combination of candles and old lights. He had a grizzled look about him, a man who clearly hadn't gotten a chance to shave in a few days, some rough scruff growing into a full-fledged beard. As he approached the table, the individual looked up and slowly rose, shaking Sobol's hand.\n\n\"Utkin\". He introduced himself in flawless Russian, albeit with the accent of an English speaker. \"Parents fled the revolution\", he explained further, referencing the Soviets. \"Grew up speaking Russian at home, English in school. It's good to meet you, Colonel Maksimov.\"\n\n'Maksimov?' Thought Sobol. The other man thought he was speaking to Sobol's commanding officer. \"Major Sobol, actually. Colonel Maksimov is my superior.\", the Russian officer responded, taking a seat across from Utkin, trying to ignore the look of disappointed disinterest in the spook's expression. \"It's good to finally sit down with you, and discuss our future with America.\"\n\n\"And what future would that be, major?\" the agent responded.\n\nThe question took Sobol aback - he had barely been briefed on the meeting, outside of the fact of who he was meeting and what they were discussing. That much became obvious when Sobol stumbled over his words. \"Ah, well, recognition. Support-\", Sobol responded. As he attempted to go on, he was interrupted by the American.\n\n\"Listen. Not that anyone's asking me, but I don't really care about your organization's reputation. I think you're doing God's work. But some of my higher-ups don't feel the same. A lot of the CIA remembers your organization as it was years ago. My being on the ground here doesn't change that. Between you and me?\" Utkin leaned in. \"You guys have a lot of rebranding to do. Until then, it's going to be very hard for me to convince my handlers of anything.\"\n\nSobol attempted to protest. \"Isn't it clear that we're not interested in collaboration anymore?

He revelled in the shadows, likening himself to a puppet master at play, jangling around those who he bought or blackmailed as if they were marionettes, setting up corrupt deals and meeting wealthy magnates. In a dingy, run-down bar, where Oktan frequently held court, the type of place where you had to take three alleys from the main street to get there, a special session was taking place.\n\nEver since he had attained his position at the top of the ROA's leadership, Oktan had been frequenting his old contacts less and less, relying on his more trusted and thuggish cronies to tie up loose ends and ensure both compliance and loyalty among those who still had their uses. However, music played loudly, and the raucous nature of his little backalley hideaway betrayed his presence. Sitting at his table that he had specifically made up for himself, seemingly sitting court among the bar patrons, and flanked on all sides by the scariest bodyguards he could buy, Oktan faced a trio of less-than-savoury Russians who lived beyond the Urals. The three men called themselves the Goncharov Brothers, and while none of them were related, each one was nastier than the next. One, a trader from Nizhny Novgorod who dabbled in less savory trades than guns, the second an ashamed \"made man\" from the thief's territory, and the third a disgraced middling officer from the city of Tyumen accused by Kaganovich's commissars as corrupt. Each one of them had fled from their lives, fleeing stark justice, only to redefine themselves as smugglers who worked for the most powerful, or anyone else who would pay more. The trio had made their first fortune smuggling contraband eastwards, across the Urals. They were still under his employ, but they had been called to talk to the new Grand Marshal, now that he was fully in control of Western Russia. After ensuring that all three of them had some of the nicest vodka in the joint, Oktan opened.\n\n\"Gentlemen. I'm sure that all three of you have heard about my promotion.\"\n\n\"But of course, Grand Marshal. A big step up, that's for sure.\" the man from Tyumen stated.\n\n\"Then I won't have to remind you of how important you are to me... now more than ever. And how vital it is to make sure you stay important.\"\n\nNerves gave way to alcohol, however, as Oktan and his smugglers drank the night away, each party assured of their continued prosperity. "

It had been doled out to Vadim Kovalevsky so that he and the garrison that was assigned to him could make their way to Yerykly.\n\nKovalevsky, a junior officer of the ROA, was quickly bought by Oktan soon after he received his post, mostly because of Kovalevsky's drinking problem and penchant for violence where needed. He played his role during the tumultuous time between Vlasov's death and Oktan's assumption of power, and because of that, he had been parcelled out a small village and its environs as a reward. Kovalevsky, poorly read and fat off of the luxuries provided by his master, was more than happy, after a few vodkas, of course, to accept the \"gift\" that Oktan had provided him. The sobering reality of the situation only set in when he was woken up the next morning and told that he was to report to his new fiefdom.\n\nYerykly was a village where the primary export was poverty. The streets were dirt on a good day, mud on most, and the most exciting thing that had happened here since the end of the terror bombings was that one of the cows had given birth to twins. Now, Kovalevsky, who had grown up a refugee from the Germans to the West of Samara, knew desperate times. As he stepped off of his troop truck, he found his welcome completely ignored by most of the village's inhabitants, who continued on with their daily lives. Kovalevsky had a flash, for just a brief moment - the place, somehow, reminded him of home. But as reality sank in, he knew that the relative comfort of Samara was long behind him, and his faint smile turned to grimace.

He had, perhaps most controversially, invited a series of left-leaning politicians as well - those who had definitely been members of the CPSU at one point or another, some of whom even utterly refused to renounce their allegiance to a leftist ideology. The convention - attended by 59 members plus Zykov himself, had been passionately arguing with itself for quite some time. Not just over the nature of the constitution, but the future of Russia as a whole. The only thing that kept the delegates in check were reminders that their participation was contingent on keeping the convention civil, as well as the several armed ROA guards that lined the large conference room.\n\nZykov intermittently participated, but also went about various other duties of state as well, and was thus often absent for a lot of the debates. In his stead, a secretary took what notes he could and sent them off for review by the chairman. Additionally, any changes or proposed clauses to be put in to the constitution were brought to Zykov personally, in front of the convention, where he would give his often-critical opinion on the proposed additions, which tended to be well received by the voting members of the convention - especially considering how many of the delegates were suspiciously oft in agreement with Zykov's \"decrees\", as some more independent-minded delegates began to seethingly call them.\n\nZykov read over the newest proposed provision for the constitution. Clearly, it had been drafted by the convention's more radical elements - the words that stood out to him were \"fully representative democracy\". The entire clause called for that and more. Something that Zykov was personally not interested in, but also that even considering implementing something like that would not only alienate the officers of the ROA, but perhaps even induce them to revolt. A dangerous consideration for the chairman who often felt he walked a razor's edge.\n\n\"This part here, it's unacceptable to the convention.

It almost seemed more a procession than an entrance, but after all, the Grand Marshal did preside over the convention.\n\nAs he took his place at the front of the gathered delegates, he observed those who had earned a place at the convention: from the military wing, his most trusted and skilled generals, those who had earned a place at the Grand Marshal's side. Beside them sat the more junior officers, the ones that he couldn't name, but that he, and his trusted senior comrades, had seen fit to bestow administrative responsibilities to large tracts of land in Western Russia. He may not have known their names, but clearly their hearts were in the right place. Next to them sat the noticeably smaller civilian wing.\n\nThese were the real question marks in Oktan's mind - he had his trusted aides put feelers out in Samara and other large cities under the control of the KONR for any \"dynamic individual\" who had the money, manpower, and desire to cooperate closely with the Grand Marshal and his plans for the future. These were industrialists, technocrats, disgraced former politicians. Each one of them with an interest and, to Oktan, a payoff. Looking over all those assembled, Oktan began to talk, his raspy, but powerful voice booming through the room, made louder by the ancient microphone he was speaking into.\n\n\"My friends, thank you for joining me here today, in the true spirit of a Russian state!\" Respectful clapping followed, before he continued. \"As most of you know, we all have been working tirelessly to forge a Russia independent of the communists, who have been doing nothing but causing issues for our land for decades. With this convention, we have taken a massive step towards destroying their movement completely. And once we do, we can begin looking at turning our Russia into a rich nation... one where all will be without want, free to help forge a strong identity and forever prevent the slide of our people back into the depravity of communism. For now, however, we must continue discussing our constitution. I see here, on page fourteen...\""

 SAM.59.t: "Better Courts"
 SAM.59.desc: "Today, Zykov's choice of judges for both supreme and provincial courts was announced, much to the chagrin of a large fraction of the ROA but to the relief of many others. It was made public that in both federal and provincial courts, that there would be a mixture of civilian and military judges, the latter only making up about a third of the judiciary. The move was controversial, but ultimately in line with the Chairman's vision for a democratic Russia that prioritized the needs of its citizenry. Zykov, still always careful to walk the razor's edge between his vision and the military's reactionism, ensured that those appointed to their respective positions, civilian or military, were in his pocket. That way, at the very least, they could make their case for Zykov and defend his choices to their respective supporters. Of course, the civilian judges and the military judges both had their own agendas - after all, everyone wanted something. But the aim was that, despite their affiliation, they would remain loyal to the Chairman.\n\n\"Welcome to your new office, judge.\" Anatoly Ignatov's brother said, emphasizing his new title as the pair of them entered into the large room. A comfortable area, the office would be the headquarters for Ignatov's new job - that of judge. He had been handpicked by the ROA following the chairman's insistence on forming a coherent and comprehensive judiciary. Despite the fact that he was a civilian, he met with Zykov's deputies, who, apparently, were enamored with the now-judge's ideas of justice and sensibility. Of course, the position wasn't without responsibilities, nor was Ignatov's conscience clean; the former community leader did have to make some deals with the deputies to ensure that he got the position. This of course, included an unspoken provision that he was to be loyal to the chairman, and by extension, the entire committee. But this was a small price to pay for the position that he now found himself in. As he explored the room, his brother, in awe at the place, asked him a question. \"So where will you start? How does this even work?\" Anatoly thought for a bit before responding.\n\n\"I guess we'll find out.\""

Theory has often, however, had to give ground to practical considerations as strict martial law was the order of the day in any piece of territory captured by the ROA. The years of idleness in and around Samara have seen a large amount of Imperial and Soviet laws grafted to the civil and criminal code wherever the ROA's officer judged it fit.\n\nChairman Bunyachenko's advisors have trimmed this ball of legal precedents down to coherent and useful civil and military codes. These will be enacted by a new system of tribunals staffed with former ROA soldiers. The supreme court of the republic itself will be stacked with men loyal to the chairman. As such Commander Bunyachenko expects favorable hearing as his consolidation of power continues. The failure of the opposition to prevent this marks another victory in Chairman Bunyachenko's consolidation of power."

 SAM.61.desc: "Mikhail Oktan was tired of meetings. All he did day in and day out were meetings. Meetings about funding, meetings about peasant unrest, meetings about what uniforms he could and couldn't wear in public. After he had finished his lunch, he had dismissed all of his meetings for the rest of the day - except one, his aide reminded him. He couldn't possibly postpone the meeting of prominent military and civilian officials to finalize the judiciary system in the Provisional Commissariat. Especially, as the aide had pointed out, that the officers who he was meeting with, he had sent them out to their fiefs but had so soon recalled them.\n\nReluctantly, and with a belly fuller than he could remember, he sat down with the eight individuals, five military and three civilian, to hash out and complete the judicial code for the Russia that he envisioned. Despite his lethargic outlook, he soon took to the task with his normal charisma, cracking jokes and living up to his image as the most sociable head of state west of the Urals.\n\n\"So, let's get down to business, shall we?\" He asked those gathered, laziness rapidly dissipating in favour of excitement. The Grand Marshal laid out a number of documents, which were passed around the group. \"As you can see, we're looking at a dual military-civilian system. The military governor of a province appoints a political chief, which deals with any civilian case in the district, but can be appealed or vetoed by the military governor. Cases won't be able to be taken federally, the military governor is the highest say.\" Oktan shifted in his chair, looking more towards the officers. \"Military disputes will be handled federally. A group of officers will serve in positions as judges and will be handpicked by me. A judge can be removed if the majority of the judges vote them off, or if I want them off. I'd pick a successor. These disputes and proceedings would be similar to military tribunals, complete with your pick of various legal provisions.\" Looking directly at the officers, he emphasized, \"Remember, I take care of our boys.\""

Sounds good?\"\n\n\"If it works, it works. What about Gelevkar? And Syktyvkar?\"\n\n\"Syktyvkar is a toss-up. Make it it's own district, there's no way we can predict what'll happen there.\"\n\nToday, Zykov's vision of a unicameral system of parliament to represent \"all the peoples of Russia'' began its first step towards realization. Zykov announced the formation of a parliament following general elections during a grand ceremony in Samara, where apparently, \"all free Russians'' would be able to vote. The reaction to this announcement was mixed among the people of Russia.\n\nIn places like Samara, which had known ROA rule for so long, it was a welcome relief to military rule, and Yedinstvo, the political party representing the ROA, candidates were projected to win in landslides. In other places, the news of elections were more tentative.\n\nThe gentry of Syktyvkar, those who survived its conquest, were cynical and suspicious of the elections, and immediately pointed out the great degree of gerrymandering that had gone on in certain areas. This gerrymandering, likely, they claimed, all but ensured the victory of the Yedinstvo in various areas to make sure that its interests were represented in the government. But Zykov's official representatives denied this claim vehemently.\n\nIn the north, where the Soviet remnants once reigned supreme, feelings were ambivalent. For the ideological hardliners, those who fled with the front, rigorous campaigning for candidates as left as was allowed occurred, but many others, natives, cared little. Regardless, the winds of change were blowing, and even the most ignorant Russian peasant couldn't escape Zykov's careful, calculated democratization."

The only question that remained was, president to what type of republic?\n\nA strong push by Zykov's faction for a democratic unicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage faced a barrage of criticism from ROA grandees. Their counter proposal of a legislature appointed by the officer's committee brought the convention to a stand still for some time until chairman Bunyachenko brought along a new proposal of a bicameral legislature. An elected lower chamber would keep accountable an appointed upper house.\n\nCynics could accuse this scheme of favoring the Chairman's own interests in the long run. The democratic lower house's extremely limited power would impose few restrictions on the actions of the senate. A realist, however, would see how astute the Chairman's compromise solution was in threading the needle between various interest groups.\n\nIn return for Bunyachenko's partial support for their proposal, the officer's committee agreed to let him appoint many of the initial senators for five year terms. The list of candidates being brought forward by the Chairman's faction is expected to contain loyalists to the president, technocrats and industrialists willing to enact the president's rumored radical reforms. The democratic faction itself is likely to receive a few important ministries as a reward for their cooperation."

Mikhail Oktan, once he had secured his position at the head of the Committee, took over the office and had it transformed into his own personal throne room. Entering from the front, a long red carpet led from the oaken double doors to the large, ancient desk that the Grand Marshal sat at. Portraits of great Russians, including Oktan himself, adorned the walls, but there was a conspicuous lack of Vlasov's presence. Throughout most of the day, Oktan and his closest confidants caroused themselves and those that they met with to the point that the Grand Marshal could barely remember everything that he had done and all who he had met with.\n\n\"Clearly our dear, departed leader was doing this all wrong!\" Oktan exclaimed to uproarious laughter, exactly when Grigory Lagunov stepped into the room. The officer was a newcomer to the ROA's senior ranks, and was considered a bit of a teetotaler. His uniform was always immaculate and he never slouched, nor did he ever drink or smoke.\n\n\"You wanted to see me, Grand Marshal?\"\n\nOktan made a welcoming gesture, practically begging the man to join them. \"Yes, yes! Come in, please! I wanted to see you, Colonel Lagunov,\" Oktan's face dropped his smile, and he turned deadpan. \"About something very, very serious.\" Oktan and his company watched as the color drained from the colonel's face.\n\nThey gave it a few seconds, allowing the officer, who surely thought that he was about to be shot, to advance towards them before they burst out into laughter. \"Look at your face!\" the Grand Marshal cackled. \"No, no, nothing like that...\" He said, calming himself down after a fit of laughter. \"The Committee would like you to... well, grant you the governorship of the province of Nizhny Novgorod!\"\n\nLagunov, clearly not having recovered from the fright, wasn't quite sure what to say. \"A... a governorship?\" He repeated. Oktan rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Come now, don't be so suspicious. Is this because of the joke? I'm sorry. Yes, we want you to govern the region. You'll be subject to the federal government, of course, which means that you'll owe taxes, as well as conscription and equipment levies. But you can make your own laws, within reason of course, so long as they only apply within the borders of the area that you control! How's that sound?\"\n\nThe colonel was taken aback. He had been smart enough to keep his head down during Oktan's accession, but he had never expected this. \"I... well, I must accept.\" Lagunov took a drink with the officers for the first time in a long time, and he left the \"meeting\" satisfied, knowing that he would be presiding over his hometown."

Any injuries are to be reported directly to me before the wounded individual is taken to the aid station. For those of you who do not know, you are being paid $1.00 above the minimum wage. Are there any questions?\"\n\nThe Perm Armaments Factory no.32 opened today, as one of many government-controlled enterprises that did the same under Zykov's dual public-private sector industrial policy. This factory, like its sister facilities all across the territory of the Provisional Commissariat, would be working day-in and day-out to produce weapons and ammunition for the ever-hungry ROA. Owned and operated by the government, these arms factories, once seen as a dreadful deal by a number of local residents, had become beacons of job stability and good pay as a result of government investment into making working conditions and wages livable, at the very least. Zykov had worked for a long time to ensure a good, stable industrial base for the ROA back when it was scratching out a meager existence around Samara, and later once he was the guiding hand behind Vlasov's policies. Now that he was at the helm of the Provisional Commissariat, a coherent, effective, and most importantly, fair, industrial policy had been put in place by Zykov and his administration.\n\nThe military industry would be almost entirely state-controlled: The line between the military-industrial sector and the ROA itself seemed to be distinct, if blurry at times. This way the state could guide the necessities of military production while also ensuring that the needs of the soldiers are met. The civilian sector, however, was almost immediately privatised. The government sold off a number of factories that had been seized during the ROA's conquest of Western Russia, and those they couldn't sell, they simply handed out to conglomerates and corporations. Working conditions were exponentially better than they had been a mere few years ago, and while a civilian factory job was far from perfect, it was, at least, stable."

The new Chairman, however, silenced the feverish complaints that such a project could not be realized. Had the Japanese not carved an empire of steel in Manchuria where once only dusty steppe could be found? Had not the damn Bukharinists developed the central Siberian heavy industry in such a time span?\n\nCombining a modern central financial system and interlocking shareholders, a select set of industrial concerns would be expanded horizontally and vertically into economical juggernauts dubbed kombinats. The presence of allies of the government in key financial institutions would be used to feed loyal businesses, and prevent hostile takeovers by national or international rivals. In preparation for liberation of the rest of Russia, military supplying contracts would provide initial fuel for the rise of these kombinats.\n\nBunyachenko's speech concluded, the chairman stood and answered questions.

This informal network, known as the \"Shepchushchaya Galereya\", or whispering gallery, had become the paramount organization for intelligence gathering and dissention prevention. Zykov knew that it was indispensable, and the sheer size of both the Galereya's agents and the territory they now had to cover essentially warranted by necessity its reformation into an official, government-sanctioned agency: The Ministry of Truth. From the lowliest soldier to some of the highest ranking officials in Zykov's realm, suddenly, as informants, they found themselves under the scrutiny of a new set of handlers, professionally and deftly collecting information and dispensing rewards as needed.\n\nCorporal Gennady Bogomolov sat in a barren office, nervously smoking.

But as their victory became more assured, it seemed as if their grip on the town slipped. It was a deceptive slipping, of course - as peace returned to Western Russia, Zykov's armed forces helped transition their new state from military to civilian rule . Village and town councils were introduced, and state-run schools with state-issued curricula were opened. Attendance was made mandatory for all children.\n\n\"The October Revolution - what do we know about it?\" asked the school teacher, whose name Viktor could barely remember. In fact, he couldn't remember when last he had been up this early.

The education system that the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia had been leagues better than whatever had been offered before - usually nothing; if a child was lucky, they would be taught how to read and write by an older member of their family or village community. That being said, the kids didn't have to actually like going to school. It's true, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for most of them, and would prepare them for the new Russia that Oktan had envisioned. However, truthfully, conditions were terrible, and the curriculum was more than controversial, even for the deplorable state of the Russian educational system.\n\nThe hours in class were almost as long as the hours in a factory, and discipline was harsh. Obedience was taught above all - the teachers were all uniformed and ranked the children based on their performance, engagement, and obedience. What they actually learned was incredibly basic - reading, writing, math... history was the worst. Even the youngest, poorest educated kids knew how trumped-up most of it was. But they dared not speak of it; any mere whisper of dissent could mean a serious beating.\n\nUltimately, the goal of the schools that Oktan and his friends had sponsored was not to educate the populace, but ready them for a greater purpose. Children will be educated in the most minimal and efficient way before they are sent off to either join the army, an officer's college, or a technical school, where they will be put to use by the state for Oktan's image. It wasn't a glorious education, nor was it particularly useful for any of the children, but it gave them the basic tools to survive and thrive in Russia's future."

Zykov walked the balance between ideal and practicality as he balanced the military's tendency towards reaction with the dream of a government by the people, for the people. And in that walk, Zykov chose to take what was good from what the Committee knew of other nations and blend it all together. Russia would have a head of state, who was commander in chief.

Thus some elements of economic planning are proposed to 'jump start' the economy for the purposes of beginning the long awaited reunification of Russia.\n\nREPORT SUMMARY: It has been found that a significant amount of factories have been destroyed from either raids from opposing warlords, or due to German terror bombings. What few remain suffer from a lack of manpower. Similar outcomes occur in construction and extraction industries. In spite of this, the unemployment rate is high, especially in urban areas. This has caused suffering among families, who rely on charity to get by. For full analysis, see pages 20 through 54 of this report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: To use government powers to enforce an end to unemployment, through a combination of government assistance, relocation of the unemployed towards areas and industries where needed most, and, when no other option is available, conscription into the armed forces. While this would expand government powers into the economy thus unseen, it would make it (a) more viable and attractive to do business and (b) increase productivity of the average citizen through additional wages.

Poverty has decreased, unemployment is nearly non-existent, and for the first time in years new factories are being created throughout the country. The unemployment program has even been so successful that juveniles (13-17 being the majority) makeup a significant portion of the workforce, although by no means a majority. While far from done, the program has made much progress in revitalizing the economy, which has benefited military production in domestic firearms, making unification a more likely outcome. See pages 18 through 30 for full report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Aside from continuing the program, it is recommended that additional resources be made available to increase business opportunity.

Hastily exiting the car, to the consternation of his bodyguards in the other vehicles, he strode over to the wall, where a poster he and Malyshkin had collaborated to create was hanging.\n\nHanging defaced - the words 'Down with the Traitors!' splashed across it in bright red ink and obscuring the message behind.\n\nJoined by Malyshkin a moment later, and with their bodyguards quickly establishing a perimeter, they inspected the poster. Exchanging a knowing look, and with a wordless nod from the other man, Zhilenkov quickly tore it down, aware of how fortunate it was that they, and not others within the ROA's high command, had seen it first. His relief was short-lived, however, as Malyshkin tapped his shoulder and pointed across the street.\n\nAnother copy of the poster. Defaced. With more of them down the street disfigured similarly.

Unfortunately, he had ties with Oktan, though Vlasov doubted even that man held any love for Zakutnyy. Nobody did.

He just thought himself too good for a POW camp. A true coward among an army of cowards.\n\n\"Yes, continue.\" Vlasov finally said. As Zakutnyy discussed his plans for the development of defenses against German bombings and increased armament production, Vlasov barely listened, knowing his approval or disapproval of the plan mattered little in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHowever, when Zakutnyy began speaking on how it was only natural that such a great plan was devised by a brilliant mind such as his own, Vlasov couldn't stop himself from slamming his fist down on the desk and standing up, shooting a seething glare towards Zakutnyy causing the man to take a couple steps back. \"You-\" Almost as quickly as he had given in to his irritation, Vlasov cooled down.

A few chairs had been scattered around, but most had to stand. Vlasov himself was behind his oaken desk, the entire barren room brightly framed by the large window immediately behind him. The old chairman took a cursory glance outside before turning towards Sidorov and the rest of the crowd. \"It's no secret that there's been some consternation about the matter of our movement's leadership after I am gone.\" It was a plain statement, and one that was definitely true. Aides like Sidorov would spend whole meals discussing the matter as if they were adolescents discussing romantic interests. \"I have taken a significant amount of time to think about the matter, and I have decided that I will be nominating Sergey Bunyachenko as the next in line for Chairman of our committee.\" Most of the aides nodded. After all, Bunyachenko was a sensible choice. He was popular with most of the officers and generally avoided shady dealings that some of his peers gleefully engaged in. One of the aides, however, a \"friend\" of Mikhail Oktan's, piped up. \"But why Bunyachenko? I don't get it\". A pensive look flashed over Vlasov's face for a minute, before he responded. \"Good question\", he started, looking directly into the aide's eyes, knowingly. \"The ROA is filled with rot - corruption, bribery, nepotism, anything that you can name. I'm no fool, I know it exists. Bunyachenko is a strong, honest man and an honorable general. I know that he will be both a good compromise candidate between our ideologically passionate peers and those who are less so. And I also know that he will work to expose and purge the rot from our organization, forcefully if need be. For if we are to rule all Russia, we need a man and an organization that is free from corruption and interested enough in crushing our enemies to not put his own interests above our ultimate goals.

After the dozen or so KONR and ROA officers and various aides had taken their seats in chairs that had been hastily brought in by those not privy to the meeting, Vlasov had stood up, and addressed his \"crowd\". \"We are all aware,\" he began, \"that there is the matter of succession within our movement. It has been a matter of contention for some time that when it is time for me to hand off the torch, who would be the one to receive it.\" There was a pause - a reluctant, grimacing pause, before he continued. \"And as such, I have decided that General Mikhail Oktan will be the one to bear the burden of succession\". Almost immediately after the name was mentioned, the room began to erupt into discord. Sidorov himself was baffled; Oktan? Even among his allies, Oktan had a reputation for corruption and administrative negligence. He was a decent officer, a sight better than the \"cadets\" who \"volunteered\", but nothing special, and he was no friend of Vlasov. Vlasov's voice suddenly boomed throughout the room, a single command - \"Silence!\" It was obeyed. \"Oktan already owns half of the Russian Liberation Army. He attracts those damned opportunists and lackeys, bribing those who can be bought and sidelining those who can't.\" Vlasov continued to calmly explain his decision. \"But if it is anyone but Oktan succeeds me, I worry for the continued existence of our movement.

 SAM.306.desc: "\"Harvest Days\" was what they were called around these parts. ROA soldiers would descend upon the town in their full battle dress, and proceed to help the local farmers with their harvest, providing the valuable manpower that their fields needed especially since so many of their sons had been conscripted or killed. When the harvest days had first been put in place, there was little trust or goodwill between the soldiers and the villagers, especially considering one of the reasons the soldiers helped out with the harvests was to take some of the food back with them. But as the harvest days became more regular, and the village became more acclimatized to the presence of the ROA they began to see them not as German collaborators, but as protectors. The atmosphere changed, trust was built between civilian and soldier. Eventually, some members of the ROA even began volunteering for the harvest days - usually conscripts who had a background in agriculture - hoping to be assigned to one. With some of the friendliest villages even offering to feed the soldiers during the day, it was a relatively comfortable assignment compared to border patrols or anti-bandit operations.\n\nWhile the Committee for the Liberation of the Russian People was far from popular, they had been working hard to secure their regime, distance themselves from the Germans, and even improve their relations with those that they ruled over. These harvests were a key part of that, and contributed to the image that the ROA was there to help, not hurt; to a large extent, it seemed that it was working. No one liked taxes, especially when they were being extracted in the form of food, and oftentimes after the harvests many of the farmers would stare jealously at the ROA's trucks as they pulled away from their village, wishing they had been able to keep more of the food they had grown. However, on the whole, it was a positive experience. The soldiers had even been effective in getting a few of the local boys and restless farmhands to sign up with the ROA, which further helped dissipate tensions with the locals. Most of the core of the ROA had no local ties to the area around Samara, and having patrols protect those that they knew was a huge boon for the KONR's propaganda machine."

When men of the Imperial Army entered, there was a momentary tension. That too died down as the Vlasovites offered a round of drinks to the Imperials.\n\nTalks ebbed and flowed on a range of topic. A particularly violent group of bandits that both groups of soldiers had fought with (the bastards). The recent weather (mostly bad). The news from beyond the Urals (very confused). Eventually the topic moved to the WRRF. A few of the veterans of both groups had fought in the fifties. After comisserating on the shame of fighting fellow Russians to defeat the reds, the soldiers shared war stories back and forth. A few more rounds were shared. This casual conversation marked the high point of the evening's mood. Eventually a bitter dispute erupted as to the legitimacy of the ROA. Had it not begun as a German militia, dogs for the invaders? The ROA veteran snapped back that the tsar had been invited by the Germans, and that the white soldiers should not talk about serving tyrants, foreign or domestic.\n\nThe barman did not speak.

He radioed his troops who were observing the situation over at the factories - ROA troops frequently mediated between employers and employees, especially during tense situations like this one. He asked a simple question - \"Have they dispersed?\" The answer Popov got was not the one that he was hoping for. \"The strikers won't give up\", the voice on the other end of the radio responded. \"Worse still, there's some rumors among the workers still here and their managers that the strike was actually orchestrated by communist agents, 'plants', as they call them. Things are getting pretty tense, people are throwing things\". What came after that was what really worried Major Popov. \"Some of the greener troops... I think they're unnerved. If things go south, they might start shooting.\"\n\nPopov cursed to himself. The damned strikers. It was the third time in three months that this had happened, and each time, it was up to the ROA to sort things out. How many times would he have to deal with this before he made his superiors understand that he, and those he commanded, were soldiers, not policemen? Regardless, Popov had to make a choice - he could send in his troops to disperse the strikers, and potentially kill or weed out the apparent communist plants. Surely, this would calm things down and set a precedent to the ungrateful strikers that their insubordination would not be tolerated. It might make us unpopular in the short run but it would also ensure the stability in our streets, for workers will surely be reluctant to complain if it meant being on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun. However, Popov would have the lives of those workers on his hands. Similarly, if he refused to send in the army, the workers would be happy, and alive of course, but business interests would feel betrayed. It wasn't an easy call by any means, but Popov knew that he would have to make it - it would be a PR disaster if his recruits lost their cool and fired into the crowds."

As a result, it didn't take long for news of an envoy from the east to arrive at a local garrison station. The ROA was consistently weary about outsiders and strangers, to the point where a diplomat from beyond the Urals instantly kicked up suspicion. Maksim Oliynyk, the officer in charge of the garrison station that the envoy had been escorted to didn't particularly want to meet the man - in fact, he was suspicious that the man was who he claimed he was.\n\nSitting down with the envoy, it was clear that he was frustrated. Protesting his being whisked away to the garrison, rather than Samara itself. Oliynyk sat down with the man, looking at him up and down. \"Who are you?\" he asked, \"And why have my caravan and I been stolen away here?

 SAM.310.desc: "Armaments Factory no.14 was a small complex near the Samara railyards. \"Repurposed\" by the ROA itself during the darkest days of the terror bombing, the small shack was soon built up. The \"factory\" - in reality little more than a large building with a few long, wooden tables and a number of machine tools - was dedicated to taking apart German small arms and reverse engineering them for our own purposes. Vlasov and most of those under him knew well that their German support would eventually run out, and they had long made provisions to ensure that their myriad of German equipment, from Kar98Ks to StG-44s would remain operable even once it was no longer possible to receive their parts from their former benefactors neither officially nor through smugglers. The factory rarely worked during the day - the bombings made it hard to - but workers toiled all night, with small headlamps and minimal light, disassembling old or well-worn rifles and their respective ammunitions. These workers, despite their rugged condition, were not civilians. Not officially, at least. They were engineers, not just employees of the ROA, but members of it and experienced in handling German weapons for many years. Until recently, the factory had been minimally staffed. However, with the increasing amount of bloody victories won by the ROA, the soldiers at the frontline needed more and more weapons, and the number of those that we can get from German smugglers is becoming miniscule compared to our needs. As such, Armaments Factory no.14 has, as of recently, expanded not only in terms of manpower, but location as well. A number of shoddily-constructed buildings have been added to the original to form a sort of complex, where dedicated stations and senior engineers act as efficiency-generating machines.

 SAM.311.desc: "The office of Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov was incredibly barren. He had intentionally ordered the removal of most luxuries from his office and his living quarters two years prior, in a vain attempt to stave off his ever-present guilt. The old marshal stood, looking out the window, a drink in hand. He couldn't remember the time, all he knew was that it was dark out. Midnight, maybe? 1? 2? Who cared. The night was the only time that Vlasov could be alone. Every waking hour of the day he had aides, officers, and administrators asking him the most mundane of questions, but lately he had become disinterested in answering them, instead preoccupying himself with a reflection on his life's work. What was it, if not the Committee? And what had they accomplished? At what cost? These were the questions that resounded in Vlasov's head day and night. \"And for the life of me, I can't figure out the answers.\" he mumbled to himself. He couldn't even remember if his alliance with the Nazis was one of pragmatic survival or the desire to see a Russia forged in his image. He barely had an image anymore. He continued to pace around his room, occasionally glancing up to the stoic portrait of himself that his aides insisted he keep in his office. A single word came to his mind: legacy. What was to be his legacy? Vlasov had always thought about writing a book. After all, who else would tell his story the way that it should be told? \"The Germans remember me as a traitor, the Russians remember me as worse. Those in the West barely even know who I am.\" He stated to no one in particular. Realistically, no book would be coming. Vlasov knew he couldn't. After pacing some more, he sat, slumped in his desk chair, looking at his drink. It had become harder to resist the urges to refill the glass over and over with the premium vodka he had \"liberated\" for himself. He looked to his glass - it was now empty. When did he drink it? He couldn't remember. Glancing towards his desk, there were two items that came to his attention - the bottle and his service pistol. A brief idea crossed his mind, but common sense got the better of him. He decided to retire for the night, after a long, deep sigh."

 SAM.312.t: "The Will of the People"
 SAM.312.desc: "Outside of a small village about two and a half hour's drive from the city of Samara lay, in a pile, roughly thirty dead bodies. Well over half of them were wearing the ROA's uniform, the other dead were clearly partisans. The confrontation between the partisans and the local patrol had taken place when a routine inspection of the village led to the discovery of weapons caches, partisans hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe firefight that ensued saw all of the partisans killed, but most of the patrol as well. The dead ROA, which featured kids as young as sixteen, was sorted into one pile, with another, far more uncouth, for the dead partisans, mostly young men and women. Vlasov, who was shocked to hear that there was such a coherent piece of communist resistance so close to the capital, drove out himself to see the aftermath.\n\nAccompanied by two of his bodyguards, he examined the carnage after personally ordering the surviving patrol members to not exact revenge on the surviving villagers. One of the bodyguards, Belochkin, was a personal confidant of the old general. He could tell that for the first time in a long time, Vlasov was filled with emotion - and none of it was good. His mouth formed into a tight-lipped grimace as he walked through the village. An explosion of anger eventually brought the usually laconic general into a yelling fit, shouting at the pile of dead partisans.\n\n\"Who are you to think that you could do what you tried to do?\" He asked and then paused. Was he waiting for a response? \"I have worked years - no, decades - to bring about a Russia free from communism, free from tyranny. And all you people who so stubbornly resist my efforts, indoctrinated by the bastards I beat years ago, you waste the lives of brave, young men who fight my good fight!\"\n\nBelochkin was stunned. He looked around, villager and soldier alike froze, observing the marshal's outburst. Glancing towards his fellow bodyguard, he slowly approached Vlasov, who had since fallen silent. Careful not to touch him, Belochkin quietly whispered in his ear.\n\n\"Perhaps, my chairman, it is time for us to go. I'm sure you're needed back in Samara.\"\n\nVlasov weakly agreed; the drive back to the capital was a very quiet one."

 SAM.400.desc: "Any successful army requires a great deal of officers. Only, the recent years in Samara have seen our junior officers grow not so junior. The men that fought in the West Russian War, the former Red Army PoWs, opportunist whites and fascist emigres have now spent most of a decade with us holed up in Samara. Years of promotion, attrition and desertion have unbalanced our officer pool, especially at the junior level. Our army is now dangerously top heavy, and needs new blood to fill out its command structure.\n\nFortunately, local recruits form a satisfactory pool of potential officers. The only issue is that the years of sitting around have begun polarizing the soldiers into three different groups. Some of the more idealistic recruits follow Zykov's faction, and argue that the ROA should live up to its promises of liberation and democracy. In contrast, a group of black market smugglers and hardline fascists have coalesced around general Oktan's promises of a strong Russia where the soldiers are fully respected. In between these two hands, the officer committee tries to maintain the status quo by recruiting dutiful and apolitical men who share General Bunyachenko's apathy and desire to see the junta's structure endure until the situation has changed.\n\nThe composition of officers we choose will help determine the direction the ROA takes. It would be wise to be prudent in our selection of the ROA's next generation."

The pair were both prominent members of the Russian Liberation Army's Officer Committee that Bunyachenko chaired, and despite Oktan's increasingly frequent claims that he should be chairman, had both remained at his side despite the former's attempts at curbing or buying the Committee's power.\n\nBoth were oddly silent this morning, however, as Bunyachenko attempted to brainstorm ways to counter Oktan's influence. \"It spreads like a cancer, Arkady...\" he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. \"He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price.\" The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. \"Well?\" asked Bunyachenko. \"What do we do now?\"\n\nPopov nervously checked his watch, and was about to answer when a sharp rap at the door interrupted him. Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn. Rising from his desk, Bunyachenko asked, \"What is going on?\" a tone of suspicion was confirmed as he looked to Popov and Antonov, who had since stood up and drawn their sidearms.\n\n\"Sergey Bunyachenko,\" Antonov started, \"The Officers Committee has placed you under arrest following an investigation into corruption and nepotism charges. We have reviewed the case and have sentenced you to death.

Vlasov had been their leader since the beginning and there had never been a transfer of power until now. The Committee was untested, raw. Bunyachenko signaled to his bodyguards that he was ready to leave the office, but before they could go more than a step the doors burst open. A squad of ROA regulars was the first through the door, followed by three men, Oktan's dogs. He would know their stench anywhere. \"What is the meaning of this!?\" Bunyachenko demanded. The man at the head of the conspirators smiled cruelly.\n\n\"Chairman Bunyachenko, in the name of Vlasov's true heir, you are under arrest for treason against the Russian people. Come quietly, and you may yet die with dignity,\" the dog had the audacity to look magnanimous. However, instead of the panic that they had hoped to inspire in the Chairman, they saw only resolve.\n\n\"Men, arrest these fools and you shall be pardoned for your part in their little game,\" he ordered. The regular soldiers that had barged into the office looked at each other, unsure. \"This is your last chance, men, don't do anything you'll regret.\" Finally, they reacted. The sergeant at the head of the squad turned and smashed his rifle against Oktan's man's head, he crumpled to the ground with a groan. With the spell broken, the soldiers rounded up the other two and bound them with the rope meant for Bunyachenko's own hands. \"Get this filth out of my office,\" he turned and sat back down at his desk, it would be a long night."

Remember, struggle not against your family, but against those who threaten it!\"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage those still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent an all-out explosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to exhibit perfectly the tenets that Macchiavelli wrote about centuries ago. Zykov had bribed those who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those who would do neither. The combination worked, if just barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and the immense amount of relief given by them, was swirling around the heads of the committee, which Zykov stood in front of. The enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing to the committee about the situation, and the fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. \"As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized this mutiny against the authority of our dear chairman.\" Actually, for most, that was a surprise. \"Indeed, it's clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate such a rat-like insubordinate in our ranks, no matter how entrenched he may be.\" Zykov looked around this room, his cool, calculating gaze analyzing each committee member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. \"Very well. If it is the will of the committee, I will order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial.\"\n\nOktan would not get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, ultimately being shot. His body was burned. Such was the end of Mikhail Oktan."

Good to see you.\" The democratic activist began to speak, only for the chairman to cut him off. \"No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The officer's committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces.\"\n\n\"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the officer committee? I should go see them directly\"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. \"The officer committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized.

Bunyachenko also wishes to stress that his government's reclamation of the Far East, and the eventual reunification of Russia proper, would only increase available opportunities for both of our economies.\n\nMany corporations and business owners are supportive of this action, as it would both increase the profits of corporations seeking to invest in Russia, and provide a new market for Japanese goods.

Regardless, we have brought this region under our control, and we expect to keep them for a long time.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that they will just accept this. Many citizens wish to create their own party, or to participate in elections outside of the Yedinstvo. This could be devastating, because if a big enough party can challenge us, many inside of the Yedinstvo may begin to question the usefulness of staying inside the tent. Our Economics Department, however, has offered a way to solve this problem: by bribing important citizens to keep with the Yedinstvo.\n\nBut there is a split. Some wish to bribe important businessmen, as they can provide us with a significant base of resources to win elections and maintain power in these regions. Others wish to bribe local democrats who, for one reason or another, are critical of the regime or Yedinstvo as a whole.

Two warlords with neighbouring territories - men he had made himself - were feuding. Already some skirmishes between their troops had resulted in deaths, and they seemed to be stockpiling arms to go to war. The dispute was, as far as he could make out, more about mutual loathing than anything else. Oktan sighed. The odd massacre across the border he could wave away.

He'd already condemned the more foolish warlord to death. But the other, such wasted promise. A shame. \"Kill both of them,\" he told the aide finally. \"You can give this to Belyaev.

Wait!\" he called after the aide, as the man stood. \"After it's done, hang the bodies in public.\"\n\nOktan returned to the party with a grin, but his heart was no longer in it.

Both had been killed during their participation in the political militias in '62 and '63 respectively. Turgenev, like his parents, had grieved, but death was commonplace in Russia. But Turgenev had made his peace with the nature of the Republic's trade-off: one could live a free life and speak for what they believed in. In return, a certain degree of risk in one's everyday life could be expected.\n\nSo when the Russian Liberation Army paraded themselves through Syktyvkar in an apparent parody of the Soviet soldiers Turgenev's father would tell him about, he had been worried for the future of his livelihood and the status quo he had gotten used to. And for a time, his fears had been legitimized. The ROA, on orders of their officers, had looted the city. They had stripped it of what wealth it had but when they had finished, things returned to a certain normalcy. Turgenev went back to work in his factory; it was as if the looting had never happened. But the ROA promised peace and prosperity, and eventually they had delivered. The city saw a massive revitalization in terms of jobs and quality of living.\n\nTurgenev may have had a thicker wallet and better food, but he always felt that dark clouds were on the horizon, a belief reinforced by the continual military patrols and rumors of brutal \"policing actions\" in rural areas.

That is, until he saw the money Oktan was offering. It was enough to... well, overhaul the team and make way in the budget for better draft picks the following year. And that was just to start. Moore barely waited a day before he wired his answer: yes.\n\nThe game itself was quite civil. The Russian team was filled with large, intimidating figures who looked more like soldiers than they did athletes. But despite the final outcome, a 4-0 win for the Canadians, Moore had been impressed with the performance of the Russians. He joked to himself that in a few more years, the Russians could even rival Canadian hockey talent.\n\nAfter the game, Moore and his coaches spent the evening at Oktan's residence in Samara, a palace of decadence, with the finest cigars and expensive vodka. As he was boarding the plane to go back to Toronto, he was satisfied with the trip.

 SAM_bunyachenko.1.desc: "The President had had enough of paperwork for the day. His guard, as always, refused him the luxury of wandering the streets of the capital. Far better for his evening walks to be in the presidential palace's gardens. Gardens were a bit too grandiose a word, Bunyachenko thought, for the half finished assembly of shrubs and plants.\n\nWalking loops around the closed garden, the president's thoughts were free to wander beyond the confine of the park. Politics was a new career for him. A soldier's life had been his, after joining the red army as a teenager. Hard fighting in the plains of Ukraine, against the whites and the Ukrainian National Republic. Bunyachenko had been free, then. He and his comrades, fighting for a new Russian nation, freed from archaic tsarism, fighting with the naivety of youth for a better future. After the civil war he had been deployed to central Asia, fighting Basmachi rebels. Different plains, but the same endless blue sky. The president smiled bitterly. Freedom, as always, was wasted on the young.\n\nThe Reds had turned out no better than the Tsar. Endless court politics, as Bukharin's boyars ran roughshod over the country. Ukraine had not been spared their incompetence. Fields of gold, exploited by faceless bureaucrats. Neither had Bunyachenko. Yet he had kept fighting. Accused by the paranoid men in Moscow of failing to win a war their incompetence had caused to be doomed from the start. He had fought on then, naively, too. Being captured by the Germans had merely confirmed the Red's paranoid accusations that he was a traitor.\n\nHe hated the Germans for destroying Russia. Truth be told, however, they had merely ended what the Bukharinists had begun. It felt good to know that the WRRF was dead and buried. Now all the President had to do was to destroy the Germans, kick over their own rotting structure. Perhaps then he would truly be free, innocent in the court of public opinion. Until then he had to keep following orders. Stuck in the presidential palace, Sergey Bunyachenko continued his evening walk round and round his prison's courtyard."

A small band played the Japanese national anthem as Bunyachenko confidently shook the hands of the Japanese delegates before escorting them to a line of gleaming automobiles, surrounded by an honor guard.\n\nPerhaps they expected a ramshackle hovel, the cramped presidential palace of yet another Russian warlord with delusions of grandeur. And, had they wandered beyond the main streets, they might have been correct. But Bunyachenko left nothing to chance: the Japanese sun flag hung from freshly-installed lampposts, while the Japanese emissaries silently watched the meticulously cleaned and spotless cityscape roll past.\n\nThe Japanese were a people of order, of punctuality, of proper appearances. And they were arrogant - an opportunity Bunyachenko would not squander.\n\nMuch later, as Bunyachenko bade the Japanese good night after a sumptuous, extravagant banquet, the Mitsubishi representative laughed drunkenly to his colleagues, forgetting the presence of Bunyachenko's translator: \"If only half the Sphere were as agreeable as these Russians!\" At that moment, he knew that he had them."

With whatever you have, and whatever you can find. Now run the obstacle course.\"\n\nIncredulous, Pavel stood rock still.

Housing was a right for hardworking Russians, the former military man declared over and over in his speeches. As was education. The father saw his children's school books on the table, neatly stacked at the end of the day. Homeworks had been dutifully completed. Dmitry's penmanship was not great for a ten years old. But he had learned to read so fast. If only their mother could have seen all this. The small ones worked so hard.\n\nAt this hour of the day, his only companion was the bottle. A little drink, to soothe the day's pains. He had to take long hours, to keep his children fed, to keep qualifying for free apartments near the train station. The pay was good. What were a few aches at the end of the day? All of Russia was being rebuilt. All of Russia...\n\nThe man caught himself pouring a third glass. He put the bottle back in the keyboards, locked it with a key. It would not do for the little ones to try their father's medicine. The third glass went down easy, quenching his thirst for warmth.\n\nEveryone was working so hard. President Bunyachenko's economic miracle would leave his children a better nation. The father knew, hoped, that the president shared the workers' hard schedule. Many dismissed Bunyachenko as a traitor. The father knew better. All had done terrible things in the Rusisan Anarchy to survive. The father... No, better not follow that line of thought.\n\nThe president claimed things would get better, work shifts would get easier as the industry advanced. The father hoped they would. The daily glass of vodka had turned into two glasses. Three, recently. Burdens had to be carried. Perhaps his generation would be the last lost Rusisan generation. Better try to get some sleep."

From her home-one of the new townhouses on a tree-lined promenade-the car passes rotting apartments and tin sheds. Many of her employees live here. She used to, too, back when she was one of the first woman engineers at Ukhta's main refinery. She slept on the floor, and her daughter slept on their couch. Now, her daughter goes to school in Samara. Every week, Yulechka writes a letter home to her mother. The uniforms at that school make her look quite sharp.\n\nAt the refinery, she marches through halls and across worksites, accompanied by the sycophants that she calls her staff. They supervise the visbrakers and catalytic crackers and pipelines that send oil from Ukhta to... well, to everywhere. The black insignia of Rosneft is emblazoned on storage tanks across western Russia, after all. The Queen, in turn, supervises them. It's a good job. Everyone strives for a good job these days, especially since so few can get them. It gnaws at her, some days. The guilt. The feeling that she has betrayed something, someone.

Light only confirmed shadows, rather than dispel them.\n\nSergey Bunyachenko often paced the halls, away from his working office. What a contrast the central wing made to the president's more spartan quarters! The presidential office in particular was filled with neatly aligned filing cabinets. Golden baubles and other trinkets were for effete civilians. A thought came, unbidden, of Vlasov and his denuded office. The president sneered at the memory of Vlasov waiting for his death, his spirit broken.\n\nIn the distance the capital's lights were turning on one by one. Each day, more lights. Each day, more buildings. More cars. More homes, more factories. More of a future. The economic projections the president had just read hinted at the magnitude of what had been accomplished. Intelligence intercepts from the Pakt, the OFN and the CPS revealed the surprise, joy and consternation abroad at Russia's recovery.\n\nA pair of soldiers stood guard in the next hall. An odd pair, a youngster barely out of basic training, and an older man, from the Moskowien days. The kid was a tall lad. Young men like him all across Russia now had regular access to meat. Improved nutrition had helped them grow strong. They would make fine soldiers. The veteran next to him held his modern assault rifle wearily.
