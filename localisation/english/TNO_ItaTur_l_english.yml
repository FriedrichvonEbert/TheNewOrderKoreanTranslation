#just all the events lol#
itatur.1.t:0 "Operation Black Bull"
itatur.1.d:0 "Yo buddy, you're not meant to be playing Turkey until Penelope's Web releases. These events used to reference Türkeş as the leader, and since he's gone now they don't make sense, so have fun with placeholder loc."
itatur.1.a:0 "We will be victorious!"

itatur.2.t:0 "터키의 승리"
itatur.2.d:0 "Alright gamers we did it, the Italians got totally owned. (GOOD ENDING)"
itatur.2.a:0 "Send the deal!"

itatur.3.t:0 "Italy Holds on"
itatur.3.d:0 "Despite the Turks best efforts, our troops in the Middle East have been able to stem the tide of Turkish forces, and blunt their offensives. Reports from our intelligence networks are that the Turkish govenrment is panicking due to the war dragging out and their economy suffering for it, making this an ample time to send peace terms.\n\nIn the halls of the Grand council, two ways to deal with the Turks have come to prominence. The first is from our Duce Ciano, and is quite moderate. In it, he proposes that we demand reparations from the Turkish government and also a demilitarisation of the Damascus region, to ensure that they cannot threaten our presence in the Middle east again. The other deal, proposed by Ciano's rival in the party, Scorza, is demanding the handing over of some terriotries from the Turks, namely the Damascus region and the Mosul region for Iraq. He argues that the Turks know they are beat and will accept these terms, and that these regions will give us access to new welath and improve relations with our Iraqi allies. All remains is for the council to vote on a deal."
itatur.3.a:0 "Ciano's deal is ratified and sent."
itatur.3.b:0 "Scorza's deal is more appealing, we shall push further to have more leverage."

itatur.30.t:0 "The Empire Remains Strong"
itatur.30.d:0 "As our brave Italian soldiers push further into Turkey, it is apparent that we are victorious. With Damascus held firmly under our control we have more leverage than we previously had.\n\nCarlo Scorza has made it clear to the Grand Council that for Italy's empire to remain strong we must gain new territories. These words of his previously held us off and let us keep the fight going on within the Levant. However now as we have Turkey on their knees, we are finally able to make our demands."
itatur.30.a:0 "Scorza's deal shall be sent to the Turks."

itatur.4.t:0 "İnönü Sends His Demands!"
itatur.4.d:0 "As we have decisively lost in the field of battle in the Middle East, the Turkish president, Ismet İnönü has sent us his demands. In it, he details that in exchange for us keeping the Levant, we will hand over our possesions of the Dodecanese, Cyprus and Lebanon.\n\nIn our current position, we will have no choice but to accept the terms sent to us."
itatur.4.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."

itatur.5.t:0 "Ciano Sends His Demands!"
itatur.5.d:0 "Italy kinda cringe though, don't know why you let them win."
itatur.5.a:0 "I suppose they'll do, send our reply accepting."

itatur.6.t:0 "An Offer on our Desk"
itatur.6.d:0 "Scorza you imbecile we won't accept."
itatur.6.a:0 "We, of course, refuse."

itatur.7.t:0 "Turks Refuse the Offer!"
itatur.7.d:0 "Those damn Turks, they refused our offer! Citing that they still hold the field and that Iraq hasn't even participated in the war, they cannot accept these terms. Now the debate is either whether we try to call their bluff and send it again, or we go to Ciano's more moderate deal."
itatur.7.a:0 "Try and call their bluff - send the same offer once more."
itatur.7.b:0 "Clearly we need to send something more reasonable, offer Ciano's deal instead."

itatur.8.t:0 "Scorza's deal- Take Two"
itatur.8.d:0 "Italy is having a gamer moment."
itatur.8.a:0 "This must be a joke! We refuse, again."

itatur.9.t:0 "The Offer Refused Once Again"
itatur.9.d:0 "The Turks have once again refused Scorza's deal, citing the exact same reasons as last time. In the Grand Council, more and more people are arguing that we should instead use Ciano's, as it is clear that the Turks will under no circumstances accept the deal. Scorza and his most loyal allies in the Council are still doggedly fighting for his deal."
itatur.9.a:0 "Third time's the charm, as the saying goes. Send it again."
itatur.9.b:0 "This is futile, just send Ciano's deal"

itatur.10.t:0 "Scorza's Deal - the Third"
itatur.10.d:0 "Italians are bullying us too much we have to accept :("
itatur.10.a:0 "We have no choice..."

itatur.11.t:0 "A Skirmish in the Sea"
itatur.11.d:0 "Some worrying reports from the naval office in Rhodes. Yesterday, our patrol boats were intercepted by their Turkish counterparts. While their discussions were usually courteous, today they used a loudspeaker to say that the Italian boats were in Turkish waters and therefore violating Turkish sovereignty. An argument ensued, the Italians arguing correctly that they were still in Italian waters as they were only a couple of nautical miles from their base in Rhodes.\n\nSuddenly, the Turkish speakers went silent, and they opened fire on the Italian ships. They returned fire, and the situation escalated from there. The local cruisers were sent out and a tense standoff between the Turkish and Italian fleets occured. After a flurry of transmissions between the naval offices in Rhodes and Marmaris, the fleets stood down and retunred to port, with fortunately no casualties on either side.\n\nThis report seems to confirm our worst suspicions, which is that Turkey is planning on making a move on us and our regions that they hold a claim to. A reinforcement of the area is already in the works and Italian soldiers and naval offices all across the Eastern Mediterranean are on high alert."
itatur.11.a:0 "We must be prepared for the worst."

itatur.12.t:0 "Our troops attacked by the Italians!"
itatur.12.d:0 "Death to Italian imperialism"
itatur.12.a:0 "Step up patrols, and move troops to reinforce the border. War is looming."

itatur.13.t:0 "Unrest in Cyprus"
itatur.13.d:0 "More bad news is pouring in from our Eastern territories.\n\nThe Turkish population in Cyprus has always been unhappy being part of the Italian Empire, and with the recent rise in tensions between our two nations this tension has reached a boiling point.\n\nLocal carabinieri were sent to police an upcoming rally by the Taksimciler, when the rally's organisers turned their ire upon the officers. Soon the rally turned into a riot when the police were pelted with rocks and assaulted by the mob. Reinforcments were called in and despite the Turks best attempts the police held strong, and the rioters eventually dispersed.\n\nThe tensions between Turkey and Italy are very much about to explode, and the Cyprus governorate has declared martial law across the island."
itatur.13.a:0 "At least the Greeks aren't kicking up a fuss..."

itatur.16.t:0 "Triumph in Rhodes!"
itatur.16.d:0 "As the last Italian soldiers scrambled from the Rhodian shore, a decisive victory has been achieved over the Italian forces in the Aegean.\n\nAlthough the Italian forces had been long prepared for inevitable scenario of an attack, stationed forces were able to breach the Italian fortifications that had been installed, enjoying overwhelming air superiority as well as the element of surprise. By first securing the adjacent Isle of Simi, naval forces stationed near the area successfully landed several regiments of infantry along the north-eastern coastline, easily securing the majority of the island. Although minor skirmishes throughout the treacherous terrain continued for another 13 days, organized resistance finally ceased when Italy withdrew all non-captured forces from the island, cementing our position in the newly-acquired city.\n\nWith the capture of the city, as well as the surrounding region, the Turkish navy has significantly greater control over the Aegean.\n\nAs Turkish soldiers march past scattered ancient ruins, many are certain that our triumph in the Aegean is a sign of things to come, as with this victory, the ability for Italy to project its power through the Aegean has been greatly diminished, at least until for the remainder of the war. Through our newly-gained control over the Aegean, we shall be in an excellent position for further incursions into the severely-weakened Italian Aegean. This victory's benefits are twofold, however; as a part of the greater campaign to reclaim disputed claimed territory, this battle has served as an extremely useful media tool. Reports of our victory have been widely publicized in Turkey and Italy alike, and the increased morale will certainly aide us in our campaign in the Middle East."
itatur.16.a:0 "At last, Roda is ours!"

itatur.20.t:0 "Rhodes Falls to the Turks!"
itatur.20.d:0 "Marte's regiment had hardly a day's warning of the most recent Turkish offensive. They found themselves stumbling through the barracks at some ungodly hour at their commander's orders, drifting between consciousness and slumber. The only light above was that of the dim moon.\n\nThe Turkish defense forces were expected to beeline towards Italian military assets on Rhodes, but not with such ferocity or in such a short span of time. A well-practiced combined-arms effort saw the Turks shattering the expectations set by their previous maneuvers in the region. Bypassing the Rhodian Strait and its well-prepared Italian defenses, the Turkish navy was able to secure the Isle of Simi north of Rhodes and then leverage their advantage to launch a coordinated night attack that saw the north-east of Rhodes falling to small infantry contingents supported by overwhelming airpower. But Marte and his regiment would only find that out weeks later, in newspaper columns gleefully read aloud by the Turkish officers.\n\nAll they knew at the time was that a small Turkish force had managed to somehow land on the island, but without the means to supply itself or pose a serious threat to Italian possessions. The night skirmish by Kremasti and the harrowing defeat the Italians suffered was not a fluke, nor a single incident, but a sign of things to come. Similar maneuvers had been taking place north in the Italian dioceses, and Italy's grip on the Aegean was not expected to recover from the losses incurred during the Turkish Aegean campaign - not during the course of the war, at least. Marte and what remained of his regiment later found out that Rhodes as a whole had held on for roughly 13 days before Italian forces were forced to evacuate the island, leaving him and the rest of the men captured by the Turks to their fate, learning of the war's progress from newspaper columns and the mood of the prison camp's commanding officer during the morning rollcall."
itatur.20.a:0 "This is a Disaster!"

itatur.100.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]사막의 전쟁"
itatur.100.d:0 "Ever since the Second World War ended, Turkey has never been pleased with their share of the spoils; far too many Turks ended up outside of their borders. These long simmering tensions have exploded today, as Turkish president Ismet İnönü has announced that a state of war now exists between the Turkish Republic and the Italian Empire.\n\nDespite being former allies, the war has already proven extremely popular in Turkey. Young nationalists march through the streets of Ankara, calling on İnönü to "Lead Us to Victory". Comparatively, in Italy the public has shown little to no support for the war, with many questioning why Italy is even in Cyprus in the first place."
itatur.100.a:0 "또 다른 제국주의자의 전쟁이군." 
itatur.100.b:0 "We will crush them." 
itatur.100.c:0 "What a way to treat a former ally." 

itatur.21.t:0 "Italian Victory in Rhodes"
itatur.21.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, our forces have successfully repelled the Turkish advance into Rhodes. Though the short conflict was simply part of a larger effort by the Turks to conquer long claimed territories in the chaos following the collapse of the Triumvirate, the victory has been widely publicized by the press and celebrated in Rome.\n\n"The bravery of the Italian army can withstand any attack!" Ciano said in a speech from the capital. "The Turks could not defeat us in Rhodes and they will not defeat us in the Levant!"\n\nThis success hardly assures victory in the Middle East or the continued glory of the Empire, but in Rhodes, at least, the Italian banner still flies."
itatur.21.a:0 "Viva L'Italia!"
