 ZAR_idea_warlord_state:0 "군벌 국가"
 ZAR_idea_warlord_state_desc: ""군벌 국가"라는 단어는 이제 어디서든지 볼 수 있습니다. Used to describe countless statelets, it is a simple label that often conceals a more complicated situation. In Zarmaland, this is not the case. Seyni Kountché and his army form the entirety of Zarmaland's government, the land of Zarmaland made up only of the territory they have seized. To many, it is a wonder that Kountché has achieved any success in his revolt against Sokoto, and few expect Zarmaland will stick around any longer than he does."
 ZAR_idea_deficient_administration:0 "부족한 행정"
 ZAR_idea_deficient_administration_desc: "To put it simply, the administration of Zarmaland doesn't exist. Kountché's army exerts a brutal control over the country, suppressing any signs of unrest and stealing anything they fancy under the guise of taxation. Due to the hesitance of local officials to join such a violent and unstable government, and Kountché's distrust of all but a few of his closest officers, Zarmaland's government seems destined to remain tiny and ineffective."

 POLITICS_SEYNI_KOUNTCHE_DESC:0 "자르마인은 한 떄 단순히 프랑스인의 군홧발 아래에서 살아남은 사람들로 귀족들은 발전하고 거래하며 문제를 피하며 살아남기 위해 무슨 수라도 전부 썼습니다. 하지만 지금은 자르마를 자유로 인도할 의지와 방법을 갖춘 지도자가 있습니다. Seyni Kountché is that man, a man with history connected to the Zarma, who brings the people of Zarmaland the strength to face down those who are enemies to the Zarma, like Issa Korombé and his struggle against the Fulani. However, that's but a façade. Seyni Kountché was but a man in the right place at the right time. Born the heir to the Zarmakoy Tondikandie, the heavily stratified Zarma society always held Kountché and his family in high regard, and the young man entered into training in the West African branch of the French army quite early. He slowly rose through the ranks in the Free French army after the mainland fell.\n\nThen the bombs started falling. As the Free French were slowly beaten back, Kountché became aware of the fact that the Zarma were without a leader, and that this could be an easy way to get power. He took his opportunity quickly, leveraging his place as the nobility to rile the Zarma underneath him, establishing it as his domain in West Africa as the Luftwaffe destroyed all around them. This land, however, happened to be within the borders of the Sultanate of Sokoto, but what could they do about it? Hell was raining from the skies, there was no way to prevent this man from calling this land his own. One day, however, the bombings stopped. The Sokoto were weak, and more importantly, many of their army were Zarma. A speech here and there, and allies flocked to their side. Months after the bombing stopped, Kountché declared an independent Zarma state from Sokoto. But Kountché's control appears to be coming to an end. The people hate him and his deputies hate him even more. It seems that Kountché needs to make some difficult choices to remain in power..."
