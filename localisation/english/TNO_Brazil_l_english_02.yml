 ## Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_DESC: "Known as \"The Man who swept Brazil,\" Jânio Quadros is a unique figure within the Brazilian political system and has reached heights that many said he would never achieve. Born in Mato Grosso but raised in Curitiba, he would later move to São Paulo and study Law. Quadros entered politics in 1947, a man who disliked the Estado Novo regime for its growing authoritarianism, deciding to dedicate himself against it. With the collapse of the Estado Novo in 1949, Quadros was ecstatic believing that he himself had delivered a major blow to the regime and it deepened his passion for politics.\n\nHe would continue his career in politics, becoming a well known anti-corruption crusader who claimed to fight against corruption in all forms in Brazil. While he won the mayorship of São Paulo, he lost the governorship race by one percentage vote against Adhemar de Barros. However, this did not stop him and he declared he would persevere and sweep away corruption with a broom.\n\nIn 1960 he ran for the Vice Presidency of Brazil on a combined ticket of many political parties, including the PTN, UDN and PDC, plus other minor ones. In this election, Quadros outperformed his presidential running mate and reached the heights of the Vice-Presidency. Had it not been for the man to win the Presidency, Henrique Teixeira Lott, Quadros would have probably been able to have his way in pursuing whatever path he felt like pursuing, but instead he finds himself every day in a constant tug-of-war with Lott for domination over the other, which had prevented him from enacting most of his promises.\n\nHowever this has changed now he has become President and now has the political power to enact what he wants. He has maintained his exhibitionist, dramatic and demagogic ways, annoying many who say Quadros will, in the end, fail to implement his plans. But he continues, ever stubbornly, to say that he will erradicate the corruption of the Brazilian State or die trying..." #remind me to fix this after the teaser -oveja
 POLITICS_TEIXEIRA_LOTT_DESC: "Henrique Teixeira Lott, the 22nd President of Brazil is in his heart still a military man. Lott developed his military career over the span of four decades. Not through nepotistic appointments, but using skill.\n\nWith the entry of Brazil into the Second World War, Lott was sent as a military attaché to America. However, history would force Lott deeper into the war. With the German invasion of Britain, Lott would work closely with Field Marshal Mascarenhas de Morais in commanding the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. Yet despite their best efforts, the island would fall and Brazil was forced to retreat. Lott would be promoted for his efforts, becoming a Brigadier General, and praised as a war hero. Lott worked on plans to defend Brazil from outside invasion, maintaining his ties to the Americans. As the Estado Novo regime fell in 1949, Lott would be one of those standing among Vargas' close circle of advisers. Deciding to act instead of going with his arms crossed, Lott proved instrumental in reaching an agreement that guaranteed elections would be held and Vargas was unharmed. He was personally involved in making sure that this agreement was maintained as he warned radical members of the military to allow the transition of power to occur.\n\nLott would be the minister of war throughout the fifties for both Eduardo Gomes and Juscelino Kubitschek's government. Lott, known for his dedication, stopped a coup attempt in 1955 ensuring that Brazilian democracy would survive and prosper. In 1960 Lott himself ran for the presidency, winning under the banner of the PSD. Lott now leads the largest nation in South America, however, Lott is still a General at heart, not a politician. Issues that plague Brazil, such as rampant inflation, he has been unable to deal with effectively. This combined with the fact that Jânio Quadros won the Vice-Presidency, a man with very different ideas for Brazil than Lott, turns governing into a challenge just as big as the wars that Lott fought in."
 POLITICS_Joao_Goulart_DESC: "João Goulart knows the political establishment dislikes him, but he doesn't care. Born in the rural south, Goulart became a skilled businessman and gained a passion for swimming and football. Goulart almost didn't enter politics, considering a career in football. This dream was shattered due to Goulart's bohemian lifestyle and catching syphilis, causing paralysis in his left knee that never healed. Goulart entered a depression, where he lacked a vision for what he would do. Seeing how the poor were treated throughout Brazil, he decided that he would fix this.\n\nGoulart thrust himself into politics, meeting with Vargas himself and joining the PTB. He used his personal wealth to support his political ambitions and ran for the Chamber of Deputies and gained a seat. During his campaigning, he met two important figures. Leonel Brizola a key political ally and a good friend, and his future wife Maria Thereza. With Brizola, each rose rapidly in the PTB and took control of it.\n\nWhen Kubitschek approached the PTB for a political alliance in the 55 elections and Goulart to be his running mate, Goulart accepted. With the victory, the PTB's influence and power grew. Goulart ran with Henrique Lott for the '60 elections, but was stopped by Jânio Quadros who narrowly won the election for Vice President. After a brief depressive period, Maria convinced Goulart to run in the Chamber of Deputies, where he would win the election and become its leader.\n\nGoulart's career has reached its inevitable end, the presidency. His drive and ambition has not stopped and he has remained a humble man, wanting to aid the poor. With Brizola, Edna Lott and others by his side, Goulart aims to build a better Brazil for all Brazilian's. However enemies are everywhere and they wish to destroy Goulart, but Goulart knows that he can not fail. For the good of Brazil and the good of the poor, he must not fail."
 POLITICS_Humberto_Castelo_Branco_DESC: "What goes through the mind of a man who has betrayed an oath? Does he feel guilt or does he justify it? For Castelo Branco the answer is both. Born to a rich army family, it was only natural that he would eventually join the army as well, enrolling in 1918. A skilled soldier shown by him placing first in his class of the General staff school, Humberto rose through the ranks gaining promotions due to skill not nepotism.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Humberto was part of the Brazilian expeditionary force and was involved in the British campaign and he showed his ability in commanding and planning. But skill wasn't enough and Brazil would be defeated and forced to retreat. This is what created a sense of disdain for fascism in Humberto's eyes, too many good Brazilian soldiers had died to fascism. With an already deep dislike of communism, Humberto would fight against both when he returned home.\n\nWith the birth of the fourth republic, Humberto worked with Lott in the early part of the republic, supporting his efforts to ensure the inauguration of Kubitschek took place. It would only be later when Lott was being hailed by communists and perfidious trade unionists as a savior, that Humberto turned against the President. His leadership of the Sorbonne faction drove a deeper wedge between the two, and their relationship would be destroyed by leading the military coup after the 100 days of chaos."
 POLITICS_Adhemar_de_Barros_DESC: "Adhemar de Barros is a politician of contradictions, a populist that uses left-wing language but gets along with elites. A man who can connect with the working class but is highly educated and rich. A playful populist but a great planner. Adhemar is not a man whose ideology can be fit into one box, thus he is called an 'Adhemarist' a man whose only ideology is what is best for Adhemar.\n\nBorn in a family of traditional coffee farmers, Adhemar quickly rose. Graduating with a degree of medicine in 1923. He traveled to Europe and America becoming an aviator and learning multiple languages. He stopped practicing after the constitutionalist revolution of 1932 where he fought for his state, when his state lost he traveled to Paraguay and fought with them as a doctor in the Chaco War. He would return to Brazil and became a state deputy in São Paulo, until Vargas instituted his Estado Novo regime and closed the legislative houses down.\n\nHowever this was not the end of his political career, Adhemar became an intervener in São Paulo and helped govern the state. From this point on, São Paulo and Adhemars destinies were tied as Adhemar advanced his career in São Paulo. He has been governor of the state three times and when he hasn't his political control of the state has still been strong. He has also run for the Presidency twice before, in 1955 and 60, each attempt gaining more than the last, and now Adhemar has succeeded, he is President.\n\nAllegations of corruption, nepotism, bribery and other crimes can sink other politicians. Adhemar has had hundreds of accusations but none have sunk them. In fact he has turned them into a weapon against his critics. Yes he may steal, but he delivers. He has bet that the people of Brazil want someone corrupt who does work, than one who does nothing. So far he has been right."
 POLITICS_Carlos_Lacerda_DESC: "If you had told Lacerda in 1940 where he would be in 20 years he would have stated that you were a lying fascist. Despite this Lacerda would eventually become what he once hated most, a conservative. The child of left-wingers, Lacerda too was a communist in his youth and early adulthood. He turned against the idea after Germany destroyed the Soviet Union. Lacerda blamed the ideology of communism for the victory of the Germans in the Second World War. This disillusionment caused Lacerda to search for an ideology that would give Brazil a strong foundation, he settled on Social conservatism and economic liberalism.\n\nFollowing the war, he became one of Vargas' arch-nemesis, founding the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa to attack Vargas. For this Lacerda became known as the anti-Getúlio and was one of the main factors for the fall of Vargas, with the fallout of an attempted assassination on Lacerda being the final straw for the regime.\n\nLacerda became a strong supporter of Eduardo Gomes and joined the UDN, seeing this as the party that would build a stronger Brazil. The victory of the Kubitschek/Goulart ticket in 1955 was a direct threat to the future of Brazil in Lacerda's eyes. He joined the plot of 55 to prevent their inauguration. While this failed and he was let go with a slap on the wrist, Lacerda continued to scheme and was a fierce opponent of Kubitschek, Goulart, and then Lott, working with Quadros and Adhemar in alliances of convenience to attack their enemies.\n\nThe position of Governor of Guanabara was merely a stepping stone to his actual ambition which he has fulfilled, the presidency of Brazil. With this position, Lacerda will not fail as his predecessors have, he will create a strong Brazil to resist totalitarianism or he will die trying."
 POLITICS_Juscelino_Kubitschek_DESC: "The life of Kubitschek is what he describes as the dream of Brazil, to rise from a poor family to the Presidency itself. Raised by his mother, due to his father dying from tuberculosis while JK was two. JK would persevere, gaining an education and later becoming a licensed medical doctor. In 1930 he would travel around Europe, missing the events of the revolution that occurred in 1930 cementing Vargas' rise to power. Once news of this arrived, JK traveled back to Brazil and on his arrival asked his future wife, Sarah Kubitschek to marry him.\n\nKubitschek entered into politics in Minas Gerias and advanced quickly. He became known for his professional nature and his signature infrastructure and architecture programs. It would be during this time period where he had a child Marcia in 1943 and adopted another Maria in 1947. He also met the architect Oscar Niemeyer that he would cooperate closely with.\n\nAs the war ended JK supported Vargas to the very end being a key ally that Vargas could rely on. With the restoration of democracy, he decided to carry on Vargas' legacy and ran for the legislature in the PSD. He became a popular figure and was the PSD candidate for the 1955 elections. He negotiated with the PTB and João Goulart to run on a joint ticket and support each other. JK won a decisive victory and with Lott's help stopped an attempted coup.\n\nPresident Kubitschek focused on infrastructure programs and the construction of Brasília using the architect Oscar to design the city. He promised 50 years of progress in five and to the PSD and many Brazilians, he achieved it. Now President again, Kubitschek promises another decade of progress in a few years. However his ambition may be more than he can achieve within the few years he has, and certain business in Rio distracts him from the political sphere in Brasília."
 POLITICS_Auro_de_Moura_Andrade_DESC: "Auro Andrade, hated by the center, right and left due to his actions, but a political giant in his own right. The son of the king of Cattle Antônio, Auro first entered the political sphere in the constitutionalist revolt of 1932 and after continued it becoming an enemy of the Vargas government with his charismatic speeches and business connections. With Vargas' fall and the birth of the Fourth Republic, Auro ran for senator of São Paulo and has remained in the Senate since.\n\nWhen he woke up one day and saw a letter with the words Be prepared on it, Auro was ready for what was to come. What followed next was a shock to nearly everyone in Brazil but not to Auro, the resignation of Lott, and Auro working against both Quadros and Goulart to become President. An unprecedented act from a so-called moderate center of the Senate. But to Auro to allow either Quadros or Goulart to become President would be dooming Brazil to either incompetence or communism. Auro saw himself as the one man who could stop this and he did.\n\nAuro seized the moment and while Brazil has fallen into chaos, Auro believes that a better Brazil will be forged out of these fires. Or at least a Brazil where Quadros or Goulart are not President. Despite the hatred thrown at him, Auro continues his current actions. The senate and nation is too divided to remove him, and soon they will be out of time to stop him."
 POLITICS_COSTA_E_SILVA_DESC: "A son of Portuguese immigrants, Artur da Costa e Silva's life is inseparable from his career in the Brazilian Army. An exemplary student in military school, he graduated with top marks and quickly rose in the ranks, becoming general in 1955, and was given command of the 3rd Military Region in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, later being promoted to the rank of marshal. While his life is inseparable from the military, it is also inseparable from his alignment with the Hardliner faction inside the Armed Forces.\n\nCosta e Silva became known as a fierce supporter of the Hardliners, and soon would be the main leader of this faction. He views the legacy of the previous democratic presidents as one of failures and weaknesses, and only the strong hand of the Armed Forces can correct the country's course. While he initially joined Humberto Castelo Branco and the Sorbonne in the coup that ended civilian rule in Brazil, Humberto's desire to return power to the civilians was a sore point between the two, and the gap between Sorbonne and Hardliners widened. However, Castelo Branco overplayed his hand. In an attempt to fire Costa e Silva and solidify his control, his plan backfired, and through a series of telephone calls, Artur da Costa e Silva organized an internal coup, removing Castelo Branco from the Presidency.\n\nNow, with the presidential sash upon his shoulders, Costa e Silva is ready to defend his country against all threats, especially from terrorists and dissidents on both the left and the right. The Hardliner Marshal will do anything to correct mistakes done by the previous administrations and plans to extend security and stability across the country, aiming to mend the wounds Castelo Branco's cowardice left behind."
 POLITICS_RANIERI_MAZZILLI_DESC: "Brazilian democracy is dead. Its death was not an uncommon one - yet it remains bitterly tragic nonetheless. The military, sworn to protect that most sacred of institutions, turned its idle hands against its beloved patron, like Cain's betrayal of old. What shallow veneer of democracy that the military kept dissolved into pointless bickering and petty factionalism before being cast to the wind by the Generals. Dissolving the Senate is one thing, but leaving the state apparatus headless is another. So, who should be the esteemed President of Brazil?\n\nBorn to an Italian immigrant father in 1910, Ranieri Mazzilli lived in modest circumstances. Ascending the social ladder, from a simple tax collector to director of the National Public Treasury of Rio de Janeiro, his big break was yet to come. Chief of Staff to the Minister of Finance. The PSD 's Federal Deputy to São Paulo. Not once, not twice but five different times. It was only inevitable that, in 1959, the invitation to assume the Vice Presidency of the Chamber of Deputies came to him.\n\nNormally the story would end there. A modest, hardworking man gets to a point of power, where he helps to govern efficiently and benevolently. Yet, fate is a cruel and caring mistress. With the military "intervention" and the collapse of the Senado, Mazzilli has been given the privilege of becoming the interim President. While the military decides amongst themselves who shall lead, Ranieri's job is to put out fires wherever they emerge. Now torn between party loyalty and national pride, Mazilli is a prisoner of his own patriotism."

 BRA_pl_unknown_bill: "§YUnknown Bill§!"

 BRA_pl_bill_1: "§V국가전기법§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_1: "One of the major factors that exacerbates the current energy crisis in Brazil is the fact that a substantial fraction of the electrical infrastructure is owned by foreign corporations. Poorer and rural citizens bear the brunt of this injustice. This bill will nationalize these electrical corporations in order to provide electricity at low cost to the people."

 BRA_pl_bill_2: "§V투표권법§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_2: "Our Republic is supposedly "democratic", but there is very good reason to doubt this when the illiterate, low-ranking military officers, and other marginalized groups are denied the vote. Accordingly, in order to promote the interests of democracy, this bill will expand the franchise to all Brazilian citizens without exception."

 BRA_pl_bill_3: "§QThe African Surge Resolution§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_3: "The war against the Reichskommissariate in southern Africa continues to rage; the conflict with the three German colonial tyrannies is nowhere near over. It is clear to any observer that additional support will be required if we are to drive the so-called "Aryan master race" back from the South African border. This law will send more reinforcements to the frontier so as to ensure that the Hitlerites are driven back."

 BRA_pl_bill_4: "§QThe Unwavering Torch Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_4: "In light of the unprecedented German aggression witnessed in South Africa and other places in the last two years, Brazil must find allies; the Americans and their Organization of Free Nations could not be better candidates for this. This bill gives the legislatures support and consent and thus arranges for Brazil's immediate admittance to the Organization of Free Nations as a full member."

 BRA_pl_bill_5: "§YThe Highway to Prosperity Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_5: "The Trans-Amazonian Highway connecting Brazil to its hinterlands and to the rest of South America has languished for lack of resources and funding since the fall of the Lott government. This bill will restore the lost funding and provide more money with a view on seeing the project through to completion. Whatever is required, Brazil will provide."
 
 BRA_pl_bill_6: "§KThe South Africa Withdrawal Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_6: "Brazilian blood has been shed on South African soil for a useless proxy boxing match between America and Germany. Ships and ships of Brazil's youth and treasures have been sent east, to no return. No more. This act, proposed by President Quadros, will bring our boys home from the lawless hellhole of Africa and save them from having to play the catspaw for America. As the act to enter South Africa was passed overwhelmingly by Congress, Quadros must ensure a act to ensure Brazil withdrawal from South Africa can also pass. Otherwise he will lack the legislatures approval and consent to do so. While Quadros could just ignore the legislature, arguing directly to the supreme court that they have no authority over foriegn policy, it would be best to pass this bill through the legislature to prevent any unneeded political battles."

 BRA_pl_bill_7: "§KThe Lott Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_7: "This bill will once and for all prevent armed forces interference in Brazilian politics by setting new ground rules for military officers and harshly enforcing the rules already on the books to kick politics out of the armed forces and protect democracy in the Republic of Brazil. If it goes through, the Constitutionalists in our military will finally be empowered to help ensure our military fully embraces its rightful role of "uniformed civilians" and nothing more or less."

 BRA_pl_bill_8: "§KThe Agrarian Relief Act§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_8: "This bill aims to begin the process of agrarian reform. We will redistribute land from inefficient, money-gorged landowners such as ranchers and hand it over to more deserving people - smallholders, peasants - who know the land more intimately and are better-placed to make sure it prospers. The bill also has emergency relief and loans to ensure the agriculutural sector does not suffer but continues to grow and improve. This will also hopefully also put an end to the protests currently paralyzing our country."
 
 BRA_pl_bill_9: "§KEntry into the Andean Pact§!"
 BRA_pl_bill_desc_9: "Ferocious debates are taking place all over the Republic of the United States of Brazil as the ratification of the treaty for Brazilian entry into the Andean Pact is debated in the Congresso Nacional. The stakes are quite high: if the treaty is ratified, it means that Brazil will enter the Andean Pact as a full member. This will subject it to all that was agreed to in the negotiations. As the lists of people that support and oppose this move are large and often transcend party lines, careful political manoeuvring will be required to see this treaty ratification through."

 # BRA_lottquadros_category_description: "Following the 1960 Presidential elections, the office of President and Vice-President were held by two differing tickets. The President's office held by §KTeixeira Lott§!, supported by the §YPSD§! and §VPTB§!. The Vice-President's is held by §QJânio Quadros§! supported by numerous right-wing, chiefly being the §QUDN§!, and other smaller parties. Their differences have caused tension between the two over the course of the term. While both have promised to work effectively with the other, what has instead developed is a power struggle between the two with both candidates wishing to push forward their agenda with what power they have. The power struggle over influence will continue, as long as the two continue to conflict over policies and their political and personal relationship change, for better or for worse."

 # Parties Description
 BRA_party_psd_desc: "The PSD is a liberal party seeking to represent the centrist current of Brazilian politics aligned with Varguism, and is one of the major political parties in Brazil. The party relies on agrarianism and a powerful network of political influence in rural areas to maintain its main support base, and functions as a middle point of compromise in Brazilian political issues. Many Brazilian political heavyweights such as Henrique Lott, Juscelino Kubitscheck, and Tancredo Neves are PSD members. Since 1955, the PSD has been in a coalition with the PTB, and both parties vote on key issues, campaign, and watch each other's back together."
 BRA_party_ptb_desc: "The PTB is a social democratic party seeking to represent the left wing current of Brazilian Politics that supports the ideals of Varguism. Formed by Vargas after his removal from power, it has become a dominant but controversial force in Brazilian politics. Many Brazilians see the PTB as nothing but communists in pink clothing, while others believe that the PTB when in power will restore the worst policies of Estado Novo. The PTB is divided into three parts, the ideology led the President of the party Vargas and Joao Goulart, advocating for left wing populst policies, the left wing nationalist faction led by Leonel Brizola, and a small center left Christian democratic wing. The PTB gathers most of its support from cities, unions, the working class and the poor. Since 1955 it has been working in a electoral pact with the PSD for the benefit of both parties."
 BRA_party_udn_desc: "The UDN is the mainstream right-wing party and one of the major political parties in Brazil, gathering groups between classical liberals, to hardline conservatives, to progressives, though the main thing keeping them united is perhaps their opposition to the demagogic populism that they see in Varguism. Unlike the PSD or the PTB, the UDN doesn't cater to one specific social class or group, instead seeking to appeal to the diverse pool of interests aligned with the right-wing. Its most notable members are the iconic media personalities Jânio Quadros and Carlos Lacerda."
 BRA_party_psp_desc: "The PSP is a center-left party and one of the major political parties in Brazil. United around their leader Adhemar de Barros and his populist platform, the exact ideology of the PSP is hard to define. The party's rhetoric is generally populistic and receives support from the poor of São Paulo, but gathers much of its strength from the social elites, and due to São Paulo being Brazil's most populous state, their numerical adherence is quite high. Outside of de Barros, its most notable member is Getúlio Vargas Filho, the son of the former president."
 BRA_party_prp_desc: "The Partido de Representação Popular, the brainchild of the currently exiled right-wing ideologue Plínio Salgado, is the foremost Integralist and far right party in Brazil's political ecosystem. This limited success, however, is not representative of its actual political standing; the PRP's only source of notable influence is a small but growing following among sympathetic members of the Brazilian Armed Forces. Nevertheless, its support base, concentrated in the South Region, shelters active and motivated Integralists who subscribe to the party line of Catholic traditionalism, Brazilian nationalism, anti-liberalism, and anti-communism. Additionally, a faction of Italian-style fascists led by interim party head Miguel Reale is attempting to supplant the party's Integralist platform. That the government suppresses the PRP should come as no surprise."
 BRA_party_pdc_desc: "One of the most successful minor parties, the Partido Democrata Cristão is a bastion of moderate conservative political thought. The PDC, led by Ney Braga, champions a strain of Christian democracy informed by Pope Leo XIII's pro-labor Rerum novarum. Union-friendly policy, administrative decentralization and the readjustment of wages to the cost of living all feature prominently in the PDC's lengthy manifestos. However, the most notable personality the party has produced no longer subscribes to its program; Jânio Quadros won the mayorship of São Paulo on the PDC's ticket but left to pursue the Vice-Presidency. Nevertheless, the PDC has endured, and likely will still endure, as a moderately influential, small center-right party."
 BRA_party_ptn_desc: "The PTN is a right-wing party and a minor party most successful in São Paulo. Its platform is conservative and traditionalist, but they have a flexible relationship with many of the major and minor parties. Because of this, they often support most presidential candidates and help form coalitions to assist them in elections. They recently helped elect Jânio Quadros to the position of vice president in a broad conservative coalition."
 BRA_party_pst_desc: "The PST is a center-left party and a minor party formed as a splinter faction of the PSD. While it promotes a social democratic, populist, and laborist platform, the PST is more of a home for many dissidents of major parties, who often run on a PST ticket."
 BRA_party_psb_desc: "The PSB is a left-wing party and a minor party home to many trade unionists and intellectuals. Uniting democratic socialists, social democrats, and Christian socialists, they are closely aligned with the UDN in their mutual opposition to Varguism. It promotes a cautious and reformist approach to socialism, hoping for gradual socialization of the state through reforms to the capitalist system."
 BRA_party_pr_desc: "The PR is a center-right party and a minor party created by former President Artur da Silva Bernandes. A proudly republican party promoting federalism and Brazilian nationalism, it regularly works with the PSD and UDN. It seeks to defend the Republic by preserving federalist autonomy, promotes separation of powers, bicameralism, and universal suffrage, and wants to prohibit the President and state governors from running for reelection. Economically, it promotes state interventionism and industrial decentralization."
 BRA_party_pl_desc: "The PL is a center-right party and a minor party strongest in Rio Grande del Sul, but sees occasional success in the north. The PL's liberal conservative platform emphasizes federalism and parliamentarism. Due to its power base in Rio Grande del Sul, it is known as a 'gaucho party' and appeals to gauchos in the pampa and rural regions. It seeks to promote and defend parliamentary democracy in Brazil, and advocates a bicameral parliament to replace the current presidential system."

 BRA_military_elections.1.t: "The Crow's Head Start"
 BRA_military_elections.1.desc: "A military spokesperson announced today on television the beginning of election season for the Presidential and Vice-Presidential offices, which would conclude in 135 days. While many breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Brazil's democracy would still live on, the real truth of the elections had begun manifesting itself several weeks ago.\n\nThe military, in order to ensure that a leftist candidate could never see power again, began extensive preparations. Candidates throughout Brazil were denied from running for office. In their place were various candidates that people had never heard of before, nor seen in their community, but people knew better than to ask questions. For some reason, there were a large amount of candidates running for various offices, but no matter the district, there was always only one UDN candidate running in a crowded field. While everyone else offered confusing and conflicting messages, UDN candidates offered a unified vision, and voters were flocking to that in far greater numbers. Carlos Lacerda, the presidential candidate for the UDN, was polling around 20 points above within just a week of election season.\n\nThe blatant subversion was not lost on the former President of the Republic, Juscelino Kubitschek. On one hand, he was grateful that the military even allowed him to run in the first place. On the other hand, it was purely for show and, he thought, a waste of his time. But he realized that there was nothing standing between the UDN and a dictatorial, one-party state except for him. If the military wanted a fight during election season, well, they'll get it from the former President. Just because the odds were stacked against him, doesn't mean that he shouldn't try. They told him the same when he wanted to build Brasília, and he didn't listen. Both men knew the stakes at hand."

 BRA_military_elections.1.a_tt: "Campaigns for §QCarlos Lacerda§! are now available in the Presidente Elections panel!"

 BRA_military_elections.5.t: "Kubitschek's Kicking In"
 BRA_military_elections.5.desc: "A win, a loss, a win, a loss, rinse and repeat. The votes kept landing on Kubitschek's lap in thick sheafs, each conveying an identical conclusion in consistently novel permutations: he and Lacerda were even. For hours he watched the numbers scramble over each other, climbing higher and higher to decide the election in a seemingly endless flurry of papers and figures until Tancredo Neves gripped his shoulder.\n\nThe counting had stopped. Kubitschek had won.\n\nHis nervous grin shifted into a radiant smile, the President-elect constricted Neves in a fulsome hug. "A chance in Hell was all I needed!" Kubitschek chimed, and the two advanced into the cheering throng of their supporters. Members of the congressional caucus, old and new, cut through to shake Kubitschek's hand, but he ignored their attempts at endearment and hurriedly took to the celebrations.\n\nKubitschek was not alone in his jubilation, his enthusiasm had spread to all corners of Brazil. Hundreds of thousands sang in the streets, drowning out the fulminations of Lacerda's supporters. The anguish, the joy, the clashes and the fights mixed into a great national noise, but the songs of the Republic cut through it all.\n\nExhausted and only slightly drunk, Kubitschek and Neves trained their eyes on the television's election coverage, the only unblemished surface in the vandalized party room. "Some of them are saying it's rigged," Neves slurred. The President-elect flashed a big, stupid grin.\n\n"They know that, that's why they voted for me!""
 BRA_military_elections.5.a: "Tyranny is a passing affliction."

 BRA_military_elections.6.t: "Carlos Lacerda, Spirit of Prometheus"
 BRA_military_elections.6.desc: "The numbers kept coming and Lacerda was still in front. He took little comfort from it. What could Kubitschek pull, how could he still win? A knot of schemes meant nothing to him, he'd follow after Alexander and cut through it with a sword of optimistic charm. Campaigning against him was like catching smoke. Beating him, to Lacerda, was the same.\n\nAppropriately, he followed after the Greeks, and stole the fire.\n\nThe new PSD candidates had dragged Kubitschek down. Where they had sprung, he hemorrhaged votes, and Lacerda barreled in front further until the final tally arrived and it seemed as if the PSD had never contested some areas at all. The UDN had won! Lacerda had won!\n\n"We got him!" Lacerda yelled. His caucus met his cry with booming cheers and full glasses, and they caroused to the symphony of clinking glass and televised celebrations. Lacerda's supporters flooded the streets in the tens of thousands, the uncommon throng of protestors trailing after them with placards held high, but their noise dissipated as the day went.\n\nFrom his own uninvolving conversation, Lacerda took notice of the television. A sprinting cameraman struggled to keep a brawl in frame, a clash between his and Kubitschek's supporters - a blemish on a great day. Lacerda smiled and abandoned the droning of a functionary for the company of his advisors."

 BRA_military_elections.8.t: "Inauguration Amid Chaos"
 BRA_military_elections.8.desc: "The Brasília garrison was aflame. News had just reached them that Juscelino Kubitscheck's presidential convoy had suffered a bomb attack on the way to his inauguration, and the President-elect himself was dead. One colonel yammered on about "those spineless politicians that had failed the nation". The officers saw the country as leaderless and paralyzed. Finally, they decided that the troops should march to the Monumental Axis and seize the Presidential Palace and Congress.\n\nReports of Juscelino's death spread like wildfire, and by the time the garrison marched, protestors had already taken to the streets and gathered between the Ministries' buildings, fiercely opposing the local police, even as checkpoints were set up all across major avenues. Repression increased for the better part of the afternoon, and clashes with protestors grew more violent by the hour. The garrison's officers stood confused when a heavily armed convoy showed itself and dumbfounded when Marshal Castelo Branco himself stepped out of an armored car, with a noticeably shaken, but still alive and unharmed, President-elect Juscelino Kubitscheck by his side.\n\n"Who is in command here?", questioned the Marshal, with the disapproving tone he was known for. No one came forward. "I will not ask again. No orders came from my office and none of my fellow generals approved this. This farce is an affront to the Armed Forces' authority. President Juscelino is alive and well, as all may see, and the lot of you will be brought into custody for insubordination."\n\nDemoralized, the garrison surrendered. Castelo Branco's troops dispersed the protestors, and preparations for Juscelino's inauguration could finally begin. The ceremony took place in the Senate, where Juscelino vowed to reinstate an age of stability, promising Order and Progress for the people of Brazil, with guidance from the Armed Forces."
 BRA_military_elections.8.a: "Pomp and chaos collide."

 BRA_military_elections.9.t: "Inauguration from Safety"
 BRA_military_elections.9.desc: "President "elect" Carlos Lacerda was waiting on the back seat of the Presidential Rolls Royce inside the Brasilia Air Force Base, being kept there for his own protection as the city devolved into chaos. A general strike had been declared, and a million workers were on the streets of every major city. Talk on the base was that would be one more attempt by the Communist Party and their fellow travelers in the PTB, led by Brizola and Goulart, to destabilize the upcoming Presidency and their military allies, paving the way for the takeover of Brazil.\n\nThe Air Force's helicopters circled around the city, looking for suspects as the Military Police cavalry charged upon protesters blocking the way to the presidential palace, clearing the barricades while infantry soldiers were deployed to the Monumental Axis to try to restore control of the city.\n\nGeneral Castelo Branco brought the news to President Lacerda: There were just not enough troops to guarantee the safety of the Presidential Motorcade. He was to be inaugurated at the Brasilia Air Force base while they waited for reinforcements to arrive.\n\nLacerda was furious at the news, but he knew he had nothing to do. As he was being inaugurated, surrounded by military officers, Lacerda thought about Kubischeck and the construction of Brasilia. He had criticized him when he was building this city, but deep down, he knew that he wouldn't survive a riot like this in Rio."

 BRA_open_brasilia: "브라질리아 개방"
 BRA_open_brasilia_desc: "Juscelino Kubitschek's greatest work, the construction of the city of Brasília, is at last completed. Constructed in just four years, this great city will serve as the new capital of the Republic of Brazil. This act, the transformation of an empty savannah plain into a masterpiece of modern urbanism and architecture, shows the greatness and strength of our Brazilian nation. President Lott and Vice-President Quadros will officially open the city and its congress. We will also invite ex-President Kubitschek and the architects who supervised the project to the opening to thank them on behalf of the Republic for their diligence and devotion."
 BRA_american_investors: "미국의 투자"
 BRA_american_investors_desc: "The Brazilian economy is closely tied to that of the 'Land of the Free' in the north. Many large American companies and conglomerates have substantial operations in Brazil and we receive millions of American investment dollars every year. The previous government of President Kubitschek alternated between investor-friendly policies and limited nationalisations; this was sufficient to keep American investment at a constant, high level.\n\nOn the other hand, Lott believes strongly in the benefits of attracting American capital to Brazil and will do whatever it takes (within reason of course) to make Brazil even more attractive to American investors than it already is."
 BRA_japanese_tech: "일본의 기술"
 BRA_japanese_tech_desc: "In recent years, technology in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, especially in the Empire of Japan, has begun to advance by leaps and bounds. Japanese researchers and engineers are designing and producing all kinds of devices in all industries which improve efficiency, productivity, and profitability. If we can obtain these new, cutting-edge technologies and put them to good use, it will be a great boon for the Brazilian economy. Accordingly, under the guidance of President Lott, we will begin the process of importing limited quantities of Japanese technology through various trustworthy intermediaries. This will further our industrial development and assist in construction of new, modern infrastructure throughout Brazil."
 BRA_construct_the_highway: "고속도로 건설"
 BRA_construct_the_highway_desc: "Having secured American investment and Japanese technology, Lott is now ready to reveal the great economic ambition of his presidential career. The President has made plans for a Rodovia Transamazônica - a Trans-Amazonian Highway - to be constructed. This is to be a corridor that will cut directly through the Amazon as far as the distant borders with Colombia and Peru. This highway would be the first of its kind - a direct land route connecting Brazil and western South America.\n\nLott's plan is endorsed by his own party. Even better, it has also found support among many politicians of the UDN. Among these is Vice-President Quadros himself; he has personally endorsed the idea. However, others are skeptical. They wonder how Lott's optimism and plans will fare against the heavy rain, disease, pests, and humid heat that bedevil the Amazon Rainforest. But Lott dismisses these detractors: if the Germans could dam the Mediterranian, the Brazilians can breach the Amazon. Accordingly, the plans having been made and the material having been prepared, the march to the West can begin."
 BRA_end_coffee_strikes: "커피 파업 중단"
 BRA_end_coffee_strikes_desc: "Out of all coffee-producing nations on Planet Earth, Brazil is at once King and Emperor. We produce the most coffee in the world, which allows us to provide supply to world markets from Anchorage to Auckland. However, this means that the revenue from coffee exports is a vital part of the Brazilian economy, and if the coffee industry is disrupted, all Brazil is disrupted with it. This fact makes the ongoing coffee-industry strikes all the more worrisome. If these disturbances are allowed to continue without resolution, the coffee industry and by extension Brazil's entire economy will suffer. Lott cannot and will not allow this to happen - he will issue a decree ordering an end to the strikes and meet with police chiefs, union leaders, and other stakeholders to discuss potential options. The strikes will come to an end by hook or by crook."
 BRA_end_the_marches: "행진을 멈춰라"
 BRA_end_the_marches_desc: "With the police at maximum readiness and the army on standby, it is now time to put an end to the marches these strikers hold. Putting a stop to the marches will cause sympathy for the strikes to slowly fade and be replaced with frustration at a lack of progress. Lott has ordered the ground forces to blockade major streets and thoroughfares with tanks so as to prevent the marches from proceeding too far from their starting points. He hopes that the frustration that being unable to keep marching causes will break the strikers' wills and incentivize them to prefer negotiations to continued strike action."
 BRA_more_concessions: "몇 가지 타협"
 BRA_more_concessions_desc: "Henrique Lott is not an unreasonable man. Even if he was, as President he is still beholden to his party, and the PTB has made it clear that problems in the coffee industry must be addressed. Thus, the President and his charismatic daughter, Edna Lott, will meet with strike leaders and offer them concessions. On the list of proposed concessions are increased wages, fewer working hours, and longer vacations. Lott will offer an improvement on their situation but prevent a substantial change; this will avoid frustrating the plantation owners. With his daughter by his side, helping him every step of the way, Lott has every reason to believe that the strikes will end through diplomacy and compromise and not in further conflict."
 BRA_back_to_work: "다시 일터로"
 BRA_back_to_work_desc: "With a combination of negotiation and strike-disrupting tactics, making use of both handshakes and tanks, the unions have stopped their strikes. The strikers have gone back to work, and the coffee has once again begun to flow. Brazil's title as Coffee Emperor is once again secured for the foreseeable future. Lott leans back in his chair and takes a sip from his coffee, relaxing after a job well done. The PTB may complain and his daughter may say they didn't do enough to help the strikers, but politics is about compromise, not crowd-pleasing. From what Lott himself can see, though many aren't over the moon with the results, almost everyone can tolerate them, and a significant portion are pleased. That there is the definition of a very successful compromise."

 BRA_emergency_budget_cuts_desc: "With the immediate crises dealt with, Lott has turned his attention towards the economy. Here, the responsible minister Senhor Tancredo Neves has informed us of the existence of a few problems. Inflation, debt, and slowing economic growth all pose a threat to our prosperity; needless to say, if these are not dealt with, the President will have significant difficulties pushing through the rest of his plans for the Republic. Lott has implemented minor budget cuts as an emergency stopgap measure to deal with the debt and seconded Neves to tackle the inflation problem. The issue of economic growth will hopefully be resolved through the implementation of Lott's industrialization programs."
 ## Operation Lobster ##
 BRA_Fireworks_in_Rio: "리오의 불꽃 놀이"
 BRA_Fireworks_in_Rio_desc: "A year has passed, and Lott has gotten a lot of work done: opening Brasília, managing the economy, beginning the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway, and dealing with the coffee strikes. After all this work, Lott is exhausted and needs a break; the New Year celebrations present the perfect opportunity for this.\n\nWhile others throng the streets, celebrating another year passed without nuclear annihilation and sharing their hope that the Hawaiian Missile Crisis will continue to deescalate, Lott will spend it in his study, taking a well-deserved rest. Let Quadros and Neves take care of the government for just this week. Then it will be back to work for the old general."
 BRA_operation_lobster: "랍스터 작전"
 BRA_operation_lobster_desc: "For the past few years, we have had to deal with what the press has dubbed the 'Lobster War'. Our territorial waters are subject to continuous incursions by African pirates, foreign merchant boats and German warships.\n\nOur local fishermen are harassed and their livelihoods suffer while wealthy vultures in the so-called 'Capital of the World' feast on our lobster. Just recently, a Japanese couple was taken hostage by pirates, resulting in a major diplomatic crisis. Lott has declared he will end this war: no more will German naval craft violate our waters, no more will African fishers steal our lobster.\n\nTo this end, Lott has arranged a meeting with Admiral Arnoldo Toscano to promise him the ships and resources he needs. In return, he asks for one guarantee from the Admiral: that he will make Brazil victorious in this conflict."
 BRA_Deploy_the_Flotilla: "함대 전개"
 BRA_Deploy_the_Flotilla_desc: "Admiral Toscano has asked for a task force and Lott has given him one, now it just needs to be deployed. The task force will quickly be stationed in the waters off the coast of Pernambuco, where the fishing violations are at their worst. There, Arnoldo will ensure the task force destroys any pirate ships they see and sends rogue fishing craft back to Africa. This intervention will take some pressure off of the administration, but the fishermen will be back. While Arnoldo deals with the immediate problems, it is up to Lott and Quadros to think of a more permanent solution to the Lobster War."
 BRA_Anti_Piracy_Operations: "해적 퇴치 작전"
 BRA_Anti_Piracy_Operations_desc: "For a good while now we have had to deal with pirates and fishermen coming from the anarchic coast of West Africa and engaging in illegal fishing and a thousand other kinds of criminal enterprise within our maritime borders. They profit from these ventures and get away with it, but we get blamed whenever something goes wrong. The recent incident involving Japanese tourists is a sign of what could come. If we want to prevent further disruptions of this kind, we must wipe this piracy out completely."
 BRA_Work_With_the_Governments: "정부와 협력"
 BRA_Work_With_the_Governments_desc: "Vice-President Jânio Quadros' idea is to work with the local governments that are emerging from the aftermath of the collapse of French authority and the terror bombing in West Africa. He believes that, now that the 'superior Aryan master race' is busy bleeding itself white, the native Africans once the bombing has stopped will jump at any opportunity to reestablish friendly contact with comparatively civilized 'non-Aryans' to help rebuild their nations. Accordingly, we can send our foreign minister Walther Salles to the recently-reestablished authorities such as the Republic of Liberia with an offer, we'll send them money and aid if they nip the pirate issue in the bud within their own borders."
 BRA_A_Deal_With_the_Free_France: "자유 프랑스와의 거래"
 BRA_A_Deal_With_the_Free_France_desc: "General Charles de Gaulle and the Free French need weaponry; how will they achieve their precious pipe dream of liberating Paris and France without guns and artillery? We can send them an offer. We'll help them with their arms shortage if they put their outdated boats and ships to harass and suppress the pirates. It is a win-win situation for both of us: they get the weapons they desperately need, and we don't have to deal with the pirates ourselves. Let us just hope that Charles de Gaulle, his mind frayed after years of failed struggle, will still be able to see reason."
 BRA_Search_and_Destroy: "수색 및 파괴"
 BRA_Search_and_Destroy_desc: "Admiral Arnoldo's plan is to put our own local task forces to use to suppress these illegal fishermen and pirates ourselves. He advises us to move at once to search and destroy the illegal craft until they are no longer a threat, rather than waste precious time and effort negotiating with bombed-out villages, camel-riding tribesmen, and crazed resistance fighters who cannot admit defeat. Lott has decided, on the advice of his Minister of War, to take up the Admiral's plan and ignore that offered by Vice-President Quadros. We shall defeat the pirates as we have been doing already, with fire and steel."
 BRA_Send_Them_Back: "그들을 되돌려 보내기"
 BRA_Send_Them_Back_desc: "The next part of our plan is simple: send the pirates back to West Africa. Once they are back in their homelands, there will be no problem. Furthermore, we can save ourselves from having to spend any more on these nuisances than the value of a plane ticket. This is an easy and efficient process; if these people have brains they'll know better than coming back into (and getting blown out of) our waters a second time. And if they don't learn the first time, well, beatings (and gunfire if necessary) will be more than sufficient to cure such disorders."
 BRA_The_Pirates_Scattered: "흩어진 해적들"
 BRA_The_Pirates_Scattered_desc: "No matter what course of action we have taken, whether we fought with well-placed words or with good strong steel, we have succeeded in our task. The pirates are mostly defeated and scattered; instances of illegal fishing, though still significant, have begun to decrease. Most important of all, our fishermen can return to work with the danger to their livelihood significantly reduced. Our task forces will of course patrol the areas for the next few months, but their job will be far easier from here on in. As for us, having caught or killed the smaller members of the food chain, it is now time for us to deal with the big predators."
 BRA_Stop_the_Companies: "기업들을 멈춰라"
 BRA_Stop_the_Companies_desc: "While the African fishermen and pirates are a problem, a greater problem still is posed by the German Reichskommissariate and the corporations that run amok within their lands. Large fishing trawlers from the RKs - primarily Siegfried Müller's Zentralafrika - frequently intrude in Brazilian waters to fish illegally and sell what they get to gluttons and gourmands all across the world. They put these illegal gains to use to finance their terrible colonial governments that grind human beings to dust in order to perpetuate the deluded superiority of their imaginary 'Aryan race'. If we are to attain final victory in the Lobster War we must pressure either the RKs or the corporations into no longer continuing to violate our territorial integrity."
 BRA_the_48_Hour_Ultimatum: "48시간 최후통첩"
 BRA_the_48_Hour_Ultimatum_desc: "Let us issue a 48-hour ultimatum giving these vultures a choice: either they leave Brazilian waters or have their ships seized and their workers imprisoned. But we should be vigilant; if one of these people decides it'd be a good idea to test the ultimatum and enter our waters another time, we should be ready to back our words up with force."
 BRA_Seize_Their_Ships: "그들의 선박 나포"
 BRA_Seize_Their_Ships_desc: "Following the advice given by our army and navy, we will seize those ships that are in our waters. Let us send out ships and planes to locate the boats, frighten the bigger ones, and seize the smaller ones. These rabid corporations will see reason if we attack the only thing that matters to them: the bottom line of their profits. The more boats they lose the more unprofitable it becomes, and the less they will fish in our waters."
 BRA_Meet_With_Muller: "뮐러와의 만남"
 BRA_Meet_With_Muller_desc: "Quadros now suggests sending Reichskommissar Müller a letter in service of Quadros' goal of securing a more independent Brazilian foreign policy. If we can get hold of him personally we can try to get him to restrain the companies in his territory; but if it fails and the matter gets leaked we will damage our credibility and anger the Americans for trying to work with Nazis. Let's hope he accepts, and, just as importantly, that everyone who knows about this plan keeps their damned mouths shut."
 BRA_A_Trip_to_the_Congo: "콩고 여행"
 BRA_A_Trip_to_the_Congo_desc: "Now that Müller has accepted our request, let's send Walther Salles to the Kongo and Zentralafrika to meet with him (and his hypercompetent sidekick Rolf Steiner) and spend a week there discussing plans about what to do. We might want to dangle a lifetime supply of Brazilian lobster for the Zentralafrikan upper echelon or a few hundred all-expenses-paid hunting trips in the Brazilian rainforest in front of Müller to sweeten the deal, because these negotiations will be tough. To make matters easier in that, we will send Walther Salles, our best diplomat, to deal with these negotiations. Let us hope and pray that he is successful."
 BRA_The_Bountiful_Harvest: "풍성한 수확"
 BRA_The_Bountiful_Harvest_desc: "The Lobster War has ended in a Brazilian victory. With competition now gone, large amounts of fish and lobsters can arrive on our shores once again as Brazilian fishermen are freed to fish their rightful waters unchallenged. A bountiful harvest - and greater economic prosperity - is on the way. With this victory, our Republic of Brazil is one step closer to bringing about Ordem e Progresso in its own lands."
 BRA_The_Germans_Pacified: "평정된 독일인들"
 BRA_The_Germans_Pacified_desc: "German ships have stopped coming into our waters in such large numbers; we have succeeded in our objective of dramatically reducing the number of lobsters being illegally fished in our waters. This has shown the Germans, indeed the whole world, that Brazil, the South American Juggernaut, is not one to be cowed."

 ## Economics
 BRA_Coffee_With_Neves: "네베스와 커피를"
 BRA_Coffee_With_Neves_desc: "Henrique Teixeira Lott will now meet with Tancredo Neves in order to discuss the economic situation that our Republic now finds itself in. Senhor Lott believes that Neves' help will be the weapon he needs in order to put Brazil's economic chaos to an end. As for Senhor Neves, he wishes to discuss managing the economy and development of Brazil, and believes that this President is best-placed to see Brazil's economic revival through.\n\nNeedless to say, the cups of fine Brazilian coffee that Lott and Neves gulp down during this meeting may well turn out to be the most important drinks in modern Brazilian history."
 BRA_Neves_Plan: "네베스 계획"
 BRA_Neves_Plan_desc: "The plan suggested by our esteemed finance minister, the prudent Tancredo Neves, is as follows.\nRaise taxes, fees, and otherwise get hold of money in order to service our debt which, thanks to the ambitious spending programs of President Lott's predecessor among other things, is at a crisis level, before we give any thought to promoting economic growth. Only when this debt has less of a stranglehold on us can we get to work on various investment and economic stimulus schemes, which will grow the economy. This will in turn further reduce our debt and free us to do what we want with our finances."
 BRA_Lets_Raise_Some_Taxes: "일부 세금 인상"
 BRA_Lets_Raise_Some_Taxes_desc: "One of the major planks of Neves' economic renewal plan is the raising of taxes. We need these taxes in order to deal with the debt crisis and deficit, and taxes are the first and simplest path of many paths we will have to take.\nAccordingly, we will raise taxes on the middle and upper classes - but NOT on the poor.\nNever mind the fact that raising taxes on poor people is immoral or a first-class vote-loser, Vargas' angry criticisms for stabbing his "children" in the back like that would create enough political chaos to make even a Quadros rampage seem calm and peaceful by comparison."
 BRA_Lower_Interest_Rates: "금리 인상"
 BRA_Lower_Interest_Rates_desc: "Raising interest rates is also a good idea during times of economic malaise. It is a measure that has been taken by countless national banks throughout the world since the idea of a state-controlled bank became commonplace. Doing this will put more money in the Brazilian worker's pocket in the long run, by directly tackling inflation and lowering it. While this may have a short term effect on our economic growth, further investment in industrialisation and mechanization under the advice of Neves, will ensure that in the long run economic growth is not hampered. Thus with both inflation being lowered and long run economic growth continued, this will in turn benefit the Brazilian economy in the long run."
 BRA_Control_Transfer_Profits: "이익 이전 통제"
 BRA_Control_Transfer_Profits_desc: "Companies, wealthy people, and other assorted types that form part of the One Percent tend to transfer money all over the place like balls in a tilted pinball machine. At the moment, our government does not gain anything from this; if we impose regulations and taxes, we will secure a lucrative new source of taxable wealth for the Brazilian bottom line. Sure, it will anger these groups, but that is a price worth paying for the welfare of the Republic and its people. They will realize the rightness of this policy in due time."
 BRA_Enact_Deflationary_Policies: "디플레이션 정책 제정"
 BRA_Enact_Deflationary_Policies_desc: "Inflation is something that has bedeviled our nation for the longest time, and it has tortured Brazilian pocketbooks at all levels of society. From the poorest favela resident to the wealthiest denizen of Jardins in São Paulo, there is no taxpayer in this country that has not been at least somewhat inconvenienced (if not outright ruined) by the vicissitudes of inflation. Decisive action must be taken in order to reduce its further effects on our people. Though Neves is not too focused on this - the people have coped and will cope, and other things also need to be handled - he will still make sure decisive action is taken to reduce the problem."
 BRA_Continue_Industralization: "산업화 지속"
 BRA_Continue_Industralization_desc: "Industrialization is the future of our Brazilian economy. Accordingly, if we want the economy to grow, our nation to modernize, and its people's welfare to improve, we must keep the process of industrializing the country continuing at full speed. As such, factories, refineries, and other assorted modern industrial facilities will be built under the Government's aegis.\nTrue, this will impede our progress on the reduction of inflation. But if we manage to keep everything under rational management, we should at least be able to prevent inflation from increasing any further. And a population that benefits from improved industry will be more resilient against the problems caused by inflation, so it is all worth it."
 BRA_Industralize_The_Interior: "내륙 산업화"
 BRA_Industralize_The_Interior_desc: "The interior regions of the Republic of Brazil, far away from the initial areas of settlement, are not nearly as developed as the heartlands around Guanabara and São Paulo. In light of the great potential that these regions have, to say nothing of the sheer wealth of resources they possess, this is frankly a travesty; it cannot be allowed to continue. In accordance with Senhor Neves' directives, the interior will be industrialized so that its resources and human capital can be leveraged both for its own good and for that of the Brazilian state more generally."
 BRA_Industralize_The_South: "남부 산업화"
 BRA_Industralize_The_South_desc: "The southern regions of our country, close to the Argentine and Oriental borders, have a significant infrastructure network that is not currently sufficiently leveraged. Accordingly Senhor Neves has directed us to take action to improve the industry in these areas as well as in the Interior.\nThis directive is a no-brainer for us. If we industrialize in the south, it is far easier to put it to use quickly. This is because the factories and what-have-you will start off connected to decent roads and will therefore be able to send and receive goods almost immediately."
 BRA_Repairing_Kubitscheks_Road_System: "쿠비체크 도로체계 수리"
 BRA_Repairing_Kubitscheks_Road_System_desc: "In the years since the presidency of our esteemed predecessor, Juscelino Kubitschek, the great road system he established while in power has fallen out of repair. Day after day reports of cars crashing, falling into potholes, and losing tires to ruts in roads are made to the transport administration. This is damaging to the economy, public welfare, and international image of our country; it cannot and will not be tolerated. Accordingly, we will make a significant investment to repair the damage to the new Brazilian road system and, while we are at it, further improve our nation's infrastructure so as to strengthen the economy."
 BRA_Mechanization_Programs: "기계화 프로그램"
 BRA_Mechanization_Programs_desc: "The South has massive farms and plantations scattered all over it; these grow large amounts of cash crops and assorted fruits. However, due to a lack of mechanization, they have yet to reach their full potential. Investing in agricultural mechanization in this region will allow us to drastically increase the output from these properties. This will ameliorate local economic productivity, improve the quality of life for people in that region, and put us one step closer to achieving the President's goal of putting an end to the economic instability that has plagued Brazil for the longest time."
 BRA_Neves_Plan_Finish: "네베스 계획의 완료!"
 BRA_Neves_Plan_Finish_desc: "With the completion of the plan of Tancredo Neves for resolving our economic malaise, economic growth has been achieved and the debt crisis has been resolved for the time being. We have successfully industrialized formerly underdeveloped regions of Brazil, mechanized farms, modernized and renewed infrastructure, secured new sources of income for the Government, and put more money into the pockets of ordinary Brazilians. Truly the President was wise to put our trust in Senhor Neves. ...Granted, the inflation has not gone down by much, but it will decrease over time thanks to our wise economic policies. Surely it won't increase ... right?"
 BRA_Form_Agriculture_Comission: "농업위원회 구성"
 BRA_Form_Agriculture_Comission_desc: "The Peasant League has lost its leader and now the rural regions of Brazil are once more in chaos. Peasant leagues and unions, no longer restrained, are making unrestrained demands and striking en masse. Even when strikes are not taking place, employee-employer tensions are rising to an unsustainable level, and it is beginning to negatively affect our politics and economy. This cannot be borne; accordingly, President Lott will convene an agricultural commission in order to devise a plan of action for agrarian reform and devise a bill that will put this issue to rest once and for all."
 BRA_Deploy_Goulart: "굴라르 배치"
 BRA_Deploy_Goulart_desc: "João Goulart is well-respected among the rural and labor movements. The de-facto leader of the PTB is known for his ability to effectively empathize with the people. People are willing to tell him what they want and listen to his suggestions in a way that Lott or any other prominent member of the PSD or even the PTB cannot hope to equal. That is just what we need if we want to bring about a positive end to this challenging situation. President Lott recognizes this; accordingly, he will send Goulart to talk with these people and calm them down."
 BRA_Investigate_Peasent_Leaders: "농민 연합 조사"
 BRA_Investigate_Peasent_Leaders_desc: "The leadership of the peasant leagues as it currently stands is a clear and present danger to the Republic of Brazil, and the military has no illusions about this. Accordingly, they have been talking to Henrique Lott, their former colleague, and have convinced him that decisive action must be taken to prevent these nuisances from turning into something more than that.\nJânio Quadros, backed by some members of the PTB, is complaining quite loudly (as is his wont) about this proposed method; he thinks it could backfire on us. But Lott and the military believe that the benefits of putting these seditionists down far outweigh the risks, and so they will push through with this course of action."
 BRA_Stop_League_Crackdowns: "연합 단속 중지"
 BRA_Stop_League_Crackdowns_desc: "Now it is true that these Peasant Leagues and their leaders are not the most reasonable or effective in the pursuit of their goals - this is to be expected. What is clear to President Lott is that their cause is just; they only want to create a better, more equitable and just Brazil for themselves and their children. This is why he allowed himself to be convinced by a faction composed of the PTB, Tancredo Neves, and - surprisingly enough - Jânio Quadros to cut down on the current crackdown against the Peasant Leagues.\nSome members of the military are grumbling; they accuse the President of treating "Amazonianist subversives'' and "commies" with kid-gloves. But Lott, Neves, the PTB, and Quadros believe that the benefits of showing the peasants kindness far outweigh the risks, and so they will push through with this course of action."
 BRA_The_Agrarian_Bill: "농업 법안 작성"
 BRA_The_Agrarian_Bill_desc: "Having taken initial action regarding the problem of the Peasant Leagues, it is time for the Lott Government to take the final decision that will put an end to the protests paralyzing the Republic. President Lott and his government are proposing a comprehensive land-reform bill that, if passed, will cause the largest land redistribution in Brazilian history.\nThe proposed program will transfer land from large rural landowners to the poorest rural citizens that are best-placed to put it to use for their families and the Nation. (Mind you, we will of course give the affected landowners compensation and allow them enough loopholes where they will not flee the country with their money.)\nIt will be difficult to pass, but if we manage to pull it off it will be worth it."
 BRA_Union_Negotations: "노동조합 협상"
 BRA_Union_Negotations_desc: "The labor unions are one of the major factors of the current crisis; they are the organizing force behind some of the larger strikes currently ongoing. It is imperative for us to get them on board with this bill if we wish to use it as a means to bring back industrial harmony. However, if our bill is too weak, our overtures may backfire and cause them to keep on protesting.\nAccordingly, we will meet with the union leaders, determine what issues if any they have with the current bill, and see if we can reach a permanent modus vivendi with them."
 BRA_Smooth_Talk_Ranchers: "목장주와 논쟁"
 BRA_Smooth_Talk_Ranchers_desc: "Ranchers and other assorted landholders will also be affected by this bill; they know it, and they are shouting about this plan at the top of their lungs. But it so happens that they are also a major source of finance for the PSD, UDN, PSP, and even some PTB politicians' political campaigns. We can and must leverage this fact.\nAccordingly, we will get hold of them and see what they want from us. True, we may have to compromise and go a few steps down from the land reform we wanted. But in exchange we will possibly be able to get them to compromise with us and maybe shut up a little. The concessions we will have to make will be worth it when we are freed of landowners screaming like so many mynah birds on drugs about how Lott and his officials are tools of Amazonianism every tenth of a second."
 BRA_Hold_The_Vote: "투표 개최"
 BRA_Hold_The_Vote_desc: "We have done as much glad-handing, negotiating, politicking, and bargaining as President Lott deems necessary to see this bill of his through. Now all that is left is to put an end to the incessant prevarication that is so common in politics and finally get on with putting the Agrarian Reform to a vote in the Congresso Nacional. The pessimist within Lott worries that this bill will not get the votes that are needed for it to pass, but the more hopeful part of him thinks that he has (probably, he hopes, God willing) convinced enough people for this much-needed policy to go through."
 BRA_Agrarian_Bill_Passes: "농업 법안 통과"
 BRA_Agrarian_Bill_Passes_desc: "We have done it! The bill on agrarian reform has passed with a clear majority mandate from the Congresso Nacional, thus permitting President Lott to go through with the largest land reform program ever embarked on in Brazilian - hell, maybe even South or Latin American - history. Truly this is a major success for the President as he achieves the first step of his dream to bring about comprehensive land reform in the Brazilian Republic. The UDN is screaming, and those landowners we failed to convince are campaigning hard against the bill even though it is a settled matter. But long-overdue justice has been done, and the rural poor and laborers will respect Lott all the more for it. Oba!"
 BRA_Agrarian_Bill_Fails: "농업 법안 실패"
 BRA_Agrarian_Bill_Fails_desc: ""The best laid plans of mice and men go oft awry, and leave us nought but pain for promised joy." Despite the best efforts of the President and the PTB, the bill on agrarian reform, which had so much potential to build a more just and equitable Brazil, has been shot down in the Congresso Nacional due to the intransigence of the UDN and some rebels within the President's own PSD. Needless to say, the Peasant Leagues and so many others that put their faith in this bill are unhappy. While the countryside descends into chaos once more, President Lott backward casts his eye on these prospects drear. Forward, though he cannot see, he guesses and fears."
 BRA_All_We_Can_Do_Now: "구속의 시간"
 BRA_All_We_Can_Do_Now_desc: "The bill has passed, and it is time to let the waters settle. An agrarian reform of this kind will have the same effect as throwing a large boulder into a standing pool. The water and other things in the pool will start moving all over the place. Accordingly, while we deal with the consequences of this success of ours, let us avoid the urge to go off on any other policy adventures. We must enforce the bill and bring this recent fight of ours to a successful conclusion rather than setting off a new one and overextending ourselves."
 BRA_Calm_Down_The_Countryside: "시골 진정시키기"
 BRA_Calm_Down_The_Countryside_desc: "In the aftermath of our unfortunate failure in the Congresso Nacional, the unions and peasants are in open revolt. In their desperation they are beginning to find the mad ideologies of people like Amazonas and the lunatics around Salvador Allende appealing. They are proposing performing land reform and redistribution by force the way those MIR lunatics over in Chile tried to do in the south of that country. This cannot be borne; though we are to blame for this failure, the people must be prevented from taking their rage out on each other and their nation. We will take decisive action - through words or force, whatever works - to prevent this from spiraling out of control."
 BRA_Quadros_Plan: "쿠아드루스 계획"
 BRA_Quadros_Plan_desc: "Our maverick vice-president, Jânio Quadros, sees things differently from Neves. He thinks that, rather than taking more money from the average Brazilian, we should instead cut down on our current spending through a thoroughgoing austerity program. Slash unnecessary social and infrastructure programs left and right until our finances are more secure, and then negotiate with one of the great powers for a loan so that Brazil can put an end to its financial woes. Going with this plan will not only help us restabilize our bottom line and please Quadros; it will also help suppress inflation, which is currently a major problem, by reducing the current flood of government money in the economy."
 BRA_Slow_Down_Industralization: "산업화 늦추기"
 BRA_Slow_Down_Industralization_desc: "The first step in vice-president Quadros' program is perhaps its most controversial, for Quadros and his faction argue that Brazil must slow down its industrialization drive.\n\nMany see this idea as profoundly counter-intuitive, for South America's under-industrialization is a source of recurrent economic problems. Yet Quadros and his allies argue that the current cure is worse than the disease. The flood of government investment into the economy and foreign debt taken on by new businesses has caused inflation to rampage out of control. Meanwhile both government and private debt continue to soar.\n\nTo safeguard our economy, it is time to put brakes on it before it turns into a runaway disaster. As the tide of easy money and speculative investment recedes, inflation will naturally come down and poor Brazilians will no longer be victimized by financial instability."
 BRA_Cut_Public_Spending: "공공 지출 삭감"
 BRA_Cut_Public_Spending_desc: "Government spending has risen rapidly over past years, increasing as a percentage of our GDP even as our economy itself has grown. A lot of this spending has been done through borrowed money, fuelling a growing debt even as government deficits continue to increase.\n\nThe rising cost of servicing the debt, as well as the crowding out effect occurring as businessmen cannot afford to outbid the government on foreign financial markets are both becoming drains on the economy. It is time for the republic to end its spendthriftness , and for balanced budgets to become the norm once more.\n\nCutting back on social programs and public spending will be costly politically at first. The continued prosperity of the nation demands it."
 BRA_Slash_Highway_Budget: "고속도로 예산 절감"
 BRA_Slash_Highway_Budget_desc: "As the nation's public finances are bled white, ever greater amounts of money are funnelled into the highway program. This situation has long been decried by vice-president Quadros. Why waste taxpayer money on roads to nowhere?\n\nPresident Lott has long seen infrastructure as one of the most important areas in which to invest, and vehemently disagrees with his vice-president that better roads to connect the nation's cities and villages is anything but a net gain for the country. Nevertheless, the president has agreed to reduce the scope of his highway program as a condition of following Quadros' economic plan. While it pains Lott greatly to see the highway budget slashed, the political gains from appeasing Quadros and his allies will be well worth it. The extra money will be put to good use elsewhere."
 BRA_Begin_Debt_Negotations: "부채 협상 시작"
 BRA_Begin_Debt_Negotations_desc: "The mountain of debt inherited, and added to, by our government, remains a major problem. Not only are the loans draining a ton of resources from our government; they are also a political powderkeg that may see us defeated at the ballot box in the future.\n\nVice-President Quadros' economic plan seeks to undo this Gordian knot. His approach is two-fold. A program of austerity to gain the confidence of financiers, and securing the help of a foreign power to help restructure our debts by borrowing at a much lower cost. Having done the first half of his program, we now approach the other half.\n\nWhile Quadros' idea has generated cautious hope throughout the government, his proposed source of funds has not been unanimously well received. Quadros wishes to request help from Japan to restructure our debts. This goes against our traditional foreign policy, and may irritate the Americans who have always been a reliable trade partner. As such many within the cabinet suggest we approach Washington for the loan program. A decision must be made."
 BRA_Talk_With_Sphere: "공영권과 대화"
 BRA_Talk_With_Sphere_desc: "Quadros' arguments have carried the day. Despite the worries of our foreign policy grandees, the vice-president's argument that weakening our reliance on America will strengthen our hand has won more than a few adherents.\n\nThe Japanese government will be approached for help in this debt restructuring. Tokyo has long sought new trade partners beyond eastern Asia, and will no doubt be interested in buying our friendship on the cheap. That said, the Japanese will still need reassurances. Rumblings are reaching us of a slowdown in the imperial economy. The sphere's diplomats will no doubt drive a harder bargain than usual."
 BRA_Talk_With_Americans: "미국인들과 대화"
 BRA_Talk_With_Americans_desc: "Our foreign minister Walther Salles has managed to convince the cabinet that the best source of funds will be the United States of America. Vice-President Quadros will be dismayed to see his drive to wean Brazil off American dominance is to be put on hold for now. However he will hopefully be satisfied to continue helping us put his plan into motion.\n\nUncle Sam always has time for friends. However our contacts in Washington have signalled to us that the department of state worries of the preponderance of the state in our economy. American money is likely to be available to us for debt restructuring... However the northern giant will no doubt attach conditions to it to encourage Brazil to remain a liberal democracy with what are deemed sufficiently 'healthy' markets."
 BRA_Reduce_Tarrifs: "일본 관세 인하"
 BRA_Reduce_Tarrifs_desc: "The Japanese have accepted! From the Sphere flows enough low interest loans to end Brazil's debt crisis forever!\n\nAttached to this bail-out are a few conditions. The biggest of these, and one we should have seen coming, is a severe reduction of tariffs between us and the sphere. The Japanese have long sought new trade partners, shut-off as they are from American and European markets. They now turn to us to buy their knick-knacks.\n\nThis loss of tariff is of course concerning to those who seek to protect domestic industries. However, without an end to the debt crisis Brazilian industries are not likely to weather the storm ahead. We must thus risk this new danger rather than keep the old one."
 BRA_Zaitbasu_Land_Grants: "자이바츠 토지 불하"
 BRA_Zaitbasu_Land_Grants_desc: "Many of the Japanese ZaIbatsus, or financial cliques, have expressed interest in operating in Brazil. Beyond lowering the traffic partner, our new sponsors in Tokyo expect a degree of reciprocity in our dealing with their national champions. As such, we must help the Zaibatsus plant roots in Latin America.\n\nTo go about this, land will be sold cheaply to our foreign partners. This small loss will serve as a good faith demonstration of our will to strengthen our commercial ties to the far east. If the next century is to be an Asian one, Brazil must get on the ground of this new era."
 BRA_Negotations_Collapse: "협상이 결렬되다"
 BRA_Negotations_Collapse_desc: " Talks with a potential foreign source of loans has broken down! With the other great powers unwilling to help us at this time after being spurned by our foreign ministry, it seems that Brazil will have to go at it alone for the time being.\n\nThe debt crisis still looms large over us. While Quadros had some contingency plans for such a disastrous outcome, the solutions remaining for us are not pretty. The cabinet will bring onboard some more economists to help us stitch together a new strategy. One thing is for sure, this failure has generated a great deal of tension between the vice-president and president."
 BRA_Some_More_Cuts: "더 많은 지출 삭감"
 BRA_Some_More_Cuts_desc: "Once, the Quadros plan saw us cut with a surgeon's precision. Without the help of a foreign power taking on much of our debt, it is time for Brazil to begin deeper cuts.\n\nThe Kubitschek era programs have to be aggressively trimmed down. Industrialization, healthcare, education, public services; all will see devastating cuts. The people will no doubt howl in frustration, while the opposition will make much of the end of social programs our predecessors have begun. No matter the fallout however, we must walk this cruel path if the country is to reach solvency."
 BRA_Lower_Corporation_Tax: "미국 법인세 인하"
 BRA_Lower_Corporation_Tax_desc: "Our successful negotiations with the Americans have seen Brazil's financial situation be entirely salvaged. Now however comes the time to pay for the help the Americans are sending our way.\n\nA particular sticking point in the negotiations was the issue of corporate taxations. The Americans have been much impressed by how quickly the Quadros plan has restored fiscal sanity to the nation. However, the taxation rate on corporations remains extremely high. For the sake of better trade between our nations, as well as mutual investments, the tax rate has to go down.\n\nWhile caving to the American demands will not be too popular, there are few other options. Increased investment from our northern partners as well as the end of the debt crisis will be worth it all in the end."
 BRA_Protect_American_Bussiness: "미국의 사업 이익 보호"
 BRA_Protect_American_Bussiness_desc: "Washington has long been skeptical of our predecessor's policies. The Kubitschek-era saw many talks of nationalizing foreign businesses operating in Brazil. Washington wants guarantees that such talk will never trouble the American business community in Brazil ever again.\n\nSuch guarantees will pass through new laws making it either impossible or very costly to nationalize foreign businesses. This will be unpopular with many within the country, especially within our party's left. However the situation has forced our hands. If Brazil is to escape the debt trap into which it entered, it must accept the American's help. A bankruptcy on our debt would devastate our economic sovereignty."
 BRA_Quadro_Plan_Finish: "쿠아드루스 계획 완료"
 BRA_Quadro_Plan_Finish_desc: "Vice-President Quadros, an odd presence within the Brazilian political sphere, has long had his doubters. Our decision to begin his program of economic reforms was seen as a dangerous step backward. Our critics on the left accused us of reversing the policies that saw the Kubitschek era bring Brazil into modernity.\n\nNow that the program has been completed, Brazil has come out of a shadowy valley and into a bright new era. Our industrial growth has slowed, and the economy has suffered a few set-backs on the way. However the debt crisis that rocked the nation is a thing of the past. Our deficit is finally narrowing down to zero. Most importantly, inflation, that killer of working class families, is finally a thing of the past.\n\nVice-President Quadros is content that our government has followed his calls for austerity and financial reforms. We now turn to face the future, better equipped to safeguard the nation's prosperity."

 BRA_brazil_to_the_rescue_desc: "Millions of our lusophone brothers are oppressed by the Nazi tyranny in Angola and Mozambique. Worse yet, millions of South Africans are now also in danger of being put under the jackboot. Brazil neither can nor will allow such a terrible state of affairs to continue without intervening. Just as the Prussian cavalry arrived at the last moment and saved the British at Waterloo, the Brazilian Army shall come to Africa and save the Anglos again!\n\nEven better, the collapse of the African Reichskommissariate will make Brazil the main naval power in the Southern Atlantic, thereby decisively ending the naval conflicts that we have had to fight for the past twenty years. The President has ordered it and thus it shall be so, we shall go to war to support South Africa."
 BRA_convince_the_legislature: "Convince the Legislature"
 BRA_convince_the_legislature_desc: "Political articulation is a difficult thing, but thankfully the President has got figures like Tancredo Neves and Edna Lott to engage in the requisite smooth talk with our legislators. The good part of fighting side to side with the Americans is that the UDN will be easier to convince, with Carlos Lacerda also showing strong support for the war. But there are still those strongly isolationist members of the PTB that might need a bit of encouragement. Through reforms, agreements and an occasional bribe, the road to an intervention shall be de-obstructed and the legislators will one by one come around to Brazil intervening on South Africa's behalf."
 BRA_cia_contacts: "CIA Contacts"
 BRA_cia_contacts_desc: "The CIA is everywhere and there is little we can do to completely root it out of our country at the moment. However President Lott still can talk with his American friends about using it to influence public perception to favor the war through the creative methods that American intelligence services know best. The CIA and other American factors can take care of the tasks that Lott does not want the Brazilian government to get involved in. Letting them take care of the bribes, intimidation and so on will aid Brazil's efforts to join the war and will be a victory for the free world."
 BRA_convince_the_people: "Convince the People"
 BRA_convince_the_people_desc: "One of the most important things we inherited from the Estado Novo dictatorship was the Agência Nacional, or National Agency, which was responsible for producing and disseminating government newsreels and media. By cooperating with American newspapers to disseminate news of the Nazi atrocities in Africa and utilizing the nationalistic propaganda created by our army we can cause a patriotic surge similar to the one we had during the second great war. We just need to hope that this war doesn't end like the last one."
 BRA_send_our_guns: "Send our Guns"
 BRA_send_our_guns_desc: "Brazil has its own military-industrial complex, inherited from the New State and the Gomes government that followed it. In defense of democracy, we shall flood South Africa with as many guns as we can. These guns will supply the poorly-equipped South African troops, allowing them to hold the line against the flood of Boers and Germans. These guns will include state of the art Brazilian equipment, but also large quantities of older models that are being replaced. After all, an outdated gun is better than nothing, and it's not as if we're sending them blunderbusses."
 BRA_air_support: "Air Support"
 BRA_air_support_desc: "As our intervention grows in size and more after-action reports return from the front, it has become clear that one of the major advantages that the Reichskommissariate enjoy is their efficient use of airpower. As such we must reduce their advantage by sending more helicopters to better supply our troops and bring the battle to the enemy. Good, reliable Brazilian bombers and helicopters will defeat Südwestafrika's fighters, thus allowing us to drive the Germans out of the air, before crushing them on the ground and proving once and for all that they are not the 'master race'."
 BRA_operation_deadoro: "Operation Deodoro"
 BRA_operation_deadoro_desc: "The time has come! The people have been inflamed by our campaigns, the politicians are following our policies and voices of the non-interventionists such as Quadros have been overshadowed by the louder cries of our people. Brazil will begin to send volunteers and soldiers across the Atlantic, to fight and die for democracy and freedom. Some talk of increasing violence by locals against people of German ancestry, but surely this is merely propaganda uttered by Hitlerite sycophants implanted in Brazilian society.\n\nNever mind the discriminatory policies enacted in South Africa, life is always better under the Anglos than the German-backed Boers. Even if we did decide to change our minds it is too late; the propaganda we gave to the people has been too effective. They demand war and victory. Brazil is coming to Africa, for the defense of Democracy and for the rescue of our brothers. Senta a pua!"

 BRA_business_as_usual: "Business as Usual"
 BRA_business_as_usual_desc: "President General Henrique Lott has survived whatever crises have come his way and can now get back to business. Well done, Senhor Presidente; "um vencedor é você." Lott has gathered his cabinet: for the true task, he says, the task that will preserve Brazilian democracy, and ensure another 55 can never occur again, will begin now."
 BRA_operation_toucan: "Operation Toucan"
 BRA_operation_toucan_desc: "Operation Toucan is President Lott's plan to depoliticize the armed forces of Brazil. Lott wants to remove self-centered hardliners and replace them with constitutionalist officers and generals who will respect and protect democracy. Lott enters into this endeavor knowing that pacifying the stormy ocean that is the armed forces will be so difficult as to make the Lobster War seem like a brief dip in a child's pool by comparison. "
 BRA_contact_gomes: "Contact Gomes"
 BRA_contact_gomes_desc: "In reorganizing the Brazilian Air Force, we can attempt to enlist the help of Senhor Eduardo Gomes, who served as President of Brazil from 1950 to 1955, in cleansing the armed forces. It will be difficult to convince him, but the reward will be great: our reforms will be stronger and more robust, and the backlash from the Air Force will be lessened."
 BRA_destroy_the_delusions: "Destroy the Delusions"
 BRA_destroy_the_delusions_desc: "Our air force is filled with delusional imbeciles that think of themselves as untouchable knights of the air, unaccountable to no-one. Lott wants them to understand that, just like everyone else. they are in fact neither untouchable nor unaccountable. Hopefully, as Lott moves to remove these people of these ideals, at least some of them will devote themselves to the Republic and its Constitution instead."
 BRA_oaths_to_the_republic: "Oaths to the Republic"
 BRA_oaths_to_the_republic_desc: "We shall pass a law making all military officers swear on the Bible with the Lord Himself as their witness that they will respect the Republic of Brazil and be loyal to the Constitution above all else. (The President insists on this because he knows that bringing God into it will make the officers take it seriously, or at least more seriously than any number of appeals to reason.) This will start only in the air force, but Lott will spread this practice throughout the armed forces, using the air force as a test to see how people respond."
 BRA_send_sarmento: "Sarmento in Manaus"
 BRA_send_sarmento_desc: "Sarmento, a hardliner rival of President Lott, was involved in the putsch of 1955. Since then, he has continued to be a thorn in Lott's side and poses a severe challenge to any future attempts to depoliticize the armed forces. Reassigning this nuisance to Manaus - a textbook "reassignment to Antarctica" as they call it - will remove him from the military halls of power and make him a nonentity, thus clearing an obstacle to the depoliticization of the Brazilian military. Have a pleasant time in the Amazon, Sarmento; you'll be 'on vacation' there for a long time."
 BRA_expose_kruel: "Expose Kruel"
 BRA_expose_kruel_desc: "Field Marshal Kruel was caught in the act of accepting bribes from Japanese and American corporations. A venal individual such as this should not be entrusted with anything, let alone command of troops. Exposing Kruel will force him to resign in disgrace, thus removing another obstacle to the President's plans. It galls Lott beyond belief to do this; Kruel is a long serving general and a man with whom Lott worked with in the past. But it must go through. It is for the greater good of Brazil."
 BRA_police_the_officers: "Police the Officers"
 BRA_police_the_officers_desc: "Let us integrate civilian police and observers in the armed forces to police the officers. This will further Lott's two goals of fully subordinating the armed forces to civilian authority and making officers (and the armed forces more generally) accountable to the Brazilian state."
 BRA_promote_constitutionalists: "Promote Constitutionalists"
 BRA_promote_constitutionalists_desc: "Constitutionalists are the faction of the Army that is loyal to President Lott and his ideals of constitutionalism and democracy. Promoting them will increase their influence at the expense of the Hardliners and Sobronne, thereby increasing the prevalence of constitutionalist thought and ideals in the Army."
 BRA_investigate_the_marines: "Investigate the Marines"
 BRA_investigate_the_marines_desc: "The Marines must be invested in order to understand the extent to which antidemocratic thought has spread among them. It isn't likely to be all that significant a problem due to their size compared to the rest of the armed forces. But one can never be too cautious, a single rebellious group in the armed forces could lead to disaster. The marines are no exception and must full under the same scruitny as the rest of the armed forces."
 BRA_fire_potential_troublemakers: "Fire Potential Troublemakers"
 BRA_fire_potential_troublemakers_desc: "Now we will turn to the Navy and cut down hardliner influence by getting rid of any troublemakers present in it. Sailors that discuss antidemocratic thought will be told to pack their bags and new ones will arrive to take their place. These new sailors will be sound people with mindsets that favor the Republic and democracy. While some say this is an overreach of Lott's powers, he blows them off, insisting it must be done."
 BRA_sweep_the_navy_clean: "Sweep the Navy Clean"
 BRA_sweep_the_navy_clean_desc: "There are only a few more troublemakers left in the Navy, mainly the hardliner or other troublesome admirals. Getting rid of Cândido da Costa Aragão, the self-proclaimed "People's Admiral", will be a good place to start. Then we can move on to getting rid of other such hardliner Admirals. The navy, like the army and air force, will be cleansed utterly of corruption."
 BRA_the_lott_act: "The Lott Act"
 BRA_the_lott_act_desc: "The Lott Act is the last stage of President Lott's Operation Toucan. Like the Hatch Act passed by the U.S. Congress, it forces political neutrality in the armed forces by, among other things, outlawing any military interference in governance. After this goes through, Lott will finally be able to see the completion of his dream of kicking politics out of the armed forces and protecting democracy in the Republic of Brazil... unless some damn fool manages to destroy his hard work later on."
 BRA_prepare_for_the_transition: "Prepare for the Transition"
 BRA_prepare_for_the_transition_desc: "President Henrique Teixeira Lott has succeeded. He has forced the armed forces out of politics and has strengthened democracy in the Republic of Brazil.

 BRA_reform_the_11th_of_november_movement: "Reform the 11th of November Movement"

 BRA_celebrating_its_passing_desc: "President Lott and Brazil can rest easy now, for the Lott Act has passed through the Senado. Despite the military's feeble attempts to kill the act, their meddling was not enough to stop the passage of a landmark piece of legislation. While the act does plenty to curtail the military's influence in our democratic system, there are still finishing touches that must be put in place to ensure that Brazil's democracy will never be threatened again. Namely, we must address the increasing anger from the military itself and offer our assurances that we will not take additional direct action against them. Furthermore, we must also close any loopholes that are present within the Lott Act to ensure Brazil will remain a free republic forever. For now, though, we must celebrate the passage of the act and the successful defense of our democracy."
 BRA_mourn_its_failure_desc: "Despite our efforts, the Lott Act has failed in the Senate at the hands of shortsighted senators and the military. Our relationship with the Hardliner faction is now irreparable, and it remains to be seen whether or not the military will take increased action in the following election, but it unfortunately remains within their power to do so. While Marshal Lott remains in the presidential office, we must focus on what we can still do to try and curtail the power of the military. The Sorbonne faction is key to us, as we can not afford to anger another faction of the military, and it would be best if we gathered all 3 branches of the armed forces to discuss potential next steps regarding the future."
 BRA_cement_legalism_desc: "The military is not some special entity that can pick and choose which laws it wants to obey or disobey, especially regarding our democracy. While the Lott Act removes any legal avenues for the military to skirt around our constitution, the attitude of subverting our democracy runs deep through our military. We must educate the armed forces and instill a strong emphasis on legalism in the ranks, in order to ensure that the Republic never falls under threat from within itself. Our Constitutionalist allies already believe in the importance of legalism, and they will serve as important educators and allies for us to replace this negative attitude that the military has toward Brazil's politics. To ensure that this sentiment will never reappear, we will continue to promote deserving Constitutionalist officers to senior positions to strengthen our support in the military."
 BRA_cool_the_tensions_desc: "To the surprise of no one, the military has been in vocal opposition to the Lott Act since the day it was announced. However, we cannot afford to have our armed forces continuously feel as if they are antagonized by the government, and we should work to re-establish trust and goodwill with them. It may be a tough sell to convince the military, but it is better that we try and convince a few folks. Talks will be set up with senior officers across the branches of the military, and a few token promises will be handed out to ensure that the military does not continue to feel as if we are targeting them. Even if we are, we cannot anger the military so soon, and it is necessary for us to de-escalate the situation, lest they feel compelled to attempt a coup of our government. "
 BRA_compromise_with_moderates_desc: "Just like us, the Sorbonne wish to see a stable and safe Brazil. A hostile military that is continuously eyeing the government with suspicion is one that is not protecting the Brazilian people against the perfidious fascists. Marshall Lott believes that there is room to compromise and work with the Sorbonne faction in order to implement some limitations on the military's influence. Although these compromises will not amount to anything close to what was in the Lott Act, something is better than nothing when it comes to safeguarding our democracy. Lott and several cabinet members will meet with General Geisel and see what can be done to convince the Sorbonne and ensure that the Hardliners will never be able to see their agenda come to life. "
 BRA_impement_failsafes_desc: "It is always prudent to prepare for the worst case scenario; Lott is still worried about a potential coup from the Hardliners with covert support from the UDN and PSP in the future. In order to counter this, plans will need to be drawn up to detail preparations and procedures should the government or our allies in the military ever suspect a potential coup. These plans will be reviewed by Constitutionalist generals to ensure that at least parts of the military will continue to stay loyal, and governors of key provinces will be briefed to ensure that the continuation of Brazil's democracy is set in stone. While some believe this action to be overly cautious, Lott believes that there is no price too high to pay for democracy to survive."
 BRA_reform_the_11th_of_november_movement_desc: "If the Hardliners want to play outside the law, then Lott must also resort to such underhanded tactics in order to ensure the survival of Brazil's democratic republic. Disbanded after several peaceful transitions of power after 1955, the 11th of November Movement was founded by Lott to serve as a clandestine group that would continuously promote democracy and do anything within their means to see the republic stand. However, Lott believes that it is necessary to resurrect this group to ensure that democracy will always live on in Brazil. With government resources, Lott can afford to give additional resources and intelligence to members of this movement, but the stakes are much, much higher. It is paramount that this movement lurks in the shadows, quietly promoting democracy; the discovery of this group could start a coup itself, if Lott is not careful."
 




######## Hundred Days Crisis
 BRA_brasilia_paralyzed: "Brasília Paralyzed"
 BRA_brasilia_paralyzed_desc: "The Hundred Days' Crisis has begun. President Lott resigned, Vice-President Quadros failed to seize control in the resulting vacuum, and the only remaining alternative, President of the Chamber of Deputies Goulart, who was the legal successor, was refused appointment to the Presidency by the machinations of Auro de Moura Andrade. The military, using the officer Sílvio Frota as a mouthpiece, has given the Senate exactly one-hundred days to choose a new President before it "does what it has to do". Disorder takes hold in the Parliament and the Republic more generally as four candidates - the PSD's Kubitschek, the PTB's Goulart, the PSP's Adhemar, and the UDN's Lacerda plan out their route to the Palácio do Planalto."
 BRA_now_or_never: "Now or Never"
 BRA_now_or_never_desc: "Time is running out! There are only a few days left before the Hundred Days come to an end and Sílvio Frota and his military goons go through with their threat. At this point, ideology is thrown out the window in favor of a pragmatic decision, and avoiding the disaster that would be a military intervention is of the highest priority. To that end, previously-undecided senators are beginning to coalesce behind the leading candidate despite whatever disagreements they might have with that individual. One can only hope that this show of democratic unity and prudence will be able to produce a definitive result before the nearly-empty hourglass runs dry."

## Crow and Bull
 BRA_the_crow_and_the_bull: "The Crow and the Bull"
 BRA_the_crow_and_the_bull_desc: "Lacerda and Adhemar are not friends by any definition of the term. Even if one catches them agreeing on something, they will react with denial if they hear claims that they are in fact in agreement on that topic. Despite this, the two men understand that they are better off fighting together instead of apart or worse yet against each other - only united do they have any hope of defeating the PSD-PTB coalition. This doesn't mean that they like each other any more than before all this started, however. As the Crisis rages and the deliberations begin, the tension between the Crow and the Bull can be felt from easily half a kilometre away."
 BRA_adhemars_strategy: "Adhemar's Strategy"
 BRA_adhemars_strategy_desc: "Adhemar de Barros is of the view that bribes and corruption will be more than sufficient to allow him to gain power. To that end, he will bribe and blackmail as many senators, congresspeople, and other such political riff-raff as humanly possible, digging up skeletons from closets faster than a land developer desecrating a cemetery, in order to obtain their (willing or unwilling) support for his candidacy. At the same time, he will go out and harangue the public all over Brazil in order to obtain their support for his presidency. The combination of corrupted politicians and adoring civilians will be more than enough, Adhemar thinks, to get him into the Palácio do Planalto."
 BRA_ready_the_psp: "Ready the PSP"
 BRA_ready_the_psp_desc: "It's true that the PSP are second fiddle to the UDN and PTB-PSD in terms of political power. But what they lack in numbers they more than make up for in loyalty to and fervor for their leaders. Their connections and local strength in critical states such as São Paulo, will make them a useful asset in securing Adhemar's victory in the Hundred Days' Crisis. It's time for Adhemar to call his PSP brethren to arms and kick their sleeping apparatus back into motion. From there, all he hopefully has to do is hold on to the guardrails and cruise down the easy road to power on the backs of his loyalists. "
 BRA_lacerdas_gambit: "Lacerda's Gambit"
 BRA_lacerdas_gambit_desc: "Lacerda is risking a lot to become the President. That's why he's called this little enterprise of his a "gambit," though maybe "desperado" would be a more appropriate term given his attitude. Why can we say this? This is because he believes that he simply cannot afford to lose; he has convinced himself that if he is defeated, the victor will try to do away with him. Accordingly, while relying on his own UDN as a solid block of support, he will apply media pressure on those senators he is able to target in order to obtain their backing."
 BRA_rally_the_udn: "Rally the UDN"
 BRA_rally_the_udn_desc: "The UDN were never ardent supporters of Vice-President Quadros. Not only is the man prone to making an absolute fool of himself if he so much as makes a single step or utters a single word, during his governance he had significant disagreements with UDN policy and made those known at every turn. After years of PSD "governance", it is high time that a UDN member rose to the Presidential dignity. The party members see this opportunity as clearly as Lacerda sees it himself and are eager to take it with both hands; to that end, they have offered him their full support. With the full force of the UDN behind him, Lacerda will be a formidable opponent in the race to control the presidential complex."
 BRA_bribes_for_some: "Bribes for Some"
 BRA_bribes_for_some_desc: "Adhemar knows more than many the effectiveness of bribery in convincing people in general, let alone against members of the political class. People can be turned from vehement opponents to fanatical supporters when exposed to a sufficiently large pile of cruzeiros; the fresher they look the better. With the sword of Sílvio Frota hanging over the Senate, less than a hundred days from falling on the collective head of all Brazil, time is of the essence; traditional negotiations are too slow and inefficient. Greasing palms is the quickest and most effective path to the Presidency. Promises of "budgetary allocation" and "special financial arrangements" should be sufficient to win over some of the more hesitant senators..."
 BRA_blackmail_for_others: "Blackmail for Others"
 BRA_blackmail_for_others_desc: "As one might expect from a man like Adhemar, he is no stranger to dirty tactics. Bribes offer a win-win situation for everyone involved. However some bright-eyed Senators, blind to how beneficial bribery is for them and fancying themselves followers of "justice", "righteousness", and "good governance", loudly consider themselves above such "immoral dealings".\n\nWhile Adhemar laughs at their manic-delusive sanctimony, he prepares an alternate method of persuasion - digging up the closeted skeletons of these so-called "paragons of virtue" and threatening them with a first-rate public airing of dirty laundry. That threat will probably shut up at least ninety percent of them long enough for Adhemar to seat himself behind the presidential desk. After that's done they are free, even welcome, to whine and yell as much as they damn well please; but all the response they will ever get at that point is "Frankly, Senator, I don't give a damn"."
 BRA_lacerdas_speeches: "Lacerda's Speeches"
 BRA_lacerdas_speeches_desc: "Lacerda is a gifted writer and skilled orator. He has a mastery of words on par with the great speakers of the olden days - Pericles, Demosthenes, Abraham Lincoln, and so on. Lacerda knows that he will have to put every talent he has to use if he is to win the Presidency. Accordingly, he plans to embark on a tour of the country, making speeches anywhere and everywhere. That will doubtless be more than sufficient to convince both the Brazilian public and the Senate in Brasília that he is the right man for the job and knows what's best for the State and its people."
 BRA_press_offensive: "Press Offensive"
 BRA_press_offensive_desc: "Brazil's senators are ultimately slaves to the will of the public; as a vampire falls down flat when attacked with garlic, so a senator breaks into a cold sweat when confronted with a hostile ballot. As such, the most effective means of persuading them is to make clear to the public that there's only one clear choice for the next President of Brazil (unless, of course, they want the Republic to fall to ruin). To ensure that the people are convinced of the necessity of choosing the correct President, Lacerda will reach out to his various press contacts throughout the country and have them engage in a bit of, shall we say, public enlightenment."
 BRA_approach_the_prp: "Approach the PRP"
 BRA_approach_the_prp_desc: "The integralists of the PRP are rightly considered too risky and/or radioactive to approach even at a ten-metre distance under most circumstances. (Mind you, they don't help themselves at all.) At this unique time, however, when the very foundations of the Brazilian State are threatened, they are instead an untapped potential source of support. They are currently weak enough where with a sufficiently advantageous deal we will be able to convince them to support us and lend their apparatus to back our candidacy, thus allowing us to push our candidate over the finish line first."

## Coalition Must Hold
 BRA_the_coalition_must_hold: "The Coalition Must Hold"
 BRA_the_coalition_must_hold_desc: "The alliance of the PSD and PTB must hold a conference in order to decide their candidate. João Goulart and the former President, Juscelino Kubitschek, are the two front-runners; they are both planning to make their cases before the party and people even at this very moment. But no matter who wins out, and no matter what platform is decided, two things are agreed upon by all factions of the PSD-PTB pact. The coalition must hold, and a PSD-PTB President must be elected, for the good of the Senate and people of the Republic of Brazil."
 BRA_regroup_the_psd: "Regroup the PSD"
 BRA_regroup_the_psd_desc: "The Partido Social Democrático is a successor to the regime of Getúlio Vargas; God knows we need to fall back on the wise policies of the Father of the Poor once more in these times of crisis. As one might expect, the PSD wields significant influence in both houses of the legislature, and frequently commands large portions of the vote every election. As such, winning their support is essential for the success of either Kubitschek or Goulart's campaign."

 BRA_gather_the_ptb_desc: "The Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro - the Labor Party of Brazil - also wields significant influence, and has done so ever since the demise of Vargas' government. In fact, when Kubitschek was first president about a half-decade ago now, Goulart, a PTB member, was his running-mate and eventually his Vice-President. His support and that of his party proved indispensable in all of Kubitschek's endeavors, especially the founding of Brasília. If Goulart or Kubitschek want to have the kind of success they had last time around, the support of the PTB will be just as indispensable as that of the PSD."
 BRA_the_conference: "The Conference"
 BRA_the_conference_desc: "The PSD-PTB intra-coalition conference is about to begin. The coalition will pass a final decision on which one between Kubitschek and Goulart is the better choice for the Presidency. We can only hope that a candidate will be chosen quickly so that the coalition can mobilize quickly behind him and thus ensure his election as President. But some worry that the convention, far from unifying the coalition and yielding a definitive choice, might instead further inflame already-brewing internal tensions. Needless to say, the eyes of all of the Republic as well as various interested parties in many regions of the world are on us today. "
 BRA_kubitscheks_stand: "Kubitscheck's Stand"
 BRA_kubitscheks_stand_desc: "Kubitschek will not give up, even after the PSD-PTB conference was thrown into deadlock. He deems it critical to take a stand against Lacerda and Adhemar. Accordingly, he will gather his own PSD and convince PTB and UDN members to support him for the Presidency. Despite the recent setback, Kubitschek still refuses to give in or fold over after a single defeat; such luxuries are only available for a weak-minded individual. He believes, not without reason, that he can still win. As such, he will keep fighting hard right to the end of the Hundred Days until and unless he wins or has no choice but to throw in the towel."
 BRA_the_bully_pulpit: "The Bully Pulpit"
 BRA_the_bully_pulpit_desc: ""Bully pulpit, noun - a conspicuous public office or position of authority that provides its occupant with an outstanding opportunity to speak out on any issue. Apparently originally used by President Theodore Roosevelt, explaining his personal view of the presidency."\n\nKubitschek is no slouch when it comes to oratory, nor is he little-known among the people of Brazil. He has a bully pulpit like no-one else in Brazil, and he will put it to good use, campaigning through the Congress and the country at large to make the case for returning him to power as President. After all, unlike all the other candidates, he has a shiny new city and beautiful buildings to point at and claim he made all by himself.\n\n"Niemeyer? Who's that? Never heard of him. It was all me. I did it all.""
 BRA_compromise_with_the_udn: "Compromise With the UDN"
 BRA_compromise_with_the_udn_desc: "The loss of Vice-President Quadros has set the UDN reeling; Kubitschek sees an opportunity in this. Kubitschek, being a former president (and a damn good one if he says so himself), is a known variable for the UDN. It is a well-known fact that negotiations are far easier when you know who you're dealing with. As such, it will be far easier to reach a compromise with at least some of the UDN senators and thereby bring them to our side. After all, a man you've spoken to before is a far better choice for your president than a corrupt good-for-nothing, an idiot who lusts after a golden past that never existed, or worse yet, some violent imbecile who dreams of a time when he can play "dissident-and-reformer hunting" every day and get away with it."
 BRA_plead_with_the_ptb: "Plead With the PTB"
 BRA_plead_with_the_ptb_desc: "After the political Maracanaço that was the beginning of the intra-coalition conference, it will be difficult for Kubitschek and the PSD to convince the PTB to abandon their golden boy Goulart. But the interests of the Nation and of the coalition demand unity between the two parties, and Goulart must be cast aside in order to achieve this. Therefore Kubitschek has decided to approach some of them in private and offer them funding, money, and other such perks in exchange for their support and backing. One can only hope that he will be able to convince the grandees of the Labour Party to see reason."
 BRA_people_power: "People Power"
 BRA_people_power_desc: "As a result of the achievements of his previous term - building the new capital not least among them - Kubitschek is currently quite popular with the average people of Brazil. This gives him an advantage over virtually any other candidate, as he does not need to waste any more time on introducing himself and building a reputation. Kubitschek plans to put this bully pulpit to immediate and effective use - he will make speeches and hold rallies like no one else in Brazil can to galvanize his campaign. This will have the effect of swinging some members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies towards him, since the voice of the people will naturally affect the thought processes of their representatives. "
 BRA_goularts_gamble: "Goulart's Gamble"
 BRA_goularts_gamble_desc: "After that bastard Auro de Moura Andrade blocked João Goulart from being sworn in as President of Brazil, even though constitutionally as President of the Chamber of Deputies he was the rightful successor, many gave up hope in him. But in the halls of the PTB there are many functionaries who are still saying that Goulart can still win out. As the PTB is the largest party in the House of Deputies and a major party in the Senate with socialist backing, Goulart has a solid chance of coming out of the Hundred Days' Crisis as President...\n\n...provided he can convince the PSD that Kubitschek is a lost cause and to back him instead. But that is in and of itself a great challenge; Goulart will have his work cut out for him in the upcoming days and weeks."
 BRA_approach_the_constitutionalists: "Approach the Constitutionalists"
 BRA_approach_the_constitutionalists_desc: "The Constitutionalist faction of the military are known for their loyalty to the Republic, its people, and the established democratic order. They have been very public with their expressions of confidence in the democratic process currently being undergone. Even better, they say time and again to anyone willing to listen that they have faith in our ability to weather the crisis.\n\nGoulart, relying on his connection to his former boss, the previous President, will get hold of the leaders of the Constitutionalists in order to obtain their backing - support from good men like these is a great help in any endeavor, particularly in a democratic crisis."
 BRA_adhemars_proposal: "Adhemar's Proposal"
 BRA_adhemars_proposal_desc: "That snake Adhemar de Barros, secretary to Lucifer himself, has approached the PTB leadership for some reason, offering to stand aside in favor of Goulart in exchange for what he calls something "mutually beneficial". Under any other circumstances, we would rather be thrown out of a window than cooperate with a corrupt, backstabbing good-for-nothing like Adhemar. But the times are desperate and a sword is hanging over all our heads, no matter our party affiliation. So we will talk to him and see just what this "mutual benefit" of his entails, and also learn what he and his party want in exchange for it."
 BRA_bribe_the_psd: "Bribe the PSD"
 BRA_bribe_the_psd_desc: "The PSD requires some more convincing to set Kubitschek aside and support Goulart instead. Though we have successfully cajoled a large group of them, there are significant holdouts among the more conservative members of the party. But these are desperate times in which we cannot leave anything to chance. The interests of the coalition, of democracy, of Brazil itself demand Goulart's victory, and that victory must be with total backing from both parties of the Coalition. Fortunately we happen to have reliable information that some of these naysayers are quite responsive to a dose of the good old payola; let's put that to use and thereby further unite the coalition behind Goulart. "
 BRA_the_shadow_master: "The Old Master in the shadows"
 BRA_the_shadow_master_desc: "In his political infancy, João Goulart was mentored by the Father of the Poor, the most influential President of Brazil, Getúlio Vargas himself. As a doyen of the party, his endorsement would be of significant benefit to Goulart in his effort to gain further support in both the PSD and the PTB. Moreover, it would also improve his goodwill with the populace and reduce the advantage that Kubitschek has in that area. To that end, Goulart will approach his aging mentor in an effort to gain that coveted endorsement and further improve his chances of coming out of the Hundred Days as President of the Republic."
 BRA_a_matter_of_formalities: "A Matter of Formalities"
 BRA_a_matter_of_formalities_desc: "While the first session of the congress concluded without a decision, the proceedings have finally attained a modicum of stability. Various grandees and representatives are choosing sides. Supporters high and low are beginning to coalesce around the two main contenders. Debate is raging everywhere one looks, though it is of course less vicious and polarized than it was at the disastrous beginning of the conference. If one looks more closely, however, it is clear that a decision is almost in sight. Perhaps we will at last be able to make an end and put the military threat behind us once and for all, thus bringing about a new era of good governance in the tradition of President Vargas."
 BRA_hold_the_vote: "Hold the Vote"
 BRA_hold_the_vote_desc: "The Leadership Conference of the PSD-PTB Coalition is at last nearing its close. Leaders of both parties sigh in relief as the atmosphere cools further and people finish making their decisions in a peaceful manner. A decision between these two strong candidates is quite clearly on the horizon, and the vote will be taken very soon. Let us hope that a clear verdict is reached, and that the coalition will firmly unite behind the chosen candidate, for its own good as for that of all Brazil. We have a democracy and a people to save, after all, and it's well past time we set about doing so."




######## Lacerda
 BRA_lacerda_presidency: "The Lacerda Presidency"
 BRA_lacerda_presidency_desc: "The Hundred Days' Crisis has ended with a successful decision, and Carlos Lacerda emerges from the Congresso Nacional as President of the Republic of Brazil. As he is sworn in, a weight lifts off his back, since he knows that as President he is now safe from any danger - imagined or real - that he was in beforehand. Now it's time for the new President to put the lessons he learned as Governor of Guanabara to use and apply them to Brazil as a whole, with a view on cleansing the plague that is Getulism from the Republic and its people."
 BRA_crow_flies: "The Crow Takes Flight"
 BRA_crow_flies_desc: "Lacerda knows that there is only one year left before the next election is called. Because of this he must move quickly and make every change that has to be made in order to bring prosperity and success to the nation. Time flies and the welfare of all Brazil demands that he take decisive action and make the very most of the time that he has been given. As such the President will shift himself and his government apparatus into high gear. He knows the possible cost of failure: if he doesn't do things right, the Getulists might be swept back into power, and he and his supporters will have failed in their objective for the foreseeable future."
 BRA_meet_with_us_ambassador: "Meet with the Ambassador"
 BRA_meet_with_us_ambassador_desc: "First on the agenda is a meeting with the ambassador of the United States of America here in Brazil. It is known that our close alliance with the Land of the Free in the north is one of the major factors behind Brazilian security on the international stage and success in the socioeconomic realm. As such it would be folly not to further strengthen the already-close relationship we have with the Americans. So we will approach the Americans, our democratic brethren, with the hand of friendship extended. Let's see where such a friendly gesture takes us."

 BRA_ask_ofn_observer: "Ask for Observer Status"
 BRA_ask_ofn_observer_desc: "Ever since the failed defence of Great Britain against the Hitlerite invaders, the United States and Brazil have been strategic partners. Now, in one of the few initiatives most of Brazil agrees on, Brazilian boys have fought and bled side-by-side with Americans, South Africans, and other OFN members for the preservation of freedom in Southern Africa. The next step is obvious, and Lacerda will take it rather than evasively tip-toeing around it like virtually every other politician in Brasília does. It's time to formally align Brazil with the Organization of Free Nations - let's request a well-merited and long-overdue admission to observer status with them."
 BRA_talk_at_ofn: "Speak at the OFN"
 BRA_talk_at_ofn_desc: "As we prepare to be welcomed into the American coalition, it's coming time for us to make a visit to the headquarters of the Organization of Free Nations. Lacerda will commission a top ambassador go north and meet with the good members of that noble coalition. While there, he will reaffirm the Brazilian commitment to democracy and opposition to the poisonous Nazi aggression in Africa and the world more generally. This will definitely help seal the deal in our ongoing negotiations to join the OFN, especially since we have already backed our words with actions."
 BRA_visit_washington: "Visit Washington"
 BRA_visit_washington_desc: "It has been a busy few months for Lacerda thus far. But he will not hear of taking a break while there is still work to be done. No vacations for him yet; he must at the very least see to it that Brazil has firmly ensconced itself in the Organization of Free Nations. To that end, he will visit the United States for diplomatic talks and hobnob with congressmen, delegates, and other assorted dignitaries for as long as it takes until they become as eager about Brazilian membership in the OFN as Lacerda himself is. He'd best keep a coat or two ready while he's there; Washington is pretty cold for a man used to Guanabara and the Distrito Federal."
 BRA_increase_cia_contact: "Increase CIA Contacts"
 BRA_increase_cia_contact_desc: "The United States possesses an intelligence apparatus on a scale far larger than any of us can dream of. Even with this Brazil is still potentially useful to them. It is a gateway to South America, after all, on a scale that even the Argentinians cannot hope to rival. Therefore there is much we can provide the Americans in terms of intelligence-gathering and the promotion of their interests. The US-Brazil intelligence collaboration is a fruitful relationship that has a lot to offer to both of us; common sense demands that we move to strengthen it as quickly as possible."
 BRA_joint_military_operations: "Joint Military Operations"
 BRA_joint_military_operations_desc: "Even if the United States came up short fighting against the Nazi and Japanese monstrosities, they remain a powerful military juggernaut. Their technology, esprit de corps, and tactics remain admired by countless militaries the world over, and Brazil is no exception to this. Lacerda understands the need to cooperate and learn from our American brethren. To that end, he will order the Brazilian armed forces to cooperate with America in joint military exercises. This will hopefully be a learning experience for our military."

 BRA_double_down_troops: "Double Down in South Africa"
 BRA_double_down_troops_desc: "The war against the Reichskommissariats in southern Africa continues to rage; the conflict with the three German colonial tyrannies is nowhere near over. It is clear to any observer that additional support will be required if we are to drive the so-called "Aryan master race" back from the South African border. The Republic of Brazil is proud to serve as a bulwark against the National Socialist threat; as such, we will rise to the occasion with relish. To that end, President Lacerda, following the correct method of President Lott, will personally sign decrees authorizing further groups of volunteers for the South African Front."
 BRA_send_more_guns: "Send More Guns"
 BRA_send_more_guns_desc: "The war rages on and supplies are constantly being consumed. Without guns, of course, South Africa will have no choice but to capitulate and let the Hitlerite and Boer scum run amok. The thought of these race-deluded madmen running wild in Cape Town or Pretoria the same way they do in Burgundy or the Ukraine is an intolerable nightmare to any Brazilian with his or her head screwed on the right way. Therefore, we will do everything we can to prevent such a thing from taking place. As such, guns and other assorted materiel will follow the new wave of volunteers for the South African Front."
 BRA_skirmish_with_germans: "Skirmish with the Germans"
 BRA_skirmish_with_germans_desc: "The Brazilian Navy, having successfully handled the matter of the Lobster War, and not wanting to be outdone by the ground and air forces, has approached President Lacerda asking for greater involvement in the South African War. This proposal pleases Lacerda; he will give them something to do. Much of the American and other allied navies are caught up elsewhere; leaving a large portion of the South Atlantic empty. The Germans know this and have caused the OFN no small amount of grief in that area; however, our fresh naval forces are more than capable of beating them back. This is a good opportunity for us to flex our naval muscle and secure the South Atlantic against the Nazi-and-Boer menace."

 BRA_welcome_the_refugees: "Welcome the Refugees"
 BRA_welcome_the_refugees_desc: "With the OFN and South Africa utterly defeated in the South African War, and the bigoted, Hitler-loving Boers given legal control over the whole of South Africa, a brain drain is currently occurring as many of the former Union's best and brightest minds flee for less hostile climes.\n\nBrazil has always been a country that strives to welcome intellectuals and innovators, no matter what race they are from. After all, immigrants, beginning with King João VI himself, were instrumental in strengthening Brazil both during the Empire and during the Republic. So we will roll out the red carpet once more and welcome these people, offering them shelter in exchange for their services."
 BRA_lessons_of_defeat: "Lessons from Defeat"
 BRA_lessons_of_defeat_desc: "We must examine the strategic and tactical failures that led to the South African and OFN defeat in Africa and learn everything we possibly can from them. Doubtless there are many lessons that we will be able to put to use when the next battle comes around, and we should get to absorbing them as quickly as possible. After all, if we fail to learn from the failures of the past, what chance will we have to ensure victory against the fascists when they inevitably try to bring their degeneracy to our shores?"
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control_2: "Reassert Atlantic Control"
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control_2_desc: "Before the War began, President Lott successfully drove the Reichskommissariat vultures out of our waters, but with their recent victory in the South African War they have regained their confidence and have started to violate our maritime borders once again. This cannot be borne. Out of respect for the work of his predecessor and Admiral Toscano, and especially due to our concern for the wellbeing of Brazilian fishermen, President Lacerda will order the Brazilian Navy to sally out once again and teach the Germans a few hundred lessons in respect, with or without lethal force. By the time our sailors are done with them, they will know better than to invade our seas."

 BRA_keepers_of_the_peace: "Keepers of the Peace"
 BRA_keepers_of_the_peace_desc: "The bloody South African War has ended in a ceasefire for the time being. However, only an idiot would trust the word of a Nazi, or a Boer signature on a page. To that end, even if we recall most of our volunteers, some of them should stay behind to keep an eye on the border in case hostilities resume.\n\nThey'll also have a lot of fireworks to watch - intelligence informs us that the failure in the South African War cut the legs out from under the Reichskommissariats. It will be an interesting learning experience for us to watch members of the "superior Aryan-blooded master race" flail about like the rest of us normal human beings do after a failure like that."
 BRA_guns_for_guards: "Guns for the Border Guards"
 BRA_guns_for_guards_desc: "Though it isn't as difficult as fighting in an actual war, patrolling the entirety of the border with the Reichskommissariats is easier said than done. In particular, the guards will need quite a lot of equipment to make sure that any refugees are kept safe, and any fleeing Hitlerites kept on the other side of the border. Accordingly, vehicles, guns, and other assorted supplies will be sent to the South African-German frontier in order to ensure that the border guards are well-supplied and can watch the fireworks to their north without any worry of running out of what they need."
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control: "Reassert Atlantic Control"
 BRA_reassert_atlantic_control_desc: "Before the War began, President Lott successfully drove the Reichskommissariat vultures out of our waters. However, with their recent failure in the South African War, their despair and anger has driven them to recklessness and they have started to violate our maritime borders once again. This cannot be borne. Out of respect for the work of his predecessor and Admiral Toscano, and especially due to our concern for the wellbeing of Brazilian fishermen, President Lacerda will order the Brazilian Navy to sally out once again and teach the Germans a few hundred lessons in respect, with or without lethal force. By the time our sailors are done with them, they will know better than to invade our seas."

 BRA_eradicate_the_jackboot: "Lifting the Jackboot"
 BRA_eradicate_the_jackboot_desc: "For too long the African peoples were kept under the brutal jackboot of the German colonial regime. Now, order must be kept in these restive, wartorn places. To that end, if we choose to recall any of our volunteers, a large proportion of them should stay behind to keep things stable. Moreover, we will want to send Brazilian troops to help American-OFN forces clean out the remainder of the Nazi menace, remove any non-cooperative warlords, and keep things safe and sane as Africa is guided down the slow and hard road to stability."
 BRA_arm_the_peacekeepers: "Arm the Peacekeepers"
 BRA_arm_the_peacekeepers_desc: "Though it isn't as difficult as fighting in an actual war, keeping the peace in post-German Africa will still be easier said than done. In particular, the mandates will need quite a lot of equipment, medicine, and supplies to make sure that the oppressed are uplifted, the bandits kept suppressed, the Nazis in prison, and the various guerillas and revolutionaries restrained until the correct time. Accordingly, vehicles, medicine, guns, and other assorted supplies will be sent to the OFN mandates in order to ensure that the peacekeepers are well-supplied and can successfully go about decolonization without any worry of running out of what they need."
 BRA_remind_the_pirates: "Remind the Pirates"
 BRA_remind_the_pirates_desc: "Before the Crisis of '64, President Lott successfully drove the pirates and illegal fishermen out of our waters. However, with the recent collapse of German Afrika and the anarchy that that has created, they have started to throng our seas once again. This will not be tolerated. Therefore, President Lacerda will order the Brazilian Navy to sally out once again and teach these fools a few hundred lessons in respect with authorization to use lethal force if need be. By the time our sailors are done with them, they will know better than to steal from our seas, no matter who is in charge in Brazil."

 BRA_shaking_things_up: "Shaking Things Up"
 BRA_shaking_things_up_desc: "When Lacerda served as Governor of Guanabara - that is, the chief administrator of the great city of Rio de Janeiro and first servant of its people - he shook everything up like a Chilean mega-earthquake, leaving no stone unturned, no edifice unchanged, no policy unaltered. Inefficiencies were destroyed left and right, and those who contributed to them were kicked out on the seat of their pants. This earned Lacerda the acclaim of Rio's citizens and the attention of the powers-that-be throughout the Republic. Hence, during the Hundred Days he made no secret of his plan to do the same for Brazil. Now he is President, and he will transform Brazilian domestic policy the same way he did that off Rio, once more rooting inefficiencies out left and right."
 BRA_lacerdaomics: "Lacerdanomics"
 BRA_lacerdaomics_desc: "Vargas, with his inane socialist policies such as nationalizing key industries everywhere and anywhere, single-handedly sent our nation's policy down a backslide that became a continuous downward spiral. Lacerda, an adherent of sound, prudent conservative policy, knows far better than to let such foolhardiness continue on his watch. To that end, he will begin by privatizing parts of smaller state monopolies such as Vale, the mining corporation, the steelmaker CSN, or the car manufacturer FNM, starting with smaller, less cumbersome targets in order to allow him to privatize the largest one of them all - Petrobras."
 BRA_what_vargas_did_right: "Vargas' One Success"
 BRA_what_vargas_did_right_desc: "Nationalization is a ridiculous policy, just like virtually every other socialist policy. But Lacerda is a pragmatist above all; he recognizes that some state oversight is needed if Brazil wants to assure itself some semblance of energy independence. As such, Lacerda has no choice but to give the hated Vargas credit for his prudence in this matter. While for all that it chagrins us, Petrobras must stay around, we can at least purge it of bloating and inefficiency. To that end, we will auction off underexploited mineral rights and privatize limited portions of the company."
 BRA_dismantle_the_monopoly: "Dismantle the Monopoly"
 BRA_dismantle_the_monopoly_desc: "Petrobras was the biggest travesty of the Vargas Era! It turned one of the most promising wealth-generators in Brazil into an inefficient, lumbering dinosaur straight out of a Japanese "animêção" drama. Unprofitable, corrupt, and hamstrung by bureaucracy, it is incapable of even partially exploiting the black gold within our borders. Exactly how will we profit off of our natural wealth if we're held back from exploiting it? The President thinks it is well past time for this "Godzilla" of a state monopoly to be dismantled and privatized as soon as possible!"
 BRA_scale_down_trans_amazonian: "Scale Down the Amazonian Project"
 BRA_scale_down_trans_amazonian_desc: "Lott had an inane, idealistic fantasy about "building a road through the Amazon Rainforest", and the yes-men of his administration were unwilling or unable to tell him the truth. For all its great promises of connecting the Brazilian coast to the Andes, it is in practice a massive sink of resources that has yet to yield any benefit. Accordingly, Lacerda will pull back funding from the project - for now - and auction off some of the machinery used in it in order to service the financial liabilities the previous President's foolish ambition created."
 BRA_a_few_more_cuts: "A Few More Cuts"
 BRA_a_few_more_cuts_desc: "The previous President plunged Brazil into a morass of inefficient and asinine spending - a quixotic passion project here, a misplaced investment there -  that left our financial portfolio a mess. Even the things he did right he dealt with in a financially incompetent manner; no wonder, then, that his end was as humiliating as it was. Having dealt with the Trans-Amazonian Highway project, which was the origin of the worst financial problems, we can also make some more cuts here and there to further reduce the deficit. This will put Brazil on a more stable economic trajectory that is also certain to guarantee his reelection as President."
 BRA_integrate_ccc: "Integrate the "Squads""
 BRA_integrate_ccc_desc: "Great Rio de Janeiro, like all large cities, is quite difficult to control. That is especially true if you only have a police force so comically incompetent it could trip over its own feet and end up in a satirical situation comedy. As such, during his governorship, Lacerda was left with no choice but to make use of squads of what uncharitable minds call "paramilitaries" or "militias". These people were competent and loyal, serving as Lacerda's hands and feet in his efforts to root out corruption, crime, and Getulism from the jewel that is Guanabara. Doubtless Lacerda can still find a use for these good and faithful servants now that he is President."
 BRA_protect_american_interests: "Protect American Interests"
 BRA_protect_american_interests_desc: "The interests of the Brazilian people are the first concern in Lacerda's mind. If we are to preserve the Brazilian popular interest, the American interest must be considered a close second to it. The Land of the Free to the North, the Last Best Hope of Freedom, is the source of so much of our economic success. If we give the good Yankees any cause for reproach, the entirety of our people will suffer. With this in mind, the President has declared that American interests must be protected. To that end, Lacerda will arrange to protect current American investments in Brazil as a baseline and incentive for them to keep sending investment dollars here."

 BRA_join_ofn: "Join the OFN"
 BRA_join_ofn_desc: "Lacerda is a strong believer in the concept of US-Brazil partnership. He also realizes that with the next election coming ever closer, he may not be the President anymore in a year's time. Though others may decry his decision as premature, Lacerda will now push for Brazil's admittance to the Organization of Free Nations. He will cite as his justification the unprecedented German aggression witnessed in South Africa and other places in the last two years. If the Crow must leave the skies of Brasília, he will do so having left his nest - that is, Brazil - in a secure position."

But when the good Lord saw fit to give him the opportunity, he took it with both hands and was able to set Brazil on a promising trajectory. He was able to ensure a close partnership with America and the OFN more generally. Even more importantly, he successfully dismantled the foolhardy policies of Vargas as much as he was able. Now, the Crow sets his eyes on the upcoming federal election with a view on winning and finishing what he has been able to start these past few years."

But when the good Lord saw fit to give him the opportunity, he took it with both hands and was able to set Brazil on a promising trajectory. He successfully dismantled the foolhardy policies of Vargas as much as he was able. He established close relations with America and the rest of the OFN. But he was prevented from ensuring an even closer partnership with America by the refusal of his bill in the Federal Congress. Now, the Crow sets his eyes on the upcoming federal election with a view on winning and finishing what he has been able to start these past few years.

 BRA_kubitschecks_return_desc: "In the aftermath of the chaos and misery that was the Hundred Days' Crisis, the former President Juscelino Kubitschek has once more been entrusted with the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil. Though he had always had ambitions to run for the presidency once more in 1965, the chaos set off by the lunatic Quadros has made his return all the easier. As for the new President, he is justifiably confident in his abilities; as he enters the Palácio do Planalto, he knows that he will be able to save Brazil once more, as he did the first time around."

 BRA_talk_with_the_military_desc: "The military of the Republic of Brazil is not very happy with the events of the recent Hundred Days' Crisis, which makes sense in light of their actions during that time. Fortunately for them and us, the new President is a known and tolerated variable for the armed forces. If Kubitschek wants his presidency to survive, he should leverage this fact; he knows this and has every intention of doing so. As such, he will talk to them and get them to, as the old Crook of California says, "calm the hell down" and get back to working with him as they did in the past. When that is done, Kubitschek will be able to get back to work."
 BRA_promote_soborne: "Promote the Sorbonne"
 BRA_promote_soborne_desc: "The moderate Sorbonne Faction of the Brazilian Armed Forces are of the mind that the government should be supported so long as it remains stable and does not threaten Sorbonne-held positions. The President is of the view that this is an eminently reasonable position to take, especially when one compares it to the militarists and their inane, power-hungry claims that "the people cannot be trusted to rule themselves" and "only the military can rule the country". As such, President Kubitschek will take action to promote some Sorbonne leaders in the military, thereby ensuring their support for the government."
 BRA_work_with_constitutionalist: "Work with the Constitutionalists"
 BRA_work_with_constitutionalist_desc: "The esteemed Constitutionalist Faction of the Brazilian military are genuine believers in democracy, rule of law, and the protection of the public welfare. Many of them consider themselves as little more than civilians and public servants in uniforms; this belief, as well as disgust at the alternatives, was what motivated them to defend Kubitschek's rule as President of Brazil in 1955 under the leadership of Marshals Lott and Denys. Now nearly a decade has passed and Kubitschek is President once more. Accordingly, he will work with the people that saved his hide the first time so as to ensure the safety of his second mandate."
 BRA_bring_back_golden_years: "Bring Back the Golden Years"
 BRA_bring_back_golden_years_desc: "The first mandate of President Juscelino Kubitschek is fondly remembered as a golden age of development, progress, and glory for the Republic of Brazil and its people. Countless projects that improved the welfare of the Brazilian people were built, culminating with the construction of the great city of Brasília, a glorious jewel in the crown of our nation. Now the man that brought that golden age about is back in power, and he will fight tooth and nail to bring it back about. Let there be no more crises or chaos in this glorious republic of ours, only progress, stability, and "Ordem e Progresso"!"
 BRA_fund_highway: "Fund the Highway"
 BRA_fund_highway_desc: "President Kubitschek's esteemed predecessor, President Marshal Lott, had some blunders here and there (one big one that comes to mind is giving Quadros reason to start running around and screeching like nails on a chalkboard). But the good Marshal had one brilliant idea, which President Kubitschek wholeheartedly and enthusiastically supports: the Trans-Amazonian Highway connecting Brazil to its hinterlands and to the rest of South America. Since the fall of the Lott government, this glorious project has languished for lack of resources and funding; Kubitschek will not tolerate this. As such, he will provide whatever attention or money the Highway needs."
 BRA_expand_automobile_industry: "Expand the Automobile Industry"
 BRA_expand_automobile_industry_desc: "The automobile industry of Brazil is currently prospering. It produces countless cars for the domestic and even some foreing markets. But it can make, sell, and export even more cars. President Kubitschek will pull out all the stops in order to make that happen. Government investment funds will be poured into the Brazilian car industry in order to allow the companies to expand their production lines and strengthen their export capabilities. This initiative, combined with the President's other plans, will continue to further the industrialization of Brazil and help make our Republic the workshop of the whole world."
 BRA_south_american_support: "South American Support"
 BRA_south_american_support_desc: "Our honored South American neighbors can be of great use to us. They can support us diplomatically in our local and global negotiations, which will make our dealings with the larger powers easier. They can also assist us by trading with us, which will boost both our economy and theirs. However, we are not as close with our neighbors as we should be; accordingly, we have some work to get done before we can go and ask them for their support. As such, the President has directed the foreign experts and ambassadors of Brazil to work to improve relations with all South America from Bogotá to Puerto Madryn."
 BRA_chainsaw_and_diggers: "Chainsaws and Diggers"
 BRA_chainsaw_and_diggers_desc: "The glorious project that is the Trans-Amazonian Highway needs more resources if it is to successfully cut its way through the Amazon Rainforest. This will not be feasible if the workers do not have the right equipment. Nor will it be able to continue if the project's accounts remain as lacking in investment as they are. To prevent this, President Kubitschek will earmark funds for investing money in the locality and in purchasing cutting-edge construction devices such as chainsaws, excavators, and the like. This will help ensure that the project is completed in a reasonable timeframe."
 BRA_increase_industrialisation_spending: "Increase Industrialisation Spending"
 BRA_increase_industrialisation_spending_desc: "If the Brazilian economy is to continue growing, more money must be spent on industrialization. Kubitschek wants the economy to continue growing, so he will do just that. It's a beneficial version of the domino effect really. If industrialization spending goes up, the economy will be strengthened. If the economy is strengthened, votes for the PSD will be boosted. If the PSD goes up in the polls, then Kubitschek will be re-elected. And if Kubitschek is re-elected, good governance will prevail once more, stability will persist, and we will be well-placed to build Ordem e Progresso in our nation. There is nothing - except maybe some kind of global crisis coming out of nowhere and cutting the legs out from beneath us, but how could that happen? - that can prevent this from happening."
 BRA_increase_trade_with_guyana: "Increase Trade with Guyana"
 BRA_increase_trade_with_guyana_desc: "Our northern neighbor, the Republic of Guyana, is a fairly small nation as members of the Organization of Free Nations go. But that does not diminish its importance in President Kubitschek's trade strategy. It will be very easy to make a puny, comparatively disorganized nation like that economically dependent on Brazil. If we can pull that off, that part of our northern border will be secure, and we will have significant influence over what does or does not happen in Guyana. That kind of influence is always a useful thing to have. With that aim in mind, let's start off by increasing exports and trade with them."
 BRA_visit_argentina: "Visit Argentina"
 BRA_visit_argentina_desc: "In the last century, we fought with our southern neighbors. There was constant conflict and bloodshed in territories such as Corrientes and Paraguay. Fortunately, those days are now long gone, and relations with the brethren to our south are more-or-less satisfactory. With President Kubitschek's recent directive to strengthen relations with other South American nations, Argentina has come into our sights. Close relations with them will help improve relations, settle any remaining disputes, and most importantly strengthen trade to the benefit of both our economies. To that end, President Kubitschek has decided to visit his counterpart in the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires."
 BRA_march_to_manaus: "March to Manaus"
 BRA_march_to_manaus_desc: "The Trans-Amazonian Highway is finally close to completion. After so much work, funding, and difficulties, we have managed to push the highway farther than our predecessor could have done or its opponents ever dreamed it would reach. We have come so far, but we need just one last burst of effort to finish the project and gain the credit for what was essentially Marshal Lott's idea. If we can get the highway extended to Manaus and beyond, then our efforts will not have been for nothing. Let's get on with it, for the sake of Brazil and its people."
 BRA_build_more_roads: "Build More Roads"
 BRA_build_more_roads_desc: "Roads, not railways, are what will send Brazil into the future. If we have more roads, it will incentivize people to buy more cars, thereby strengthening the car industry. If the industry is strengthened, our economy will expand and businesses will prosper even more than they already do due to the fact that we made their work easier by building roads. It is a positive feedback loop set off by the simple action of building new roads and paving over existing unpaved ones. As such, expanding the road system is a no-brainer for President Kubitschek, and he will do it. "
 BRA_ambasodorial_dinners: "Wining and Dining"
 BRA_ambasodorial_dinners_desc: "With President Kubitschek's recent directive to the foreign establishment of Brazil to strengthen relations with its fellow South American nations having yielded some fruit, it is time to go further with the charm offensive and ensure once and for all their continued support and respect for our nation. Let us call on their ambassadors and invite them to as many ambassadorial dinners as they want to attend. This will further improve their already-improved opinions of us and therefore strengthen our trade ties with our South American neighbors. To peaceful relations and trade (all in the Brazilian interest of course) - saúde!"
 BRA_all_roads_lead_to_brasilia: "All Roads Lead to Brasília"
 BRA_all_roads_lead_to_brasilia_desc: "Building roads and improving existing ones wherever the eye can see is not enough if we want a good infrastructure system. After all, what's the point of a road if it isn't connected to any other roads? As such, we must connect our new roads and highways to the national highway system and make sure these roads are connected to Brasília. The result of this will be to connect the whole nation through a reliable network of interconnected roads. When that is done, our economy will prosper even more, and everyone will praise their esteemed President Kubitschek for all his hard work."
 BRA_meet_with_petrobas: "Meet With Petrobas"
 BRA_meet_with_petrobas_desc: "Petrobras, our national oil company, is of significant importance to our nation and its economy. Founded by President Kubitschek under the wise advice of Vargas, it provides Brazil with an all-important resource: oil. Our heavy reliance on imported oil for economic development leaves us with a potential disaster in the offing if something should happen to that oil; as such, we need to expand any alternative sources within the nation. Therefore, Kubitschek will meet with the heads of Petrobras to figure out how Brazil can expand local operations that extract and refine oil so as to reduce our reliance on foreign oil sources."
 BRA_industrialize_the_north_east: "Industrialize the Northeast"
 BRA_industrialize_the_north_east_desc: "The northeast of Brazil is a region of incredible economic potential. However, it is held back from attaining this greatness by a myriad of constraints from the past. Kubitschek, on the other hand, fully recognizes the economic potential and the benefit it could bring to its citizens and the Republic of Brazil more generally. Accordingly, he will order the Finance Ministry to invest in industrialization projects in the northeast with a view on pushing that region into the modern ages. This will improve prosperity in that region, boost the Brazilian economy, and, most importantly, help Kubitschek's chances of winning the next election. "
 BRA_expand_the_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 BRA_expand_the_dockyards_desc: "Due to the circumstances in which Brazil was established, the modern Brazilian nation is possessed of a large coastline with many ports and docks scattered all across it. These sites form a major part of our import-export structure. If we expand these ports into full-fledged dockyards and trading ports, it will further strengthen our economy as more and more goods will then be able to be brought into and exported from our great nation. Let us therefore begin a campaign of investing in marine infrastructure at as many points of the Brazlilian coast as is feasible, from the Guyanese border in the far north to the Uruguayan border in the far south. "
 BRA_airports_in_reclife: "Airports in Reclife"
 BRA_airports_in_reclife_desc: "Part of our plan to improve the northwestern states of Brazil is to improve its infrastructure. We have built roads, which are well and good, but we can even further strengthen our economy by building airports and expanding those that already exist. This will incentivize international and regional air travel in the area and allow airborne trade and tourists to enter Brazil through its northwest. To that end, President Kubitschek will issue orders to build airports in and around the city of Recife, which will certainly be of use in our efforts to bring about an economic golden age in the Republic of Brazil."
 BRA_final_bills: "Final Bills"
 BRA_final_bills_desc: "In his second, caretaker term as President, appointed in the aftermath of the Hundred Days' Crisis, Juscelino Kubitschek has been able to achieve a great amount of things in his struggle to bring Brazil back to the good and prosperous days of his first term. But now the scheduled 1965 election is on its way, and Kubitschek must instead focus on winning it. Before he gets to work on getting a third term, he can pass a few more bills to further increase infrastructure and industrialization spending. Having done that, he can go and secure for his no doubt inevitable victory in the upcoming election."
 BRA_politicians_dont_die_they_fade: "Mais Uma Vez À Brecha!"
 BRA_politicians_dont_die_they_fade_desc: "Juscelino Kubitschek has once more attained the pinnacle of BrazIlian political power, after having gotten so much done for his people the first time around. For him, the opportunity to once more bring about a golden age for his country was too great to pass up; that is why he chose to throw his hat into the ring when the presidential succession collapsed.\nWhen he succeeded, beating out the other candidates, he was able to bring about another economic boom on a level that only he had been previously able to achieve. But the best is yet to come; "JK" is not just kidding when he says that he will turn Brazil into an industrialized powerhouse and a juggernaut on the world stage. So as the election approaches, Kubitschek dreams of bringing glory to his people and to himself, and thinks, "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.""


######## Goulart

 BRA_legacy_of_vargas: "The Legacy of Vargas"
 BRA_legacy_of_vargas_desc: "As João Goulart emerges from the Hundred Days' Crisis as the President of Brazil, he reflects on his journey to this stage. He remembers his duty to the people of Brazil, and how best to serve it. He reminds himself that he is the true heir of Getúlio Vargas and the most powerful promoter of his mentor's policies today. He supported Varguist policies from the start, and will keep supporting them throughout his career. But he also reminds himself that he is his own man, and has his own brain, replete with its own ideas. With all that going through his mind, he walks into the Palácio do Planalto for his first day on the job."
 BRA_deal_with_smear_campaign: "Deal with the Smear Campaign"
 BRA_deal_with_smear_campaign_desc: "The first issue at hand at the start of Goulart's Presidency is a massive smear campaign being directed at him before he has even started to get to work. As expected, it is the conservative faction under Lacerda and Adhemar that is the spearhead of this slander; somewhat more surprising, but not completely unexpected, is that people from the PSD have joined the Crow and the Bull in this nonsense.\n\nAll this is a significant problem; they are weakening support for Goulart from around the country before he can prove himself. Decisive and quick action is required if this is to be stopped."
 BRA_a_caretaker_government: "A Caretaker Government"
 BRA_a_caretaker_government_desc: "These days we have heard a loud, annoying old crow cawing at the top of its lungs, sometimes in the National Congress, sometimes from its nest in Guanabara. Its cacophony seems to consist of repeated false claims that the new President is a catspaw of that lunatic Amazonas and his insane communists. To counter that annoying and malicious noise, President Goulart will publicly proclaim that this new government is simply a caretaker regime until the next election. He will make this even clearer by promising stability and healing, not insane policy adventures. After all, Goulart is a labourist, not a communist; a reformist, not a crazed radical."
 BRA_talk_to_military: "Talk to the Military"
 BRA_talk_to_military_desc: "More concerning than the noise-making of overgrown ravens in Rio is the rumblings of military dissatisfaction in barracks and bases throughout the Republic. There is constant talk of using force to disperse a regime that they think does not suit their interests. Worse yet, they are beginning to act out their dislike for us; during the Hundred Days, in a clear show of force the military occupied an airport for no inherent reason and then left without doing anything. They claimed that this was a planned wargame, but the civilian authorities in the Ministry of Defense had no advance notice of this. If we wish to prevent this kind of show of force from becoming more than mere show, we must nip it in the bud. President Goulart will meet with the military leaders in an effort to calm them down."
 BRA_deal_with_energy_crisis: "Deal with the Energy Crisis"
 BRA_deal_with_energy_crisis_desc: "There is currently an energy crisis ravaging the Republic of Brazil. For many of the less fortunate in our country, energy is too expensive to purchase, forcing them to live under blackout conditions. For many people in remote regions, the power plants simply aren't there. This will not be tolerated. Though President Goulart is ruling as a caretaker president, he cannot just sit around while this crisis rages on. To that end, he will take decisive action to put an end to this crisis and bring good, reliable energy to all the people of the Republic of Brazil. "
 BRA_expand_the_franchise: "Expand the Franchise"
 BRA_expand_the_franchise_desc: "Our Republic is supposedly "democratic", but there is very good reason to doubt this when the illiterate, low-ranking military officers, and other marginalized groups are denied the vote. This cannot be borne; how can we claim to be a "free nation" if we fail even the most basic criterion of universal voting? Accordingly, President Goulart will expand the franchise to give everyone the vote, in order to promote the interests of democracy generally......and the interests of the PTB more narrowly. After all, if someone has enfranchised you, you will want to give back to him, won't you?"
 BRA_gain_american_support: "Gain American Support"
 BRA_gain_american_support_desc: "The Goulart Presidency that has emerged from the aftermath of the Hundred Days Crisis is besieged on multiple fronts. There is a constant risk of concerted political attack from the opposition UDN; this could even suffice to topple his government. Even worse than that is the ever-present threat of a military coup, which has not abated even after Frota's demand for a new President was met within the timeframe. If the new President wants to remain in power, he will need the support of a major foreign power to frighten the UDN and would-be military junta leaders in check; the Americans and their Organization of Free Nations are perfect for this."
 BRA_meet_with_denys: "Meet with Argemiro"
 BRA_meet_with_denys_desc: "If the Goulart Administration is to survive into the next election, it will require backing from enough powerful military figures to counterbalance the pro-coup faction. Our Defence Minister General Argemiro de assis Brasil, is a potential option; he is a close friend of the former President and Goulart's mentor, President Lott, and a man that stands between the Constitutionalists and Sorbonne Faction. Moreover, he cooperated with Marshal Lott to ensure a peaceful transition of power between Kubitschek and his predecessor. Now that Goulart thinks of it, the general may be just the right man Goulart needs to back him until the next elections. Accordingly, Goulart will approach the good General and see what he wants in exchange for his support."
 BRA_visit_washington_dc: "Visit Washington"
 BRA_visit_washington_dc_desc: "If the new President wants to remain in power, he will need the support of a major foreign power to frighten the UDN and keep would-be military junta leaders in check; the Americans and their Organization of Free Nations are just what we need for this. But we cannot expect them to give us their support without something in return; we need to get hold of them as soon as possible and ask them what it would take to help prop up our government. The President must hurry to Washington D.C. as fast as the plane can take him. After all, a coup or political crisis could come tomorrow morning, if not sooner."
 BRA_constituationalist_backers: "Constitutionalist Backers"
 BRA_constituationalist_backers_desc: "The Constitutionalist Faction of the Brazilian Armed Forces is, as you would expect, constitutionalist. What does this mean? They support the constitution, democracy, and government in service to the people. While the autocrats in the rest of the Brazilian military were busy occupying airports and making unsubtle noises of disapproval everywhere they went, the Constitutionalists paid due respect to their elected President, and made their support for the democratic order clear. Let us foster this already-positive relationship in order to secure us a useful ally for the rest of our mandate."
 BRA_leave_them_alone: "Leave Them Alone"
 BRA_leave_them_alone_desc: "It is true that there are many rebellious officers, and that they want nothing more than the destruction of the government. The recent airport occupation is the clearest sign of this terrible fact. But President Goulart knows that his government is unstable, and that a single wrong move could risk everything that he has managed to build. Accordingly, taking the advice of his predecessor, General Lott, he will leave these nuisances alone for the time being until and unless they do anything untoward. After all, if the President doesn't rock the boat, what possible reason could the hardliners have to coup him?"
 BRA_crush_rebelious_officers: "Crush Rebellious Officers"
 BRA_crush_rebelious_officers_desc: "There are many rebellious officers, and they want nothing more than the destruction of the government. The recent political crisis is the clearest sign of this terrible fact. The continuation of this sedition cannot and will not be tolerated. To that end, the President has laid out a plan to remove the would-be autocrats from the officer corps in order to crush the anti-government, antidemocratic sentiments that threaten his government. But he must be careful. If he executes the operation incompetently, this could go wrong; in fact, it might even provoke a coup instead of preventing it."
 BRA_fund_electrical_infrastructure: "Fund Electrical Infrastructure"
 BRA_fund_electrical_infrastructure_desc: "In Brazil, nine out of ten favelas are devoid of major electrical infrastructure. The one favela remaining in that sample does have electricity, but it is unsafely and unreliably connected. The UDN, laboring as always under their free-market delusions about "the invisible hand of the market" and "personal responsibility", would just leave these poor people unconnected to the grid. But President Goulart is not them; he actually cares about the poor. Accordingly, he will take decisive action to invest in electrical infrastructure, so as to connect both the urban and rural poor to the electrical grid; this will certainly help uplift them."
 BRA_form_eletrobras: "Form Eletrobras"
 BRA_form_eletrobras_desc: "Compounding the energy crisis in Brazil is the fact that a substantial fraction of the electrical infrastructure is owned by foreign corporations. The President and the PTB find this unacceptable; exactly why should foreign vultures be allowed to profit off of forcing Brazilian men and women to pay for a basic necessity? Accordingly, the President will have the Brazilian Congress to nationalize the electrical corporations in order to provide electricity at low cost to the people. The UDN may caw and scream in opposition on hearing of this "anti-capitalist" action, but their opinion is neither here nor there. This must be done."
 BRA_meet_kubitshcheks: "Meet Kubitschek"
 BRA_meet_kubitshcheks_desc: "While Juscelino Kubitschek was President he sympathized with the ideals under which our government is being run. While he and Goulart initially competed against each other during the Hundred Days' Crisis, those days are now thankfully over, and good governance has triumphed over militarism and the UDN's folly. It is now time for all parties of goodwill to cooperate for the welfare of Brazil, and the PSD and PTB understand this very clearly. To that end, President Goulart will meet with his predecessor in order to gain his support - and therefore that of the PSD - for the reforms that he has proposed and intends to propose in the foreseeable future."
 BRA_present_bill: "A Vote for the Voters"
 BRA_present_bill_desc: "The bill has been created and we have put everything we want to put in it. The unreserved support of Senhor Kubitschek and the PSD for it has been secured. The PTB is unified behind their President and his proposed policies. Of course, there will be opposition. The largest instance of this is the UDN and the large, overgrown starling perched on its collective head, who will of course start cawing, shaking, and screeching like a murder of crows being shot at by an anti-aircraft gun. They will wail about "damaging the Brazilian economy" and "incitements to fraud", but Goulart does not care. The bill will pass one way or another."
 BRA_counter_lacerda: "Counter Lacerda"
 BRA_counter_lacerda_desc: "This whole time, that cowbird in the Congresso Nacional has been spreading propaganda all over the place against Goulart, the PTB, and the whole government. Since he has nothing better to do with his life, he sits there screeching about the current "quasi-communistic fascist" (Really? Communist AND fascist? What illiteracy.) regime ruling in Brazil. But Lacerda, too busy trying to pull what he thinks is a plank out of our eyes, forgets that he himself has a big old tree straight out of Rondônia sticking out of his own eye. President Goulart will endeavor to remind the Brazilian people of his opponent's flaws."
 BRA_combat_illliteracy: "Combat Illiteracy"
 BRA_combat_illliteracy_desc: "Illiteracy is a major problem in the Republic of Brazil. It holds back everything - it prevents our workforce from understanding instructions, it prevents the less fortunate from uplifting themselves, and it even prevents people from exercising their rights as Brazilian citizens. This cannot be borne; how will we begin to compete on the same level as the various great powers of the world if our people cannot even read and write? President Goulart is resolved, the literacy rate will rise while he is in power. Let a literacy campaign be begun in all the states of Brazil."
 BRA_increase_minimum_wage: "Increase Minimum Wage"
 BRA_increase_minimum_wage_desc: "The initial reforms that have been passed are well and good, but they do not go far enough to improve the welfare of the average Brazilian. Take the minimum wage, for instance. True, it is currently fairly high as these things go. But it is not enough to match the rising inflation that is gouging holes in everyone's pockets these days. Common sense demands that this problem be countered as quickly as possible. To that end, Goulart will arrange to raise the minimum wage by an amount sufficient to improve the average João's quality of life."
 BRA_work_with_psd: "Work with the PSD"
 BRA_work_with_psd_desc: "Now is a time for all parties of goodwill to cooperate for the welfare of Brazil, and the PSD and our PTB understand this very clearly. It is because of this that we were able to secure the support of Senhor Kubitschek and the PSD for our recent reforms. Even without this, however, the PSD and PTB have been allied with one another in the legislature and in Brazilian politics more generally since the era of President Vargas; the conflict of the Hundred Days' Crisis was very much an exception to the norm.\n\nPresident Goulart recognizes this; to this end, he will work to improve ties and mend bridges with the good politicians of the PSD. This will make his re-election campaign much easier as the revived PSD-PTB coalition, rather than fighting within itself, unifies against external threats."
 BRA_attack_udn: "Focus on the UDN"
 BRA_attack_udn_desc: "The conservative lunatics of the UDN, led by a clamoring mynah bird possessed of neither tact nor human decency, have given us no amount of grief for the past half-decade. First they sabotaged the promising presidency of General Lott, then they caused no small amount of grief during the Hundred Days' Crisis, then for good measure they slandered the President and his party every chance they got. Now an election is imminent, and they are our main rival. If we wish to protect the welfare of the Brazilian state, they must be defeated. As such President Goulart and the PTB strategists have earmarked much of our campaign resources to pulling the UDN down a notch or two."
 BRA_attack_psd: "Distance from the PSP"
 BRA_attack_psd_desc: "The PSP, though a smaller party than the UDN, is still potentially a major contender in the coming election. A politician on campaign must always keep an eye out for potential threats, even one as small as the PSP. Accordingly, the President has directed his strategists and operatives to make sure to attack the PSP at the same or similar level of intensity as they do the UDN. The result of this will be to weaken the PSP's credibility relative to ours, which will doubtless help us improve our chances of winning in the upcoming election."
 BRA_jango_gamble: "Jango's Gamble"
 BRA_jango_gamble_desc: "Many people in Brazil have begun to refer to the upcoming election as "Jango's Gamble" as "Jango" Goulart moves to wager it all on continuing his rule as President. President Goulart will take a page from the book of the late lamented Vice-President of the United States and go on national television to take questions from the Brazilian people, in an effort to further boost his support. If this goes well, and his answers please the people, it could assure him victory. But if it goes poorly, it could lead to disaster in the upcoming polls. The atmosphere will doubtless be tense."

######## Adhemar

 BRA_dark_horse_rises: "The Dark Horse Rises"
 BRA_dark_horse_rises_desc: "To the surprise and concern of countless Brazilians (and some particularly educated foreigners), Adhemar de Barros, the Bull of São Paulo, has emerged from the Hundred Days' Crisis as President of the Republic of Brazil. Of the available candidates, he was always the dark horse. This is reflected by the fact that every pundit, journalist, political gambler, expert, and other intellectual was united in saying that the odds of his winning out were near to zero.\nAdhemar, laughing in all their faces, has instead taken power and is now the tenant of the Palácio do Planalto. But as he walks into his new home to take over from his predecessor, he realizes just how weak his grasp on power is. He's going to have his work cut out for him if he wants to stay around."
 BRA_calm_military: "Calm the Military"
 BRA_calm_military_desc: "The Armed Forces of Brazil and their leadership, as one might expect, are annoyed at the current state of Brazilian politics. As is well-known, this annoyance at the antics of incompetent civilians was what set off the Hundred Days' Crisis. They are also fairly annoyed with Adhemar's antics, which to them are "absurd" (heh). But Adhemar doesn't have time to fall victim to a coup d'état - he's too busy getting used to all the perks of being the President of Brazil (and also the duties... sometimes). As such, the generals and assorted military riff-raff need to be fobbed off. Adhemar knows only one method, and it is remarkably effective: the old Suborno Method, also known as bribery."
 BRA_wage_increases: "Token Wage Increases"
 BRA_wage_increases_desc: "Now at the bottom of it all, the good men of the Brazilian Armed Forces really just want to provide for themselves and their families, and leave a good legacy behind for their children. Our honorable President is a decent man in his own right who understands this situation far more than many do and sympathizes with their plight. For this reason, a wage increase for the military must be pushed through for their sake and that of their families... and also to secure their goodwill for when President Adhemar needs them in turn."
 BRA_extra_military_founding: "Extra Military Funding"
 BRA_extra_military_founding_desc: "Sure, we have raised the wages of military officials, but that does not go far enough. We must also try to show the military itself some love so that they will leave us alone for longer. To that end, let us set aside more funding for the armed forces so they can afford to work on their pet projects such as their strange and wonderful guns, their fancy new boats, and fast and novel aircraft designs. God willing, this will work out like a crying child that calms down when given a toy: keeping them distracted, preventing them from trying to throw the President's fledgling government down."
 BRA_adhemar_dine_generals: "Dine with the Generals"
 BRA_adhemar_dine_generals_desc: "Having thrown money at both the military and its officers in order to shut them up, it seems that they have taken the hint and calmed down. This is not enough, to Adhemar's view; he now believes that he has to build personal connections with prominent members of the military. Accordingly, Adhemar will call on some of the more prominent and malleable generals and officers of the Brazilian Armed Forces, such as Amaury Kruel and Ernesto Geisel, and try to build close personal relationships with them. Hopefully such connections will help make them loyal, if not to the constitutional order, then at least to Adhemar de Barros personally."
 BRA_military_parade: "Military Parades"
 BRA_military_parade_desc: "Everyone and his mother-in-law knows that the military is one of the few things that is respected in this tormented Republic of ours. As such, honoring them and helping make sure they get the respect they deserve is equivalent to strengthening the Brazilian state's integrity. A start in this direction is military outreach, and what better method of that is there than ten or twenty good old-fashioned military parades? Sending the military out to show off in front of the Brazilian people will gain the respect and support of not just the common folk, but the military as well."
 BRA_meet_oligarchs: "Meet with the Oligarchs"
 BRA_meet_oligarchs_desc: "Adhemar is no typical oligarch. Before his presidency he tended to give that type of person a wide berth, since he disliked them for various reasons. For now, however, Adhemar has decided to set his dislike of the oligarchs and other assorted moneyed elites aside, because likes and dislikes are not important before the most important thing in Adhemar's life: his reelection. He knows how important these people will be to his victory in the upcoming election; for that reason, he will sit down and talk with the cattle barons, coffee kings, bankers, and other assorted wealthy types, gain their support and funding, and put them to use for his own needs."
 BRA_chat_cattle_barons: "Chat with the Cattle Barons"
 BRA_chat_cattle_barons_desc: "The cattle barons - owners and proprietors of vast ranches throughout the rural interior of our Republic, have significant sway in the regions where their cattle roam. Getting hold of them and convincing them to back the new President will be critical to the success of his reelection plan. Moreover, their backing could be the difference between glorious victory and humiliating defeat for the various PSP candidates in those regions, for both the State and Federal Legislatures. To that end, Adhemar de Barros will call on the cattle barons and see what they want or need in exchange for their support for the PSP."
 BRA_meet_french_elite: "Meet with the French Elite"
 BRA_meet_french_elite_desc: "The "French Elites'' are ethnically French Brazilians of middle- and upper-class extraction. Most of them fled from the French mainland to Brazil when the German devil-worshippers, invading the Last French Republic during Fall Gelb and Fall Rot, reduced the once-proud French nation to a shadow of its ancient glory, turning it into first a pathetic puppet and then into that thrice-damned antichrist Himmler's personal torture chamber. By God and His Mother, it is a terrible fate for a nation that was once the originator of so many great things. At least we have managed to provide a comparatively decent new home for these poor people... but now we need something from them - their political support.\nOur current president is in a unique position to get this something from them; a fluent French speaker, he can get hold of them and get their support for his venture; backing from a group as powerful and wealthy as this will be of great use."
 BRA_invite_galloue: "Invite de Gaulle"
 BRA_invite_galloue_desc: "The French elites are not the only Francophones who we can approach. There is also the pitiful Republican remnant on the West African coast, led by General Charles de Gaulle. Though they are an outdated relic of a past long dead, they are doubtless still useful to those they are convinced to assist.\nFor instance, even a token meeting and photo-op with the General will be more than sufficient to gain the support of the influential French expatriates. Let us do that and help increase Adhemar's chances of holding on to power.\nWhat? The Vichy French will be irritated by this? Who cares? What will that Poujeb or whatever in God's name they call him do about it? Come back to me when there's an actual threat!"
 BRA_increase_envelope_system: "Increase the Envelope System"
 BRA_increase_envelope_system_desc: ""The 'Envelope System' is simply a sophisticated euphemism for bribery. This system, like any other system, is versatile and can be used for various purposes, be those gaining power, wealth, influence, or reputation.\nIn today's lecture President Adhemar de Barros of Brazil, an internationally recognized practitioner of the Envelope System, will demonstrate the correct use of the Envelope System in gaining power. He will demonstrate its effect on the mind by testing it on people in São Paulo, and show the benefits it offers by requesting people's votes in exchange for the envelope.""
 BRA_money_from_rich: "Migration to the City of Rain"
 BRA_money_from_rich_desc: "São Paulo - the City of Rain - is Adhemar's hometown and his main base of support. Increasing migration to it (and further developing it so it can welcome the people that are sent its way) will increase its development and contribution to the Brazilian economy. For Adhemar it is a simple "positive feedback loop", as it is called - more migration to the City of Rain equals more development equals more PSP voters equals more time in the Presidency for him. And more time under the wise rule of Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz is a good thing... right?"
 BRA_populist_policies: "Populist Policies"
 BRA_populist_policies_desc: "Populist policies will be of great help to Adhemar in his plan to gain further support from the Brazilian people so that he can be re-elected to a full term. After all, populism is a vote-winner on a scale that other methods can only dream to achieve. Sure, this won't be all that great for the economy. But as Keynes, paraphrasing a long line of thinkers going all the way back to the Holy Writ, once said: "in the end, we will all die". Keynes concluded that the damage caused by populist spending (if there even was any) mattered little in comparison to the rest of time; Adhemar, a cultured and literate man, agrees completely with this conclusion. "
 BRA_decrease_taxes: "Decrease Some Taxes"
 BRA_decrease_taxes_desc: "One plank of Adhemar's populist platform is cutting down on various taxes. If taxes are cut, that means that people will have to spend less. If people are made to spend less due to such a tax cut, they will remember and bless the man who brought it about. And if people remember and bless a politician for the good that he has done for them, they will vote for him. As such, it is really a no-brainer to cut taxes at least until the next election. Concerns about funding are rubbish; the economy will cope, as it has done from the time of His Late Majesty the Emperor."
 BRA_raise_welfare: "Raise Some Welfare"
 BRA_raise_welfare_desc: "Raising welfare is another plank of Adhemar's populist reelection plan. Increasing welfare spending will put more money in the pockets of the poor. This, combined with the cut taxes, will unquestionably allow them to bring more wealth to their families. From there, it is much the same as with the tax cuts. The poor are already a major part of Adhemar and the PSP's voting base; this measure will make them even more loyal to and enthusiastic for their esteemed President, allowing him to ride their votes to another term in the Palácio do Planalto."
 BRA_sway_media: "Sway the Media"
 BRA_sway_media_desc: "For all that Adhemar has striven to bring about peace, order, and good government to the Republic of Brazil in the aftermath of the Hundred Days' Crisis, there are still countless members of the Fourth Estate of the Nation - the journalistic class - that oppose the Adhemar presidency. This cannot be borne; if every single newspaper, radio show, and television program is denouncing the President in one way or another, what relevance will his policies carry, and what hope does he have of winning a vote? At that point Adhemar could throw himself in front of a train to save a child and people wouldn't know it.\nFortunately for his chances of reelection, Adhemar knows how to talk with these people. By sitting down with some of them, he can reason with them and get them to support him. And, as has been demonstrated, if - God forbid - basic reasoning goes flop (it often does with these types) the Envelope System is a useful fail-safe."
 BRA_tour_country: "Tour the Country"
 BRA_tour_country_desc: "Our President is not a bland, uninspiring man that has to rely on surrogates and ghost-writers to get his point across. Quite the contrary: Adhemar de Barros is a flamboyant individual possessed of a loud speaking voice, an impressive look on television, and a playful, attention-grabbing style of oration. His confident exterior, which is the perfect combination of intelligence and brashness will be perfect for him as he strives to make more Brazilians see him - and not some fool from a different party - as the right leader for the times that the Republic finds itself in."
 BRA_aid_poor: "Aid the Poor"
 BRA_aid_poor_desc: "Aiding the poor is one more major part of Adhemar's reelection plan. As we have established, increasing welfare spending and cutting taxes are one major way in which the poorer people of our Republic, already fairly favorable to the current President, will be convinced to re-elect him. But there are other ways in which the Government of Brazil can put itself at the service of the poor, and Adhemar will direct it to do so as quickly as possible before the votes start being cast.\nThough he will claim to anyone who questions him that he is doing this out of a Christian concern for the welfare of the people, it is obvious to most people why he is really doing this. But what does that matter to Adhemar, if he wins the Presidency and is free to play at being Rouba-mas-Faz for another five years?"
 BRA_urban_slums: "The Urban Slums"
 BRA_urban_slums_desc: "The urban slums - favelas and other such hotbeds of poverty, despair, and misery - are usually shunned by the educated upper classes, in particular by politicians. Adhemar is not a normal politician. Nor does he hold the poor in their huts and hovels as being beneath him or unworthy of his notice.\nAccordingly, as he has done before, he will enter these slums (accompanied by some bodyguards, obviously; can one be too cautious?) and talk to the people. He will promise them the moon, show his successes, and gain their support and votes. The hesitant can of course be inducted into the Envelope System, of which Senhor Adhemar is a veteran practitioner and promoter."
 BRA_rural_towns: "The Rural Towns"
 BRA_rural_towns_desc: "Rural towns and their associated localities are filled to the brim with the exact sort of person that would be swayed by Adhemar's personality and his manner of speaking. In a previous gubernatorial election in São Paulo, the madman Quadros was defeated by Adhemar because while Quadros paid these areas no mind, Adhemar willingly went and sought support there. It has worked once; as such, Adhemar has very good reason to hope that it will happen once again. So he will go back to these towns for a second time, using the same method as in the favelas: promise the moon, show some successes, gain support and votes, deploy the Envelope System as necessary."
 BRA_decrease_interest_rates: "Decrease Interest Rates"
 BRA_decrease_interest_rates_desc: "Decreasing interest rates is the last major part of Adhemar's reelection plan. If we cut the interest rate, this will allow the Brazilian people to borrow more for less interest, thus effectively putting more money in their pockets. Granted, it may result in a further rise in inflation, building off the inflation set off by Juscelino Kubitschek's building mania that culminated in the construction of the new capital, but that does not matter to Adhemar. What matters right now is the short term, and all short-term indications are that this is for the best."
 BRA_victory_approches: "Victory Approches"
 BRA_victory_approches_desc: "Adhemar de Barros has done everything he can. He has gained the support of the military and assorted elites, wooing the generals and convincing the French expatriates. He has played the economy like the organ of the Catedral da Sé in São Paulo in order to gain public support and fire up his voting base. With all this done, who in their right mind can doubt that Adhemar and his vice-presidential candidate will win the Presidency? True, Henrique Lott's daughter is proving to be remarkably popular as the vice-presidential candidate for the PSD-PTB coalition, but surely she - being after all a mere woman - cannot defeat a good, competent man chosen by Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz, who has stabilized the Brazilian nation after the disaster Edna Lott's father caused.\nRight?"

 ## Quadros
 BRA_now_onto_the_hard_part: "Now Onto the Hard Part"
 BRA_now_onto_the_hard_part_desc: "A great disaster befell the Brazilian common man when the conservatives of the UDN failed to win the 1960 elections. Quadros campaigned hard for a return to fiscal sanity, for an end of the corrupt Kubitschek era where the rich and corrupt feasted as the common laborer toiled, burdened by ever increasing debt and inflation. Many thought that Sr Quadros would languish in the vice-presidency, forced to stand aside as graft and malfeasance bled the nation from a thousand wounds.\n\nNo more! Lott's own misdeeds have brought him low, and we now hold onto the presidency. Our enemies, the enemies of all Brazilians, are currently shocked at our ascension. They will rapidly recover, and their stupor will turn to anger. We must stabilize our position, so that the presidency can be turned once more into a lighthouse, a great beacon of order and progress for our great nation! Leeches and parasites shall tremble!"
 BRA_establishing_the_cabinet: "Establishing the Cabinet"
 BRA_establishing_the_cabinet_desc: "No man can rule alone. President Quadros has thus turned his attention to the Cabinet. Our current ministers are all leftover from the Lott era. True to their patron saint, these mens are all either corrupt, lazy or crypto-communists. Perhaps all three, for deficiencies in moral characters often compound, dragging men further and further into the abyss.\n\nOur president is a good man. For the nation's sake, these relics of the past have to go. In their place, hard working and earnest politicians will be brought forward. The coming days will be difficult for Quadros' presidency. As our enemies are numerous, we must not risk any threat from within."
 BRA_calm_the_military: "Calm the Military"
 BRA_calm_the_military_desc: "Due to his military background, president Lott might have fancied himself a new Caesar. Now, his comrades within the army accuse us of having betrayed him in our very own ides of march. The army's men, both constitutionalist and otherwise, are displeased to see a civilian be president.\n\nThis restored Brazilian democracy is young. The fifth constitution has been damaged by Lott's misdeeds. It is crucial that we convince the army not to end democracy, not to seize power once more.  We must genuflect, kow-tow and beg for patience and understanding. Perhaps the greedy commanders will ask for a little extra money, for their understanding. President Quadros understands that no price is too high, no humiliation too ignominious, for us to risk the golden path to a better Brazil!"
 BRA_apologies_and_compromises: "Apologies and Compromises"
 BRA_apologies_and_compromises_desc: "Army officers have so far scoffed at our attempts to open negotiation. In the barracks, president Quadros is mocked as an eccentric paperpusher, a man far too arrogant in his own abilities. The thought of giving legitimacy to a self-important politico is too much for the proud soldiers of our armed forces.\n\nThough it pains president Quadros to give some ground to those who would threaten democracy, it is the only way forward. The president will apologize to the army for Lott's downfall. During this show of contrition, he will present himself as an humble servant of the people, who knew not the best course of action when dealing with such unprecedented corruption.\n\nA show of penitence and repentance, as well as a dialling down of our criticism of Lott himself, will go a long way toward the military giving us a chance."
 BRA_pay_rise_for_the_officer: "Pay Raises for the Officers"
 BRA_pay_rise_for_the_officer_desc: "Time is of the essence to secure our control of the presidency. The men of the armed force cannot only be won over through words. Actions will be required.\n\nPrevious presidents were loath to extend their graft and nepotism to the army. A laudable precaution, perhaps born from their avarice and fear of a resurgent military. Nevertheless, the proud men in uniforms could use a slight pay rise. Especially those in the officer's corps who have shown themselves to be of a ... magnanimous disposition toward the president.\n\nOur hearts weep at the tought of extending the despicable network of corruption to new areas. Yet we must be forced by these extraordinary circumstances to take up damned arms. The nation's redemption is at stake!"
 BRA_dealing_with_vipers: "Dealing with Vipers"
 BRA_dealing_with_vipers_desc: " Carlos Lacerda, and Adhemar de Barros. Among the brave few who followed our president in his opposition to Lott. Men of admirable convictions, perhaps. But in the halls of power, bravery and convictions are mere illusions, flamboyant garments meant to hide daggers.\n\nIt has not escaped president Quadros' attention that Adhemar and Lacerda's support for Lott's removal has had very little to do with the good of the nation, and very much to do with both men's ambitions. Lacerda is desperate to get out from his role as junior coalition partner to our party. Meanwhile, the perfidious Adhemar seeks to extend his empire of corruption to ever greater heights. As soon as either of them smell the slightest weakness, their allegiances will no doubt shift again.\n\nWe must take the fight to these two vipers before it is too late!"
 BRA_lacerdas_hypocrisy: "Lacerda's Hypocrisy"
 BRA_lacerdas_hypocrisy_desc: " Lacerda has long claimed to be a conservative, and an ally of all Brazilians. His convictions allegedly led him to support a shabby coup attempt in the fifties. HIs political prestige hurt by his failure, Lacerda saw the UDN bleeding support to our own PTN. Lacerda bent the knee and entered into a coalition with us as a junior partner. Having forced himself into a loveless marriage, Lacerda still thinks he can be master of his own destiny. During Lott's downfall, Lacerda and his cronies tried to implicate then vice-president Quadros. This betrayal at the most dangerous of times has not been forgotten. Nor has it been forgiven.\n\nWe will outmaneuver this treasonous rat and turn all of his followers away from him. Lacerda, in trying to salvage his future, has damned himself to disgrace and obscurity."
 BRA_expose_the_crows_lie: "Expose the Crow's Lies"
 BRA_expose_the_crows_lie_desc: "Lacerda is a devious creature, lying as thoughtlessly as others breathe. We have kept tabs on the man's countless fabulations with grim fascination. Lacerda rests now at the center of  a web of contradictory lies told to many, many members of the political class. All that is needed is a little push to ensnare this cawing crow in his own hypocrisy.\n\nLacerda, a former journalist, knows the power of the press. We will remind him of the media's power by arranging for the publication of Lacerda's lies all over the country. When the entire nation knows of our rival's two faced nature, they will no doubt recoil in disgust and abandon him en masse."
 BRA_adhemars_corruption: "Adhemar's Corruption"
 BRA_adhemars_corruption_desc: "Of the myriad beasts preying on good citizens through the nation's highest offices, Adhemar is one of the most well known to our president. An schemer of ill repute, a colossally corrupt scoundrel and an arrogant man, Adhemar certainly remembers his early conflicts with President Quadros over the governorship of São Paulo. This man can not be trusted.\n\nAdhemar's supporters claim that for all the corruption surrounding the man, Adhemar at least get things done. The plan to get rid of him is simply to let the whole nation known of his corruption. After all, once this charlatan's reputation has been dragged through the mud, there will be very few opportunities for him to steal, and fewer still to try to sell us out for his personal benefit. The nation deserves, nay, needs to know the danger of letting Adhemar continue his schemes."
 BRA_raid_his_office: "Raid His Office"
 BRA_raid_his_office_desc: "Adhemar's natural habitat is muck, and he is thus a slippery critter, able to evade justice again and again. His corruption schemes are often nestled one within the other, with a dizzying array of front businesses, cat's paws and secret bank accounts. If we're to win, we must strike everywhere all at once.\n\nBy raiding his office, seizing documents and ransacking any safe we find, we will ensure that at least some evidence will end up in our custody. Cautious advisors within president Quadros' circles warn that Adhemar is not likely to be taken out of action so easily. Their prudence, while laudable, do little to affect our president's ardent desire for justice. The scoundrel Adhemar will have his day in the courts!"
 BRA_the_diplomatic_shuffle: "The Diplomatic Shuffle"
 BRA_the_diplomatic_shuffle_desc: "All nations live in the shadow of the second world war, where the old great powers of France and England were shattered. America, once seemingly destined to global hegemony, saw its position challenged in the Atlantic by Germany and in the Pacific by the Japanese. And yet the North American republic continues to steer the continent's nations as though nothing has changed.\n\nBrazil has no quarrel with America. Nor with Germany. Nor with the Japanese. All three great powers seek to determine the world's destiny through their schemes. Yet none of the great powers' means are unlimited. President Quadros knows that Brazil would be better served be through an independent foreign policy than by fiendish loyalty to America. The Americans will for once have to do some courtship of our nation, forced to outbid the Japanese and German efforts. Through this neutral policy Brazil's strength and prestige will only increase."
 BRA_withdraw_from_south_africa: "Withdraw from South Africa"
 BRA_withdraw_from_south_africa_desc: "President Quadros has long been a critic of interventionism. Of particular concern to him is the American giant to the north, willing to trample over other nations whenever the fancy strikes them. This bad habit has compounded itself by the American habit of dragging friends and associates into their crimes whenever they think that they can get away with it.\n\nBrazilian blood has been shed on South African soil, and for what? A proxy boxing match between America and Germany? To take sides in a civil war that does not concern us? Ships and ships of Brazil's youth and treasures have been sent east, to no return. No more. President Quadros will stand up to the political establishment and convince lawmakers to abandon this quixotic war. Surely, hidden within the legislature's stony heart, there remains some remnant of decency and patriotism?"
 BRA_connection_with_the_corps: "Connection with the German Corporations"
 BRA_connection_with_the_corps_desc: " Away from Germania's court politics, the so-called Wehrwirtschaftsfuhrer continue to drain Europe in their quest for profits. These titanical conglomerates run the entire German economy, from slave plantations to chemical industries to banking and financial services. Tapping into the german kleptocratic economy requires going through these cartels.\n\nWe will cultivate better relationships with these corporations, and entice them to invest their money into Brazil. Already, these avaricious robber barons drool at the possibilities offered by Brazil. We need only name our price to tap into the ill-gotten German wealth."
 BRA_the_japanese_ambassador: "Meet the Japanese Ambaassador"
 BRA_the_japanese_ambassador_desc: "In the far east rises the Japanese sun. A unique nation, Japan is the first superpower to emerge outside of Europe in quite some time. It will definitely not be the last.\n\nCompared to the hypocritical American democrats and the belligerent imperial pretensions of the Reich, the Japanese seem content to manage their recent acquisitions and tend to internal matters. Nevertheless, Tokyo's envoys continue to monitor the situation in latin America motivated by the Japanese hunger for new export markets. This situation can be used to our advantage.\n\nPresident Quadros shall invite the Japanese ambassador to a banquet. There, talks will begin in earnest about improving bilateral relationships. Brazil's dreams will unite with Japanese ambitions, so that a better future is reached for all."
 BRA_reassure_the_americans: "Reassure the Americans"
 BRA_reassure_the_americans_desc: "Latin America observers in Washington D.C. are dismayed at Brazil's new independent foreign policy. Now the tone changes to anger as the Republic exits South Africa and seeks closer ties to Japan. Americans see our nation as part of their backyard. Now they accuse President Quadros of digging holes under the fence so foxes and wolves can get in.\n\nThe northerners need not fear anything. Our independent foreign policy is not about ending our friendship to America. Rather it is about being more self-confident in our dealing with other nations, about giving the Brazilian people the ability to seek friends throughout the globe.\n\nSurely, the Americans will understand that we mean no harm. We have opened several talks through official as well as through back channels. We will be conciliatory yet firm in our dealings with the Americans."
 BRA_the_german_connection: "The German Connection"
 BRA_the_german_connection_desc: "A shadow has fallen over Europe. From what was once called Berlin, the Germans rule over an empire of ill-gotten gain. They maintain their sacrilegious grip of Europe through blood and slavery. As Eastern Europe burns, the Portuguese provinces of Angola and Mozambique continue to be occupied by corrupt and oppressive Reichskommissariat.\n\nThe German hands are tainted by blood. Nevertheless, in these troubled times Brazil cannot afford to be squeamish. The kleptocrats running the nazi empire are desperate for any friendship beyond the enslaved nations of the Einheitspakt. By offering them a foothold in the Americas, we can acquire a great deal of the German's stolen wealth.\n\nThe independent foreign policy requires us to deal with the Devil."
 BRA_end_restrictions_on_immigration: "End Restrictions on Japanese Immigration"
 BRA_end_restrictions_on_immigration_desc: "Brazil, a land of immigrants, has seen unjust barriers erected to potential new citizens. Among those, a law putting a cap on the arrival of new Japanese families was introduced in the forties. Initially lured to replace the freed slave as disposable labor in coffee plantations, the soaring Brazilian-Japanese population rapidly alarmed the political elite. This racial bigotry towards non-whites, as well as distrust of Japanese as a potential fifth column for the axis, have contributed to the current sorry state of our immigration laws.\n\nThese laws must end. The Japanese population has been hard working, and unfairly attacked by their community. What's more, removing immigration restrictions will be well received in Tokyo. President Quadros will mend this historical injustice and end the immigration restrictions. Befitting our status as a tropical nation, this infusion of vigorous blood and talents will help the national renewal our party seeks to bring about. Even better, as children of the Confucian tradition, our new citizens will have a healthy respect of authority, and of their duties to the state."

We will develop these relations further. By enmeshing our economy deeper with the American one, we will ironically gain more independence. American foreign policy experts will see that our government has in fact expanded American influence within Brazil. Being given a bigger slice of the pie, will the northerner still begrudge us for trying to expand the pie through the independent foreign policy?\n\nSome whisper that giving Americans more leverage in Brazil is a dangerous game to follow.

Now it is time for our President to return to Asia, not as a mere politician, but as the new leader of the Brazilian Republic. It is time to take Tokyo by storm!\n\nCritics implore President Quadros to stay in Brazil, and work on internal problems rather than put on a pageantry and make a fool of himself abroad.

From helping to train agents, to collaborating on new surveillance techniques, to information sharing; without the CIA our modern spy agencies would struggle to keep the lights on.\n\nThis reliance on the CIA is a threat to our desire to follow an independent foreign policy. However, the American presence could also be an opportunity. We will continue previous arrangements made with Langley, even as we look to other great powers for help. The Americans will feel safer knowing that any attempt by the Japanese or Germans to meddle into Brazilian affairs can be monitored.

Inviting the man to a dinner will no doubt cause an uproar within the capital. So be it; our cold treatment of Germany has not done anything to hinder their criminal empire.

We do not advocate revolution, the delusional chase of phantasmagorical demi-marxist truism advocated by Goulart or his ilk. Nor do we seek to maintain a stagnant, corrupt status quos of the PSD era.

Today, we march again.\n\nCowards within the senate accuse of seeking the end of Brazilian democracy. These slanderous accusations merely seek to distract from the catastrophes the politicians have brought down onto the republic. The average soldier is not an enemy of the constitution, but its most ardent defender. In recent times, elected officials have preferred chasing bribes and graft to fighting fascists and communists. It would be criminal negligence for us to let the situation fester any longer.\n\nThe senate is to be closed. If democracy is to live in Brazil, we must act decisively to save the nation.

Present within a wide array of political factions and institutions, these men and women will begin plotting against us as soon as they recover. Continuing our lightning offensive is thus critical to the success of our intervention.\n\nThe number one priority target is Henrique Lott. This despicable former general has long used his influence within the army to argue caution and patience with regard to the Kubitschek government. We once believed his lies. Now we know he merely schemed his ascent to the presidency. Lott is a perfidious traitor, and he must not be allowed a chance to rally our opposition."

 BRA_win_over_media_desc: "Political power has long rested on the consent of the governed, and in this age of mass media the masses' approval is paramount. After all, it takes only an instant for the nation's passions to be turned astray.\n\nThe media will thus be powerful allies of our intervention... or extremely dangerous enemies. It is crucial that we convince newspaper companies and radio and tv stations to spread our message of renewal and hope. Each citizen convinced by words and deeds of the justness of our emergency government will prove invaluable in the struggle to come.\n\nMedia moguls and independent journalists alike will be convinced to work with us. Those who will not be convinced will at least be persuaded to avoid discussing politics for quite some time."

In attempting to derail our economy, union leaders hope to bring our intervention to an end.\n\nGood, honest Brazilian workers have taken to the streets. On whose behalf? Parasitic union leaders. Almost all of them in cahoot with communist filth. Poor innocent men and women are sent to wave their banners, as clashes with the police bloody the streets of our nation. The strikes must end, if we're to be given the opportunity to hunt down the shadows behind these illegitimate protests."

Peaceful protests are already turning into riots as clashes with police and army escalate; noticiably, in Rio, bandits have made use of Zhdanov cocktails to torch an army checkpoint, the fleeing soldiers being hit by bricks, rubbage or projectiles.\n\nThe daring and energy of youth is the future of our nation, but the moral discrepancies and the taint of leftist thought has polluted it beyond reasonable conversation. No doubt agitated by communist propaganda and cynical opponents within the disgraced political class, our own children are marching to stop us from saving their future, however, all they are at this moment is terrorists, threatening the country's integrity.\n\nBrazil doesn't deal with terrorists. Time to clean the well."

 BRA_totally_not_a_coup_desc: "Unsurprisingly, a degree of fear has begun spreading throughout the nation, as streets become barren, families huddle in their homes, afraid of encountering soldiers in the streets.\n\nA shepherd's flock need not fear its sheepdogs, nor should good and honest citizens fear men in uniforms in these difficult times. It is time for General Humberto Castelo Branco, one of the many shepherds of the republic, to appear on tv to reassure the population and gently correct them of a few misgivings: The Army haven't launched a coup, and that military men have acted out of naught but self interest and are intent on ending democracy.\n\nThe general's words may not convince all, but his appearance will no doubt help dispel the accusations that the army is out of touch with the civilian population."
 BRA_storm_them_instead: "Storm Opposition Media Stations"
 BRA_storm_them_instead_desc: "As expected, there are those who will not be silenced. Throughout the country many radio stations have proven uncooperative, especially among left-wing media companies, no doubt agitated by the misguided cause of freedom of speech. Many more are likely to be motivated by sympathy for communism to spread bile and discord throughout the nation.\n\nWe've no time to separate the wheat from the chaff: All radio stations refractory to good moral will be stormed by our men and taken off the air.\n\nAny second lost is another seed of hatred planted in an innocent's heart."
 BRA_hunt_down_communist: "Hunt Down Communists"
 BRA_hunt_down_communist_desc: "As our youth and our working age brothers and sisters launch their misguided battles in the streets, the sinister force fraying the very fabric of society still lurks in the shadows. The communist snake whispers seductively of a better world, even as their poison sinks deeper and deeper within our country. Order turns to chaos as citizens are turned against one another. Progress turns to stagnation, as cynics and nihilists see a breakdown of the system favorably. What better way, after all, to convince the workers of capitalism's dysfunction than to engineer its demise?\n\nSuccessive governments have alternatively ignored or cajoled the communists. Our intervention will end once the last of these anarchists have been thrown in jail. The lucky ones, at least."

Rio, São Paulo and Brasília are now all orderly.\n\nHowever in the vast countryside between the cities, sharks and pirates still roam. It is time for the next part of our intervention. By moving into the countryside, we can pre-empt any attempt by the communists' peasant leagues to stir up trouble in peaceful and productive farmlands. The advance in the countryside will be equally useful in chasing any threat that has fled the big cities into the interior.\n\nMen, set sail! Fear not stormy waters, for fortune favors the bold!"
 BRA_censorship_laws: "Enact Media Censorship Laws"
 BRA_censorship_laws_desc: "Half of the battle for sanitization of the media comes from controlling the sources of it. The other half is to put in place the proper filters. News organizations need our guidance for time being, as our emergency government sets the nation right. Access to the undistilled truth requires solid institutions. Brazil has unfortunately seen the pillars of its constitutions hollowed out in the past decade.\n\nPassing censorship laws will be an important step in controlling the tone and content of the information that reaches citizens. Just as our intervention is set to eradicate evil from Brazilian politics, our partners in the media shall ease the fear of the public through a diet of truths judged appropriate for mass dispersal."
 BRA_win_over_companies: "Win Over Companies"

The business community has mostly vacillated between silent fear of chaos and hope that the situation will now improve.\n\nWe will prove to businessmen that Brazil remains open for business. Our campaign to eradicate communism will do much good to assuage their fears. Already several unions have begun unofficial talks with industrial partners and with our government to build a joint front against the socialist menace. Once anarchist trouble-makers are rid of, our nation's greatest industrialists will no doubt provide financial and political backing to our intervention."
 BRA_talk_with_cia: "Talk With the CIA"
 BRA_talk_with_cia_desc: "Uncle Sam has long considered South America its backyard. Our restoration of order has roused the interest of the watchdogs in Langley. The Americans are never happy to be left out of the loop. However, our contacts have proven surprisingly patient with us so far. The standing order from back home seems to be for CIA agents to monitor the situation and seek an understanding with the new government.\n\nIt's imperative that we make use of the opportunity to explain ourselves. By showing enough deference to America and reassuring our contacts of our friendly intention, we can enlist the CIA's help in securing Brazil from communist, fascist or foreign interlopers."

 BRA_the_storm_subsides_desc: "The past few months have seen the army triumph against all forces arrayed against it: Mass media profiting from the situation, brash student activists, deceitful union bosses, corrupt politicians dismayed at their loss of control...all stood against us. Thankfully, their failure to unite against us has allowed our men to crush them for the good of the nation. For Brazil.\n\nNow that the storm has subsided, men within and without the army await for the next development. Cowed citizens in the streets await for the other shoe to drop. Electrified soldiers in the barracks look to us for their next orders.\n\nIt is time for us to determine if the time has come to call for new elections. "

 BRA_schedule_new_elections_desc: " There are those who scoffed at our claims of restoring democracy to Brazil after the end of our intervention. Let them laugh no more, for our time at the head of the country has come to an end. The Sorbonne faction has reminded the officer corp of their oath to the constitution, and to respecting the popular mandate.\n\nNew elections are to occur then. Blessedly, they occur in a country cleansed from communism and fascism. Few political organizations have emerged unscathed from our war on corruption and treason. Carlos Lacerda's UDN party has thankfully been among the survivors. The men of the armed force have long found Lacerda's struggle against the decadent Brazilian political class admirable, and hope to see him do well at the ballot box."

Seeing the people be so easily turned against our armed forces by corrupt political organizations and perfidious communist has done much to reinforce the hardliner faction.\n\nThe troubles began when we entrusted the nation to a new generation of politicians. This generation has failed the test. There shall be no reprieve, no new opportunity for kleptocrats and socialist sympathisers to return to power.\n\nThe army shall lead Brazil to its bright future.

While there is much work to be done, Castelo Branco's provisional administration is ready to tackle the problems created by the previous government.\n\nThe Armed Forces will now decide the country's future, for better or for worse."
 BRA_meet_with_delfim_netto: "Meet With Delfim Netto"
 BRA_meet_with_delfim_netto_desc: "Only a miracle could save Brazil's financial situation now. Inflation has risen dramatically, savings are rapidly lost, and investors are unsure of the new government. Thankfully, President Castelo Branco now has the advice of Delfim Netto, a renowned economist who was previously Secretary of Planning for São Paulo, and now stands as the Economy Minister of Brazil. The administration must focus on a new economic plan, targeting our inflation rates and ensure that a Brazilian Miracle will indeed happen."
 BRA_attract_investment: "Attract Investment"
 BRA_attract_investment_desc: "The sudden political changes that happened in our nation have shaken the trust of foreign investors, and this is something we need to rectify with our new economic directives. To forge the path to the Brazilian Miracle, we will reduce business taxes in hopes of calming the investors. While our income will be reduced, we can only profit with new investments, especially if our economic policy is coordinated with the Foreign Ministry, leading to an expansion of American-owned industries in Brazil."
 BRA_ban_strikes: "Ban Strikes"
 BRA_ban_strikes_desc: "In one thing we must admit that Getúlio Vargas was right: workers should not be allowed the right to strike. The simple notion that walk-outs are possible damages our country's business, and we must correct this mistake. We are also dealing with the political ramifications of these mass movements, as workers around the country react to our unpopular economic policies. While the right to strike was enshrined in the 1949 Constitution, President Castelo Branco must revoke it by decree, to ease the suffering of employers in our nation."
 BRA_freeze_wages: "Freeze Wages"
 BRA_freeze_wages_desc: "Much of our troubles with inflation can be attributed to the previous administrations' careless wage increases. As such, our minister Delfim Netto has proposed a plan to freeze wages in the public and private sectors, arguing for the need for fiscal responsibility and to maintain control of our government's debt. This policy will surely be unpopular, but we must go down this path of moderation and restraint."
 BRA_build_up_infrastructure: "Build Up Infrastructure"
 BRA_build_up_infrastructure_desc: "Delfim Netto's new economic plan calls for increased investment in infrastructure projects. While this may seem contradictory to our general policy to reduce spending, it is necessary to improve our country's gathering of resources and distribution network to unleash our nation's full economic potential. Some critics argue that this policy is reminiscent of Juscelino Kubitscheck's administration, but we must do everything in our power to spur rapid economic growth."
 BRA_dealing_with_dissent: "Dealing With Dissent"
 BRA_dealing_with_dissent_desc: "Throughout the country, resistance against our legitimate government persists. Some of these dissidents have ties to radical leftist and communist organizations, while others seek to restore the "democratic" regime we have rightfully toppled. Our new order must not accept these terrorists' demands as we have vowed to restore Brazil to glory. We shall use the newly-established SNI and its espionage and information-gathering tactics to better deal with these dissidents and improve our stability."
 BRA_ban_the_far_left: "Infiltrate the Far Left"
 BRA_ban_the_far_left_desc: "In the years after Vargas' ousting from power, the communists have slowly infiltrated themselves in our country. While Eduardo Gomes did the right thing and successfully banned the PCB in 1953, the leftists still dominate many labor unions in Brazil, most notably the CGT. Golbery has proposed that we use the SNI's intelligence apparatus to infiltrate these unions and the Nazi-Communist parties that control them. Espionage tactics will also be used against students' movements, as they are known to be a den of dirty leftists and dissidents."
 BRA_extinguish_the_student_union: "Extinguish the Student Union"
 BRA_extinguish_the_student_union_desc: "The National Students' Union (UNE) stands as one of the greatest adversaries of our revolution. An organization dominated by left-wing parties, its leaders have become the faces of the opposition for young people across the country. With their rallies against our government ever-growing, we must take action to strangle this movement in the cradle. The UNE itself will be declared an illegal organization by President Castelo Branco's decree, with further action being taken by the SNI to weaken their momentum. Our country's students should be in the classroom, learning to become our future leaders, not causing anarchy and riots in the streets."
 BRA_close_opposition_radio_stations: "Close Opposition Radio Stations"
 BRA_close_opposition_radio_stations_desc: "As we all know, a government that has the media on its side will always be more powerful and stable than one that doesn't. As it stands, our ministers have proposed that we review some of our media concessions, especially towards radio stations. Many such stations air programs and speeches against our revolution, and Leonel Brizola still operates his radio in Southern Brazil. These concessions must be revoked and instead granted to more loyal journalists, like those in Roberto Marinho's media conglomerate O Globo."
 BRA_integrate_the_integralists: "Integrate the Far Right"
 BRA_integrate_the_integralists_desc: "While the Armed Forces have been the loudest voices against communist influence in our country, we are not alone in this struggle. Far-right groups like the Anticommunist Movement (MAC) and the Commando to Hunt Communists (CCC) have carried this torch for a few years now. We share many values, and their paramilitary structure may benefit us in the future. While they must not be allowed to become part of our administration, we shall suggest that the SNI look the other way if a few leaked documents indicate alleged communist hideouts. If one or two leftists can't find their way home after a clash with the CCC, it's not really our problem."

 BRA_establish_a_formalized_high_command_desc: "While the Armed Forces were united enough to launch the movement that seized the presidency, it was quite clear that our structure is completely disorganized and anarchic, with nepotism and political connections being more valued than discipline and rank. Castelo Branco's government will set in motion a reorganization of our military structure, establishing a more rigid high command. If a few Constitutionalist generals get sacked along the way, that is a consequence they must suffer in silence, for they cannot stand against our values of order and progress."
 BRA_reform_the_officer_corps: "Reform the Officer Corps"
 BRA_reform_the_officer_corps_desc: "Ever since the political upheavals of the 1930s, our Armed Forces have been plagued by factionalism, nepotism, and politicization. Many generals command their troops for decades, which has led to the formation of Chinese-style cliques and personalistic loyalties in the military. Obviously, this cannot be allowed to continue. Our reforms will break up this old structure by introducing mandatory retirement ages for generals and increasing the rotativity of officers. The Hardliners will frown at this, but it is a necessary step to transform the Army into a truly apolitical structure."
 BRA_leave_as_it_is: "Leave as It Is"
 BRA_leave_as_it_is_desc: "The Hardliners stand fiercely opposed to the reforms we have proposed, and we must reach a compromise so as not to divide the military even further. Above all, the Armed Forces must keep presenting a semblance of unity to the outside world. Thus, our newly agreed-upon reforms will mostly target the influence of the remaining Constitutionalists, driving them out of the most powerful ranks in our military structure. This move will solidify the political strength of both the Sorbonne and the Hardliners, but the discord between these factions will remain present."
 BRA_form_the_sni: "Form the SNI"
 BRA_form_the_sni_desc: "The retired general Golbery do Couto e Silva, a close ally of Castelo Branco and Ernesto Geisel, has pointed out that our regime needs to update our intelligence-gathering operations if we want to survive. After many rounds of discussion, President Castelo Branco has decided to form the National Service of Informations (SNI) to replace the inefficient SCIFI as our intelligence agency and appoint Golbery as its Chief. This rank will have the same status as a Minister of State, and the SNI itself will be modeled after the CIA's internal structure. The agency will work as an espionage office, where we shall organize any intelligence operations against the enemies of the state."

 BRA_prepare_the_elections_desc: "Our work is almost done. The Armed Forces' Revolution has successfully taken control of our country, and we are ready to steer our nation back to its natural course. President Castelo Branco and his allies in the Sorbonne intend to keep their promises to call for free and direct elections and restore civilian rule to the presidency. The Hardliners are not so happy with this arrangement, but we have accomplished our goals. The Armed Forces must not meddle in politics so much, lest they be tainted by the politicians, as Geisel is fond of saying.\n\nOf course, we should oversee the electoral process, to ensure that the civilians choose only the best option, while also removing some choices from their plate. The PTB and other leftist parties will be suppressed through the electoral courts, making it so that only Lacerda's UDN or Kubitschek's PSD will have a chance to win the presidency."

Let us grant his agency free reign to do as they please, enabling them to efficiently suppress the opposition andany and all rebel groups where necessary.

Accordingly, they have been talking to President Castelo Branco, their colleague, and have convinced him that decisive action must be taken to prevent these nuisances from turning into something more than that.\n\nFor the sake of Brazil, let the peasant leagues be outlawed and then eliminated. Our socio-political welfare demands it."

Though we are not degenerate enough to slaughter Vargas - we will leave him in his house but keep him under watch - we are more than willing to force him to watch as his heretical, egocentric, and manifestly undeserved cult of personality is dismantled, destroyed, and left to rot for all eternity, until the people itself reject him in his old age."

We have also shut down the various student unions. But they keep protesting all over the place; it is at its worst in the University of Brasília.

 BRA_keep_the_bull_out_desc: "Adhemar Pereira de Barros has proven a popular choice, and by his means announced participation in the upcoming election. He is blissfully unaware that, at the moment, this isn't an option. He can not use his style of right wing populism to potentially split the vote with Lacerda, allowing a Kubitschek victory, just so he can make money for his hidden vault. It's fallen on us to tell him."
 BRA_allow_adhemar: "Allow Adhemar to Enter"
 BRA_allow_adhemar_desc: "Although Adhemar Pereira de Barros is not a preferable alternative either, and does not pass many of the checks required for presidency, we cannot do much to stop him from running. His electoral campaign may however divide the left-wing varguist vote. Adhemar is a wildcard and could harm either us or the opposition, all while he aims for his own personal wealth and not for a proper shot at the presidency this time. Let us hope it hurts them."
 BRA_aid_the_crow: "Aiding the Crow"
 BRA_aid_the_crow_desc: "So sure of victory at first, Lacerda has conceded that some rare interal polling indicates him at a narrow loss. Despite our policy of minimal electoral interference, we must come to his aid as soon as time allows to ensure that he prevails."

 BRA_fine_on_his_own: "Fine on His Own"
 BRA_fine_on_his_own_desc: "Lacerda is a great leader and a fine orator. His help against Costa E Silva using his natural charisma is part of the reason this election is even going ahead. Not only this but his time as governor of Guanabara has reduced homelessness rates, improved infrastructure and boosted the economy. Surely everyone can see that. Why would he need any more of our help, when he is fine on his own and when we have already given him so much?"
 BRA_allow_a_debate: "Allowing a Debate?"
 BRA_allow_a_debate_desc: "The performance of an election depends more on agreement than popularity. The more transparent our vision, the better our chances. With Lacerda's media connections, hosting a radio debate between him and Kubitschek may not be that bad an idea. However, this runs the risk of the opposition candidate spreading his message on his own time. However Lacerda is a skilled enough orator that he could prevent this."
 BRA_keep_an_eye_on_things: "Keeping an Eye on Things"
 BRA_keep_an_eye_on_things_desc: "Although we have made it clear that Lacerda is the country's only option forward, Kubitschek has rallied nearly all opposing organizations behind him. If we do not pay attention to his actions, we may find ourselves trapped."
 BRA_the_crow_new_look: "The Crow's New Look"
 BRA_the_crow_new_look_desc: "Lacerda's current vision aligns far too much with what many consider 'status quo'. This is not good for appearances. By making widespread populist promises and creating new policies, we can prep Lacerda for a fresher show before the media."

 BRA_use_them_to_our_advantage: "Use Them to Our Advantage"
 BRA_use_them_to_our_advantage_desc: "When we do a little trickery, the pieces come together. By allowing the military to send covert and anonymous support to small left-wing candidates, we can diminish the Kubitschek vote while also making the election look fairer. This paradoxical plan is perfect."

 BRA_supress_the_left: "Suppress the Left"
 BRA_supress_the_left_desc: "Supporting left-wing splinter groups may run the risk of them growing, and eventually aligning themselves with the rest of the opposition and even giving them legitimacy and pushing more into the communist movement. By keeping them divided and weak, we can tackle one threat at a time."

 BRA_a_bridge_too_far: "A Bridge Too Far"
 BRA_a_bridge_too_far_desc: "Direct actions against Kubitschek have proved to be a mistake, disrupting the election cycle and threatening the possibility of maintaining control even within the upcoming year. We must do all we can to pose a better strategy for this process, and the projects to come."
 BRA_work_against_kubitscheck: "Work against Kubitschek"
 BRA_work_against_kubitscheck_desc: "Fellow officers and hardliner generals such as Sylvio Frota have advised to directly work against Kubitschek and his campaign. This will almost certainly ensure Lacerda's chances at an inauguration."

 BRA_use_the_envelope_system: "Utilizing the Envelope System"
 BRA_use_the_envelope_system_desc: "In conscript's terms, the 'envelope system' used by Adhemar is essentially bribery, used as a way of gaining support. Utilizing this may be either our last-minute resort or additional effort to ensure Lacerda gains better chances."
 BRA_eternal_vigilance: "Eternal Vigilance"
 BRA_eternal_vigilance_desc: "Although the coup has secured the Sorbonne's power, radicalisation and political violence still roams free. Overlooking the state of affairs to ensure political violence does not disrupt the flow of plans is the preferable option. "The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.""
 BRA_keep_the_integralists_happy: "Keeping the Far Right Happy"
 BRA_keep_the_integralists_happy_desc: "Although the Far Right movement and paramilitaries such as the CCC is not without controversy, they have helped secure control of the country in the weeks following the coup. To keep them on our side, however, we must pay a substantial amount in political influence and monetary funds"
 BRA_and_the_communists_quiet: "And the Communists Quiet"
 BRA_and_the_communists_quiet_desc: "If we are to prevail, we must repress the hardline opposition with the full extent of our force, to ensure they cannot influence other extremist factions that may align themselves against us in the long run."
 BRA_cool_down_the_north: "Cool Down the North"
 BRA_cool_down_the_north_desc: "Communist saboteurs have long threatened Brazilian democracy - and our reports have indicated their general location.

 BRA_soldiers_on_high_alert: "Soldiers on High Alert"
 BRA_soldiers_on_high_alert_desc: "When election day comes, soldiers have already been placed on high alert, patrolling for possible ploys, assasination attempts, or poll violence. With military assistance in peacekeeping, and the intimidation meant to secure democratic processes, a smooth transition of power - to our candidate - will soon occur."

 ## Costa E Silva Tree
 BRA_silva_victorious: "Costa e Silva Victorious"
 BRA_silva_victorious_desc: "The unworthy Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco, who was too soft of head and hear to lead our country, now leaves the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil in ignominy, shaking his head in disgust as his former subordinate, Artur da Costa e Silva, takes power.\n\nCosta e Silva had been the target of an unjust, militarily ridiculous plot by the previous president to force his resignation. However, the new President had enough support to force Branco out instead.\n\nNow the victorious Costa e Silva is free to fix the problems Brazil faces."
 BRA_silva_victorious_tt: "§GHumberto rolled snake eyes and now Silva is in control.§!\n"
 BRA_ban_political_parties: "Ban Political Parties"
 BRA_ban_political_parties_desc: "The new President is of the conviction that all political parties are worthless and potential threats. Even ostensibly loyal parties such as the UDN can serve as an umbrella beneath which potential opponents can come in and wreak havoc, organizing against our government and handing the whole country over to the Hitlerites and communists.\n\nThis possibility, of course, cannot be tolerated. Banning these organizations - left, right, or centre - will ensure that the opposition is kept disorganized and most political plots are kept at the stage of imagination only."
 BRA_exile_the_opposition: "Exile the Opposition"
 BRA_exile_the_opposition_desc: "The degenerates that forced us to seize control of Brazil, that prioritized their own welfare and prestige over that of the nation, have absolutely zero, z-e-r-o, place in the Brazil that we are going to build. Good-for-nothing scum such as Jânio Quadros, Carlos Lacerda, and Juscelino Kubitschek, will be made to realize their failure to serve and love the country and its leadership disqualify them from being referred to as truly Brazilian.\n\nAnd countless other fools will follow them. Let the motto of the new order in Brazil become thus: "Brasil, ame-o ou deixe-o" - "Brazil, love it or leave it"! "
 BRA_close_the_legislature: "Close the legislature"
 BRA_close_the_legislature_desc: "The Congress is the symbol of everything wrong in this country. Corruption. Nepotism. Inefficiency.\n\nAt the start of the Revolution, the rot began from it; not a single moment passed where the Congress did not egg the Brazilian government to further and further depths of corruption and folly. And then of course the rule of the degenerate Getúlio Vargas and his cronies only worsened the situation.\n\nThis cannot be borne any longer. Until a more opportune time, let this accursed pesthole of folly and immorality be shut down. There is no need for anyone but one or two cleaners to be there."
 BRA_integrate_loyalist_conservatives: "Intergrate Loyalist Conservatives"
 BRA_integrate_loyalist_conservatives_desc: "It is true that even ostensibly loyal parties such as the UDN can serve as an umbrella beneath which potential opponents can come in and wreak havoc, organizing against our government and handing the whole country over to the Hitlerites and communists.\n\nOn the other hand, beneath that potentially treasonous umbrella there are also faithful and true conservatives, men who understand the necessity of our actions and the need to suppress the Amazonist-adjacent leftist faction.\n\nLet them be taken under our umbrella and induced to join hands with our regime. This will ensure us significant support from large segments of Brazilian society."
 BRA_nationwide_censorship: "Nationwide Censorship"
 BRA_nationwide_censorship_desc: "Unfettered newspapers of the sort that Lacerda and other democratic imbeciles promoted before our assumption of power are filled to the brim with just the type of degenerates that forced us to seize control of Brazil and prioritize their own welfare and prestige over that of the nation. Obviously this too cannot be tolerated for much longer.\n\nLet everything and anything be censored until only what the state agrees with and permits to be published is published. This is certain to help curtail dissent."
 BRA_weaken_the_sorbonne: "Weaken the Sorbonne"
 BRA_weaken_the_sorbonne_desc: "The Sorbonne, though not as insane as the Amazonists, are still a threat. After all, they supported our weak-minded former president in his attempt to restore democracy to Brazil. On the other hand, they are still good military men, and their influence is nothing to sneeze at. Let us try to weaken it.\n\nMoving Geisel from the armed forces to the Supreme Military Tribunal (without demotion, of course; this is not a purge) and placing our own man in charge of his SNI will probably be of great help in defending our nation's interests. It'll also no doubt provide that poor life-hating, misanthropic bastard with a well-deserved rest from his labours."
 BRA_implement_martial_law: "Implement Martial Law"
 BRA_implement_martial_law_desc: "We have gone far, but it is nowhere near enough.\n\nUnless we take direct, decisive action, our nation will burn. The communist bastards are plotting a revolution and we need to stop them.\n\n"Do you mean the Brizolistas?" we hear you ask.\n\nYes and no, we reply. To us a communist and a fascist is anyone that dares defy the Brazilian government or disagree with our control over it.\n\nTo President Artur da Costa e Silva, the way is clear. Martial law must be declared to save the nation, he says; he is right, and so it will be done. A temporary suspension of civil liberties and implementation of martial law will be necessary to destroy the plotters trying to ruin our nation from the inside.\n\nAnd it will persist for as long as is necessary to protect the glory of the Brazilian nation from all that would attack it."
