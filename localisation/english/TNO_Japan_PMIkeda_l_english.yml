Luxuries such as tea and tobacco are not freely available, prompting an emergence of a black market that seeks to rob honest, hardworking citizens out of the fruits of their labor.\n\nThe reformists have, since the foundation of their clique, demanded the abolishment of price controls and other such measures that hamper the consuming habits of the Japanese people. With them in government, it became one of the conditions of their confidence in the chambers of the Diet. If their proposition passes, the average citizen would no longer be inhibited by arbitrary measures designed to win a war already won."

The conservatives, however, with their concerns for the morality of the public, had found a new use for it. Ikeda and Takagi have to compromise, and the measures they arrive at is the lessening of curfew hours as well as relaxation of the requirements for a permit.

Now, you may be wondering what the platform of this administration is, and how different it will be from the Ino administration.\"\n\nA slight chuckle emerges from the stands, as Ikeda lets out a cough to reassert the room's attention.\n\n\"Moving forth, I seek to guide my administration by these principles: integrity and moderation. Our nation is fundamentally great, and our position could never be more secure, but we have to always take note of the changing tides of the world. Like my colleagues among Admiral Takagi's reformists, I do believe Japan constantly needs reform and advancement to keep our place in the sun.\"\n\nThe reformists among the diet let out a mild applause for a few seconds, before silence engulfs the room again.\n\n\"But, above all I seek to run a clean and honest administration. Ino was a fool, and was rightfully disgraced as one. Some of you are still loyal to Ino's path, and I would not chide you for that - but this administration shall be honest and purged from corruption. With that, I end my speech and cede my time back to the speaker.\"\n\nSilence echoed through the room, as many of Ino's loyalists let this new reality sink in, no matter whether Ikeda actually meant whatever he said.\n\n"

The leader of the Reformists has made an attempt to reach across the aisle following Ikeda's unspoken request for cooperation against the technocrats. While Takagi considers Ikeda to still be a stain on the government's integrity, he has begrudgingly concluded that Ikeda was far from the worst possible option the Conservatives could field.\n\n\"Look - you know me, Ikeda-san, I don't have many non-negotiables. It's the same things I've always been fighting for in the Diet - clean governance, technocratic principles and curbing the Army.\"\n\n\"Takagi-san, you have to understand that it isn't easy - I personally don't find the idea of army cooperation too attractive either, but you know what they say about eggs and omelettes.\"\n\nTakagi lets out a small grin, but one that's forced enough to show his frustration, \"I'm not here to play games, Masanosuke. You either accept the proposal, or the agreement's off.\"\n\nIkeda is at a crossroads - gaining the Reformists' trust is harder than it seems. He's walking on a tightrope now - if he caves in too much to the Reformists' demands, he'd collapse his own base. If he puts up an uncompromising front, a hundred Diet votes would go up in dust. The only viable path, if the conservatives were to survive, is to tread the middle line.\n\n\"Soukichi, you and I both know that your relevance in the Diet hinges on cooperation too. I'll take up your offer - but know that this is an equal partnership, at the very least.\"\n\nThe two men put out their cigarettes, shake hands and bide each other goodbye. The moderates might triumph after all, thought Ikeda as he observes Takagi entering his limousine from his office window."

Lit by a small table lamp, the Prime Minister is accompanied by a warm mug of coffee and a pack of cigarettes. Nights like these were made for reading, and tonight, Ikeda is reading the memoirs of Saionji Kinmochi - by far the most influential and domineering figure in the Japanese political scene in the 1920s. For Ikeda, Saionji is the very personification of the ideals he strives for - moderation, conservatism and a respect for the traditional institutions of Japanese power.\n\nOf course, times have changed since the days of the Genrou. The Showa era was supposed to herald a new, bright era for Japan - the glory of Asian hegemony was theirs for the taking. Japan had everything it could have ever wanted, but corruption and incompetence has prevented Japan from claiming the spoils of victory. \"Ino wasn't entirely wrong\", Ikeda thought, but his governance was abysmal in practice.\n\nMaybe the House of Representatives was an outdated means of ensuring political domination, and has been mired in so much graft, backroom dealings and corruption. Maybe it's time to concentrate power in those divinely ordained to do so once more - the nobility. After all, if this pays off, Ikeda's basically untouchable - noble pressure and cajoling is incredibly powerful in getting House of Representative deputies to fall in line.\n\nThe issue is, for Ikeda, is to secure the nobles' support in the first place.\n\n"

 japikeda.6.d:0 "Traditionally, the main financial and economic backers have always been the Zaibatsu. In particular, the Big Four families of Yasuda, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo have always been entangled with Japan's political conservatives - from the Rikken Seiyuukai to the Rikken Minseito. Even in the aftermath of the formation of the Taisei Yokusankai, the Yokusankai's centre has always been backed by the financial might and historical ties to the mega-corporations. However, this has changed in the aftermath of the Yasuda collapse, an event that will change the face of the Japanese economy forever.\n\nPrime Minister Ikeda has always had strong ties to corporations, and this has not seemed to cease upon his ascension to Prime Ministership. Recently, the remaining three of the old four families have approached his administration for negotiations regarding the continuation of his term under their rule. In particular, the three families have approached Ikeda separately regarding the aftermath of Yasuda's collapse - with Sumitomo in particular being the most aggressive in negotiating for the scraps of Yasuda. Ikeda however, is not an idiot. Favour begets another favour, and his terms are simple: Financial backing for his political campaigning, and a promise to restructure accordingly to the new needs of the economy.\n\nThe corporations are in flux upon receiving such demands. On one hand, it is a guarantee of their old alliance with the conservative centre of Japanese politics. On the other hand, restructuring is an incredibly tiresome and gruelling task that may not guarantee dividends. Sumitomo however, has already wholeheartedly accepted Ikeda's proposal - considering the mega-corporation was already in the middle of restructuring when Yasuda collapsed."

Hatoyama after all, was already part of the Diet since 1915 - seeing it all, living through it all. Though he has every urge to bark back at the old conservative, he resists. Of course, Hatoyama notices his body language - but does not say a word.\n\n\"Thank you, Hatoyama-sama. It was a struggle, but playing off the Reformists against the corporations was pretty effective at shutting them down.\"\n\n\"Genjitsu Seiji Keikaku, young man.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I don't quite get your drift.\"\n\n\"Realpolitik. Play your enemies against each other, they don't even notice you're gliding above them the whole time.\"\n\nIkeda was of course, no stranger to the games of Realpolitik. He himself was a \"faction-jumper\". In the eyes of many in the Diet, jumping across factions in the Yokusankai is akin to dishonour and betrayal - something many independents accused Ikeda of being when he joined the Yokusankai in the late 1940s. However, their protests were just hot air, as Ikeda rose to ministerial positions throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, and even moreso now when he has become Prime Minister."

Most important were Sato Eisaku, Sakurauchi Yoshio, Ezaki Masumi and Hatoyama Ichirō - important moderates, and trusted, non-corrupt deputies from the Ino era. Ikeda has worked for and against members of this cabinet in the past, but what's done is done. What matters now is the formation of a strong, unified front - opposition be damned.\n\n\"Thank you, Daijin-sama: Regarding the governmental situation, we have a stable mandate over the Lower House. However, the Upper House is an entirely different story. Trust is important, especially given how Ino threw away their faith in the Diet moderates.\"\n\nIkeda knows that swaying the nobles and the Peers would be an uphill struggle, that uptight bastard Kido be damned. Unfortunately, Ikeda's mandate relies on their support - if Kido is left alone to lobby the House of Peers, passing legislation would be difficult, if not impossible.\n\n\"What about the Kazoku? Can they be convinced?\" interjected Ikeda.\n\n\"Daijin-sama, lobbying the Kazoku would be inadvisable: if they even think that we're pressuring or cajoling them, we're dead.\"\n\n\"We're not going to pressure them - it'd be more like, 'appealing to their better natures'. Either this works, or our administration will be dead in the water.\" Ikeda knows the risks, but decades of parliamentary wrangling has made him bold enough to take the fight upwards.

 japikeda.10.d:0 "The Diet of Japan is a treacherous snakepit, filled with crooks, opportunists and alliances of convenience. Unfortunately, Ikeda Masanosuke's political credibility lives and dies by the approval of the Diet. While the House of Peers are stuck up in their high horses, the House of Representatives contains the people who will actually get things done, for good or for ill. Our conservative front now has to choose who to brown-nose, who to keep close, and who to throw under the bus - a roulette between the Reformist, Royalist and Technocrat factions.\n\nThe Reformist faction, formerly moribund has experienced a return to form during the twilight of the Ino years - no doubt taking advantage of the anti-corruption sentiment among the Japanese public. One could argue that the Reformists are our natural allies: after all, they are moderates - and the conservatives largely differ only in terms of cautiousness to reform. However, allying with the Reformists would cost us the support of the army and the technocrats, in exchange for popular and Imperial navy support.\n\nThe technocrats on the other hand, could be described as technocratic, nationalist étatists at best, and totalitarian, destabilising extremists at worst. Firmly opposed to moderation and caution, they seek to reform and recalibrate the state into a corporatist, arguably totalitarian model: supposedly in the name of the Kokutai, but that claim stands on shaky ground in our eyes. However, we could try and appeal to the moderates within their ranks - taking influence from their corporatist model into ours, and choking them away into Diet irrelevance.\n\nLastly, the royalists. Less of a proper faction and more of Kido Kōichi's personal clique, they seem to be numerically irrelevant. What makes them worth considering though, is their connections with the nobility and most importantly, the Tennō himself. Their relative infirmity when it comes to ideology can be spun to our own gain - we have the numbers to outmuscle them, and they don't."

So, now that you've become top dog - what's gonna change? How are you different from that fool Ino?\"\n\n\"Well - it's rather easy actually: I see the values of the pre-war conservatives as much as you gentlemen do, and-\"\n\nIkeda's third swing barely missed the hole - but it's close enough for him to sink it in.\n\n\"Where was I? Right - fiscal responsibility, and running a clean ship. Doesn't sound like much, but it's an essential first step.\"\n\n\"Ikeda-san, if I can be frank - Ino's indiscretions don't bother us that much: our concerns lie mostly within his ideal of conservatism. All that we're asking is that you uphold the ideals of the Minseito, and to hell with the Seiyuukai's ideals.\"\n\nIkeda knows the foolishness and how badly out-of-touch these old nobles were.

Any politician that does not earn the favour of the House of Peers is a dead man, doomed to a premiership of vetoes and blocked legislation.\n\nIkeda Masanosuke has been planning his next move against the House of Peers for weeks now. He has secured the remnants of the Minseitou in the form of the Douwakai and the Douseikai, but it was inherently easier to win their appeal - after all, Ikeda represents the moderates in the Diet, as well as having a steady following of former pre-war conservatives. Now that he has a foothold in the House of Peers, he is ready to go above and beyond.\n\nThe next move would be petitioning for the House of Peers' stamp of appeal. An incredibly powerful tool in Japanese politics, it can only be bestowed by the House of Peers - for the obvious reason of it being able to grant access to the Privy Council, the only body able to revise the Japanese constitution and give political counsel to the Tenno himself.\n\nIkeda knows that this requires more than mere dinners and golf outings. He needs a plan, and a thorough one at that. If those plans could be drafted as soon as possible, he has the necessary momentum. Factionalism is on his side: he has a majority in the diet, as well as having a reputation for being a moderate. Only time will tell if he is able to actually win the nobles over - or perish."

His guests of honor are different every time: his fellow parliamentarians, diplomats, nobles of the Kazoku, and more. They come in and sit at the same table every time, order a drink or a light meal, and soon get down to business.\n\nAnd every so often, he'll make one of them a promise.\n\nMake no mistake; these are not grand gestures of undying respect. They are small, simple things--an amendment to a bill, a line item in a budget, a minor contract for a Zaibatsu, or some other bureaucratic detail whose significance mostly escapes me. But they rarely fail to put a smile on the other man's face, and garner in return a promise of his own, whose substance is always the same: loyalty and support for Prime Minister Ikeda and the conservative faction.\n\nWith every glass of sake I serve, the Prime Minister's web of promises and allies ties the country more tightly together.\n\nOf course, being in this position makes me privy to more than a few secrets of how Prime minister Ikeda goes about his work. Were I to reveal them, more than a few of Japan's most prominent figures would see a sudden and extremely rapid downturn in their career prospects...\n\n...but that would be ungentlemanly."

 japikeda.22.d:0 "Tsukamoto Shoji was one of the many monks working to prepare the Meiji Jingu shrine for the visit on that day. It was certainly a significant visit, as Prime Minister Ikeda had never previously been to the Shrine. Tsukamoto had heard that he was not much of a religious man, only visiting shrines for publicity and out of political necessity. Still, it was better than never visiting, or the monk felt. A visit by the Prime Minister was important, and was bound to ensure the Shrine received plenty of donations. With everything in order ahead of schedule, Tsukamoto gathered with his fellow monks to await the Prime Minister\n\nIt was easy enough to tell when the Prime Minister was nearing Meiji-Jingu. Although he traveled on foot through the majority of Shibuya's Yoyogi Park, the sounds of reporters and photographers made his presence known a good few minutes before he appeared in person before the assembled Temple monks. The Prime Minister, grinning as if meeting old friends, quickly performed the appropriate formalities before the Head Monk began to guide him around the Shrine. Tsukamoto could not help but notice that the Prime Minister had walked just a bit too quickly, only slowing down to a respectable pace when walking alongside the Head Monk. Once the tour of Meiji-Jingu was complete, the procession headed inside to hear Prime Minister Ikeda speak.\n\nTsukamoto found himself a place to sit at the back of the room, and began to listen to the Prime Minister. \"As monks of this shrine, you are the representatives of the morality and spirituality of Japan. You provide a vital service to this nation, one that each and every one of us deeply needs.\" Tsukamoto noted how loud the Prime Minister was, which was only emphasised further by his hyperbolic gestures. \"As your Prime Minister, I am sworn to defend your services, and to ensure they remain a cornerstone of society. I assure you, that my administration is committed to tradition and morality. I thank you for allowing me to take time out of your days to accommodate my visit and that the donation I make goes a long way in aiding this grand shrine.\" Upon once again performing the expected formalities, Prime Minister Ikeda was immediately surrounded by his entourage of guards and assistants as he departed from Meiji-Jingu. Tsukamoto felt somewhat disappointed by the visit, and thought about it much for the rest of the day. He eventually realised that one thing was certain, Ikeda was not a man who often visited Shrines."

Emperor Meiji was a pioneer in many means, revolutionising the Japanese State away from its backwards feudal roots, and a pioneer of the sciences and technological advancement. Today, Ikeda has the honour of speaking to the nation on television, courtesy of the technological advances made by state broadcaster NHK.\n\n\"Citizens, loyal subjects of the Tenno, I bid you a very good morning. Today is an auspicious day for all of us, and even moreso for the divine Emperor Meiji in the heavens above.\"\n\nIkeda puts down his script, before continuing his speech freely.\n\n\"Nearly a hundred years ago today, our most venerable Emperor Meiji began the glorious Meiji Restoration, a process which saw Japan advance from being a backwards, picked-upon nation, to the glorious state we have today. In more aspects than one, we owe so much to his Divinity.\"\n\nThe cameraman signals to Ikeda that he is running out of time - only two minutes left on the clock.\n\n\"Emperor Meiji remains this administration's single greatest inspiration in politics - his values of a strong, educated, forward-thinking Japan resonates with everyone in government today, and we will continue to forward that vision as much as possible. With this, I bid you farewell, fellow citizens and loyal subjects of the Tenno, and may the heavens bless Emperor Meiji on this sacred day.\""

 japikeda.24.d:0 "It had been the first time in a long while that Prime Minister Ikeda Masanosuke had had to travel far to meet with members of the Kazoku. These particular figures were of a different stock, and it would require a show of humility on Ikeda's part. Led by Shimazu Tadashige, the Shimazu family had ruled the province of Satsuma for a great number of centuries. Their powerful positions in the House of Peers had made them valuable potential allies for Ikeda Now, Ikeda stood before the Shimazu family estate. Once the formalities had been concluded, which the Prime Minister was careful to properly respect, Ikeda and the heads of the Shimazu family sat down for a most traditional dinner.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I am honored to have been invited here to meet and dine with you. I have experienced nothing but excellence since I arrived.\" While this was indeed his usual manner of conducting business, the somewhat austere mood had made Ikeda more subdued. He was more comfortable in the smokey and relaxed clubs of Tokyo, where conversation was loud and the drinks were bottomless. Still, he continued to speak to the severe men seated in front of him. \"As leaders of the Shimazu clan, you are important voices in the House of Peers, voices that I always take into consideration. The looks of the Shimazu clan leaders did not change, but Ikeda had expected nothing more from an old samurai clan. \"However, I have in truth come here to ask of you an extraordinary favour. I believe that we are aligned in our views regarding the future of Japan. Therefore, I propose that we form an alliance in the house of peers, to further both of our interests.\" The Shimazu leaders convened among themselves for a while, with the same facial expressions as before. A good five minutes passed, leaving Ikeda plenty of time to sample the sake. \"Prime Minister, we appreciate the offer you have brought before us, as well as the subsidies for our Shimazu Kosan company. We will need more time to commune with the rest of the family, but we think you should have your alliance formalised within the week.\" Ikeda performed his best humble bow and spent the rest of the evening in smug contemplation."

The weather seems to have matched the somber nature of the event as it rained throughout the whole event, forcing the event to head indoors into a prayer hall.\n\nCoat drenched from the rain, the 83-year old left the prayer hall silent as he talked about the necessity of wartime sacrifice, which he himself had seen and went through as a young man. Of particular note is a 30-minute private prayer in one of the Shrine's many halls. Yomiuri Shimbun were declined comments from the Deputy Prime Minister, but we would like to give Deputy Hatoyama our most heartfelt congratulations for dedicating time out of the busy schedules of governance to bless the spirits of those who have given their lives for Japan.\n\nOf course, the Deputy's visit to the shrine has been met with criticism from radical left-wing student activists, who call him a continued propagator of Japanese imperialism throughout East Asia. Our correspondents were able to obtain comments from the Minister of Education, who believes that the criticism towards the Co-Prosperity Sphere was caused by an influx of American smear campaigns, and will be looking towards disciplinary action towards these students."

Give me the wisdom to see my task through to its end. Give me the cunning to convince my adversaries that they have strayed from the path.\"\n\nHe pauses, wondering if perhaps he's asked too much.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he says finally, \"if I have placed too many demands on you. It is not my place to be so greedy with the spirits. But I must press on. It is the only way...all others lead to disaster. So I have no choice but to ask this of you.

You've beaten back the nobles and the elites - how are you feeling about finally wrangling in the Diet?\"\n\nIkeda at this point was unbothered by Hatoyama disparaging his relative inexperience and age. What does he know at this point? Hatoyama could barely rise to party leadership in 50 years in the Diet, while Ikeda has achieved party leadership in 20 years. Ikeda of course, held his tongue - Hatoyama's support is still critical to the old guard of the Yokusankai, as well as nobles familiar with Hatoyama as their conduit within the Diet.\n\n\"Well, Hatoyama-sama, it was hard, but you just have to know when to make the right promises - and when to break them.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll do fine, but the House of Representatives is another story. I'm too old to keep up with what goes on. Hell, I've been in the diet longer than that brash fool Takagi was even in the Navy!\"\n\n\"Experience doesn't come merely in years, Hatoyama-sama: it's what you do with those years.\"\n\nTaken slightly aback, but also impressed at Ikeda's backhanded comment, Hatoyama slowly starts to realise the capabilities of the young firebrand. Even though he was still relatively young, and still made foolish decisions from time to time, he knew how to handle himself in difficult situations. Not many people managed to bridge the gap between the Kazoku nobles and the Diet - that was on the tier of Ito Hirobumi."

Maybe it's the sense of tension in the air, so thick that Hatoyama can practically feel it in his ancient bones. Maybe it's the gleam in Ikeda's eye, signalling that his legendarily fiery ire is about to be unleashed. Or maybe it's just that he knows that Ikeda thinks he's been playing cautiously for far too long.\n\nWhatever the reason, Hatoyama finds himself utterly unsurprised when Ikeda says, \"It's time to discuss our next target.\"\n\nThe veteran minister nods, but replies, \"We'll have to choose our play with care. You know as well as I do how precarious your position is. I understand your desire to permanently defeat your opposition, but if you damage your own supporters in such a maneuver it could spell the end of your ministry.\"\n\n\"Don't remind me,\" Ikeda mutters, face twisting into a frown. \"A focused strike, then. Not an attack against a whole faction--some sort of targeted scheme, meant to diminish the influence of a few key figures. Take out the foundation and collapse the whole structure.\"\n\nHatoyama raises an eyebrow. \"Are you talking about securing your political position or assaulting a fortress?\"\n\n\"Very droll,\" Ikeda says, but his tone makes it clear that he has no time for dry wit. \"In any case, that answers the 'how'. The next question is 'who'. If we're directing our attention so narrowly, we'll have to make sure we're discrediting only the greatest threats to my ministry.\"\n\n\"You seem to have already formed an opinion on who they are,\" Hatoyama observes."

But his jaw is still clenched with anger.\n\n\"We must do this, Eisaku,\" Hatoyama tells him. \"I understand that you and Kishi are close, but there is simply too much at stake to let the Technocrats go unchecked. The Prime Minister understands this, which is why he's decided to accept my suggestion to put Kishi under arrest.\"\n\n\"You know my misgivings have never stopped me from standing by either of you before,\" Sato says. \"But this...this is different. Attacking Kishi is a bridge too far. I'm surprised you'd even consider asking me to support you against my own brother.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Ikeda is still seated, he seems to loom over his compatriots, and the evening light from outside casts his shadow in sharp relief over the tan cedarwood of the conference table. \"I'm not asking you to do anything,\" he replies. \"I'm telling you what will happen. Your options are to accept it, or to no longer be a member of this cabinet.\"\n\nSato genuinely considers the second of those options for a moment. But his own position in the Diet has always been precarious--thanks in large part to the very brother Ikeda is now proposing to attack. Even if he defects to another faction, he'll be distrusted and sidelined there, unable to make nearly as much of a difference as he does in Ikeda's cabinet.\n\nHe knows all this...and Ikeda knows he knows it.\n\nWith a defeated sigh, Sato slumps back in his seat. \"Fine,\" he says bitterly. \"But the least you can do is not to make me a part of your plans for Kishi. It's bad enough that I'm having to sit by while you target him--don't ask me to stab my own family in the back as well.\"\n\n\"Your assistance won't be necessary,\" Hatoyama says. It's not exactly a reassurance, but he offers it all the same.\n\nSato gives a despondent nod, and with that, his brother's fate is sealed."

But what does come as a surprise is the urgency with which they plead for the conservatives to take action. Some of the requests have been phrased almost as demands, brazen enough to shock even Hatoyama with his decades of experience in politics.\n\nThings must be worse than Ikeda thought if the Zaibatsus are getting this desperate.\n\nVery well, then. If corporate relief and a hard stance against the Technocrats are what they're asking of him, then that is what they shall have. But they'll get it on his terms, and no one else's.

Now, it's just a matter of who among them to purge.\"\n\nHatoyama sits opposite his boss, settling down in a sturdy chair on the other side of the desk. \"You seem oddly excited about this,\" he says. \"Even more than you were when you decided to go on the offensive in the first place.\"\n\n\"Can you blame me?\" Ikeda looks up from his work to address his right-hand man. \"It feels good sometimes to be able to make demands and throw my weight around, rather than walking on eggshells to avoid breaking the great compromise that created this ministry.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can't,\" Hatoyama admits. \"But just because it makes you feel good doesn't obviate the need for--\"\n\n\"For caution and prudence, yes, I know,\" interrupts Ikeda, a note of annoyance creeping into his voice. \"So let us plan how to cautiously and prudently purge our enemies from the Diet.\"\n\nHatoyama leans over the papers, and the wheels of state begin to turn."

It is full of abundant resource deposits of all kinds, barely utilized by the undeveloped Republic but now tapped to their fullest extent by Japanese interests. It is home to the lion's share of the Sphere's industry outside the Japanese archipelago itself, the product of fifteen years' worth of investment in its economy and an increasingly close integration between the Chinese and their overlords.\n\nBut none of these are the reason China must be held at all costs.\n\nThe true reason is this: China is the living, breathing symbol of Japan's greatest triumphs.\n\nBefore even the first war against Russia so many decades ago, the Japanese victory over the decaying Qing showed them to be more than just another \"primitive\" Asian kingdom ripe for colonization. Military advances into China during the Boxer Rebellion and the years following World War I put Japan on par with the world's greatest powers. And finally, the total conquest of all of China during the Second World War completed the creation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the culmination of Japan's imperial ambitions.\n\nIf China were to be lost, it would seem to many Japanese as if all of those victories were erased in one blow. It would not just take with it its land, its population, its resources, and its industry--it would take Japan's national pride as well. And that, more than anything else, would be a disaster too horrible to contemplate."

They had the expertise Ikeda lacked, and with them on board his government could stand in a far stronger position.\n\nAfter rubbing his eyes and sighing heavily, Ikeda was struck with another idea, the Takagites. They were motivated to legislate and notably pragmatic - perfect for his own agendas in the Diet. Where they lacked experience, they made up for it in determination.

The two chattered away for a long while; Ikeda covered his fears of rejection from Takagi's cold demeanor with short chuckles and smiles as he brokered a deal with him.

Insisting he was checking for Kenpaitai, Kido jokingly snickered and nodded to Ikeda's proposal before discussing with him the terms of this agreement.

 japikeda.57.d:0 "Tired and irked, Takagi and Ikeda spoke to each other in a boardroom in the National Diet building and discussed the last debate that split reformists and conservatives despite their unofficial alliance. Ikeda stood with his arms crossed in the brightly-lit room, looking over to Takagi with an expression of complaint across his face. Takagi glanced back over to Ikeda with a clear look of fatigue, exhausted by the bitterness of intense parliamentary dispute.\n\n\"Mr. Takagi, if our confidence-and-supply deal is to work, we need to compromise on some issues. I did not see that out there at all. If your people want a voice in our bills, you have to show us the support. It's really that simple!\"\n\nHe had finished speaking, lowering his voice after almost shouting across the room. Takagi was silent for a moment and rubbed his eyes. He looked back up at Ikeda and nodded in agreement with the Prime Minister, and the two discussed further on their dealings in the Diet."

 japikeda.58.d:0 "With resounding applause in the Diet, Prime Minister Ikeda stood impassioned by his support for his speech given to the chamber. Stood behind the podium overlooking the Diet, he bowed and waved to the bobbing heads across the chamber floor who clapped and chattered in approval of his speech outlining his intentions for the empire. Ikeda now commanded the support of the moderate bloc now centered around him thanks to the reformists' support of his administration, forming a comfortable foundation for him to pass legislation in the chamber.\n\nHe was the king of the Diet, at least for the time being, and behind his pleased grin ran thoughts of urgency. Anticipating friction, he believed that action to pass his legislation must begin before the opposition clock of his potential to overturn the many laws of the past that defined the dysfunctional status-quo."

 japikeda.59.t:0 "Attempts at Reforms of National Mobilization Law"
 japikeda.59.d:0 "Ikeda sat in a boardroom surrounded by his cabinet, and with their desperate attention he declared his intention to reform the National Mobilization Law. Yoshio, struck by the move, made his confusion clear and expressed his doubts over how the government could move such a monumental and concrete law passed in the Konoe Era. A similar doubt proliferated between his men, much to Ikeda's frustration, and they all grew concerned looks on their faces.\n\nCalming down the cabinet, Ikeda confessed to his men that with the newfound impetus of the reformist faction of the Taisei Yokusankai, he may find enough support in the Diet to amend the restrictive conditions Japan lives under imposed by the wartime measures. Ikeda down at his notes, continuing to read the conditions of his propositions, but as he looked up he noticed the lack of confidence shared between his cabinet. Scoffing at their skepticism, he asked them to look beyond the semantics of the initiative and get to work with the task at hand."
 japikeda.59.a:0 "Moving mountains, Mr. Ikeda?"
 japikeda.60.t:0 "The Responsibilities of Leaders"
 japikeda.60.d:0 "Kido was in Ikeda's office, and he had come to speak to him about an issue that has been on his and many other members' minds for a while now - the militarism of the Diet. Kido reasoned with the Prime Minister, demanding that he would at least be aware of the military's influence over the politics of the empire. Landing heaps of reports and documents containing evidence of corruption and political coercion on Ikeda's desk, he urged him to flick through them all and see for himself. The Prime Minister was unimpressed with Kido's demand, but perhaps more unimpressed at the fact it was his responsibility to look into it.\n\nOffering banal platitudes and forced grins of approval, Ikeda extended his support to Kido's requests and dragged the pile of reports from the edge of his desk towards himself. Investigating military influence was surely something to grab the attention of his adversaries, Ikeda thought, dreading what would come of the endeavor. He sank back in his chair, exhausted, and returned his flustered attention to a satisfied Kido who was pleased with the Prime Minister's kind and considerate cooperation."

 japikeda.61.t:0 "Securing The Reigns"
 japikeda.61.d:0 "Ikeda, convening with his Deputy Prime Minister, Hatoyama Ichiro, sat at his desk and leaned back in his soft, leather chair. He inhaled a deep breath, calm and relaxed, before opening his eyes and smiling at his colleague with a pleased grin. He mumbled, holding back a cackle, and finally broke the silence by addressing his deputy directly.\n\nHe chuckled, uttering his words with total satisfaction; the Technocrats had been neutralized in the Diet by the maneuvers and deal-brokering of Prime Minister's moderate bloc. Ichiro, with a confused yet impressed smile crawling across his face, prodded Ikeda for an explanation. He was met with a gleeful reply, as Ikeda explained how now the right wing of the Taisei Yokusankai has now been secured - cementing his authority over the Diet."
 japikeda.61.a:0 "Send him back to counting coins"
 japikeda.62.t:0 "Comrades and Peers in Arms"
 japikeda.62.d:0 "Ikeda, scheming in his office, scurried between different sheets of paper to scribble down notes. He flicked through dossiers provided to him by Masumi, his home minister, pulling together information about Kidoite politicians in the Diet. His aim was to strong-arm their votes to support his ruling coalition, and he was determined to see them submit to his premiership over the nation.\n\nIn the chamber, his speeches and maneuvers had convinced the Kidoites that they shared the same interests as the conservatives - whereas, in truth, his words had drawn them out to vote for conservative bills and efforts. Manipulation of the truth, Ikeda thought as he chuckled to himself, was the key to success in fooling his allies to fight his battles for him."
 japikeda.62.a:0 "The carrot and the stick"
 japikeda.63.t:0 "Feeding the Hounds"
 japikeda.63.d:0 "The manipulation of the Kidoites can not continue without making sacrifices,\" Ichiro noted to Ikeda, who was growing weary of his allies' attention in the Diet. Indeed, the Kidoites were experts; they were arguably the brightest in the field of political bargaining, and they would make it known when they were not satisfied with a good deal. Ikeda looked over to Ichiro and nodded quietly, admitting concessions had to be made if this alliance was to continue to bolster the Prime Minister's standing in the Diet. To lose their support would potentially make them enemies of the conservatives, threatening the integrity of the Taisei Yokusankai, and the position of the Prime Minister himself."
 japikeda.63.a:0 "Our government can accomplish its goals"
 japikeda.64.t:0 "Remembering the Genro"
 japikeda.64.d:0 "Sat in a relaxed and luxurious private bar overlooking the Tokyo skyline, and in the presence of various celebrities and aristocrats from throughout the empire, Kido and Ikeda lazily reclined in soft chairs whilst sipping on expensive champagne imported from Europe. They had rested there and discussed rather amicably from the late afternoon and as the sun set, they continued to chatter into the night about their positions in the Diet and in the service of the nation.\n\nIkeda, after putting his glass to the side of his chair, spoke eloquently of his duty to uphold the legacy of the last Genros, the 'founding fathers' of modern Japan. He expressed his admiration for the politicians and prime ministers of the Meiji and Taisho Eras, hoping he could emulate the same masterful leadership and successes in the reign of the current Emperor. Kido raised his glass and took a gulp of champagne, seconding Ikeda's wishes but remaining notably silent and withdrawn from the ramblings. The Prime Minister looked over to Kido and nodded slowly, pondering if his actions in the Diet were worthy of the Genro, and if he would be satisfied with the legacy he has written for himself so far."
 japikeda.64.a:0 "Can we make a man out of memory?"
 japikeda.65.t:0 "The Grey Eminence's Plot"
 japikeda.65.d:0 "The latest drives of Kido in the Diet and with the conservative's support has been directed towards suspicion of corruption and conspiracy from leading Technocrats in the Diet. Accusing them of siphoning funds to private accounts, abusing the powers of their office, and maliciously threatening the integrity of the Taisei Yokusankai, Kido has railed against the technocratic faction's dealings in the political affairs across the empire.\n\nLeading members of the Technocrats such as Okinori Kaya and Nobusuke Kishi, as well as other members of the faction, have been railed against in the Diet with these treasonous accusations, and much suspicion is raised around their dealings in the affairs of the country. Although much of Kido's words are not backed by evidence, his bold claims bring defamation nonetheless as the word 'Scandal' is printed on nationwide press."
 japikeda.65.a:0 "Perhaps some fellows in the Board of Audit can investigate?"
 japikeda.66.t:0 "Differing Reports"
 japikeda.66.d:0 "Ikeda flipped through the Board of Audit's recent report over Kido's claims of corruption in the Diet. It was the Cabinet's job, after all, to review their files before being sent to the Imperial Diet as a whole. Ichiro and Masumi both had their own copies, and it did not take long before the Deputy Prime Minister spoke of a discrepancy.\n\n\"Prime Minister, we must be weary of Kido's outrageous claims in the Diet; with every word he speaks, he creates enemies for himself and for us, by association. I am not here to tell you if you should ask him to shut his loud mouth or not, but we cannot afford to let him go unchecked!\"\n\n\"Sir, although Mr. Masumi has a point, I think there's a hidden audit in these. Some reports mention an investigation into one of Kaya's supporters, rather unprompted. It's something we should really look into, if Kido is willing to scream for hours about these accusations.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister, heeding the advice of his colleagues, sat behind his desk scratching his chin. He exhaled a deep sigh, before grasping a handful of more reports and dismissing the two men. As they bowed and exited his office, Ikeda scoured through the papers over and over, intensely brushing the forms for mistakes to save him from dealing with a potential scandal in the Diet."
 japikeda.66.a:0 "Check to see if they lead anywhere"
 japikeda.67.t:0 "On Their Tails"
 japikeda.67.d:0 "Masumi returned to the Prime Minister a few days later with a final and conclusive report on the investigation into Kido's claims; the audit was correct, Kaya's men had nothing of noteworthy status to incriminate them in crimes of corruption or fraud. Ikeda, flicking through the reports, felt a washing wave of relief prickle over his body, as he did not have to deal with a case of corruption in the Technocrats.\n\nAs the hunt for Kido's criminals had ended, Ikeda had taken the time to pen a speech to address possible corruption among his opponents in the Diet across all factions of the Taisei Yokusankai. The Prime Minister had noted fears surrounding Kaya and Kishi's investigations had caused enough of a ruckus to whip them in line in attempt to quell suspicion; threats to investigate many others may subordinate them to his authority too. It was a risky move, but Ikeda was willing to hedge his bets to win over the fear and respect of his adversaries."
 japikeda.67.a:0 "Sometimes a threat is more powerful than the act itself"
 japikeda.68.t:0 "A Pure Diet"
 japikeda.68.d:0 "After the Prime Minister spoke about the dangers of corrupt groups in government, and declared a number of proposals to expand the Board of Audit, the mood in the Diet had changed significantly. Even if there was no illegal and dangerous behavior at all, Ikeda had gotten exactly what he had wanted from his speech - a greater sense of authority built on top of the fear and respect of his allies and adversaries.\n\nWith the confidence of the Technocrats reigned in, they largely stand, albeit reluctantly, in line with the Prime Minister's proposals for bills and legislation. Kaya and Kishi, bitter as ever, watch his every move, but Ikeda can only smile and chuckle as he sits in one of the most powerful seats in the world as Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan."

 japikeda.100.d:0 "Nobosuke Kishi is intimately familiar with the workings of secret police forces.\n\nAfter all, his iron-fisted rule over Manchuria could not have been maintained without one. And when stripped down to their bare essentials, he sees little difference between the Tokko and the Yakuza gangsters he recruited to keep the Chinese in line. Both have their formalities--rank structures, wages, specialties in various fields--but in the end, the function of both had to do only with power.\n\nWhich is why he's not as surprised as one might expect when the Tokko officers kick down his door.\n\nOf course, that's not to say that he's not furious. As the cuffs are slapped on his wrists, he gives the \"thought police\" a glare he perfected for use on Chinese laborers and peasants. It's a look that conveys to the recipient that Kishi thinks they're the lowest of the low--he looks at them like they're something he scraped off his boot.\n\n\"Does Ikeda really think this will stop me?\" he snarls at the Tokko.\n\nBut they don't reply. In fact, they don't react at all. Kishi is not in Manchukuo anymore, where his word was law and his writ ran unchallenged. The wheel of history has turned, and for once in his life he has found himself at the bottom of it.\n\nPower is a fickle thing. And Kishi is about to be taught that lesson by the cold walls of a prison cell."

One by one, the enemies on Ikeda and Hayotama's list awake to the agents of the secret police bursting into their homes. Some try to fight, and are quickly subdued. Others rant and rave at their captors. Still others just stare in mute confusion even as their wrists are shackled.\n\nBut not a single one escapes.\n\nThrough decades of experience, the Tokkō has become brutally effective at suppressing enemies of the state. It is a matter of no great concern to them that they are arresting the highest-profile opponents of a particular Diet faction. They simply know that they are bringing in men suspected of crimes against the state and Imperial Crown, and that is more than enough for them to carry out their mission with ruthless efficiency.\n\nIt is the culmination of Ikeda's plan for his political foes, and it goes off without a hitch.\n\nThe Thought Police are on the march."

 japikeda.150.d:0 "After months of deliberation for a Pan-Asian infrastructure plan, two bills present themselves on Prime Minister Ikeda's desk. A month ago, he had presented the idea to the Diet. The Technocrats, as usual, scoffed at the idea. The conservatives and reformists, however, show more enthusiasm for the plan.\n\nThe reformists' Yasuhiro Nakasone approached the Prime Minister and offered to provide an alternative plan that would comprehensively improve infrastructure in key sections of the Sphere. Not to be outdone, Satou went to the Prime Minister with his own deal: a slower rate of growth to compensate for a reduction in governmental expenses. The Prime Minister ordered them to write proposals.\n\nHere they are today. Taking a brief glance at the schemes, Ikeda can tell the advantages and drawbacks of each. A comprehensive improvement, as suggested by the reformists, would be expensive, but a sure-fire way to ensure that the Pan-Asian Infrastructure goes off without a hitch. A slow-burn modernization would ensure a reduction in cost, but it may mean that the government would be unable to fulfill its promises.\n\nWhat shall he do?"

 japikeda.151.d:0 "It goes on without saying that China is a major part of the Sphere's economy. As the breadbasket of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, its economic outreach and influence are immense. However, as time proceeds onward, the Chinese modernization efforts have brought an interest in government for the subsidization of Chinese companies, to ensure closer cooperation between Chinese and Japanese corporate entities. The Technocrats make fun of the idea, but the reformists and conservatives have come forward with their own suggestions for the subsidy.\n\nThe reformists have suggested far-reaching economic subsidies that would affect nearly every aspect of the Chinese economy, a proposal that is as logical as it is expensive. As an alternative to that, the conservatives have brought forward a plan or subsidies that are more focused on the struggling and newly-growing sections of the Chinese economy. This comes with the caveat of possibly not matching the growth of the reformist plan - while costing significantly less.\n\nNow, these two suggestions present themselves on the Prime Minister's desk. Which shall he sign?"

Yet, Hokkaido has garnered the reputation of being backwater and poor, despite its mineral riches. Easily the least urban of the Japanese home islands, the governments before the Ikeda cabinet had paid it relatively little attention. The population was small enough to not warrant any major infrastructure projects.\n\nUntil now, at least. With the Diet's approval, the Ikeda government has set forth public works projects on the island. In the olden days, the people of Hokkaido cannot complain that the trains did not run on time - because they did not have many train tracks to begin with. The Ikeda government's investment in the island has ensured that the people there have speedy access to cheap, far-reaching transport.\n\nAlready the opinion polls conducted on Hokkaido have shown soaring approval for Prime Minister Ikeda. Goods and services should travel from north to south a little easier, now."

Plans to integrate Taiwan as a core island of the country have started since the early 20th century, with the intensification of the Japanization efforts there. However, it was always sidelined in favor of projects that focused on the main islands. The Ikeda administration aims to rectify the inequality and bind Taiwan closer to the heart of the Empire. Starting from its infrastructure.\n\nAside from the mountainous region in its east, the flatlands of its west can use improvement. Roads, trains-lines, as well as urban infrastructure, are included in the public works budgets that the Ikeda government has planned since its switch to favoring the civilian sector instead of the military. Although the army and the navy might grumble, there can be no doubt that Taiwan is an integral part of the defense of the home islands.\n\nPerhaps one day, far in the future, Taiwan would join the home islands as an equal."

Now, far from being a threat, Kore has become the first line of defense against a resurgent Russia, or perhaps a traitorous China. Its deposits of coals and iron ferried every day across the Sea of Japan and to the north into Manchuria, are the engines of the Sphere's industrial sector.\n\nBinding Korea closer to Japan would necessitate the construction of urban and remote infrastructures. Thankfully, the Ikeda government has allocated budgets for the construction of these infrastructural constructions. Korea is Japanese, and not even the military's grouchiest brass can complain otherwise. The smoother flow of goods and services from the main islands to Korea would benefit the civilian economy tremendously.\n\nKorea is Japanese, and we shall treat it like the scion of our nation."

Perhaps we can work on our contracts with Mitsubishi to hire some extra firms.\"\n\nIkeda smiled a little as Satou-san listed off all the benefits it would bring to Japan's businesses, still hit hard from the Yasuda crash. \"Do you know if we could make this more supportive of businesses? Perhaps providing lower interest on the loans we're giving from the collapse.\"\n\nSatou's face soured, but he informed the Prime Minister it would fit in.

Japanese television broadcasted at various stations the unbelievable speed of the rail line, with some skeptical citizens calling it little more than advanced film editing.\n\nFollowing the arrival of the first group of passengers, Prime Minister Ikeda promised the Japanese public that this system would be expanded across the islands, to transport people and goods faster and cheaper than ever before. The pocketed cities between the mountains could be reached to and back in less than a day; and soon Korea and Taiwan would have their own rail system.

Nothing but damned convoy escorts across Asia.\n\nThe Captain could see the disappointment in his men, day after day of following the shipping lanes from Fukokua to Shanghai, then a brief stop in Singapore and Dhaka.

Faint shouting formed an undercurrent to the din. Takeyama was sweating under his uniform, enough to drench his shirt slightly.\n\nPrime Minister Ikeda's government had approved funding for more military infrastructures. The whistle of a train engine brought Takeyama's attention to the brand-new railway leading to his posting. He regarded it favorably: the government was acting in patriotic interests.

Thus they chose him to stand on this airfield, a lone government minister among a mob of journalists and shutter-snaps of cameras. The day was hot.

Steadily maneuvering itself out of a hangar, it positioned itself to at the center of the runway, preparing to take off.

Cameras hungrily snapped its hull and wings, and pens scribbled hypothetical specifications for its engines. Masumi was nervous. He knew that the Prime Minister had tried to dissuade the Zaibatsus from publicly testing their prototypes, but these concerns fell of deaf ears.\n\nThe plane roared and accelerated. It became faster and faster until it was only a blur, and seemed ready to take off into the air when the engines suddenly died. It barely stopped at the edge of the runway.

A horrible place, full of screeching welders and roaring factory engines: where the Japanese workers wore ear protection, but such expenses were spared the Koreans. Sometimes he could hear his ears ringing - even after he had gone on home, where everything was quiet. It had gotten worse as of late.
