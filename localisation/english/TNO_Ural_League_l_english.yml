 POLITICS_JANIS_MENDRIKS_DESC: "야니스 멘드릭스는 라트비아 사제로 몇 년 전 선교 행위를 하다 소비에트 연방에 의해 보르쿠타 굴라크로 보내졌습니다. 연방이 붕괴되자 죄수들은 간수에 저항해 폭동을 일으켰습니다. 이 사제의 개입이 없었다면 폭동은 끔찍한 유혈사태로 끝났을지도 모릅니다. 멘드릭스의 개입은 죄수와 그에 동조하는 간수들이 연합해 우랄 연맹의 시작을 불러왔습니다.\n\n보르쿠타는 너무 거친 곳이기에 멘드릭스는 구원을 찾아 남쪽으로 떠나자고 설득했습니다. 이 출애굽기는 힘든 여정이었습니다. 수백명의 전 죄수의 간수들이 여정 도중 목숨을 잃었지만 멘드릭스 신부는 신앙을 잃지 않은 것 같았습니다. 그는 행군을 시작하기 전 격려 연설을 하기도 했습니다. 이 어두운 순간에 그의 말은 많은 사람들에게 유일한 빛이 되었습니다. 아마 산맥에 정착하기 전까지 모든 이들이 신앙을 가지고 있었을 것입니다. 이 세상과는 떨어진 곳에서 늙은 사제는 라트비아에서 발휘했던 능력을 다시 보일 것을 요청받았습니다. 그는 가톨릭 사제였고 따르는 이 대부분은 정교회 신자였습니다. 하지만 그의 말이 그들을 굳건하게 만들고 새 삶을 꾸리도록 했기에 그런건 별로 중요하게 여겨지지 않았습니다.\n\n이후 우랄 연맹을 움직인 것은 그런 매력과 결심이었습니다. 그의 달래는 듯한 리더쉽 접근 방식은 큰 도움이 되었습니다. 연맹 지휘관 대부분이 그의 지도와 위로가 필요할 때 그를 찾았습니다. 이렇게 제일 어두운 순간에도 그의 결정이 실패했던 일은 드물었고 그가 약속을 어기는 일도 없었습니다. 야니스 멘드릭스는 확실히 신을 섬기는 이입니다. 하지만 이 끔찍한 시대에 그는 평범한 군인들의 사람이기도 합니다."

We fight against all odds to defend our home and our people.\n\nWhile we have maintained our position of strength, our lands are being flooded by a tide of refugees, threatening to destabilize us.\n\nWith enemies on all sides, we must resolve this crisis quickly, or risk losing all that we have worked so hard for."

 URL_militias_approach_the_survivalists_desc: "The Ural Guard make men of children, but those who go even further into the cold are made into animals. These "survivalists" are masters of their surroundings, capable of travelling great distances while living off the land. These men are incredibly valuable to our fledgling militia.\n\nLet us recruit them into our ranks and have them form the core of one of our initial divisions."

 URL_militias_experimental_cadet_squads_desc: "The Ural Guard make up the best of the best of our forces and they are seen as an inspiration to many militiamen. Why not use them to train the militia?\n\nThey have the talent to whip our militia into a true fighting force and give Dirlewangler a run for his money. We will give the Guard whatever they need to train them."

 URL_militias_expand_the_program_desc: "With the Guard having trained our militia to fight with their tactics, the time has come to ramp up the program. Those who were trained by the Guard will become drill sergeants and instructors for the newer recruits.\n\nThis will help increase our efficiency and fighting strength. At this stage, the militia will be able to stand toe to toe with any enemy in the Southern Urals."
 
 URL_militias_many_helping_hands: "많은 도움의 손길"
 URL_militias_many_helping_hands_desc: "No one fights alone, and every Guard deployed to the frontlines can only perform at peak effectiveness when he is supported by numerous others in assistant roles in both combat and support positions.\n\nThe mortar, heavy machine gun, and anti-tank teams as well as nurses, radio operators, construction workers, mechanics, drivers and other support personnel are essential for the functioning of our forces.\n\nThese positions could easily be staffed by the recently trained Militia members by giving them valuable combat experience with lower risks than our riflemen, while freeing up the more experienced Guards to conduct more dangerous missions on the frontlines."
 
 URL_militias_shuffle_the_veterans: "베테랑 섞어넣기"
 URL_militias_shuffle_the_veterans_desc: "The training regime imposed on the militias have turned a score of weak and undisciplined refugees into a cohesive fighting unit capable of holding the line against our most vile enemies. But training can only go so far, as there are skills only experience can teach.\n\nTo better prepare our militiamen, a program shall be devised to embed our most experienced guards into the militia command structure for limited periods of time and rotate them through different militia units, teaching the recruits valuable experience and preventing them from making dangerous mistakes while in combat.\n\nThe rotation system will improve the recruit training experience by dividing the veterans into three groups, one fighting on the front, one training the militia, and a third one enjoying their well-earned rest so they can return fresh to duty."
 
 URL_militias_familial_connections: "Familial Connections"
 URL_militias_familial_connections_desc: "No man is an island. Every one of our soldiers is someone's son, father, husband, brother, cousin, friend. While most of these family members and refugees are not apt to perform at combat roles they should not be discharged as idle mouths to feed and could be proven useful assets to our Guard.\n\nEvery man we keep in the frontlines needs countless others in the rearguard as support staff, cooks, logistics, uniform sewing, equipment repair and much more.\n\nAll these roles could be easily fulfilled by the family members and acquaintances of our men provided with only a small amount of training and orientation. This way we can free up valuable trained and experienced Guards from support roles and deploy them straight into combat duty where they are needed the most."
 
 URL_militias_reach_out_further: "더 멀리"
 URL_militias_reach_out_further_desc: "The results of the first class of Ural Militia recruits trained by our instructors was a very pleasant surprise, even for the most skeptical. The first few days were hectic, as we prepped their minds for war, but after weeks of training, every recruit became an expert at looking for danger in the trees and on the ground, and to respond with fire when they hear a rifle round.\n\nThese men all had some prior, albeit largely limited, combat experience, being formerly either in the Red Army or some village militia. Yet the astonishing success of the training methods convinced the instructors to cast a wider net. Now, the criteria to join the Ural Guard does not depend on the recruit's prior experience, but on his toughness to march through the immense forests and snowy plains of Russia and on his willingness to, when the fires of war come, lay down their lives for this land.\n\nNew recruits from all walks of life will now be called up for our second training class."
 
 URL_militias_caravan_experience: "Caravan Experience"
 URL_militias_caravan_experience_desc: "Even after the Soviet Union collapsed under German Arms, and with most of its territory being under the threat of the terror bombings committed by the Luftwaffe, trade still flourished.\n\nDozens of kolkhozes, villages, and even small cities kept producing, farmers kept working their fields and workers in their factories. Every kind of good was in high demand: from essentials such as food and medicine, to alcohol and pornography to ease the pain of living.\n\nFacing bandits, animals, warlords, the weather and the ever-present threat of the Luftwaffe, these groups of the few souls brave enough to handle trade are called caravans.\n\nThey could prove themselves to be a valuable addition to our forces, for their ability to keep distant posts supplied, even under overwhelming adversity, is second to none. A comprehensible logistics plan based on the caravans will ensure our troops in the frontlines don't lack anything."
 
 URL_militias_hunters_and_trappers: "포수와 덫사냥꾼"
 URL_militias_hunters_and_trappers_desc: "The wilderness does not belong to the strongest, but to the sober, skilled, resilient and above all, to those who possess the strongest will.\n\nIn these dire times, countless men are taking to the woods to guarantee their families survival. Some did so out of necessity recently, while others have been doing it for generations. When informed of the grave danger they are now facing, these hard men will surely take up arms along our Guard to ensure their survival.\n\nHunters and trappers will prove themselves to be a welcome addition to our efforts. With their knowledge of the hinterlands and capacity to operate autonomously for long periods they could be the perfect fit for long range scouts. They could even be grouped with some of our more experienced guards to sow immense terror in the enemy's deep rearguard, destroying their most important targets, laying traps for their troops and then vanishing through the woods without a trace."
 
 URL_militias_a_paying_job: "돈 받는 일"
 URL_militias_a_paying_job_desc: "Life in Russia is uncertain. In the hectic years following the German Invasion, all that resembled order and stability came crumbling down under the terror of the Luftwaffe.\n\nFarms were burned, stores looted, factories destroyed, and irrigation systems bombed. Countless Russian men were left out of a home, a job, and a neighborhood, left to roam the countryside, doing whatever it took to survive. Though a great number of these men have turned to banditry, most of them survived on the basis of odd jobs and manual labor.\n\nThese masses of unemployed and hopeless men would be willing to enlist in the Ural Guard if offered steady employment with salaries good enough to feed their families. This coupled with a coherent pay scale and the opportunity for promotions, will encourage them to enlist for a longer period."
 
 URL_militias_a_comfortable_barracks: "안락한 막사"
 URL_militias_a_comfortable_barracks_desc: "Homelessness is a constant in the lives of most Russians following the German Invasion. The ruthless attempt by the Invader to keep the Motherland from rising again with daily terror bombings targeting civilian buildings has destroyed the homes of millions of Russians, often with their loved ones still inside.\n\nThe destruction wrought by the enemy has forced these souls to roam the backwoods in search of shelter from the terrors of the Russian wastes. In many areas, the horrors of banditry were not so different from the horrors of war, and hundreds of these wanderers of the wastes arrive daily looking for the protection of the Guard.\n\nMany of these refugees are willing to enlist in our militias in exchange for the chance of owning a home. Perhaps the militia's training program could be enhanced with a section dedicated to building the houses the recruits will live in."
 
 URL_militias_good_friends: "좋은 친구들"
 URL_militias_good_friends_desc: "For decades, Russians have been used to sleeping with one eye open. From the horrors of the First Great War, the chaos of the Revolution, to the utter abomination that was the occupation of our soil by the German Invader, you never knew who you could trust.\n\nThe Ural Guard is a place where a Russian can find trust, one can sleep without worrying about being robbed, turn his back without worrying about being killed, and rely on his fellow man without being betrayed.\n\nThe Guard is a tight knit family made of men and women who have lost theirs. The Guard doesn't care for medals, honors or fame. The Guard is a family, and they want only to protect their land and people. Whenever a Guard falls in battle, his comrades feel like they've lost a dear brother."
 
 URL_militias_healthy_rations: "몸에 좋은 식단"
 URL_militias_healthy_rations_desc: "A pillar of gray smoke rises from the militia's encampment, touching the blue sky. Upon approaching the mess tent, easily located on account of the crowd gathering around it, one could smell the reason many Russians are joining the Ural Guard: the taste of a warm plate of stroganoff and onions.\n\nA good meal is in high demand across Russia, with famine being commonplace the Motherland over and many have resorted to subsisting on canned food. Some of these tinned monstrosities are more than 10 years past their expiration date.\n\nThrough local farmers who have agreed to cede some of their livestock and with the labor the refugees have provided in the orchards and gardens, the Ural Guard will be able to provide their men with tasty and healthy food.\n\nBesides supplying the soldiers with the necessary nutrients for long periods of time, quality rations could cause a considerable boost to morale and attract dozens of refugees to the militia recruiting stations."
 
 URL_militias_and_a_purpose_in_life: "그리고 삶의 목적"
 URL_militias_and_a_purpose_in_life_desc: "Every day numerous fighting-age men arrive on our doorstep looking for protection, fleeing from the horrors that stalk the hinterland.\n\nNow roaming our lands, most of them without friends, family or loved ones, and above all, without a place in the world. These men are young and courageous, welcome additions to the Militia.\n\nThose nobodies, men living a barren life, without anyone caring for them, tired of not doing anything, will find their purpose in a life on patrol. Joined by thirteen other comrades, and led by an experienced corporal, they will march towards the frontlines to fight against the loathsome foe."
 
 URL_militias_stand_for_something_greater: "더 좋은 것을 위해"
 URL_militias_stand_for_something_greater_desc: "There is a cry coming in from the South, don't you hear it? It Is the cry of the Manic Dirlewanger, he cries for the profits of his war band, and is arming for an unforeseen Raid. His Brigade is ready for aggression, against the peaceful villages of the Urals.\n\nNo more we are defenseless farmers, now the New Ural guard is formed, reinforced by the people and fighting side by side with the Sons of Vorkuta. Along we have those Heroes all our land will be defended, and anywhere that is peaceful will be kept that way.\n\nWorkers, peasants, grasp your weapons, wear the uniform, we have a sacred duty. So that before the animals commit their crimes, the people in the Militias will annihilate the Fascist Bandit Army, and set every of them ablaze!‎"
 
 URL_orenburg_ask_for_a_meeting: "Ask for a Meeting"
 URL_orenburg_ask_for_a_meeting_desc: "Our strong sense of duty towards protecting the common and downtrodden folk of the chaotic Urals has extended towards the Communes of Orenburg; a region that prioritizes freedom over efficiency to an extreme degree.\n\nHowever, our elite forces are only able to hunt down so many of Dirlewanger's bandits, defend locations from only so many looters, and prepare only so much for the darker forces of Lysenko. We need to organize a meeting with legitimate representatives from the communes, in such a fashion that the suspicious elements in their council can rest assured that our priority is saving lives. The few local militias they have formed will not be able to secure even the villages in an effective manner, let alone Orenburg itself.\n\nTo survive, the communes will have to accept and swallow the harsh medicine of limited centralization for an effective and well-trained military corps.\n\nIf the meeting occurs at all, we will propose that we pool our resources with Orenburg to build an effective defense force."
 
 URL_orenburg_conversations_with_the_council: "Conversations with the Council"
 URL_orenburg_conversations_with_the_council_desc: "It seems that the Orenburg communes have finally allowed us to send an official envoy to their fiercely democratic council to enlighten the anarchists about the grave dangers that they will likely have to face in the near future.\n\nSome of our best officers have created certain prompts from which our envoy shall convey our analysis of the risks and solutions we have identified regarding their situation. The necessity to protect from raids conducted by the relatively well-disciplined SS bandits is a measure that will have to be considered and implemented to deal with the more clearly identifiable threat in the short term.\n\nA darker and more mysterious danger is also looming on the horizon for the communes: the Chekist army of Magnitogorsk seems to have also shifted its keen eyes and ominous attention to the peaceful region.\n\nThe threat posed by the Black Mountain is not easily quantified, but it's necessary to prepare pre-emptive defences nonetheless. Hopefully, our delegate will reach through to the stubborn council and an effective plan can be formulated with our help."
 
 URL_orenburg_speak_with_burba: "Speak with Burba"
 URL_orenburg_speak_with_burba_desc: "Two men have proven themselves able enough to see the need for a more centralized Orenburg communal system, one capable of weathering the storm of foreign invasion. However, their methods of achieving this security are vastly different, which has led us to support the industrious Aleksander Burba over the ineffectual communist, Georgy Malenkov.\n\nIf Malenkov were able to assert prerogative over the council, he may try to halt any negotiations with us, as informants have made us aware that he is hostile to what he perceives as a foreign power exerting influence over Orenburg.\n\nBurba, therefore, is our man. The technocrat has already been proven capable of transforming Orenburg into the city it is today after the fall of the USSR. With his focus on industrializing and centralizing the communes further, we can be sure that he will be capable of protecting the Orenburg region. Offering to support Burba's reforms could go a long way towards strengthening the defense of the Southern Urals."
 
 URL_orenburg_our_common_interests: "Our Common Interests"
 URL_orenburg_our_common_interests_desc: "In this barren, bombed wasteland we call our home, we have met fellow survivors with similar desires and goals; the desire to live in the Southern Urals, enjoying splendid peace and prosperity. Our methods of working towards our vision of utopia may be wildly different, but if we can manage to unite on the ends, the means just become a few conversations away from being accepted by both parties.\n\nOur delegates to the Orenburg council have come back speaking highly of the moral grounds on which the communes are built. Our representatives believe that they have the capability of transforming the region for the better, and help to elevate the pain and suffering of the region. The council by and large supports our motives, praising our tenacity in hunting down dangerous criminals and protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals from oppression.\n\nIt seems our two paths are converging towards a better future for the Urals, our common interests unite us, and our unity shall lift us both."
 
 URL_orenburg_watch_their_troops: "Watch Their Troops"
 URL_orenburg_watch_their_troops_desc: "Concerns over our proposals to help the Orenburg Communes are not entirely uncommon, and have been justified upon the grounds that the settlements have their own militias to fend off any aggressors, and therefore don't need our objectively more disciplined troops. Some within the communes fear our influence and believe that the militias who are protecting their lands are more effective and less politically dangerous.\n\nTo bypass this hiccup, we will launch clandestine, yet non-aggressive, operations into their territory to see what their defensive capabilities are, or whether they even notice our movements at all. Gathering this intel should be a simple job for the Guards. With this information, we can enter negotiations with Orenburg from a position of strength and possibly even silence opposition to cooperating with us.\n\nSome of our officers have stated the strategic significance of such a move, as it can help train our troops for more missions of this kind if we are to challenge the mysterious Lysenko or scout out Dirlewanger's bandits."
 
 URL_orenburg_raise_the_issue: "Raise the Issue"
 URL_orenburg_raise_the_issue_desc: "In our evaluation of the situation in Orenburg, especially regarding military and security matters, we have found the previous arguments to support opposition of our limited intervention rather lacking. We, however, cannot simply state how pathetic the current defensive capabilities are without raising some worrying political concerns with the council and losing the diplomatic ground we have painstakingly built.\n\nIt has been decided that we should give our evaluation a mild makeover, propping up certain weak elements whilst not shifting away from our argument that the communes require our support. One of our officers had the genius idea to implement into the report to the council the idea that Orenburg had built a good military foundation, but with our help, could truly reach their own potential.\n\nIn this way we may be able to overcome arguments that warn of our influence and finally begin to help the communes help themselves."
 
 URL_orenburg_look_at_us_when_we_speak: "Look At Us When We Speak"
 URL_orenburg_look_at_us_when_we_speak_desc: "The perpetual, ceaseless squabbling in the Orenburg council is beginning to seriously hinder progress in our mission to secure the communes against outside threats to their prosperity and survival.\n\nWe have the evidence, from clandestine operations, that we can show to the anarchists about their woefully unprepared defences against any real threat opposed to their existence. Yet despite our warnings, the slow, unrelenting arrow of time is marching onwards towards their doom, with each tick getting closer to the event horizon, whilst the council is still fighting amongst itself.\n\nUnless they begin to take the threats seriously and finally listen to our vital advice, we may have to force them to pay attention. This would certainly go against our moral code, but in this age of noble losers and dirty winners we might have to change some of our means to reach an end that will protect the region."

 URL_orenburg_we_need_to_stand_together_desc: "Our tireless scouts have finally picked up the dreaded warning signs we had hoped would never come. After checking and double-checking directions and nearby targets, we have confirmed that the pillaging war host of the Black Bandit is finally marching to devour Orenburg. It is likely the SS renegades will smash through our defense in the onset or outset of the rape of the communes.\n\nNeither we, nor the woefully unprepared anarchists, could hope to withstand Dirlewanger's forces on our own. The aggressive fighting spirit and sheer brutality of the SS will overwhelm our limited forces if we decide to stand on our own. We need Orenburg, with its manpower and wealth, just as they need us for our military expertise.\n\nA deal could be forged between our two factions, a bond of protection that might just secure our future."

The plunder and rape of our lands is all but guaranteed if drastic measures are not taken now. Dirlewanger's horde will likely crush both of our individual armies, despite our troops' quality and Orenburg's wealth. The only way we will stand a chance at survival is through uniting our forces, still under two banners, but with a single purpose.\n\nIf the communes do not accept our offer now, we will have to make our last stand alone."

 URL_orenburg_send_them_instructors_desc: "The communes have agreed that in the face of the ever-growing threat to their wellbeing and survival that they need our military support to grant them security.\n\nWe should therefore make best use of both our better military, and tactical and operational knowledge, whilst also utilizing Orenburg's larger manpower pool by sending the anarchists some of our more seasoned officers.\n\nOrenburg will likely also begin raising more troops now that they have finally realized what is at stake. By training their current troops and officers, we can influence the direction of the whole communal army towards a standard that we deem acceptable."

With this comes a certain focus in a specific area of industry as our goals also are heavily militaristic: firearms.\n\nOrenburg is a little different, however: their military stockpile is rather pathetic compared to ours. Not really a massive surprise considering their lack of centralized direction and economic priorities. Yet with the dangers that settling in this region poses, a military mindset is strongly required, one like ours.

Starinov is a mercenary, offering his services to the highest bidder, training villages to fend for themselves in return for food and shelter. Now, as he enters his sixth decade, the colonel has decided that his nomadic existence must finally end.\n\nStarinov has a detailed plan to transform our already elite Guard into a force unrivalled in the post-Soviet hellscape. They will be able to scavenge and fight well away from a supply train and on any kind of battlefield. The Children of Vorkuta will soon become the most powerful fighting force in all of Russia capable of easily crushing Lysenko's NKVD and Dirlewanger's SS."

A significant portion of our arsenal is composed of hopelessly outdated firearms, like old Russian rifles and submachine guns made by local gunsmiths, nicknamed "Bastard Guns" by our men.\n\nThis reinforces the importance of daily maintenance and intensive care our Guards must give to their weapons.

After this rough awakening, they have their packs filled with rocks and be taken on an uphill run through the Ural Mountains lasting all day. After returning from this exhausting circuit and withstanding cold, hunger and sleep deprivation, every rookie will be taken alone to a room and, at the call of Starinov, be attacked by a dozen veteran Guards. This impossible fight is made to test the cadet's will, to see if he is capable of fighting like a demon even when he is sure that he will lose.\n\nThe few who pass this test will be given a warm meal and a comfortable bed to rest before they are taken advanced up to combat training, while those who fail are sent home."

Our Guards will learn to use every means of transport available, how to give them proper care and the role they could play on the battlefield.\n\nNot every situation calls for automobiles, so our Guards will train extensively in movement by foot. Drawing on the experience of the Long March from the Vorkutlag through the war-torn Russian hinterland, at the end of their training program the recruits will have to conduct a fully equipped 150 miles march through the Russian woods, nicknamed the March of Death.

It is necessary that our Guard is accustomed to living in such weather. It is to be expected to take casualties from enemy fire, but to lose good men from camping in the snow is unacceptable.\n\nOur Guards will be subject to a harsh training regime ministered by the rough survivalists used to living off the land in the Urals so our men will be toughened against even the roughest weather.

Starinov was pleased: not a single trainee had perished during the March of Death, a testament to how his brutal training methods had hardened their bodies and minds.\n\nAfter their commander inspected them, the soldiers were ordered to kneel on the ground. Father Jānis Mendriks, the Ural League's leader himself, had come forward and looked into every recruit's eyes and led them in saying their vows: "In the name of God, I will stand by the League and will give my life to protect Russia, my comrades and the innocent."

With limited resources and manpower and threatened by two ruthless and larger foes, devising ways to cripple our enemies without risking our lives is a must.\n\nVarious methods have been studied by our field commanders to cripple our enemies in both the NKVD and the SS bandits with minimum effort. Among these proposals are creating raider bands to attack the enemy as they sleep, precise mortar strikes at their ammunitions caches to leave them defenseless, sending false information over the enemy's radio to break their cohesion, sending commando groups dressed like the enemy to sow terror behind their lines and even more exotic ideas like disguising one of our garrisons as a trading caravan to lure the enemy into an ambush."

They will be made into men who can wield weapons with ease and who are weapons themselves.\n\nThe Children of Vorkuta and the few men strong enough to pass through Ilya Starinov's ruthless training methods have proven their worth as warriors, the Ural League cannot accept substitutes.

Formed out of a most unlikely union of political prisoners and the guards who once oppressed them, we have struggled endlessly to survive in the ashes of the Motherland. When the snow threatened to consume us, we left the lands that were once our prison and embarked on a grueling march to seek refuge in the south. We have lost so much and have seen all the darkness this new world has to offer, but in the end we made it to the lands we now call home.\n\nThough we have suffered far more than all our ancestors before us, we have never let the darkness corrupt our hearts. When we arrived beneath the slopes of the Ural mountains, we found all manner of survivors, wanderers, and innocents in need of protection from the dangers of the world. We became their shield, and soon more and more of them became drawn to the warm fires within our new fortresses. Over this last decade we have trained without rest, honing ourselves into a force of warriors pledged to defend those who cannot defend themselves.\n\nWe have recently come into contact with a loose collection of communes around Orenburg. They are a spirited but disorganized people, defenseless against the horrors of the wastes. Some of our soldiers have begun heading west to offer aid and support to their villages, though our men have not always been greeted warmly.\n\nThere are also worrying rumours coming from the east: villages ablaze, families disappearing in the night, and of Germans on the march once again. Whatever foul horrors lurk in the shadows, it falls to us to be a candle in this dark new world."

It is a founding principal of our alliance that we must shelter those who need it and defend those who are defenseless. In the past few months however, the trickle of those forced from their homes has become a stream, which is quickly becoming a flood. While those arriving from the South speak of an increase in the bandit activity we have been battling against for years, the refugees from the east bring stories of a new threat.\n\nIn hushed tones they whisper of entire villages vanishing in the night, the houses and fields abandoned, their former inhabitants lost to the world. Rumors are spreading that the Black Mountain, long abandoned and forgotten, is stirring again, the smog of its factories once more blackening Russia's skies. Some claim to have seen men wearing ghoulish suits and masks moving within the smoky haze, dragging their unsuspecting victims back to their mountaintop lair.\n\nAs these disturbing reports increase in both quantity and severity, our eastern scouts have reported that the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD has fortified the mountains around the old mining town of Magnitogorsk. The remnants of the division are apparently acting under the direction of Trofim Lysenko, a popular scientist in the pre-war Soviet Union. Observation of the division has revealed that they have reopened the mines and factories around the fabled Black Mountain, though their intentions are unknown as of now.\n\nThe connection between Lysenko's reappearance and these stories is impossible to miss. Our eastern scouts have already been ordered to continue their observation of the mountain to see what they can uncover. Additional guards have been recalled from their normal patrols to reinforce the rangers currently stationed in the east. For the moment it is unknown why Lysenko has reopened the mountains and abducted those that once lived there, but we will soon find out."

This loose assembly of German war criminals, Russian bandits, and Kazakh raiders has grown to be the largest army in the region, and their violent debauchery is almost single-handedly responsible for the refugee crisis that has put us in such a precarious situation. Even worse, should the bandits continue to grow in strength, they could soon be bold enough to mount a full attack on the League. We are strong in spirit but few in number, and are already struggling to defend our borders. Should Dirlewanger invade, it may be the end of everything we have worked so hard to build.\n\nIt has been decided that, with the Black Bandits representing the greatest threat to peace and stability in the area, what scant few men and resources we have available will be concentrated in the south to prepare for the coming war. It has also been recommended that the people of the Southern Urals under our protection be organized into militias to supplement our forces to help offset the numerical disparity between our enemies and ourselves. This has become a topic of fierce debate, as some commanders feel that without the militias, our defeat is inevitable, while others believe that creating them would be akin to using those we have sworn to protect as meat shields. Either way, time is running short. The bandit king is gathering his strength, and his lust for wealth and violence must be sated soon and it is well known that he is not a patient man."

On different frontline detachments, our supplies are on such a low level that Guards are sharing food, latrines, and even blankets with hopeless refugees to protect them from a cold death on the Hinterlands.\n\nThe scale of the refugee wave will soon cause a crisis in the League's territory.

Because of this, it has been decided that the people of the Urals must be called to action, and militias must be formed.\n\nWhile the militias will provide a much needed source of manpower to augment the small size of the standing guard, few of our generals are happy. Most of the people of these mountains have seen little combat, so it has been decided that the militias will only consist of those who have fought before, or who have talents and skills that would lend themselves to warfare. Even with this stipulation in place, our commanders are reluctant to send those who thought they had managed to escape war back onto the battlefield after living in peace for so long. For years the quiet, sheltered lives of the inhabitants of the Southern Urals have been a point of pride for us, proof of our effectiveness in defending our adopted home. Now the time has come where we must disturb the peace we have worked so hard to create, and must prepare those we have protected to be thrown back into danger once again.

Although this is all well and good, there is a growing fear among the council and the people of Orenburg in general that this current relationship is not enough to truly defend us from the various bandits and kidnappers that lurk in the Urals. Our Council is somewhat divided on the matter. Some fear that the League and its powerful military will bully us or try to take control of Orenburg should we allow them too much influence over our affairs. For this reason, many of the communes are at risk from bandit raids and the League are usually powerless to stop them.\n\nWhile we do maintain some militias, they are hardly an effective deterrent to outside threats and the bandits that already lurk within our lands, often arriving far after the attacks have ravaged our people. Some on the council have suggested that the current arrangement is defence enough against the raiders and that their presence is unavoidable. Others have pointed out that Dirlewanger's Brigade could easily slip past our defences and begin a series of raids that would end in our destruction. According to them, our only hope is with the Ural League, and that any fears of a takeover are ridiculous, stating that if they wanted to take control they would have done so already. They propose a simple meeting, in a location that would not upset too many of the council members and that it will focus on establishing a more official relationship, and nothing more just yet. This proposal has proved popular enough to receive a vote to be held later this day, should we not be interrupted by another inquiry as to a farmer's missing pigs..."

 URL.8.d: "The Ural Guard already holds the title of the toughest soldiers in Russia. Forged in the nightmare of the gulags, tempered in the chaos of the collapsing Soviet Union, and tested daily in the anarchy of the Southern Urals. We prove our worth and ability time and time again, and yet, soon we might not be enough. As the guardians of the mountains, we have faced long odds before, but this time it is different. Dirlewanger's Bandits are the largest and most sadistically violent group to have ever threatened the region, far surpassing any of the wannabe warlords and nomadic thugs that we have wrangled with before. The few soldiers that Lysenko does have are possibly the best equipped men in all of Russia, armed with newly made machine guns and armor piercing ammunition, while our men fight with hunting rifles and scavenged bullets. These two threats may prove to be the first and last enemies the Ural league cannot stop, unless something is done soon. It is with this reasoning that Colonel Ilya Starinov has presented his planned reforms for the Ural Guard.\n\nWhile many have advocated for the Guard's recruiting standards to be lowered, allowing more men in and increasing the size of the army we can wield, Starinov's plan calls for the exact opposite. He argues that the Guard has not gone far enough in cultivating its elite status, and must reform itself into what would be the most well-trained force in not only Russia, but the world. He calls for a new training regimen that would, in his words, "Ideally disqualify 70 to 85 percent of the trainees before completion". This training would include spending weeks in the wilderness surviving off of nothing more than what they can find, being drilled endlessly on conventional combat, guerilla combat, urban combat, close quarters combat, nighttime combat, and any other kind of combat that their instructors can think of. Put simply, they will be put through a training so difficult that those who come out on the other side will see real war as a relief."

A motley crew of men ranging from their early twenties to their late forties stand in loose formation as a man in a tattered uniform carrying a clipboard walks amongst them, asking each individual for the same three things: name, age, address. Once he has conducted this brief interview with each member of the crowd, he returns to the front and stares down at his clipboard, muttering under his breath.\n\n"Thirty one, thirty two, thirty three in total. That's actually more than I would expect from a village of this size. Well, everyone, given the circumstances, there is really no need for formalities. As I am sure you are all aware, the Ural League has sent out the call for the formation of militias to deal with the increase in bandit activity and the refugee crisis. All of you have the skills and experience we are looking for, and you have shown that you already possess the fearless and altruistic spirit of the Guard by volunteering to defend your homeland. Before we go any further, I should ask, how many of you have your own rifles?"\n\nAbout half of the crowd raise their hands, while a few others display the rifles they brought with them to the assembly. The census taker does a quick count and scribbles something down in his notes.\n\n"Good. Very good. Excellent in fact. Those of you that don't, don't worry. We'll take care of that as well as ammunition and uniforms once we get to Beloretsk. That is about all I have to say. Remember to have your belongings packed and your goodbyes said by 11:30. The convoy is leaving at noon and we won't be coming back for any stragglers, so you'll have to find your own way south. Once again, I applaud all of you for joining the militia.

This militia would be his chance to prove himself, and to show his worth as a man. It was an unpleasant surprise when he was told that a "survivalist" was being sent into town to help train the militia. As far as Feodor was concerned, his men knew everything they needed to, and some hillbilly from the wastelands would be more of a burden than anything else.\n\nWhen the man finally arrived, all of the militia men couldn't help but stare. His beard wasn't as long as they had joked it would be, but it wasn't short. What was most surprising about him was his age. None of the men dared ask, but there was no question that this man had seen Russia collapse not once, but twice.\n\n"I don't enjoy speaking, so you children should listen. I have been living off of the land for longer than any of you have been alive. When I was seventeen, the Reds burned my home and forced me into the wild. I spent the next twenty years hunting, scavenging, and killing any Red who tried to stop me. Then the Nazis came, so I spent the next twenty years killing nazis. Now there are bandits, and I don't have twenty more years left in me. That is where you lot come in. After forty years in the forests you learn a thing or two, and I aim to teach you what I know. I know how to find food where even the worms have abandoned. I know how to move so quietly that even a rabbit won't hear me approaching. I know how to survive in a blizzard without a blanket and how to lure a wolf pack into an enemy patrol. By the time I am done with all of you, you will not know how to do most of this, but you will know enough to die fighting, rather than freezing and starving, and that is what your people ask of you.""

They had nothing if not courage, and courage was what the Ural Guard asked for, not skill nor strength. He yelled, "Hand-to-hand combat: begin!"\n\nThe militiamen and women took to each other with gusto, fists flying. Nodding with approval, Fegerov walked among the ranks, giving commentary on fighting technique. "Ivanov, watch your side! Nikolai, stop manhandling him and take him down!

He truly was a soldier, he thought, and a part of him chuckled ruefully at that. Later that afternoon, looking over statistics and tables, Fegerov began his report to the Central Command of the League. Massive improvements had been made, he noted, in the fighting capacities of his men: it appeared the training regimen was working. Response to the senior advisors had been especially positive and even affectionate, although discipline continued to be something of an issue. He paused at the final point. His report called for a final decision on whether to expand the programme with rough conscription measures. It was drastic, but the Urals were an extreme place.

The name of the village became half-forgotten, lost amidst the chatter of the infrequent merchant convoys and the boys yelling at each other in the square. Under the casual intimacies of a lifestyle which had little need for the rest of the world, it had gently drifted into the ease of isolation, as a couple slips into each other's familiar hollows in the warm darkness of the night. But any pond will tell you that the peace of stillness is only a ripple away from ending. And day by day the ripples expanded with the visits of soldiers in the single and double, the low growl of troop movements, exercises, recruitment drives. Slowly the games of the boys changed from tag and catch to cops and robbers, soldiers and cowboys, hunter and hunted.\n\nThe headman of the town smiled a little less at each monthly meeting, and the piles of paperwork on his desk slipped a little further into chaos every week. And old men woke sweat-drenched at random intervals on quiet nights, reaching for guns long vanished from households and farms, and held their spouses as the shaking overtook them. Tattered red flags were dug up, glared at and quickly reburied, along with all the other unwelcome ghosts. One morning the ripples, with an easy inevitability, reached the town and broke its silence forever. A single walker, yelling in a strange dialect from up north.\n\n"Come serve our brothers and sisters of the Ural League! All able-bodied young men from a household of more than four mouths..."

It was comforting that he had been ordered to observe the endless sky for half an hour, along with the hundred other recruits on the square of the barracks. Big thoughts for a village boy from Beloretsk, of course, but had he not been encouraged to dream? A sergeant barked, and the Marshal began his walk to the podium in front of them. The assembly came to attention, only partly due to fear of the rod. The Marshal brooked no discussion about his past, but the whispers floating around him hinted at a military one; perhaps he had been a member of the local garrison, or even one of the veterans of the Long March from Vorkuta, perhaps even a brother to Mendriks himself.\n\nHe was a commanding figure despite his age, dressed in faded khaki with the flourishes of the Ural Guard, his deep-lined face summoned as much fear as it did respect. Now he stood facing the cadets, beginning to speak from a microphone jury-rigged to functionality.\n\n"My fellow soldiers, it is with pleasure that I welcome you to the Guard. I will begin by asking one simple question: why are we here? To serve your parents? Or perhaps to make your village proud? Or maybe you think a place in our ranks will help you get laid?" Laughter broke out across the parade square for a half-minute. "No, my friends, you are not here for your friends, family, God or girlfriend. You are here to help me build my dream.

No one could have seen this coming, not a man in the People's Training Militia of the Ural League; but here it was, and in the chaos his heartbeats soared into lifetimes.\n\nThe plan had been simple, at first; secure the objective Anton at dawn and Boris and Vasili by evening. No one had expected what appeared to be an ambush prepared by Bandits for the convoy: the instructors had been the first to die in the chaos, pinwheeled into smears of blood in the grasses. Now the remainder of the platoon was pinned in a grotesque version of their own training exercise, with low supplies, low ammunition and mounting casualties. Tin soldiers towards a furnace. Fyodor looked to Grigori, then to Mikhail, both firing sporadically in the darkness beside him. He'd promised to get them home. He was, after all, a squad leader. A roll of the die in his head, and it was settled. Shame it had to be this way.\n\nNow he yelled with all the strength he had to him, "All squads, execute rear movement and prepare for breakout!" Shadows in his file jerked to life, shuddering with effort under the fear and stress. One by one they moved to the rear, and the strains of fire swelled to a climax behind him. But he stayed. 2 grenades, 3 magazines – emptied. Keep your men safe to the last second. Body after body jerked and fell. Too little, too slow. He drew a grenade, slumped over.

But that's the furthest thing on his mind right now, as he struggles forward, hacking all the way, to a sitting position. He was a disciplined soldier to the core; there was a briefing to attend and he would not miss it even unto death. The gasps reach him before the man himself; people shuffle aside and half-bow at the presence of the leader of the Ural League himself. Mendriks walks to him, and the Marshal struggles to offer a salute. "Come now, Marshal, there's no need for theatrics. At ease amongst friends, remember?" The Marshal falls back, his face lined with exhaustion. He struggles to frame the words in his mind. "...are my men doing fine? How are the volunteer brigades?" And Mendriks smiles, his face momentarily younger by decades, floodgates of stress lifting for a brief moment, and the Marshal is thrown back to Vorkuta, face-to-face with an idealistic Latvian priest too damned stubborn to die. Too upright and loving not to follow. "I'm proud of you. Because of your work we have something resembling a proper army, and the arms and supplies flowing from the Communes to support it. Listen to me – I've talked with our staff and they think we might stand a chance, against the bandits and the Black Mountain. That's what you've given us.

This is the state of play between Orenburg and the League, and it is beautiful in its own, dangerous way.\n\nThe actors play their roles with the expected level of conviction; the Ural League begins with reassuring comments on common purpose, a greater one, even. A common desire for the improvement of the Russian peoples, a love for this broken land and a shared desire to make it whole. One or two delegates tear up, moved by the display. Others nod clinically, noting that the representative has managed to say, in so many words, nothing concrete at all. The Orenburg Council is no less adept; reiterating the previous comments, they offer similar words of acceptance and mutual trust, and propose a building of mutual relations that will surely, definitely, progress to mutual unity. No clarification is forthcoming, or needed, about what this unity will look like. Everyone knows what the future holds in their own heads.\n\nThe dance continues, icy and perfectly arranged. Slowly, the atmosphere begins to thaw, and councillors and representatives prepare their pre-written notes.

An old Soviet siege cannon was dragged out from the Urals and began shelling the steel-reinforced gates, while a diversionary offensive from Communal militias distracted the defenders. What Lysenko's men did not expect, however, was an attack from the mountain itself: a grizzled band of the Ural Guard's finest veterans had scaled the side of the mountain fortress using old grappling hooks and climbing tools, and launched a surprise strike where the defences were the weakest, because no one should have been insane enough to attempt that.\n\nAs the assault team reached the walls, the defenders realized they were being flanked and opened fire on the climbing Guards, killing several men before they could retaliate, but it wasn't enough: in mere minutes, the elite Guards seized key locations within the fortress and started wreaking havoc. As the last defenders retreated before being surrounded, the siege cannon finally tore down the front gate, allowing the militias to storm in as well. The battle proceeded through the rest of the fortress, many dying to the traps within, until they finally reached Lysenko in his personal study, finding him experimenting even in his last moments.\n\nThe former scientist, mad from his defeat, released his prisoners, declaring that his new breed of super soldiers would defend him to the last, but seemed surprised when the crowd immediately turned on him: his desperate screams as he was torn apart by the men he had tortured for all these years will surely haunt the dreams of those who witnessed it."

Military, economic, and diplomatic issues are deadlocked by disagreements between hardliners and sympathisers, rural and urban delegates, and the Ural League struggles to keep a consensus which never existed outside their notepads. The meeting appears to be, like so many other impossible hopes, a stillbirth.\n\nThen a lone Commune delegate splits himself off from the fray and marches to the podium. In a desperate, heartfelt plea, he reminds his brothers of the presence of hungry things in the dark. Dirlewanger and Lysenko, and beyond them horrifying stories seeping in about what is left of the Rodina; armies using human waves, power struggles and tinpot tyranny. Against such things, he tells them, there is no cure but unity and brotherhood. "The spirit of liberty cannot be allowed to perish on the altar of purity!" he cries, glaring at his own delegation for an uncomfortable minute.\n\nThen he proposes a simple programme; Mendriks will visit the Communes on a goodwill tour, and naturally both sides will respond as a show of goodwill. Military advisors will be sent on both sides to ensure security, economic support will be forthcoming to be used at Council discretion, and yearly bilateral talks will ensure this relationship continues to develop at an even pace.\n\nThe assembly listens, thinking. Slowly the debate shifts to practical solutions and then schedule planning. Against all odds, the delegate has ensured the meeting's success. Freedom in the Urals draws another beautiful, impossible breath."

This greatly welcomed invitation to meet with the many representatives of Orenburg, a rare treat for outsiders of the communes to receive, has opened a great host of opportunities for us to now best make use of in advancing our interests.\n\nMendriks was reported to have visited the old chapel of his fortress immediately after hearing of the welcome news, having offered prayers not only for the safety of his beloved Guards and beleaguered Orenburg, but also for the friendship that was being fostered between the two. In a time of darkness, hopelessness and fear, this little event, so insignificant outside of this small region of Russia, has given the people of the Southern Urals a significantly more realistic expectation of a better future, if not for themselves, then for their children."

As he entered the large hall, he felt the slight discomfort associated with having an untold number of eyes focused on you. All heads were turned towards him, and all conversations had died with frightful speed. Except for a few slight whispers, the room was eerily silent. The slender priest tightly gripped the small, wooden cross he always held deep in his pocket - after all, even great men may feel insecure, and require the comfort of their loved ones - and then began to speak with his eloquent, articulate yet sombre tone.\n\nFirst, he asked for a representative to accept the gift he had brought from the Guards. After a brief murmur among the council members, a muscular, bearded man, likely a farmer or manual worker judging by the calluses on his hand, reached out to introduce himself to Mendriks. Surprisingly, the man pulled a beautifully woven winter coat from his chair and entrusted it to the priest, uttering what most probably were practiced lines, that this gift was "a show of Orenburg's spirit".\n\nYet, this was not seemingly an unfriendly gesture, and the priest was almost amused to see the burly man nervously fidgeting, waiting for his reaction. With a large, friendly smile, Mendriks returned the pleasant gesture with his own gift, an adorned knife, a symbol of the strong, yet protective, nature of the Ural Guard. Deep down in his thoughts he already felt the glimmer of inspiration for an address, much like a sermon, as he observed the stark contrast between the two gifts and what they represented. This was likely going to be a very successful meeting."

Though Burba has not made any statements about our cause, we can find common ground in our mutual desire to end political chaos and confusion in the city, and organize a strong, centralized army for the communes. However, as much as our encouragement means for in his pursuit of a strong and assertive Orenburg, our vocal support for Burba could potentially harm his bid for leadership. Those who eye the League with suspicion and fear our influence might view Burba as our puppet.

The weak militias guarding the various small outposts and villages are by the estimations of both our analysts and those from the communes, incapable at best, a hazard to public order at worst. As another argument for our intervention in the 'great anarchist project' it truly serves its purpose. The council cannot be allowed to stand on equal footing when comparing themselves to the military might of the factions trying to push influence or destruction upon their land. Their defences are meagre, and their so-called "army" nothing but a small, weak force, incapable of even standing up to our disciplined soldiers. In their disgrace however, they will turn to us, as our projects are the only ones even slightly similar to those of the communes. The means have become unimportant in such matters: survival currently trumps all other concerns, which is likely why Orenburg has allowed us to have such a privileged position in the Workers' Council.

Many of our troops are currently using weapons that are decades old, dating back to the Great Patriotic War. A German Kar98k or a Soviet PPsh 41 are commonly seen resting on the shoulders of our Guards at attention. The soldiers struggle to maintain the crumbling weapons and they stand no chance against the assault rifles of Lysenko or the motorcycles of Dirlewanger. Incentivizing our native arms industry and outfitting our troops with new weapons will be costly, however. We would sacrifice civilian industrial capacity, but it may be worth it.\n\nThe second option presented to us is to conscript the strongest refugees to construct forts along the borders with our southern and eastern neighbors. Again, we would sacrifice industrial capability that we desperately need, but national defense is a top priority, and a poor economy is better than an economy ruled by Lysenko or Dirlewanger.\n\nThe third and final option is to send the refugees to work in local factories.

The name bounces around the carved halls, daring someone, anyone, to pick it up and play with it.

With hostiles knocking at the gates, however, it's clear that the customary is no longer enough for the safety of the Southern Urals. A decision must be made.\n\nA faction of generals proposes a direct approach: overwhelming boasts will make the Communes bow to our will. Demands and brashness could guarantee a successful annexation. Another faction proposes a gentle seduction rather than a violent ravishing, a dance of alliances and mutual guarantees that will surely work better than a use of aggression. Those who are of the diplomatic corps in the League hold this stance. Yet another corner of the room proposes an innovative and exciting method: infiltrate and slowly turn their government towards the League with its military and governmental "assistance".

It appears relations between our nations have changed significantly, and not necessarily to our advantage.\n\nThe use of diplomatic and economic pressure from the Ural League triggered demonstrations across the communes, bringing together the fractured settlements and Orenburg in a show of unity against a common foe. In reaction, the workers council issued a statement condemning the League as "perfidious capitalist dogs" and adding any additional calumnies it could think to fit onto the space of a page.\n\nThe result has already been hailed as a work of "socialist art" in the taverns of Orenburg, while the Ural League has withdrawn protective patrols from our grounds in response.

The representative uses convincing and impressive words, ones that go down sweetly in the delegates' ears: unity, solidarity, and a shared loyalty for the betterment of Russia and mankind.

But fear trumps pride, and everyone knows what the dangers Dirlewanger and the Black Mountain represent. And this is where the envoy pulls his coup-de-grace.

The different factions within the military leadership had already been pouring over statistics whilst brooding on their meaning. They would need the best arguments to convince the pious yet pragmatic man they followed. With the careful, considered voice of a practiced sermon orator, Mendriks addressed his trusted retinue of grizzled veterans, many of whom had forged the unbreakable bond with the priest from the times of the Long March. It was now time to address the question of Orenburg and its surrounding settlements, the fiercely anarchist communes which despite their distaste for our more centralized state structure wished for nothing more than peace in their little part of the Ural steppes.\n\nThe communes, however, had managed to develop a large industrial base, perhaps more than what's necessary for Orenburg's survival in this bleak part of the world. As Mendriks recounted this with his usual charismatic eloquence, he noticed that the ensuing discussion on how to best treat Orenburg, whether to follow the Guard's mission to secure the helpless, or to use its overwhelming military force to assert authority of the area and use its resources to expand the Guard's powerbase, was likely going to be a close one to call.\n\nNot everyone here had suffered the soul crushing, oppressive destruction that the Gulags had forced onto the original members of the League; these people did not understand how power corrupts a man's humanity itself, warping it into a manifestation of its worst sins.

However, until now the League's policy of non-interference has prevented these politicians from achieving any major successes, and there has been a equally powerful faction arguing for cooperation, or even an alliance with the league.\n\nUnfortunately, a recent speech by Mendriks seems to have dashed those hopes permanently. To the assembled soldiers and officers, he asserted that the League will be enforcing its hegemony over the Urals, including Orenburg, "for the Ural People's own good".\n\nAlready, the precarious political balance in the Commune has been disrupted. Urgent preparations for conflict are being made, but the fighting that has broken out between several factions is like to render these moot.

In others however, the League's operational capacity has been severely limited by their inability to find willing collaborators.\n\nThankfully, Commander Mendriks seems to have found a solution. In a speech to a cohort of assembled Guardsmen, the League's supreme leader announced that pursuant to its goals as "protector" of the peoples of the Southern Urals, they will be refraining from any aggression with all "deserving" neighbors.\n\nWhile it's nice to know that the nearby army of elite, disciplined soldiers will not be smashing through Orenburg's pathetic, perpetually squabbling militia to burn their homes and steal their food, this announcement hasn't really changed the people's view of the league.

It's almost bureaucratic for them: killing an innocent, burning a house with the people still inside, levelling a city with bombs, is like paperwork. They feel no joy, no pleasure, only duty fulfilled. But Dirlewanger, see, he isn't like them. He felt a sense of joy when he killed his first man; some Belgian private during the Great War, apparently. And that joy never stopped. When he got his chance to return home and live a normal life, he always refused it. Always. The Bandit King does what he does because deep down, he can't stop. Lysenko is cut from a similar cloth, of course; he has no regard for human life.

The matter being debated is the issue of just how we should stand together. Some are keen on close cooperation, that we should request an alliance with the Communes to provide mutual protection and resource-sharing long after our most pressing threats have been eliminated. Although Orenburg has grown more trustful of us, they still harbour suspicions about our long-term intentions, and we can hardly blame them for being paranoid with neighbours like the traitor SS or the mad scientist. For these reasons, they may not be keen to accept the offer of a binding alliance, as they might fear that we would take too much control in such a deal.\n\nWe could instead provide them with a series of mutual guarantees, promises to defend each other in times of need. This may prove to be a nice compromise as it presents us both as equal partners. Should we wish to end our cooperation with Orenburg after Dirlewanger is dealt with, we may simply wish to issue a guarantee for that particular threat.\n\nThe nature of how we choose to bind ourselves to the Comunes of Orenburg will likely shape the future of the Southern Urals for many years to come."

This would unite our nations, not through our armies, or through trade but through an unbreakable bond of true brotherhood to last the ages.\n\nThere are those among our men that disagree with this however. They see the alliance with Orenburg as plenty enough of a symbol of our brotherhood. Besides, getting the communes to work with us was quite the effort, these men wonder how much Orenburg feels the same about us.

What followed was a tale of heroism, sorrow, and victory.\n\nThe Ural Seven, as they came to be called, trained the civilians in the art of war, and helped them erect makeshift defences around their village.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the enemy came: over fifty men, Russian bandits and German raiders, attacked the hamlet, pushing and prodding at every corner of the village, trying to break through the lines. The raiding party was dismayed by the stiff resistance, like the wolf finding out that even rabbits have teeth, but still they assaulted Prechistenka, rabid animals desperate for food and blood. Grenades, machine guns, zhdanovs and even a score of Kazakh horsemen were thrown at the defenders, but time and time again they were repelled: the village was a fortress, every house a bastion, every road a barbican, every soul a sentinel.\n\nOne by one, the Ural Seven fell. One by one, they bravely fought and died in defence of the innocent, spurring their charges to keep fighting with their dying breath. And they did. Men and women, young and old, weak and strong, all fought the invaders with courage they didn't even realize they possessed, until the bandits were broken on Prechistenka's knee. As the dust settled on the third day, the village stood, and the bandits were gone, dead or fled. The villagers cheered as the last bandit fell, but the Guard did not. The next day, they were already gone, refusing to join the villagers in their revelry, choosing instead to bury their dead and return home.\n\nPerhaps the Ural Seven, now only three, had celebrated their victory. But above all, they mourned those who could not join them in glory.

Despite a few run-ins with brigands, within a fortnight they reached the frigid outskirts of the Vorkuta Gulag. The camp sat empty, practically untouched since they had left it. They spent several days there, reflecting on how far they had come, leaving memorials for those who were not alive to make this pilgrimage, and hunting for anything they might have left behind.\n\nFor one soldier, however, the beginning would also be his end. For all the victory, for all the memories, his heart ran empty. He rubbed the stump of his arm where one of Dirlewanger's men had hacked it off, and thought of all the comrades he had lost in the labyrinthine halls of Lysenko's lab. Sitting in his old cell, he thought of all the men who had been imprisoned alongside him here, none of whom now remained. He wept bitterly as he questioned why he alone was still here, if not only to suffer. The answer suddenly was clear in his mind.\n\nHis comrades found him on the floor of his cell, pistol still in hand, his cheeks wet with tears.

Kolyma was a place no man deserved, reminiscent of the Devil's icy resting place: if anyone had read Dante's Inferno, it would remind them of Caina, the frozen land of Cain and his fellow traitors, where the damned endured eternal cold without the freedom of death. It was the past, but the past never faded, and Anatoly had done things in those frozen camps that made him shiver from something completely unrelated to the cold chilling him to the bones.\n\nOutside the walls, little lay: the occasional nomad, cold and distant, offered little more than soup and bread, and ruins were all he could see by the old road.. Slowly going South, some semblance of civilization returned, and with it, humanity. Bandits and criminals, thieves and beggars, but at least he could find shelter from the cold.\n\nAnatoly dimly recalled that eastwards there was ocean, and China. Westwards, maybe a Russian state lied. Perhaps more humane than the old Union. The old man resolved to march towards the setting sun.\n\nWhether by his own perception or by the Earth's movements, the days got longer. There was no longer snow, and wheat shone golden on the horizon. A fire, somewhere out there, glowed every night. It was on one long day that Anatoly arrived at a small village, somewhere high in the Urals. The guards, hardened by life outside the comforts of the developed world, asked for identification. When Anatoly expressed that he lacked any, they asked him for his tale then, and the man began, from the distant past inside the camps to the more recent years in the wild Russian East. Upon hearing about his time in the gulag, they beckoned him into the guard post and poured a glass of vodka for him. Only the bravest survived the camps, and Anatoly was one of them.

The quick-thinking boy took the submachine gun from the dead soldier and fired into the air, alerting the sleeping Guardsmen: within seconds, they scrambled to their arms and took the invaders by surprise, in a surprising turn of events, driving them out.\n\nAfter the blood dried, the cadet who saved the entire garrison was taken to Beloretsk where he was paraded through the streets along with the Guards who owed their lives to him. After the parade, the young trainee received a Hero's Medal from Father Jānis Mendriks, the Ural League's head himself, and the news of the event was spread far and wide.

When the hamlet had been attacked by bandits, the boy was with his parents as they fled alone to the forest, pursued by Kazakhs, and she had lost any trace of the family ever since.

They have a 10-minute break for each meal, only one set of clothes, which makes drilling even more rigorous, and if they have any free time at all, it's spent preparing for the next day of drilling.\n\nDespite these conditions, no one was expecting what happened last morning. At 7:30, Siyankin Gerasim Georgiy failed to report to duty, leading to drill instructor Savva Belov to search for him. Another 10 minutes passed before the drill was interrupted from the sound of 2 rounds going off in the barracks. Officers and soldiers rushed inside to find the officer lying dead, and Siyankin pointing the rifle's barrel to his mouth. With more than fifty spectators, the soldier then pulled the trigger.\n\nThe incident shocked the nation, and today's newspapers are filled with analyses and critiques, but many still defend the spartan conditions of the soldiers: they believe that the people of the Urals need to make sacrifices in order to protect themselves from foreign threats. However, there have been those who disagree, stating that what happened yesterday will happen more and more times, as recruits are driven mad from fatigue and stress while their officers enjoy much better standards: in difficult times, even eating fresh bread instead of flavourless soup can drive men insane with rivalry. They argue that there is no use in constant drilling if the soldiers will later ignore orders or, worse, revolt or simply kill themselves. Whatever stance people have taken on the issue, it has certainly become divisive."

 URL.110.d: "The council guiding us prides itself on being the representatives of Russia's highest virtues. The two most common backgrounds amongst its members are being either scholars of different fields, or veterans of our numerous conflicts. They claim to face the terror and evil lurking around us with their courage and intelligence. With premises such as these, the announcement that one of the council members was being exiled for cowardice in combat came as a shock.\n\nEarlier yesterday, a man came forward in private to some of the council members and informed them that one of the councilmen had lied about his previous service. The man said that they had encountered a gang of raiders, riding around on trucks with large machine guns. When they opened fire, the councilman dropped his gun and ran as fast as he could, while the rest of the squad fought back. They suffered heavy casulties, and the man held a grudge against the councilman, though he never felt brave enough to come forward until just then. Immediately, the officer was brought before a court martial: the soldier's story was confronted by hearing other squad members involved in the same operation, and their matching depositions, each judged precise and true, sealed the case.\n\nThe officer was stripped of his rank and relieved with dishonor from the Ural Guard. As an appendix, the verdict confiscated all his ill-earned money and sentenced him to exile. The man, now a civilian, returned his uniform and equipment, and left the barrack with only a bag with some food and his clothes, as his former comrades looked at him with eyes full of scorn, and the crowd jeered at himm. He quietly walked out of the camp, and the doors closed behind him. The League has plenty of room for exiles, refugees and the damned, but there is no space for cowards."

They looked up to him, and he looked after them in turn: they had all sworn to do everything to protect each other, even if it killed them. Dozens of times, they had kept their word, taking wounds and facing hardships together. Alexei more than all others, but he didn't consider himself superior: he may have been stronger and with a keener aim, but the others fought with all they could give, and that was enough. Finally, the day came when Alexei fulfilled his oath for the last time: in an act of supreme heroism, he ran to the grenade which had been thrown inside the house they were defending and launched himself on it, covering his comrades with his body.\n\nThe funeral service, as per his request, was short and quiet: his reposed body was dressed in his uniform, to which his commanding officer had pinned his posthumous medal, then the coffin was hauled out by his squadmates and lowered into a hole in the ground. As one of the soldiers began filling the hole with dirt, a priest read from the Bible and said some nice things about him. Then, the squad sergeant came forward and spoke, telling funny stories about him, like his attempts to hit on an uninterested woman, or the times he would get piss drunk and laugh so loudly he would wake up the entire barracks up from their sleep. Some laughed at this, but most cried, miserable at the thought that their friend was no longer with them.\n\nFinally, the hole was replaced by a small earth mound, and the sergeant played a short rendition of "Katyusha", his favorite song, with all soldiers forming the choir, and then they all left, talking amongst themselves or staying quiet. "What a damn shame," the sergeant muttered under his breath."

This was a special gathering; every year, befitting his former status as a priest, he gave a mass remembering those who fell in the great march southwards from the gulag to the mountains, where the League was eventually founded. Mendriks paused briefly to allow the audience to clap before beginning again.\n\n"We've all suffered greatly in our time. We've suffered incarceration, forced labor, frigid winters, great treks through hellish conditions, and the predations of all the worst examples of humanity. We've all lost somebody we cared deeply about, not because they were weak or undeserving, but because fate wasn't on their side that day." He recited a list of names, going from those who had perished in the prison camps all those years ago to those who had been killed just weeks before. He gave thanks and condolences to those grieving relatives in the crowd, and bade the crowd to treat them with compassion.\n\n"We sometimes wonder why, with all the world's cruelty, there is even a point in going on. To you doubters, I say, look around you. There are so many people who care for you, who would die for you in an instant. All of our hardship wasn't for nothing, because we have each other. God challenges us, not to tear us down but to help us grow and to bring us together. When you think of giving up, just think about how much so many people sacrificed to bring you here, and seek to emulate them in how you treat others. That said, I'd like you all to join me in a moment of prayer, to those who have fallen and to us, those for whom they gave their lives to protect.""

 URL.113.d: "Many at home had warned them of what they would see in the south. Of what the Dirlewanger Brigade had done to so many villages. None within the young squad of scouts really understood that warning, until they saw it with their very own eyes.\n\nWhen they came across the ruins of Buzuluk, the sheer magnitude of what they were facing struck them to their very core. Entering the ruined town, the smell of smoke and death was overpowering. This was a recent attack. Lost souls shifted through the streets, their clothes hanging by a thread, eyes peering into nothingness. Women and children stared at them from half-destroyed homes, with nothing but pain in their gaze.\n\nKazimir, one of the younger scouts choked at what lay within the city square. A mound of bodies rotted there; men, women and children alike, of young and old faces. Stripped of their clothes and valuables, the bandits never even had the decency to bury them. Kazimir knelt and took into his hand one of theirs. He muttered something, perhaps a prayer, perhaps an apology. Then he rose. Tears formed in his eyes, but they could not mourn the lost forever.\n\nThen they came across a smouldering heap of wood and brick. An iron bell lay in the ashes; this was a church. Sifting through the rubble, one of the scouts suddenly flinched back. Examining further, the true horror of what they were witnessing unfolded beneath their soot caked boots; piles upon piles of bones and skulls, charred black, littered the former church floor. Slowly they began to realize what had happened; the bandits had trapped these people inside the church, and then set it on fire.\n\nTogether, the scouts finally had come to face the grim truth of their duties. Their war was not just against a pack of rowdy looters and bandits. Their war was against the face of evil itself, and the very essence of human cruelty. They now realized their true purpose; to grant these souls the justice they deserved."

There isn't an inkling of soul left in those bastards. I lost three friends in the mountain, you know."\n\n"Pipe it," replied his companion, a much older man. "They're still human, and we owe it to them and God to treat them as such. I've been mistreated by Chekists since before you were born. When we kill them in cold blood, we become them."\n\n"Is that so?" said the younger. "Would you say the same for a Nazi? For Dirlewanger? For Hitler? As far as I'm concerned, slashing these torturers' throats just does everybody a service. The only way to make them stop is make it too bloody to make it worthwhile, violence is the only language they understand."\n\nThe response stopped the veteran in his tracks. He wasn't wrong, even if he was only a fresh recruit. Still, the older man responded, "And wouldn't they say the same about us, if the situation was reversed? Would we just be bandits, a motley collection of exiles and criminals? Only mercy can end this cycle of violence. You're young, you barely know death. I've seen enough killing for ten lifetimes." Now it was the young man's turn to stand and think. He twirled the knife between his fingers, genuinely unsure of what to do. His eyes turned to the captives, perhaps to see them in a new light, before he let out a cry of anger and exasperation."

Many of the communities were extremely poor, still organized along Tsarist-era Obshchina practices, and the ever-present stream of refugees was straining their resources to the breaking point. Something had to be done.\n\nAnd something would be. Zaytsev had been thinking for some time, and had concluded that centralization was the only reasonable answer. He would ask Mendriks to use his popularity to appeal to the communities, encouraging them to extend the Uralian commonality to those new arrivals.\n\nAt the same time, he would incentivize such action beyond mere goodwill by extending subsidies to the places that did so. Grain supplies would also be redirected in order to ensure sufficient food supply in stressed regions. Finally, some of the League's militias would be rebased from their camps to the villages and towns affected by his other actions, moving to serve as a combination protective force and town watch.\n\nThough he knew that there would be problems and disagreements with his choices, Zaytsev was confident that, in time, all would understand that the League was only taking an active role in their protection and continued safety."

A rifle was slung over his shoulder, a Mosin-Nagant kept in pristine condition, a pistol snug at his hip. This man of danger, this black rider, was known to them through the new strand of folklore that had arisen in the wastes.\n\nHis name was Ilya Starninov, and his reputation preceded him. This was the man who had shot dead the infamous bandit Anatoly Slivko, who had fought off the Aryan Brotherhood at the Gunfight at Salavat, who had led rag-tag militia bands to impossible victories over superior foes. The crowd watched and whispered, awed by his presence and what his sudden appearance here might mean. For his part, Starinov paid the crowd no mind, his eyes fixed on the little church that lay in the center of the town.\n\nStanding in front of the church, one of the few Catholic churches in this part of the world, was Jānis Mendriks. The aging priest was flanked by two of his Ural Guards, the men eyeing the gunfighter and his retinue with wary eyes. Starinov met the gaze of the Latvian papist, and the two shared a small smile.\n\nStarinov dismounted his pony, his boots thumping into the fresh snow and sending a puff of white into the air. "So this is the famous Jānis Mendriks and his Children of Vorkuta? Looks like an old man and some nervous village boys to me," said Starinov, his gloved finger pointed at Mendriks.\n\n"Ilya Starinov, I presume? I thought I recognized you from the smell of old leather and cheap vodka that floated into town the second you crossed the border." Mendriks' eyes were steely and his mouth set in a firm line. Both sets of bodyguards fingered their weapons nervously, and the townsfolk began to file away from the street.\n\nThe tension evaporated as Starinov cracked a smile, "Jānis, you son of a bitch, how've you been?" Mendriks laughed, and the Guards relaxed as the two old warriors clasped hands in camaraderie.\n\n"I understand you have plans to turn my little militia into a real fighting force, Ilya," said Mendriks, to which the old gunfighter grinned.\n\n"Not just a real fighting force, Jānis: the best damn soldiers in all of Russia.""

By the end of it, the village had almost all of its buildings destroyed, and almost half of its population dead or injured.\n\nHalf a day later arrived six men, armed with rifles and driving trucks. They had heard the crash, and went to explore. Upon discovering the tragedy, they left their vehicles, and began the long, arduous process of digging the snow and rocks and rubbish that surrounded the village, propping up makeshift tents for those who need a home, digging out those who were trapped under the snow, and providing medical attention when needed. They even created a village, burying the thirty victims after identification.\n\nThey stayed there for nine days, and while they could not repair the damage, or undo the horror that it had inflicted, they had gotten the community back on its feet.\n\nFor most, it would have been a nice, but fundamentally forgotten moment in Ural history. It would have remained that way if Vasily Zaytsev hadn't found out after the Guards returned home, discussing the reasons for their delay. And from there, Zaytsev petitioned Mendriks to expand on this idea, who, after some reluctance, approved Zaytsev's creation: the Guard Relief Brigade, dedicated towards disaster and emergency relief for the citizens of the Southern Urals."

He muttered, the fear in his voice poorly disguised under his SS-standard false bravado. They'd been on a relatively simple slave raid, he and his unit, until Hans had stepped on... something, and was abruptly pulled by his neck into a tree with a sickening crack. Bullets flew as chaos erupted in their patrol, although Otto had seen little of it as he and 3 other men fled the scene like scared mice. Of course, by the time they were out of the pass it was only him, Hermann, and the oldest man in the unit, Albrecht. The other man, Gunter, had disappeared into a bush as if grabbed by its very branches, dragging him off into oblivion during their mad dash to god knows where. Taking shelter by a tree, Albrecht had given his squadmates a very harrowing, if implausible, explanation: The Leshy, an ancient slavic forest spirit, tricky but vengeful.\n\nThat was when things had taken a turn for the worst. As if by the wrath of Russia itself, a terrible creaking heralded the woods themselves coming alive. Albrecht had suddenly fallen and, with a girlish cry, was pulled back at such a rapid speed he appeared to disappear for a moment before being consumed by a gaping hole in the ground. Otto and Hermann had taken no chances and fled in opposite directions. Now, Otto was slinking warily down an unfamiliar path, bleeding from the mouth.\n\nHis heart once again stopped as something snapped beneath his foot. Gazing down, he saw only a twig. Glancing up once again, however, Otto found himself staring into the eyes of Hermann as the bastard hung upside down from a tree, disemboweled, and mouth agape.

They were a scourge not only upon our nation, but upon humanity itself: imagine a world, where millions of innocents are sacrificed on the altar of the perversion Lysenko called "science", a world where the air is filled with smoke, and blood, and screams. Yet, despite all they have thrown at us, we have persevered. We have beaten them at their own cruel game, but we didn't become like them: unlike those devils, WE are still humans. Through the dark and sterilized hallways of Black Mountain, our comrades died for peace, for a promise of something better, and we fulfilled that promise time and again: today, we are triumphant! We have been hardened by the events of our past, and our struggle against Lysenko has been no different.\n\nIt will become a part of us and the generations that follow, in this cycle that is the ultimate struggle for survival. Order has returned to the Urals: no longer will our people live in fear, barricading themselves in their villages, fearing the night and the monsters that come with it, for these creatures are finally dead: now, they lay silent and frozen, kept securely inside graves dug deep into the earth, thrown back into the darkness that generated them, and that will hold them forever."

Victory against so-called "noble successors" of a madman, who had gone mad themselves.

Like rotten meat for vermins and flies, the insane German turncoat gathered hundreds of men just like him, lured by the promise of loot and carnage, a never ending nightmare of violence and blood. His small group grew larger, the raids became full-scaled offensives against our villages, then our cities, and finally the very heart of our nation, of our people.\n\nHowever, their very greed became their grave. Dirlewanger's insane drive to loot and rape everything he sees finally doomed him, as he ruled over a circle of drunkards and drug addicts and relied on them as if they were competent: perhaps it was desperation, or perhaps he had fallen so deep into his own madness that he truly believed they would serve him with diligence.\n\nWith the capture of Orsk, the "capital" and only real settlement within the SS turncoat's petty realm, and the confirmed death of Dirlewanger himself, his reign of terror is finally over! The city has been purged of all signs of his deranged rule, from the swastikas to the gallows filled with the hanging bodies of those brave yet foolish enough to face the devil with their bare hands. When the civilians saw our soldiers entering the city, and disarming their slave drivers, they filled the roads to celebrate our soldiers, though there were many sightings of former bandits lynched and torn apart by those they had oppressed until the day before.

Women and children carried precious heirlooms, items of invaluable significance treasured in their families for decades or even centuries.\n\nAs those not strong or brave enough to fight evacuated, the remaining village folk were shouting and receiving orders, tossing guns to one another and inspecting the weapons they would be soon using. Many of the firearms were in a truly sorry state, not used since the Great Patriotic War and intended only as trophies and sorry reminders of a time long lost. Still, a gun was a gun, and none of those gathered felt the need to complain. Loading their weapons with ease, many eyed their meager allocation of ammunition nervously. The stockpile was small enough already, and they still had to make sure to save one bullet each in case of the worst.\n\nThe irregulars looked grim as they took up their positions. Deep down, all knew they would not live to see another day. This was, barring divine intervention, their final stand. Though they could not save themselves, they could still make time for their families and other refugees.

Every house had been turned into a fortress, and several key locations had been booby-trapped to explode on the assailants as soon as the defenders had left. In addition to that, all buildings they had to abandon were set on fire, which protracted the siege late into the night. Only once the Guards numbers had been whittled down to a mere fraction of the initial defenders, were the invaders able to storm the final defensive line established in the village centre itself. The reprisals were vicious and hate-filled, but many of the last Guards preferred to commit suicide rather than falling into the hands of their enemies. Not only had the defenders been able to buy an unexpected amount of time but using their scorched earth tactics they also had taken away any cover opportunities for the besiegers.

 URL_initiation_system: "Guard Initiates"
 URL_initiation_system_desc: "The fierceness of the Ural Guard combined with our notoriously strict standards has transformed us into legends that reach far beyond the territory we directly control. Our reputation has caused many to seek us out, with the objective of joining the Guard themselves. This, coupled with the recent tides of refugees along the Urals, means that we receive a constant stream of new initiates, hoping to pass our strict trials to become fully fledged members of the Guard. New Guards are initiated every 50 days. Currently, the expected number of initiates to pass their final trials is §G[?Ural_initiates]§! and at maximum capacity our training facilities could handle §Y[?Ural_initiates_cap]§!. This amount could be raised, either by lowering our standards somewhat or by reserving more equipment for use in training these initiates. But some members of the guard question the competence such recruits would possess, claiming that the resources that go into their training could be put to better use in the hands of trained soldiers."
