 POLITICS_LEGION_ADEODATUS_IOVITA_MANLIUS:0 "The Legate was awarded the grass crown for saving his Legion from sure destruction in Galatia many years ago. Once this was his pride, a true mark of honor, and a sign of greatness and glory.\n\nNow however, the wreath lays on his head ever heavier, as he realizes this was not the mark of greatness but one of shame. For the man who damned his Legion to eternity.\n\nHe has claimed a thousand victories, a thousand triumphs, and a thousand worlds. Endless places that defied explanation and refused to bow to what was once thought to be the laws of man have now bowed before him. None can claim that he is not truly great, that he is not truly the greatest conqueror of all of eternity.\n\nBut he is not the Imperator. He is not the Caesar. He is not Augustus. He does not wish to rule dominion, he wishes to see Rome again. To see green eyes that once stared into his, and those who he once dreamed of raising strong. He dreams of a day where he may grow old with those eyes, and where he may one day find peace.\n\nAs the whispers grow louder and the darkness of the abyss over which his Legion treads grows darker, it becomes clearer with every time he rises again from what he had prayed was death that peace will never find him again. He is damned.\n\nAnd so are those who stand against him."

 RMN_conquest_of_the_realms_desc:0 "On and on they march. From world to world. From lands of endless metal and flying chariots to lands left turned to ash and dust by the anger of the Gods. The Legion of the undying has seen many worlds, have seen many times, and have conquered each and every one.\n\nWith every conquest they have become stronger, and with every domination their thirst for freedom from the torment of victory has grown. Release, however, eludes them, and so they conquer. On and on until the end of all time.\n\nBut what lurks in the darkness?"
