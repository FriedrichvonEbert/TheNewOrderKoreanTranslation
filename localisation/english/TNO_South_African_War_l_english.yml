 SAFWAR.2.d:0 "We are on our very last reserves of strength, near to the final loss of our liberty, and so close to the temptation of declaring our intentions to give up the fight. But this cannot be, not even as we have lost so much of our land and our manpower.\n\nWe cannot and will not allow our Dominion to fall so easily in a moment like this. Though the great shadow of the Reich is coming over us and the brutality of their soldiers is discouraging our people from keeping up the fight, we can not afford to just throw down our arms in and act of cowardice and accept our fate as perpetual slaves c.\n\nEven if this means the end of everything we have fought to keep, and the snuffing out of our lives, we will not surrender now! And never shall we cease in our efforts to keep our Nation alive, cornered as we may be, and stripped of our protections! Though our forces seem to waver, and though our enemies seem to prevail, South Africa shall not bow down to Hertzog and his German puppet masters as long as there is an honest man still standing!\n\nThe Dominion shall die for what it stands for! And the Dominion shall be remembered by the free world for what it has done"

 SAFWAR.4.d:0 "With each breath came more thick black smoke and more hallucinatory fractals,. Was he simply destined to suffocate in the smoldering ruins of his own bunk? The last bit of Dietrich's waking mind trembled with fury.\n\nHowever, just as his eyes began to close, he felt a sharp tug near his pant leg. Suddenly, consciousness had returned, and Dietrich found himself outside, gazing upon the stars. A fit of coughing began."Who?" he croaked, turning to face his saviour. An unknown figure, one he now felt immense love for. "Can you stand? We don't have much time."\n\nDietrich slung his arm over a shoulder, and limped with the strange man off into the woods. They traveled for what felt like hours, until the SS Captain found himself face to face with his savior; a subordinate in tattered rags. He fought the burning sensation in his throat, took note of the insignia on the man's uniform, and mustered speech.\n\n"You have done well Oberschütze... I will ensure you are recognized for your actions."The man simply laughed, and continued walking, greatly offending Dietrich. You consider duty to the Fatherland a laughing matter? Perhaps I was mistaken. The man stopped moving, and Dietrich observed a wild quality that had appeared within his eyes. "You stupid bastard, look around you! You speak of rank and duty, as if such words still hold meaning. The fatherland has torn itself apart, and enemy patrols are likely to descend upon us at any moment! We are just men now, two fugitives in a jungle. I pulled you from a burning building, for god's sake!"\n\nDietrich fell silent, unsure how to respond to such a brazen display of insolence. A tense energy lingered in the air, broken by what sounded like english in the trees behind them.\n\n"You mean to desert... you swine! You would rather live in cowardice then fight for the fatherland in its time of need. You are no different then our subhuman enemy!."\n\nThe english voices drew closer now, accompanied by flashlights. The man jumped into a sprint, intent on completing his treason. Dietrich mustered the strength to correct his limp, and pounced upon the traitor. They wrestled in the dirt, trading punches.\n\n"Let go of me you suicidal fanatic!" The man spat the words into Dietrich's face just moments before his brains were splattered by gunshot. Dietrich threw the corpse off of him, drew the pistol from his belt, and faced the degenerates that were now firing in his direction. He would see his duty to its end"
 SAFWAR.4.a:0 "다른 무엇보다도 조국을"
 SAFWAR.3.t:0 "와일드기스의 스완송"
 SAFWAR.3.d:0 "The building shook from what must have been an artillery shell or maybe even a near-hit from a bomb, but Lucas DeFlandre looked remarkably disinterested for a man who was certainly about to meet his death. He, along with about two dozen of the remaining members of his mercenary company "Les Oies Sauvages" had fallen back to the innermost conference room of the mansion that was now serving as the headquarters of the Zentralafrikan defense effort. DeFlandre watched, disinterested through his remaining eye as two of the remaining guns for hire erected a makeshift waist-high barricade at the door using the conference table and assorted furniture. It wouldn't do much in the long run he thought to himself, and besides, he was too tired from fighting a days long running battle with OFN forces to care much anymore.\n\nThe squad that had stayed behind to cover the mansion's foyer had stopped radioing in some time ago amidst the sounds of heavy gunfire and screams of pain. The handful that had been sent to secure an exit never even responded, and most likely had fled. Good for them, DeFlandre muttered to himself as he picked up his weapon and began to reload and clean it, no reason we all have to die here. Truthfully, he wasn't entirely sure why he hadn't bolted at the first sign of what was coming, but he suspected that deep down it had something to do with that damned pride of his that had carried him through conflicts across the globe with only the utmost professionalism. He had never run on the job, and it seemed like he wasn't about to break that streak. The heavy explosions began again and he smiled humorlessly at the thought of another American platoon walking headlong into the mines they had so carefully prepared. Gunfire could be heard dimly from beyond the room, signalling to the veteran that at least some of the men of the Zentralafrikan army had also chosen to fight. Little by little though, the gunfire slackened as each pocket was rooted out and destroyed. He heard the sound of running feet down the hallway that led to the room, then a scream as the last anti-personnel mine they had deployed took out a few more damned Yanks. Time was up, and their enemy would be at their gate in just a moment. He stood up, and as his men turned to watch their leader he flashed a smile, Well, just another job, no?"
 SAFWAR.3.a:0 "이제 살아남으려면 죽여야지"
 SAFWAR.5.t:0 "남서아프리카인의 마지막 저항"
 SAFWAR.5.d:0 "As the Americans and South Africans crawled Northwards, they were surprised at both the intensity and variation of the resistance they faced. They had known that there would be traps, ambushes, and heroic last-stands a-plenty from the handful of dedicated SS units assigned to the region, but they didn't expect that the German-settler population would so vigorously join in the final battle, or that they would be supported by so many of the native askaris.\n\nBut in retrospect, it shouldn't have been surprising. For the Settlers, there was nowhere left to run, and no one left to negotiate. Reichskommissar had all but vanished into his beloved air as the war turned against them, his battle against his inner demons lost with the broader way. His inner circle had disappeared as well, or fled back to the Reich. There was no such luxury available to either the average German or their native allies. Zentalafrika was chaos, Ostafrika was death, and the passage home too expensive for commoners. To surrender meant likely capture by the African partisans, who did not look fondly on either the Nazi or their collaborators.\n\nSo they fought. Not for their vacant leader, or for the fatherland that had abandoned them, or the ideals of National Socialism that had been so poorly applied. They fought for survival, because it was the only thing left to do.\n\nIn the plains of the south, the Americans found only brush and bombs. In the forests of Angola, there were Germans in every shadow. In the villages and towns soldiers spoke grimly of battles won for the living room, but ongoing for the kitchen. They would not give in. If not for victory, they fought to avoid defeat, and to live just one more day."

Our worst nightmare has been made real as frontline commanders report to the Cape that the "Afrika-Schild", has mobilized a massive invasion of South Africa!\n\nWith the full breadth of the National Party's treachery revealed, a domestic revolt now becomes a struggle for the very destiny of the continent. The future is uncertain, but with the combined resources of German Africa, it seems highly likely our nation may fall without foreign support!"

 SAFWAR.7.d:0 "We've said our prayers as we held the line and the Reich crept closer to Cape Town, and at last they've been answered.\n\nBy an overwhelming majority, the United States Congress has approved a resolution allowing President Richard Nixon to "take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression from disruptive forces in southern Africa." Elements from their armed forces are steaming fast onto our shores as we speak, ready to relieve our lines and push back against the rebels, and their puppet masters to the north. In the meantime, surplus and factory-fresh equipment arrive at our docks in record numbers. Thousands have since crowded the harbor to greet their saviors and new allies with welcoming arms.\n\nWith the might of the Free World at our beck and call, the Union may yet live to see not only the Boers crushed, but fascism's taint purged from our continent once and for all."

 SAFWAR.8.t:0 "독일이 지원 온다!"
 SAFWAR.8.d:0 "The solemn thoughts of the war and its toll trailed behind the troops who had been stationed on base, preparing for the arrival of the new divisions being shipped in. Everywhere you looked, men were clearing the way out of vehicle depots, worn out armored personnel carriers and tanks treaded down the makeshift roads setup within the base, and officers berated their subordinates for not pushing cargo out of the way fast enough for the incoming soldiers meant to help reinforce and strengthen the border against the South Africans. All the while, the Reichskommissar looked onwards, bearing the heat of the ever-burning African sun, as nary a zephyr gifted from Valhalla served the Germans that day. Blessings were, after all, slim to begin with in this war.\n\nJust earlier this week, the surrounding compound had been awoken from the emergency broadcast transmissions from the Großgermanisches Reich itself. Through the static of the transmissions, they managed to get several key notifications, including "United States...entering... South Afrika... Reich... reinforcements... victory... not lost!" The base had entered a feverish excitement in knowing that their savior, the Fatherland, had provided so plentifully past the horrors that the African continent managed to generate seemingly every day. The lack of an undrenched uniform, the constant wear and tear upon both their equipment and their blood, finally, the men would be able to enjoy a new bolstering of men to fight shoulder-to-shoulder in the endless savannahs of this accursed continent. Admittedly, there was continued talk about what could happen out there on the front lines with the Americans lining up to fight as well, but none could surpass the Großgermanisches Reich! As the day had finally arrived, and the distant sounds of trucks and other German machines of war poured into the base's surrounding air, the men had finally finished their preparations for all the reinforcements that were due to arrive"
 SAFWAR.8.a:0 "지크 하일!"
 SAFWAR.9.t:0 "전쟁에서 승리하다!"
 SAFWAR.9.d:0 "The march southwards was one embraced with blood. Battle after battle, the screams and begging of wounded men to be killed grew tiresome for Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig, finally being squashed out of their miserable existence as the tank treads inched forwards. The Schutzstaffel regiments of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika had proved successful warriors upon the African front, and this final siege proved no different from every other butchery.\n\nThe final battle erupted as the Ostafrikan commitment to the war had begun: under the strict orders of Hüttig. The odor of smoke and burnt flesh coupled with the screaming continued for hours, until, from the safety of the Forward Operating Base, the Reichskommissar could bear no more of this wait. He ordered the immediate advance of his regiments across the African plain, until it would assault the Cape, last bastion of defence. Thus, they marched onwards, burning the land, under the strict orders to not leave a denizen alive.\n\nAnd thus, under the burning stars of the African night, Hüttig awaited the news of the battle. Echoes of gunfire erupted, followed by the eventual rising flames of the city as he heard tank shells crumpling the scum-ridden buildings that had made up the city. Finally, hours later, a lone soldier burst into Hüttig's room, causing a thunderous slam as the door hit the wall. The soldier shouted, "Sir, Reichskommissar Hüttig, sir, news from the-" "Rottenführer." Hüttig interrupted. "You allowed a draft in, the African night is cold, you know." He said, immediately shooting up from his seat and walking to the soldier, with a bottle in hand. "Sir, my dearest apologies, sir. I was sent to inform you of the victory over South Africa, the combatants have been flushed out. Our regiments, alongside those of Reichskommissars Schenck and Müller have claimed victory tonight, sir." the soldier finished. "Victory...did you say that of Reichskommissars Schenck and Müller?" "Yes, si-" the soldier's statement was cut off as Hüttig smashed his bottle over his head, ordering him out the room.\n\nThe end to the war was Hüttig's victory, and Hüttig's victory alone, in his mind."

 SAFWAR.10.d:0 " Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller had made a sudden, disheartening realization: despite all preparations and planning for this very night, he had only been on his first drink of the night, unfortunately. However, the bounty laden within his plentiful schedule would be surely harvested later, Müller realized, as his battalion had reached the rallying point drawn out on the war map. As the bombardment that had torn apart the city finally ceased, Müller hopped upon a massive boulder, and shouted to his battalion, "Gentlemen of Zentralafrika, the Reich has tasked us for a mission, and now, we get to employ it as dutifully and properly as possible. Henceforth, you shall carry out these orders: go into that city with whatever other Germans you find in that field, shoot those American bastards, and let's have ourselves a night on the town!" Müller's mercenary company roared with compliance, rushing forth into the African night towards a burning city.\n\nAfter several hours of bored waiting, a lone soldier appeared before Müller, yelling, "Sir, Reichskommissar, si-" Müller spit out his drink, startled by the soldier's sudden salute. "Apologies sir, I was sent to inform you that the city is captured for the glory of the Reich, by the accomplishments of the men of yourself and Reichskommissars Schenck and Hüttig." Müller looked upset at the soldier, saying, "Yeah, whatever, go fuck off to some other plain." as he began walking off, preparing himself for his planned schedule.\n\nInside the city, Müller's party raged as intensely as the fires that consumed the livelihoods of thousands. Taking refuge in one of the blown apart taverns of the city, Müller and his men pranced about, chasing after the free bottles of booze and the highly exotic African narcotics. The men took a moment of calm amidst the storm, as all that filled the air were the embers of burning foundations, flesh, and bone, the smoke of the cigars, even if just for a moment.\n\nSuddenly, a laugh. Then, another soldier laughed, followed by another, until the entire bar was laughing. Then, at that moment, was when the tavern truly roared to life with laughter, booze, and drugs."

 SAFWAR.11.t:0 "전쟁에서 승리하다!"
 SAFWAR.11.d:0 "Several miles into the African savannah, rows of German military aircraft were prepped and ready for the immediate launch upon the approval of Reichskommissar Schenck himself, who had been hidden away inside of a forward operating base. Finally, as the African night sent a chilling shiver down the Reichskommissar's spine, his radio erupted that the bombardment from Ostafrikan forces had begun, while Zentralafrikan infantry had begun their assault. With every fiber of his being urging him not to grab the microphone, Schenck clutched the piece of equipment, saying, "You may begin the aerial operation in T-10... 9... 8..." until finally, German aircraft rocketed off into the beautifully icy African night sky.\n\nThe horrors of the following few hours poured in through the radio within the Reichskommissar's temporary living space. Constantly, he heard the words "Approaching target," "bombing strafe successful," and "reapproaching city." echo through the broadcast, as he silenced his microphone to continue his weeping. The despair had eaten him alive, imagining the terror and chaos reigning down upon the innocent, leaving nothing but death, or a living Hell for those unfortunate souls who survived. Despair had turned to tears, and tears had turned into sobs, as Schenck clasped his face by his rough, calloused hands. The questions of "How could I do this?" and "Why can't I stop this?" escaped his mind hours ago, with only the uncontrollable emotions of loss, despair, and self-hatred clawing at the man's mind. Finally, as tears trickled down his face, a young soldier burst into the room, shouting, "Sir, Reichskommissar, sir! The city has been captured for the glory of the Reich, by the accomplishments of your men, as well as Reichskommissars Hüttig and Müller!" The soldier's announcement was met with silence, however. "Bring me a truck." Schecnk said, coldly.\n\nHours later, Schenck arrived at the city's entrance. Firsthand, he had chosen to bear witness to his crimes, and he had understood the true destruction wrought by his evil compliance in this horrid invasion. Here, African and American men, women, and children lay dead and dying in the streets, with blood mixing with the rubble and soot. Finally, Schenck finished his journey through the South African streets as he knelt down, grasping the burnt arm of a child amidst the rubble, with mercenary's laughs and the gunshots of executions flooding in behind him, and tears rolling down his face."

 SAFWAR.13.d:0 "It truly was a mark of the modern precedent of warfare to bear witness to battle which stressed fiercely into the night. Just hours ago, the march of the infantryman was coupled with the gasps and sputters of tanks treading through the African bush, trudging through as the mud and grass as well as any pair of legs or treads could do. Finally, as the men approached the compound, the sickening relief had dawn upon them: this was it. The war would be over after tonight. And nary a soul had the strength to care about how many would have to die in order to destroy the Reichskommissariats, for once and for all. Hours into the artillery strikes, however, the true face of butchery would alight as soldiers rushed beyond the setting sun to meet the strength of the African and the American.\n\nThe gunfire lasted for hours, with some men beginning to bleed strictly from their destroyed ear drums. Rifles, machine guns, anti-tank rifles, anti-aircraft emplacements, artillery barrages, tank shells, even flamethrower units had been used to destroy as much as possible and fight to the bitter end. Trenches hardly did a man good as dirt and gore and limbs were catapulted into the sky from nearby explosions, while men shouted trying to gain advantage over the enemy. All manner of soldiers descended upon the final battle, as Americans and Africans, both white and black, met Wehrmacht, Schutzstaffel, and Mercenaries in this final stand, some only leaving bones behind in the aftermath of the gunfire and decimation. However, eventually, the Germans broke, after the frigid African night descended upon them, and it was only then that the compound remained vulnerable.\n\nHowever, as light descends upon a world of sin, so too does the rising sun bathe the men of war. No longer was the African continent plagued with a German plague. Finally, victory had been achieved, with no Reichskommissar to say otherwise, with everyone drearily enchanted with thoughts of the future."

 SAFWAR.14.d:0 "The Führer today has received a missive via the Swiss Embassy on behalf of the Organization of Free Nations, the communication is rather lacking in diplomatic niceties but given the state of affairs between the Reich and OFN this is unsurprising. Specifically, despite the negative turn of recent events in the South African War, the OFN feels that a continuation of hostilities is unlikely to produce notable results. They offer an armistice, keeping Südwestafrika, lower Mozambique and Southern Rhodesia but nothing more. And otherwise engaging in a total cessation of hostilities.\n\nDespite our public confidence in the direction the war is taking, the reality is that we are unlikely to be capable of retaking the occupied colonies, let alone advancing substantially into South African territories. Voices amongst our militarist echelons advise that should we continue fighting for much longer it is entirely possible that our forces collapse in their entirety, which would not technically be a loss for the Reich so much as it would be a complete and utterly catastrophe for our international prestige.\n\nShould we accept this offer though it would be a recognition of defeat for the Reich, something that comes with its own issues. Still, it may be preferable to lose the hand rather than the entire body. The choice however, as always, is up to the Führer."

 SAFWAR.15.d:0 "The Swiss have contacted the Reich on behalf of the Organization of Free Nations, after all the war, bloodshed and fighting it would appear that our foes are growing tired. With the newspapers constantly printing reports of massacres, deaths on the front and the native Africans turning on all sides it would appear their public is growing discontented.\n\nThe offer is a simple one, a total return to the pre-war status quo and the utter cessation of all hostilities. At first glance it would seem to be a loss for the Reich, but despite the concerted efforts of our forces in Africa we have been unable to substantially penetrate OFN lines, a swift exit to save face could be useful if we should desire to refocus our efforts upon targets closer to home.\n\nThere may be those who see this as cowardly, but we can point to the fact that whilst we have not gained anything of substance from this South African War neither have we lost anything worth mentioning, some inbred Afrikaners and a few Native SS detachments who likely would not be useful beyond the wars conclusion anyhow. Additionally, this war has reminded the world that for all the Americans claim to be the king, the Reich can strike with equal ferocity.\n\nIt is not up to the Führer to decide whether we shall accept this proffered ceasefire, or continue the fight in the hopes of a true victory?"

The Organization of Free Nations evidently agree that their side is not likely to be the winner of this war as they have, through Swiss intermediaries, contacted us with an offer of ceasefire.\n\nThe proffered terms seem favorable, recognition of the Boer Republic and a change in the borders for South Africa itself. However, it must be noted that the offer does not extend to the South African remnant state being placed under our influence, and a continued OFN presence in the Cape could prove dangerous to our influence in the long term. The more militant amongst our ranks would have the war continue until the entire nation of South Africa is under occupation but we must concede that such an operation would be expensive and quite possibly beyond our current capabilities in terms of occupying troops.\n\nTherefore it falls to the Führer to decide whether we shall accept this rather generous offer, or go all in to secure a victory for the Reich that will be remembered for decades to come."

Whilst many are hopeful this was a rogue one off attack, military intelligence and the CIA have advised the President that further deployments of chemical weapons are both likely and imminent.\n\nIn response, two proposals have been developed. Rather than triggering our massive retaliation doctrines, we could instead deploy chemical protection gear for our soldiers and press on.

 SAFWAR.41.d:0 "Today, the Reichsminister for the colonies has received a heavily-encrypted message from one of the former colonial administrators in Zentralafrika who managed to escape from the newly-proclaimed Reichsstaat. Despite our demands for answers, he has given us little information apart from the message itself, and then disappeared saying that he didn't want to see anything like what he had seen in the days of the coup.\n\nAfter decoding the cypher, we understood why the man was so secretive, and the message so potentially dangerous to bear. Claiming to represent a small clique of officers and bureaucrats who still serve the true German government even while trapped within Hüttig's hellish realm, Kai Uwe von Hassel - self-appointed leader of the "Anti-Hüttig Cabal" - asks for funds and reinforcements to prepare the ground for a counter-coup, promising to re-establish German rule in the African colonies after the madman has been deposed.\n\nOur advisors are extremely skeptical about their chances of success, but they still urge us to support them. Everyone knows that Hüttig's dream of a racially-pure Africa will end up into a nightmare of unimaginable proportions, and - according to them - when this happens, the Cabal could strike swiftly, securing at least some land to allow our return to the Dark Continent.\n\nDespite the low chances of success, this is still an endeavor worth trying. There are no risks, as someday the Reichsstaat will surely collapse - with or without our intervention - and when this happens, having a loyal administration in charge of even a small part of Africa will be enough justification to re-establish a permanent, and most lucrative, presence in these resource-rich lands."

 #South african collapse scenario
 saw_collapse.2.t: "What the Hell Did We All Die For?"
 saw_collapse.2.d: "The Schild's rapid advance throughout the Veld at an alarming rate has been met with concern by the Joint Chief of Staffs at the Department of Defense. Recent reports from the front in South Africa indicate that the South African forces have been easily folding to the much more superior Germans, and that Boer insurgencies in the countryside have increased despite our best efforts at quelling them.\n\nWhile Cape Town remains secure for the time being, the rest of the country is not, and the situation in South Africa remains dire. Commercial flights out of Cape Town, lightly booked under ordinary circumstances, were full. Even some on-duty South African Army personnel were requesting to be evacuated towards the United States, citing "loyalty towards the United States."\n\nIt remains a challenge yet a priority to evacuate the non-essential American citizens that do reside in the country, and the various economic and military assets that are scattered throughout South Africa. The Department of Defense has ordered that American forces secure Cape Town provisionally in order to conduct an orderly evacuation of assets and civilians left in the country. Whether the evacuation from South Africa will be successful or not is a test against time, however what is clear that we just need to get the fuck out of this quagmire."

Outside, little drops of rain began to fall, slowly cascading its way down the window, as Eglin seriously pondered why he volunteered for the post of Minister of Security.\n\nCursing under his breath, he picked up the latest headlines from the Cape Times. His eyes widened as he saw the words that adorned the newspapers. An abhorring sight. "WAR SITUATION IN SOUTH AFRICA DIRE, UNITED STATES TO WITHDRAW", "SOUTH AFRICAN ARMY FOLDS TO THE HUNS" He knew that the situation of the South African Army was dire, and that some of them have been easily folding to the Boer insurgents in the Veld, yet America was now leaving South Africa to fend on its own?\n\nIn a stolid heartbeat, he dialed his counterpart, the Secretary of Defense, in Washington to inquire about the reports. Eglin was insidiously told that due to an uncertain war in South Africa, and the rapidly declining situation, the United States would commit to a withdrawal of all assets and civilians in the country.

Not a day goes by without a report from the front telling us of entire brigades abandoning their posts - even when they were clearly in fortified, defensive positions - and dissolving into the wind, like ghosts. Even better, the Americans have also abandoned their ally and have started a slow, crawling retreat to the coast. Our intelligence hasn't fully deciphered the reason yet. Whether they're attempting one last, pathetic stand against us or they've realized the inevitable and are fleeing Africa, with their tails behind their legs, we can't be sure. What we can be sure of, however, is that our men will not miss being harassed by their fighter jets or the sight of entire acres of jungle and grassland being set on fire by their bombers.\n\nThe struggle is not over yet, to be sure. While entire cities fall into our hands, like dominoes, the only way we will be able to proclaim a true victory is by driving our enemies into the Atlantic. When the last American is either gone, dead, or captured, and when our flag stands tall above the Houses of Parliament in Kaapstadt, then we will have won. We are so close to our own personal Endsieg. Let's not falter, now. Vorwärts!"

 saw_collapse.10.d: "Today, the last of US forces in South Africa have pulled out of Capetown, leaving behind what little of the government and military that remains which has yet to collapse or disband.\n\nFor the most part, with order in South Africa collapsing and the Germans encroaching on the capital, we should consider ourselves lucky that we evacuated with what we had when we did. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same for the South Africans. While we did manage to bring some administrative positions into a position of comfortable exile, many were either left or lost in the chaos, something which has only worsened the position of the remnant forces which we have left behind. Similarly, there have been scattered collections of bases that we have been forced into leaving behind, containing small caches of equipment, and that's to say nothing of the near-countless South African troops still fighting. Unfortunately, there is nothing more we can do for them. Countless Americans have died fighting for the South Africans, and risking anything more would be a senseless gamble.\n\nWhile we have evacuated all necessary personnel, we must not be so careless in the future. South Africa can happen again, and we must be ready to not repeat the same mistakes."

 saw_collapse.11.t: "A Missed Opportunity"
 saw_collapse.11.d: "The reports coming in are sparse, though we now have reason to believe that the Americans have entirely evacuated from South Africa, with their last troop transports having lifted off sometime last night. As our own siege on the capital has been deemed unsatisfactory by many of the Generals present for the battle, it has become apparent that our attempts to break the defenses of the South Africans have been insufficient. Even still, with the Americans out, the South African government now exists without support to prop it up, and things seem to finally be going our way.\n\nAs according to a Zentralafrikan officer involved in the siege, a message has come through from the South African government, admitting to a total surrender of the city and government. With the Americans out of the picture, and the South African army already dissolving en masse, it's widely accepted that the war has been won, and Afrika is secure.\n\nOf course, the shockwaves of this conflict will continue for ages to come, for good or for bad. For instance, plenty of valuable equipment left over from the evacuation has already made its way into our hands, with technical teams investigating exactly how to use these newfound American treasures. Unfortunately, across the entirety of the former South African state, local resistance is on the rise, with too few of the spoils being redirected towards the Boer state's counterinsurgency programs, at least at the moment. For now, we have the support of the Reich, A loyal state to our south, and most importantly, time. With these firmly in our grasp, the Reich's place in Afrika has been secured, and will remain secured forevermore."

 saw_collapse.12.d: "For several nights in a row, Prime Minister Graaff was worried. With the last of the American evacuations underway, and the horrific scenes of chaotic crowds largely muted at this point, a strange, silent, eerie atmosphere arose. Graaff slowly fiddled with his thumbs, as his advisors rushed in and out of the room, carrying recent reports of the bleak war front that were sure to be irrelevant a few hours later. Reports emblazoning the large, bold words "CAPE TOWN UNDER DISTRESS", "BOERS CAPTURE KEY DISTRICTS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF CAPE TOWN", and "RECENT CASUALTY LOSSES OF THE WAR" were forever engraved in the mind of De Viliers Graaff.\n\nA tear streamed down his face. It was over, he thought, not only the war but the nation itself. His efforts went in vain, yet here he is. Only the civilians of South Africa could watch with bated breath what was to become of their lives.\n\nWith the withdrawal of the final foreign troops from the nation, and the conclusion of secret discussions with the Schild, it was decided that the state of South Africa would unconditionally surrender to the Boer Republic in order to prevent the years long blood feud that lasted between brothers.\n\nThat afternoon, the South African government was declared null and void, with Prime Minister Graaff himself going on the radio for one last time and announcing, "I declare the Cape Town government dissolved at all levels.""

The smiling faces and hopeful determination of our men are gone. Now lie the cold, rotting carcasses of fathers, sons and brothers. The refugees continue to come in their thousands. Their skeletal faces and thousand-yard stares are only surpassed, in their horror, by the hundreds of tales and accounts that they carry. Some retell the sight of an entire horizon, set on fire, by the endless fleet of the Luftwaffe. Others tell of men, in all shapes and colors, all too eager to unleash hell on villages and towns, driven into their animalistic furor by their insatiable greed. The unluckiest few tell the tale of a yellowish cloud, as fast as a gazelle, that kills within minutes and brutally maims those it leaves behind.\n\nToday, these stories have become far too real. As our men scramble to evacuate Africa, the Germans are poised to overrun Cape Town. Cargo planes, and helicopters, dot the skies above the city, carrying everything and everyone imaginable. The situation on the ground has deteriorated so fast that the Iberian Ambassador hitched a ride in the same helicopter used by his American counterpart. Already, reports have come of soldiers forced to shoot on crowds; to prevent them from overrunning the airports and bases currently being used. Unverified sightings of Waffen-SS commandos in the city have only added to the pure, unrelenting hysteria throughout Cape Town - their reinforcements could be hours, maybe minutes away from the Capital.\n\nToday is not a day to be choosy. We will have to leave planes to gather dust. We will have to leave our tanks, with their tanks filled. We will have to abandon some of our men to the enemy. Avoiding this fact or trying to mitigate it is delusional. There is only one bottom line to this. The United States of America is defeated."

In fact, it has fallen so fast, the American troops that were helping the lap-dog South African government failed to evacuate in time, and have been captured by the superior German troops of the Reichskommisariats and our loyal Boer allies.\n\nAmerican and South African troops have been surrendering in the hundreds and thousands, leaving their positions around the city and into the mountains: the entire American command post on Table Mountain was captured virtually intact, though with most of the important documents burnt before they could be secured. However, we have still managed to capture American made army vehicles, weapons systems, communication equipment and much, much more. All the enemy soldiers are currently being taken to POW camps for further processing.\n\nReports of looting in the posh communities of Mouille Point, Three Anchor Bay and others along the Atlantic Seaboard area have been received by High Command. The Cape Flats community, where most of the African population had been relocated to over the past few decades, is currently the scene of vicious riots and gun fights between black vigilantes and troublemakers and Boer and RK soldiers trying to maintain order.\n\nWith the fall of the South African capital by the RK and Boer blitzkrieg attack, the war must be close to an end."

The American evacuation plan had failed-and now their troops were stranded-witnessing the dreadful apogee.\n\nThe Schild had finally entered Cape Town, and all hope had supposedly been lost. However, the little hope that held out was the heroic stand of American, South African, and OFN troops that were stationed in the city. A stand against tyranny-despite the ceasing of supplies. A refusal of surrender-no matter the cost. They were outcasted by the OFN, yet they'd fight until the very end. Even as it rains the blood-stained helicopters that were intended to evacuate them, or the occasional artillery shells that would eventually end their lives.\n\nWhile we have lost hope, and while these warriors of valor will perhaps be forgotten in due time, let it be known that we stood in valiant manner-whatever it takes to fight for the last flame of democracy in Africa."

  # Report Events
  saw_report.1.t: "Throwing In The Towel"
  saw_report.1.desc: "President Richard Nixon had always felt that he was good with the media. All you had to do was smile, say the right words in a reassuring tone, sprinkle in a few jokes here and there, and you had won them and the people over. Yet, no personal charisma could save him from the situation unfolding before him. The press conference had been called to announce the USA's withdrawal of forces from Africa after the devastating defeat and overrunning of South Africa by the German African colonies. Not only had the OFN now lost a valuable ally - the last democracy in Africa - and left the Nazis in domination over that continent, but tens of thousands of American men had died - many heroically in last stands defending what remained of South Africa.\n\n"Mr. President, will you take responsibility for dragging the nation into this war, where so many of our sons, brothers, friends, have died?" One journalist, whose cousin he later on would learn had been captured, almost shouted, his face flushed with crimson.\n\nIt was an unfair question. What was he meant to do, surrender a crucial ally to the Reich? All he could do was apologize and express his condolences at the deaths and the grieving.\n\n"Mr. Nixon, questions of the wisdom of us getting involved in the first place aside, do you not feel that you, as our commander-in-chief, had a part in the conduct - or, should I say, misconduct - of the war?"\n\nOn one hand, Nixon felt the need to defend himself: he wasn't a military man or a general; he signed executive orders, not war plans. Yet, the reporter had a point. The chiefs of staff held frequent meetings with him and the Cabinet. Maybe if he had paid more attention or contributed more during those...\n\nThe press conference was cut short after a few more scathing questions and remarks about the NPP's surge in the polls. As the leader of the Free World retreated from the press briefing room, his thoughts were only on the disappointment of a hundred million people."
  saw_report.1.a: "Yet another font of American despair."

  saw_report.2.t: "Now What?"
  saw_report.2.desc: "The Cabinet stared at Westmoreland and Nixon, the tension invisible yet building, as the unspoken questions lingered in the air like a toxic gas, corroding the tension in the room until either one of the men could say something on the South African War. Incidentally, the man to make the first move of confessing his confusion was the one who was responsible for the victory.\n\n"I don't know how it happened, exactly. I would only describe it as the total and complete breakdown of control from the German colonies- which, I mean, it makes sense that this would happen, but..." Nixon raised his hand as if he was hushing a child.\n\n"Well, frankly, I think that this went precisely to plan." Nixon looked around to those sitting around him. "Do I hear any disagreements on that particular statement?"\n\nMinister of Defence Laird chimed in. "Sir, with all due respect, this is the best-case scenario, yes, but it shouldn't have happened this soon- let alone with this much ease. On the subject, Westmoreland, we're going to need more details than 'it happened'."\n\nWestmoreland scowled. "You were there during the briefings, Laird, you know damn well about the specifics. In short, for the uninitiated-" Westmoreland gestured to the rest of the room that hadn't been sitting on the same couch as him. "-the African campaign was expected to last the remainder of this presidency and a half. The collapse of the German lines after some admittedly lucky breakthroughs seems to have been enough, with the South Africans covering our flanks as necessary. Again, I cannot understate how unlikely it was for the lines to break as they had." President Nixon nodded, though he couldn't admit to having listened for the most part. The only thing that he could attest to was the sheer amount of ideas rushing through his head as to what to do next about Germany's collapsing sphere."

Even as the calming voice of Walter Cronkite filtered in from the television, the remnants of German resistance in Africa were laying down their arms. Kennedy almost couldn't believe it, were it not for the litany of reports and records that flowed unabated from Africa even amid Nixon's resignation. Not to mention the Press Corps, who had taken to the conflict like ducks to water.\n\nKennedy flipped to the latest reports delivered to the office, timetables, and estimates for an American withdrawal drawn up by the DOD and the State Department. Projections for continued resistance and necessary troop numbers cobbled together out of reports from Lansdale, the SOG, and the South Africa Command. The picture painted was inconsistent and contradictory but pointed to a continued American presence measured in years instead of months.\n\nAnd all before he had even had the chance to run for re-election, Kennedy chuckled. Whatever it may be, it was a victory, and even if they had to stay till 72' and even if Nixon had gotten the ball rolling. They had won, he had won, and wasn't about to linger on it until he had to, he had an election to win after all."

It had been why he'd turned to family. Maybe Bobby would have some wisdom he didn't. After a half-hour of somber conversation, he finally paused for breath. Bobby spoke a few seconds later. "It's a mess, John. But it's not your fault."\n\nKennedy smiled bitterly at that. "I'm the President of the United States, Bobby. It is my fault."\n\n"You inherited this war from Nixon," Bobby retorted. "You did everything you could. This was because of Nixon's incompetence, nothing else."\n\nExcept that wasn't true. Kennedy couldn't forget his hours in the situation room, committing more soldiers, resources, making promises and managing expectations. Had the war started under Nixon? Sure. That didn't mean he was an innocent bystander - he'd been vice president after all. To throw Nixon further under the bus...that struck him as wrong.\n\n"It's not that simple Bobby, and you know it," he finally said. "I'm not going to put all the blame on Nixon, no matter how easy it would be."\n\nHe heard the sigh of exasperation on the other end. "Fine, fine, then at least say you inherited his mess. Don't you dare take all the blame for this." Kennedy felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him, as the clock struck a late hour. It was all so very tiring."

  saw_report.5.desc: "It seemed anticlimactic, really.\n\nIt felt wrong to think that somehow, the press conference was about to begin after all, and on a simply objective level it was a momentous occasion. The war was over, America's boys were coming home. It was over. President McCormack was about to address the nation to tell them the good news, was he not? The peace talks had been all over the news for the past several days, so they knew what he was about to say. He adjusted his tie, straightened his suit, and firmed up his shoulders, not really out of any sense of nervousness or trepidation, but out of some vain hope that such fussing would make all of this seem less hollow somehow.\n\nHe took his first steps from behind the curtain, and towards the podium. Time moved in slow motion, or maybe it was just his thoughts firing off at a mile a minute. Status quo ante bellum. All of the fighting, all of the dying, all that America had invested in the recently-ended conflict just for everything to remain as it was before. Almost like it was some sick joke. All of the fighting, all of the dying, just for nothing to fundamentally change in the end.\n\nHe took his place behind the podium and slowly gripped either side of it with his hands, drumming his fingers along the top of it. Videos rolled, cameras flashed, a thousand and one microphones were held up in his direction while just as many pencils went scritch-scratch on tiny notebooks, prepared to scrutinize and analyze every breath he uttered. This was normal.\n\nEveryone knew that this wasn't what he, nor the rest of the administration he'd inherited, had wanted. What had started as a simple intervention to preserve the sovereignty of the sole African Democracy had morphed and transformed into a grand crusade against Fascism, the first of its kind since the World War had ended. A war to liberate the peoples of Africa. On paper, the enemy had been rebuffed, South Africa had been saved. A victory, but not nearly the victory anyone had been hoping for. That this country needed.\n\nHe cleared his throat and took a deep breath, and he began the press conference officially."

He'd often thought on how victory had been so draining to him, he'd hate to find out what defeat would have done to him.\n\nOn the other end of the line, was De Villiers Graaff, president of South Africa. His voice carried a great deal more energy, but it was hard to tell if it was legitimate or a simple facade. "Hello, President McCormack." The way he said the word 'President' felt like it was like he was still getting used to referring to John that way. "President Graaff, speaking. I would like to congratulate you on the ceasefire. It must be a weight off of your shoulders, what with everything."\n\nJohn rubbed at his temples. "That's just the thing." He leaned forward onto the Presidential desk, propping his head and the phone he spoke into upon his elbow. "It's not. Not just yet. I don't know if we can truly call the situation stable at this juncture, are you sure that everything's..."\n\nHe trailed off, and the President of South Africa filled the void. "It is as was said before. We have the situation well in hand here. The new territories will be integrated, and the Germans cannot be expected to hold on for very long after the bloody nose they have received." He sounded confident. Overconfident maybe? But it was a sight better of a sound than the trepidation that John felt. "Of course, unless you mean things at home."\n\nMcCormack was silent. He'd hit the nail on the head, but he wasn't too pleased about it. Here they were, celebrating the continued freedom of South Africa, and he couldn't get his mind off the party. The elections. Would this be enough to salvage the R-Ds chances? He had no way of knowing.\n\nAll the same, Graaff sounded certain. Impossibly so. "Make no mistake. What you have accomplished here will not be ignored by the American people. This is the first time Fascism has been defeated on the field of battle, this will not go unnoticed. South Africa is secure, and with her, so is America. Take heart.""

The initial report by the CIA had been hours ago, and the rest of the world had already been notified of the South African government's surrender and dissolution. Normally, after a moment to process news like this, he was fine, ready to face the world and all of its inhabitants. Now though? He couldn't stand to face the television, much less anyone else. That's why he was alone in the White House's rose garden. He hadn't even seen Joyce since then.\n\nHe had been dealt a bad hand. Everyone knew that, even the press was calling him "unfortunate" rather than "incompetent", a luxury that he knew he'd only have until the next cycle came about, and the NPP's dogs were allowed off their leash following the expected grieving period. But it was true, all the same. The impeachment, the assassination, could it all have happened at a worse time? The last election they'd be riding high, and now here they were, at the end of just another crippling disaster to follow the last three.\n\nOf course, would this have happened under another president? Under Nixon or Kennedy's watch? That's what they'd be asking at the end of the day, and in truth, it's what he should be wondering too. If it had been just one of them before all of this, at least the other half of the establishment could pick up the slack. One disaster could've been recovered from with ease, but this was a catastrophe that affected the Republicans and Democrats with near-equal effectiveness.\n\nAs long as there had been Republicans and Democrats, every American President was either, and as much as John McCormack tried to push it out of his mind, he couldn't help but wonder if there would be another one. If he were a strategist with the NPP right about now, he'd be salivating over what this meant for the R-Ds.\n\nAs fresh as the wounds were though, the past was the past, and now was no time to sulk. He bent down to a particularly bright red rose in the bush, and took a brief sniff of it, enjoying the fragrance, before closing his eyes and steeling himself.

The historicity of the moment was overwhelming, to the point that President John McCormack almost couldn't hear General Westmoreland on the other end of the line.\n\n"...And to tell you the truth, that was the absolute last of organized German resistance." Westmoreland didn't sound at ease. Pleased? For certain. But definitely not at ease. "As for the locals, well... That's a fight that's just beginning."\n\n"Of course, of course." That was John's own space-filling method, when he needed a second to catch up to what William was saying. The locals, right. "We have an obligation here. They are free, but if we just leave now, it will just leave a power vacuum across the entire continent, to such a point that maybe the Germans would find a way to slip back in in all that mess."\n\nThen his mind shifted right back to the home front. So much had happened during the war. The impeachment, the assassination, his own swearing in as President. What stroke of fortune allowed them to win under these circumstances anyways? The organization at the top of it all had never been this disorganized, in many wars, that was as good as a death sentence. But here they were, standing atop the smoldering remains of three dismantled German colonies and a freed continent.\n\nWestmoreland was not privy to his ruminations, so he just kept talking about business. "I get that. I'm not saying we need to pull out, but we're going to need to put some serious thought into this. The mid-war plans just aren't enough. We got nearly three million square miles of land to deal with, and God knows how many people."\n\n"Of course, of course." The President reassured the general. "We can and will revise the old plans, draft up new ones if need be." He couldn't quite get himself past the realization that they had won. He had won. In what universe did John W. McCormack preside over a victorious war? The liberation of an entire continent? It was beyond belief, even to himself. It was hard to discuss such serious matters of state while one felt like they were in a dream instead, after all.\n\n"Well, we'd better. I'll leave you to it, Mister President."\n\n"Congratulations, general. We'll see this thing through, just you wait and see.""

As if the hands of God had chosen to strike him down in Dallas that day. Leaving the Presidency to McCormack, and then to him, a war in Africa to clean up too. Johnson glanced at Washington's portrait.\n\nNot that it made much of a difference, South Africa would remain free, but the Germans would hold their ground. An unsatisfying end. Was it a suitable price to pay for the thousands of dead boys? Not even counting those maimed or missing.\n\n"Mr. President?" asked the voice of Johnson's Chief of Staff.\n\n"What is it, Jenkins?"\n\n"Prime Minister De Graaff is here to see you.

Everyone wanted to ask questions now that the South African War had ended - decisively in the favor of South Africa, and by extension, the Organization of Free Nations. The questions were rapid, and he had to barely gesture before the questions were rattled off. "President Johnson, is South Africa planning to join the OFN?"\n\n"We cannot make any comment on ongoing negotiations," he answered with a smile, which was likely all the hint he needed to give.\n\n"President Johnson," another asked as cameras snapped. "Will the United States press Africa on racial equality now that the war is won?"\n\nThey never could ask simple questions, could they? "The question of racial equality I intend to raise with President de Graaff, and I'm confident they will address this concern soon."\n\n"Mr. President," another reporter asked. "Do you believe the numerous deaths of American servicemen was justified?"\n\nHe resisted a sigh - that was not the first time this had been brought up. Nonetheless he kept his tone upbeat. "America is the beacon of the free world, and our duty is to protect democracy no matter where it may be. The sacrifices of our brave servicemen have ensured that democracy continues to flourish in Africa. There is no price too high to pay for democracy, and those who gave their lives for it will be remembered as heroes."\n\nHe didn't know if the reporter was satisfied, but he hoped it would reassure those who were listening.

The South African War was over, but the cost had been great.\n\nToo great.\n\nSouth Africa remained, but a shadow of its former self. The Boers were now established, de Graaff had been humiliated, and the OFN had been embarrassed on the world stage. Johnson supposed it could have been worse, but he admittedly didn't know by how much.\n\nDe Graaff was not taking the situation well. "I don't know why I'm bothering here," he muttered, as if to himself. "It's pointless right now. You, the OFN, you barely lost anything, and now you want to force me to join now that I don't have a choice." His eyes were angry, but also lost. "You should have done more."\n\nJohnson faced him sternly, his own frustration boiling over. "I'm going to ignore that because I know you're angry, but don't you dare imply that I, or anyone else, wanted this. My soldiers - and others in the OFN - died for your country, de Graaff. Don't dare insult their sacrifices."\n\n"I-" de Graaff sighed deeply, closing his eyes. "I apologize. It's just...I'm just angry. Not at you, not really. Just...everything."\n\nJohnson sighed and leaned back, knowing this was going to be a long conversation. "We're not going to get anywhere like this. We have to move on."

"I trust your flight back was pleasant? I hope the press didn't give you too much trouble."\n\n"No. No trouble at all, sir," Westmoreland replied evenly.\n\n"Good to hear.

It had yet to hit the mainstream news yet, but it would only be hours before it was confirmed. South Africa was lost. The writing had been on the wall, as they had suffered defeat after defeat. The CIA reports and military assessments had painted grim pictures, and despite repeated failures, Johnson had hoped they could pull through. Yet it hadn't been enough. Not even close.\n\nThe last light of democracy in Africa had been extinguished. He could only imagine the horror that was to follow.\n\nIt begged a single, simple question.\n\n"What happened?"\n\nThe words faded into silence as the room mutely acknowledged his question. One that begged an answer, but which no one had the ability or courage to say. A few awkward coughs sounded. His Cabinet moved their eyes away when he looked at them, and the generals just swallowed uncomfortably. But no one spoke. No one could.\n\nJohnson knew the news would generate speculation and drama about how this would affect the party in the elections - but right now that seemed trivial compared to the hell which was about to be created in Africa.

  saw_report.15.t: "Peace With Honor"
  saw_report.15.desc: "STILL WATERS IN AFRICA: PRESIDENT BENNETT'S PEACE STEADIES THE BOAT" read the lead story of the New York Times' editorial section. Wallace Bennett poured over page after page of newsprint; watched hour after hour of nightly news. The war in Africa had come to a close, but the war for his legacy was just beginning. He had negotiated a white peace in Nixon's endless war, a feat that he was quite proud of, but one he feared the American public would mistake for weakness. Unfortunately, it would be exceptionally unpresidential to fire the opening salvos in such a war of historical narrative, and so he was forced to sit at the Resolute Desk and read.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the peace was a "necessary and mature conclusion to an unnecessary and immature war". Walter Cronkite assented, but the Wall Street Journal disagreed. In the eyes of the Journal, Bennett had "betrayed African democracy, and allowed the fascist dogs of the Afrika-Schild to continue to run their inhumane fiefdoms". Still, the Journal had been against him from the word "go"; they would accept no less than Ludwig von Mises himself in the Oval Office.\n\nAfter nearly a full three days of channel surfing and funny pages, Bennett was forced to accept the unexpected reality of the situation: America was behind him. Against his every expectation, the average American was happy to see an end to the war, even if that end was a simple return to the status quo. Mothers were overjoyed to see their sons; sisters, their brothers. More than that, the OFN had set out to defend South Africa, and sure as rain, South Africa was free. The war had been costly and unpopular. Any end to it was welcome, let alone an end that accomplished the original goals. According to some intelligent-but-overbearing RD analysts, the peace actually was giving Bennett a notable polling boost. According to them, it proved he was a "skilled diplomat, dedicated to world peace".\n\nClearly, the white peace was going over swimmingly with the American people. Either way, an occupation of all of continental Africa would have been... costly. On the whole, the expected "war for his legacy" had already been won! Bennett the Peacemaker, he could get behind that. There was just one thing though..."

  saw_report.16.desc: "A fairly swift war, a successful defense of African democracy, and a kick in the pants to the damned Reichskommissariats. A grand anti-fascist crusade this was not, but I would still call this a rousing success!" De Villiers Graaff had a wide, confident stance. He carried a small cube, about the size and shape of an engagement ring box. Despite his confidence, he was clearly fearful for the future of South Africa. The United States had undergone significant domestic unrest over the course of the South African War, but South Africa had undergone a full blown civil war. In Bennett's eyes, however, the unrest was all in the past. The war was over.\n\n"A kick to the pants indeed. I can imagine Han Huttig with that ridiculous haircut screaming at his cronies until he's red in the face! Masters of Europe, perhaps, but certainly not masters of Africa! With the formal South African entry into the OFN, the torch of liberty blazer ever brighter against the darkness of the world!" Bennett internally grimaced; he was not a fan of bombastic rhetoric, and wished he had chosen his words in a more restrained manner. De Graaf, for his part, seemed pleased that the President was bursting with passion, and passed him the small box.\n\n"It's a personal gift from me to you." Bennett opened the box. Inside was a small vial of dirt, attached to a note that read 'With Love, From Inverness'. "I know the gift of dirt may seem unorthodox, but please allow me to explain myself. I served in the Second World War, and I was decorated for my actions during the defense of the Home Isles. As I evacuated out of Inverness onto some overcrowded American destroyer, I scooped a pile of dirt from the Scottish soil, and resolved to return it when Europe was inevitably freed from fascist. At the outbreak of the Schild intervention, I did the same thing with some dirt just outside of my family home in Tygerberg. Thanks to OFN intervention, my nation has weathered the Schild intervention, and I have returned the soil to Tygerberg. The soil in that vial is the same soil I took from Inverness. Wallace, the Prime Minister of South Africa is a powerful position, but it is a gnat compared to the Führer and the President. It is up to you to liberate Europe and return this soil to the Scottish Highlands."

South Africa was still free, it was still a democratic torch against the darkness of fascism. The Reichskommissariats remained teetering on the edge of collapse. Prime Minister de Graaf had negotiated official South African entry into the OFN, giving mutual economic benefits. Yes, it could have all ended much worse.\n\nAnd what would have been the prize for winning it all anyway? Military occupation of the world's second largest continent? A years-long "de-Nazificiation" program? Continued domestic unrest and foriegn condemnation? No, this whole damn South African War was a zero-sum game. Nixon was a fool, trying to use this war as a quick electoral jump-start without considering the quagmire it could become. The war proved to be the nail in Nixon's lead-lined coffin, and it was dragging Bennett down with him!\n\nThe war was over, peace was secure. Husbands would come back to wives; fathers to children. No matter who "won", or "lost", there was an end to the death. Bennett found some level of peace in that. To his credit, he was not the only one. As he sat channel surfing in the Oval Office, Bennett found that even the most scathing editorial agreed that peace for peace's sake was a thing worth celebrating.\n\nNo one was truly "happy" with the outcome of the war (an expensive, deadly, and unpopular war that culminates in a humiliating ceasefire is not bound for the Fields of Elysium), but it seems that the nation was fundamentally in agreement with President Bennett."

Still, the PR opportunities of holding a press conference in the ruined administrative center of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika were too perfect to pass up. The ruined white marble of Quelimane was marked with bullet holes and singed with gunpowder, but Bennett's press secretary made sure an American flag was visibly flying from the top of the Arisierungsbüro Ostafrika, in front of which President Bennett would answer questions concerning the future of Africa. Unfurled behind the makeshift stage was a massive OFN banner emblazoned with the simple phrase "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!".\n\n"President Bennett, how heavily involved will the OFN be in Africa long-term? Put another way, are our boys coming home?" Bennett knew this reporter. She worked for the LA Times, and constantly knew the exact questions to get under his skin. He naturally assumed she was a National Progressive voter.\n\n"Major combat operations in Africa have ended. In the battle for Africa, the OFN has prevailed. That being said, our mission continues. By all accounts, we have difficult work to do in Africa. This is a continent that went from colonial overlords to the brutal bloody hands of the Nazis. The OFN believes in self determination, but to completely pull out now would just consign the African people to a chaotic, undemocratic future. Just as I advocate for a stable, level handed domestic policy, Africa deserves stable, level handed leadership. William Westmoreland has already begun establishing several OFN-lead 'mandates' that will culminate in the full decolonization of Africa. Eventually, it will be though we were never here, except for the infrastructure, schools, clean drinking water, economic opportunity, and political freedom." While Bennett found his answer to be holistic, certain boat-rocking reporters clearly disagreed, and the questions rolled in. "What will the political structure of these 'mandates' be?" "What kind of timeframe can be expected for decolonization to take place?" "Will post-mandate governments be elected or appointed?"\n\nBennett had just said Westmoreland was preparing the mandates dammit! Why don't they try asking him?

It didn't matter that the war was lost, because the war was never over. The dead were buried in the ground and in the hearts of those they left behind. For the mothers, and the wives, and the sons, and the cousins, and the friends, and the party-comrades, and the furtive lovers, the war would never end. They would never have their loved ones back. Wallace Bennett took them away, and buried them in red Angolan soil. This silent crowd of protesters rallying against a war already lost stared at Bennett as he looked out of the windows of the Oval Office.\n\n"What the hell went wrong? Could the most powerful military in the world not crush a few rouge Germans? Were you not paid enough? Did you not have enough fucking medals pinned to your fucking chest to motivate you to win the war?" President Bennett was a man very slow to anger. But when an American ally was driven into the sea, when a hundred thousand Americans died for nothing, when every single television pundit was howling for his head, Wallace Bennett could get very heated indeed. William Westmoreland, a man who just a year ago was drawing up plans for the OFN occupation of Ostafrika, attempted to calm the President.\n\n"There was no way we could have won this, Mister President. Marching an army 2,000 miles from Cape Town to Quelimane, across desert and jungle, while also fighting off hostile Boer partisans was simply unfeasible from the start. It was a lost cause, nothing more." Bennett continued to stare out the window, refusing to face his cabinet. He put his hand up to stop Westmoreland from continuing.\n\n"How did Sherman march his army from Atlanta to the sea, completely disconnected from the Union supply lines? How did Washington defeat the British forces at Yorktown? How did the British hold the Zulu at Rorke's Drift? No, this was no 'lost cause'. You are either malicious, or incompetent. I hope for your own sake that it is the latter." Bennett had replaced his hot rage with cool anger, and continued to watch the gathered crowd outside."

South Africa's democracy still lives, and the German Colonies can do their thing, can't everyone just be happy, and let him do his own business?\n\nHis gaze must have wandered to the reporter, as his inner thought process is interrupted by the southern accent of the man, a small detail that relaxed his own posture, even if microscopically so.\n\n"Sir, with the War's end, what will be American's next steps to secure South Africa? How can you guarantee the safety of our allies across the sea, especially if the German Colonies try something like that again?"\n\nWallace cleared his throat, internally smiling. It really paid off to know what certain journalists will ask sometimes.\n\n"We've seen, time and time again, tyranny in the world collapse. Germany and the world at large saw that America will not leave her allies wanting, prey to the odious tides of the Reich, neither the Sphere, but we are the bulwark of democracy, first and foremost. They can knock, they can slam, they can throw all their weight, but we'll simply tire it out."\n\n"But sir, couldn't you have won the war? Vast lands of Africa are still under the Schild's control, including territories South Africa requested?"\n\nThis innocent question fired up the reporters like sharks around blood in the water, and just like that, Wallace's press conference got progressively tougher."

Fewer skirmishes than last month," Westmoreland replied in a sharp, gruff tone.\n\nWallace quietly nodded, sitting up in his chair as he rested his elbows on the table. "And the refugees?"\n\n"Mr. President, we can't hope to keep all the refugees out. Just know that every day, fewer people are crossing the border. Soon enough, the refugees won't be a problem."\n\nThe President nodded as his stern face brightened at the news. The air in the Oval Office was starting to feel much less tense now.

Wallace had invested so much time into this bleak war on this bleak continent that he began to neglect the worsening situation at home. All his stress in the previous months manifested in this one war, and while South Africa had persevered, the continent remained shrouded in darkness; this outcome would not win the support of the American people. And now, his Cabinet, surrounding him, looked and felt like some twisted kangaroo court, watching for his next move.\n\n"The Afrika Schild's police force is at work integrating former South African territories, slaughtering any resistance. The refugees living in this land are flooding back into South Africa, and the country is facing crises on all sides. Even with our continued support in the region, South Africa is trending downwards, but for now the situation is stable enough."\n\n"Our boys did all they could," Wallace muttered, his arms crossed on the desk, his head hanging low. He had seen this same outcome from his predecessors during the Second World War; two times in the last two decades now that America "did all it could". The feeling of a second defeat at the hands of German forces was bitter for Wallace, and his fists clenched in anger. Now that peace had been agreed upon, Wallace was helpless.\n\nWestmoreland quickly saw the pain in Wallace's expression and could only look down. It was a risk for the President to take, and with the war ending in the Schild's favor, Wallace's promise to end Nazism in Africa was broken. It would be a scar he would have to bear to his party, to the public, to the world stage. The OFN was back to square one."

The war was over now, but could an entire half-continent be brought to enjoy democracy? Under the jackboot there was no hope of prosperity for the Africans, but did the Americans even have a better chance than the Nazi overlords? If Central Africa were to collapse, it would definitely burst the victory bubble Wallace was riding high on.

"Was anything gained in the negotiations, or was the agreement only for a ceasefire?"\n\n"Let me remind you of why we were involved in this war," Kennedy said, lifting a hand. "We answered the call to protect an ally from being invaded by an enemy. We did not go to conquer, but protect. We did exactly what we set out to do."\n\nA few more questions followed, and he answered them deftly, before pointing at a woman in the back who spoke. "President Kennedy, with no significant changes to the borders, is it possible that the Germans may once again try to attack South Africa?"\n\n"The Germans threw everything they had into this conquest," Kennedy answered. "They are weak, their morale is broken, and they have to contend with their own domestic issues. I assure you, we have nothing to fear from a repeated invasion."\n\nThe press conference continued for a while yet, as Kennedy continued answering questions. At the end of the day, this outcome wouldn't overly help or hurt him, and for that, he supposed, it was something to be grateful for. Africa may still be under the shadow of the Reich - but at least there remained yet a torch of liberty in it."

  saw_report.26.t: "Silencing the Critics"
  saw_report.26.desc: "Robert F. Kennedy found that even his critics had found nothing to protest about the results of the South Africa War. Simply keeping the Germans at bay had been the expectation of most, and they had not only achieved that, but been able to dictate terms to the Germans. He was going to make sure the nation heard it.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen," he began at the press conference that was packed with reporters and media outlets. "We have finished the dictation of terms to the Afrika-Schild, which they have accepted. The South Africa War is over, they are in the process of integrating the newly liberated territories."\n\nThere was applause at the declaration, and all of them seemed happy. It was good to be on the winning side - and there were tangible wins here. It was not a return to the status quo, but as Kennedy saw it, the beginning of the inevitable collapse of the German presence in Africa. "Mr. President," a reporter asked. "With the gains that were able to be made, why did we agree to any ceasefire terms? Should we not have liberated all the continent from German tyranny?"\n\nThat had been the most sustained complaint he'd heard - which was that he should have done more. "Our mission was to support our ally in their time of need," Kennedy answered. "That is what we did, and far more. While it is unfortunate that there remain people under German tyranny, I cannot in good conscience send our people in uniform to continue fighting and dying for an uncertain end."\n\nSeeing an opportunity, he elaborated. "To continue, and take the German place in Africa, even if we had achieved this, would be an incalculable burden upon America, and a responsibility that, in the end, is simply not worth the loss of time, men, and resources. Make no mistake - the German control over Africa is weakening, and I am certain that we will see their liberation soon.""

  saw_report.27.t: "Limiting the Damage"
  saw_report.27.desc: "Robert F. Kennedy knew that he was going to come out of this press conference damaged. Anyone who even paid the slightest bit of attention would see this for what it was - a defeat. Not a catastrophic one, South Africa still endured, and hadn't been completely overrun. It was a small consolation.\n\n"Good morning," he opened. "I am pleased to report that a ceasefire has been signed to bring the South African War to an end. Through the brave sacrifices of our servicemen, the light of democracy in Africa still burns, and our mission has been accomplished."\n\nThe questions immediately began . "President Kennedy, how can you say the mission was accomplished when South Africa has been forced to cede territory to the Germans and Boers?"\n\n"I will remind everyone what our mission was," Kennedy said, knowing the answer would not be convincing. "It was to defend South Africa from the invasion of a foreign power, and the fact of the matter is that South Africa still stands."\n\nAnother burst of questions arose. "Mr. President, can you articulate exactly what our soldiers died for in this lost war?"\n\n"It was not a lost war," Kennedy pushed back. "It did not end in our favor, but it was not lost. Prolonging the war would have only resulted in more of our soldiers dead, and that was something I considered carefully when making the decision. But I reject that our soldiers died for nothing - they died in defense of democracy. They died fighting the evil of the German Reich, and ensured that a bastion of hope in Africa was not extinguished."\n\nIt wasn't going to convince most people, but it might mollify some of them. Kennedy braced himself as the questions continued, and resigned himself to the fact that the best he could do here was not sway the public to his side, but only limit the damage."

  saw_report.28.t: "A New Day Over Africa"
  saw_report.28.desc: "The news surrounding the outcome of the South African War had been reported on the televisions all day, but when it was announced that President Kennedy was making a national address, millions gathered around their televisions, eagerly waiting to hear what he had to say. The suited and smiling president sat in the Oval Office, exuding an air of confidence as he faced the camera directly, before finally speaking.\n\n"My fellow Americans," he said. "I am pleased to share with you the news that the last pockets of organized German resistance in Africa have collapsed, and their leaders dead, captured, or fled. We have defeated the Afrika-Schild, and with it, the shadow over the continent has been lifted. We are victorious, and the South African War is over."\n\nWhere crowds gathered to watch the address, they broke into cheers and celebrations across the country began. There were many reasons to celebrate the victory, not just for democracy, but by dealing a significant blow against Germany and fascism across the world.\n\n"To prevent the continent from falling into anarchy," Kennedy continued. "The Organization of Free Nations has begun the process of establishing Mandates in the continent, which will exist to transition the continent to democracies, and prevent unnecessary power vacuums and violence."\n\n"For decades, Africa has suffered," Kennedy finished. "Under the Reich, and under colonialism. We will work to repair this magnitude of damage," the President paused. "We have successfully defeated the German menace, but our work to better the world continues. A new day shines over Africa, and for that I thank each and every American citizen and serviceman who made this possible.""

  saw_report.29.t: "Nothing"
  saw_report.29.desc: "Robert F. Kennedy sat in an empty room.\n\nHe needed to be alone. He'd justified it to his aides by saying he needed to prepare for the press conference. It hadn't been a lie. His notes were scattered on the table, along with the final reports from the war. But he couldn't concentrate on them long enough; he couldn't format a coherent train of thought to address this, especially to the media who were waiting to pick him apart.\n\nFor once, they might be right.\n\nIt was difficult to look at the numbers from the reports. An uncountable number of lives had been lost. Numerous American soldiers had been returned in coffins. Still more bodies were abandoned and left to rot in the baking African sun. The last bastion of democracy in Africa had been extinguished. The dark continent had grown darker. Everyone was looking for someone to blame.\n\nMost had chosen him.\n\nMaybe it was unfair. He hadn't started the war, he hadn't made the decision to intervene, but no one could say that he hadn't picked up the mantle when he'd become president and try to win. The war had become his, and how many men, how much money, how many resources had been poured into the conflict? It had all been for nothing.\n\nHe had nothing to show for it.\n\nAll of his enemies were sharpening their knives or wasting no time in attacking him. The R-Ds must have been privately thrilled, and he knew this defeat would haunt not just him, but the NPP for a very long time. But there was nothing more he could do now, and he could not wallow in isolation forever. His country needed him."
