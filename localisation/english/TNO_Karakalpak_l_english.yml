 KRK_Ibrahim_Yusupov: "이브라힘 유수포프"
 POLITICS_IBRAHIM_YUSUPOV_DESC: "이브라힘 유수포프의 아버지는 성직자이자 부유한 지주였고, 이때문에 1930년대 소련 당국에 체포되어 \"삭제\"될 주요 표적이 되었습니다. 이로 인해 유수포프는 미혼모 손에 자랐고, 형제자매들에게 밥을 먹이고 옷을 입혀주기 위해 어린아이임에도 일해야 했습니다. 그러나 이 가혹한 성장환경도 시에 대한 애정을 단념시키지 못했고, 그는 스무살에 문학 학위를 마칠 수 있었습니다.\n\n유수포프의 고향인 카라칼파크스탄은 러시아 제국이 점령한 후 소비에트 연방을 거치면서 한 세기 동안 자치권이 점차 약화되었습니다. 당연하게도 연방이 붕괴되자마자 카라칼파크인들은 재빨리 독립을 선언했고 모든 군벌을 물리쳤습니다. 또한 운 좋게도 공산주의와 폭군으로부터 자유민주주의로 우아하게 이행할 수 있었습니다. 권위주의적인 정권들이 그를 억압했었지만 카라칼파크 사회의 자유로운 본성은 유수포프가 시인과 언론인으로서의 경력을 살리고 발전시킬 수 있도록 해주었습니다. 그는 신문 편집자이자 문학 교수로 일했고, 마침내 정계에 입문해 1961년 카라칼파크스탄의 대통령으로 출마했습니다. 작가로서의 인기 덕에 수월하게 유권자 기반을 구축할 수 있었고, 수사적인 지휘로 토론에서 항상 앞서나갔습니다. 하지만 대통령에 당선된 지금, 일부 사람들은 그가 시 이상의 것을 할 수 있는지, 그리고 그가 그렇게 서정적으로 지지한 정책들을 실제로 실행할 수 있는지에 대해 의문을 제기합니다."
 KRK_Kadyrov_Abdurashit: "카디로프 압두라쉬트"
 POLITICS_KADYROV_ABDURASHIT_DESC: "Should you ask anyone what defined the world as they knew it, you would certainly find yourself with a litany of answers depending on who you asked and where they were from. If you asked a young German, he would tell you of the West Russian War, breaking up the world and putting it back together just as it was meant to be. If you asked a young Russian Communist, he would tell you it was the day that the Revolutionary Front started fading. If you asked Abdurashit Kadyrov, he would tell you that the day that changed the course of history was the one that left the Germans at the A-A line.\n\nEven still, as the Russian Armies solidified around Syktyvkar, Kadyrov's dedication to the West Russian Revolutionary Front had only diminished with time, as his homeland grew more and more chaotic. As the West Russian War erupted, however, Kadyrov's dedication was tested, and it took every shred of his will not to send himself back to Karakalpakstan. In the last days of the Front, however, as Kadyrov found himself in the southern front of a collapsing war, he seized the chaos as his last chance back home. Having returned to a collapsed state of his disorganized brethren, Kadyrov took it upon himself to found a Karakalpakstan state alongside his fellow nationals, and the countless political exiles of Uzbekistan, fleeing persecution.\n\nLeading with the respect bestowed upon him through his exploits across the West Russian War and his goodwill accumulated from his actions in the first days of the new state, it is certain that Kadyrov will prove a thorn in the side of all those who would want to tear down Karakalpakstan, bar ensuring the safety of his people."

 KRK_uzbek_political_exiles_desc: "The turbulent, authoritarian nature of Uzbekistan has left much of its political scene heavily regulated, and firmly under the boot of the ruling party, with its opposition kept far away from the notion of gaining power from the Jadidi regime. Such is not the story in Karakalpakstan, however, as the nation functions under its relatively stable democracy, opening up its doors to the Uzbekistani ideologies forced out of their homeland.\n\nOf course, this policy has elicited hostilities with Uzbekistan, though as much is simply the cost of becoming a beacon of freedom."
 KRK_wolves_at_the_door: "Wolves at the Door"
 KRK_wolves_at_the_door_desc: "Karakalpakstan's troubles do not end with its hostile relationship with Uzbekistan, nor is it the least of its worries on a day to day basis for the average rural family on the outskirts of Karakalpakstan. Every week, there is a growing list of stories of the Russian and Kazakh bandits, sweeping into local towns and villages and plundering them for all they're worth, cutting down all those who stand in their way.\n\nWith murderers like these roaming our borders, countermeasures have proven absolutely necessary, taking the shape of a proper militia system spanning the nation. If these warlords hope to take a slice of Karakalpakstan, they will bleed for it, and our army exists only to ensure this fate."
 KRK_young_army: "미숙련된 군대"
 KRK_young_army_desc: "While Karakalpakstan has organized its military well to deal with bandits and warlords, there is no amount of preparations, planning, or effective command structuring that can make up for the inherent flaws in an army with a poor state of mind. Nowhere in Central Asia is this more prevalent than with the army of Karakalpakstan. Born from the local militias spanning the nation's borders, the army consists largely of young, passionate, inexperienced soldiers who think of fighting bandits as a breeze, whether or not they've actually faced conflict or shot their weapon in a combat scenario.\n\nAs a result of this mindset, each and every trial of combat faced by Karakalpakstan's army is one fought with bravery and stupidity. If we hope to maintain our security, we will need to remedy this issue in short order."
