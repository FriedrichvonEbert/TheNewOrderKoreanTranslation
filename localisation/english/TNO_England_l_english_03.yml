HMMLR 급진파 점조직으로 여겨지는 암살자는 연설 도중, 국왕에게 수류탄을 던졌지만 폭탄이 왕의 뒤에서 대중의 분노로부터 그를 지키려는 정부 인사들 사이에 떨어졌다는 사실이 밝혀지면서 암살 시도는 결국 실패로 돌아갔습니다.\n\n이는 많은 사람들이 현대 영국에서 시민의식의 이면에 숨어 있다고 오랫동안 믿어 온 불안정성을 공개적으로 표현한 셈입니다."

"무슨 이유인지 여쭤봐도 괜찮겠습니까?"\n\n"야전 원수로 너무 오래 계셨군요." 흄은 맥없이 대답합니다.

"그럼 후임은 누가 될 것 같습니까?"\n\n흄은 정치인의 가면을 쓰기전에 또 놀라운 말을 꺼냈습니다. "마가렛이 맡을 겁니다." 잉글랜드에서 가장 영향력 있는 사람은 다음에 할 말을 곰곰이 생각하면서 차를 휘젓습니다. "장군께서 마가렛을 도와주길 부탁드립니다. 제가 사임을 발표한 후에 어떤 일이 일어나든 군부가 혼란에 빠지지 않게 해준다면 그녀가 가장 감사할 것입니다."\n\n버나드 몽고메리가 끄덕입니다. 그리고 나서 줄곧 말하려던 것이 생각이 난 듯 표정이 밝아집니다. "이것이 새롭게 단결된 국민의 단결을 보여주는 행진이 되지 않겠습니까?"\n\n흄이 끄덕입니다.

Would Stirling, the reactionary leader of the SAS, be the first English PM? Or would the red banner of a communist Labour party fly in the halls of Parliament?\n\nNeither happened. Instead, the center-right coalition of the National Democratic League won the hearts of the voters. Headed up by George Jellicoe, a former commando, diplomat, and the son of the hero of Jutland, the party promised a return to the England of old. One of free markets and a strong economy, ruled by the daughter of George VI. But also, an England that would make the necessary social changes and economic reforms to keep up with the modern era. And the glowing endorsement of Claude Auchinleck was enough to seal the deal in many districts.\n\nMany are concerned that this coalition may not last. It is made up of many parties with different goals and volatile personalities. But, the NDL will still press on. It will fulfill its mandate, and give the voters what they asked for. An England ruled by sensibility and compromise, as well as a constitutional monarch. And perhaps one day a Britain that is respected by the nations of the world."

Would it be the reactionary government of Stirling? Or Jellicoe's coalition of conservatives and milquetoast liberals?\n\nBut this was a revolution, and the people chose a revolutionary party. Bill Alexander's true heirs, the communist Socialist Labor Party. The final iteration of the prewar Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain. The political arm of the Left Resistance. And an organization determined to do away with the rotting structures of Old England once and for all.\n\nThis does not mean democracy in England is truly dead.

The new government, a joint venture by resistance heroes Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander declared the act was \"regrettable, yet unfortunately necessary\" given the state of English politics and dysfunction in parliament.\n\nFormed before the first elections, the YDL was a concept thought out by Auchinleck and Alexander to ensure England would not suffer the instability and potential governmental collapse that plagued so many other revolutions. The hope was the non-partisan nature of the organization, and the respectability of its leaders would add a degree of legitimacy to what amounts to an unelected dictatorship.\n\nThe YDL has promised a new election once stability has been restored.

Across the country, the coalition won big in many swing parliament seats, and looks to have a decent majority to be able to pass their agenda.\n\nThe NDL, widely expected to break apart after their defeat in the first elections, instead held together and continued to be the primary source of opposition against the SLP. Their pro-business platform and commitment to free market economics was appealing to many voters hurt by the economic policies of the SLP, and their endorsement of more liberal social policies helped make them palatable to many more. New Prime Minister George Jellicoe will be certain to follow up these promises with action, although many wonder if his coalition can hold together now they are in power.\n\nThe SLP, by contrast, is in a sour mood. Infighting and unsuccessful policies have plagued the government and led to its defeat. It seems the first experiment with far-left socialism in England has failed in the minds of the voters. And Harold Wilson is left thinking about where it all went wrong."

Some point to failed policies and economic issues. Others say the party was set up to fail from the start, forced to cater to the whims of the extreme ends of the organization to keep to power, rather than make actually good policy. Although many believe this will be a problem with the SLP as well, since they have a vocal communist block.\n\nHarold Wilson's crusade against the great evils that damn the people of England to poverty and want is sure to go ahead with a roaring start. Although several years of NDL rule will be hard to remove entirely, especially for a man who has otherwise gotten on well with them.

But now, the Royal Party is back, and they are none too pleased about what United England has done with their time in charge.\n\nPolitical defeats have hampered United England and its reformist policies. Their dream of a more liberal and democratic government has fallen flat on its face, and the consequences for them were dire. Their failure to neutralize the Royal Party doubtlessly was a mistake that will haunt them for the rest of English history as well.\n\nThe Royal Party has been vague, but it's widely expected they wish to crush the remnants of the United England party. The new PM, Margaret Thatcher, is not merciful, and is known for taking out any threats to her hold on the party when they were in opposition. For the longest time, the party in charge of England abuses their power to crush the opposition.

The Royal Party was a formidable organization, with broad support among the electorate, kept by mass surveillance and a carefully selected group of voters. Margaret Thatcher herself was widely viewed as imposing, able to offer charismatic speeches, populist reforms, and dynamite any obstacles in her path. Certainly, nobody expected them to yield power once they grabbed onto it. But tonight, the Iron Lady collapsed in a pile of rust.\n\nThe main opposition party, United England, seemed to be on its way out after its break up with the Royal Party and its electoral failure after the war. But apparently many underestimated the organization's tenacity, some at their own peril. The reformist organization somehow not only eked out a victory, they did it in the cutthroat and oppressive world of modern English politics, where organized opposition is mostly regarded as a joke.\n\nWhoever won the election would certainly grind the other party into the dirt, but it seems the UE will be doing the stomping, instead of Thatcher. They are certain to go to work scaling back or outright abolishing her most grievous offenses, and making sure the Royal Party never comes close to a position of power again. And if they do establish a true democracy, it is clear the Royal Party will play no part in it."

I urge all members of this body to support it so we may form a new government to lead the nation forward in these trying times."\n\nWith that, Rab Butler returned to his bench. The Deputy PM's betrayal had been a shock to nearly everyone in the chamber, but certainly not an unwelcome one to Thatcher's many enemies. Over the next several hours the thatcherites howled from the backbenches as Old Guard defectors and opposition MPs spoke, and Thatcher herself raged against Butler and his allies in her defense. But the House of Commons finally went quiet as the Speaker called for a final vote on the motion.\n\nA chorus of ayes rang out in answer.\n\nFor the first time in her life, Margaret Thatcher had no witty retort or hyperbolic broadside at the ready. She merely sat, stunned and defeated as her life's ambitions came crashing down. Eventually she walked out of the House of Commons, paying no mind to the MPs, reporters, and other hanger-ons who followed her to console, to question, to jeer. She walked back to 10 Downing Street with her head held high, and the faintest glimmer of tears on her cheeks."

For how can we claim to have retaken our place in the world if we do not share this prosperity with our western neighbor?\n\nWales formed by a few well-meaning nationalists who wished to escape the fate of the United Kingdom, has found itself in a new mess. One of political instability, economic mismanagement, and extremism. Though it may find temporary respite, disaster always looms large in their minds. And the land suffers as a result.\n\nWe shall come to the Welsh with a new offer. A way out of the instability and economic disaster. A guarantee of their way of life, with representation and protection under the constitution. And special rights afforded to the nation, ones which they were denied before.

The North Sea is one of the richest spots for fishing in Europe, but that is meager compared to its many potential petroleum resources. If we can turn these over to a plurinational working class, British socialism can become just that much more fortified.

This approach will come at the cost of many lives, which may have otherwise been saved were we to take another, more cautious, approach.\n\nYet the time for deliberation is over. The more land we can recapture from the Germans now, the more their position will be weakened and the sooner we can kick them off our island for good."
 ENG_SL_frontline_cities_desc:0 "In times of old, monarchs and nobles in their endless warring would construct massive castle-fortresses, chock full of chokepoints, arrow slits, and hidden traps which would allow a defending force to stave off a much larger attacker. While our modern cities are hardly castles, we can draw inspiration from their design to transform our cities to make ready for total war. An office boardroom can be converted into a sniper or machine gun nest, a storefront into a makeshift pillbox, a police station into a forward command post. Through the tactical destruction of infrastructure and the blocking off of roadways, German soldiers can be funneled into tactically advantageous situations for us, costing the Germans precious manpower, and most importantly, time."
 ENG_SL_keep_the_midlands_secure_desc:0 "The Midlands of England house some of her most important cities in the nation, containing both major industrial areas and prominent trade cities alike. It is imperative that we protect our heartlands from German aggression. We have devised a plan to center our fortifications around the major cities of Birmingham, Leicester, and Nottingham. By protecting these key areas, we may be able to keep the Midlands out of the hands of the invading Germans, and in turn, keep the relatively undefended North safe from harm."
 ENG_SL_retreat_and_entrench_desc:0 "The Germans, we find ourselves forced to admit, are both technologically and numerically superior to us. While the Germans may preach about honorable warfare, we know that fighting on the enemy's terms is not only foolish, but suicidal. Instead, we shall fight on our own terms. We shall establish fortified redoubts at key strategic positions throughout the nations, and position our soldiers there to await enemy attack. In addition, brave guerilla fighters will cut German supply lines and disrupt enemy communications, forcing them to engage us where we want instead of the other way around. Only by controlling the flow of the invasion will we be able to achieve victory over the German menace, and save England!"
 ENG_SL_keep_the_north_safe_desc:0 "In World War Two, the Luftwaffe rained terror over our cities and industrial areas in a series of non-stop bombing raids called the Blitz. The Luftwaffe has always been the pride and joy of the German Reich, and if they could overwhelm us at our height, we must be careful to ensure that they don't overwhelm us now. We must construct a series of Anti-Aircraft emplacements to prepare for a new German Blitz, and make sure the Nazi's have a challenge when they come, for come they will."
 ENG_SL_hiding_on_hills_desc:0 "Despite how warfare has changed over all of human history, one idea remains constant: holding the high ground brings distinct advantages to combat. A cavalry charge is much easier downhill than uphill, and it is much easier to stab down than up. While the days of hand to hand combat are mostly behind us, holding the high ground still gives us benefits. Height gives us better sightlines, and allows us to shoot down at German soldiers charging uphill. The North of England is full of hilly terrain, perfect to take advantage of holding the high ground. Taking full advantage of this will give us an edge that we so desperately need."
 ENG_SL_a_fortline_up_north_desc:0 "The Roman Emperor Hadrian once created a giant wall stretching across the north of England to protect the civilized Roman Britannia against the Caledonian barbarians to the north. Today, the threat to England no longer lies to the north, but from her south. Field Marshal Gerard Templer has proposed a series of fortifications informally dubbed as Templer's Wall that will stretch across the north of England from the cities of Manchester to Hull, where we can fall back to in order to stop the German' northward march in its tracks."
 ENG_SL_last_ditch_counteroffensive_desc:0 "The German Reich is in many ways superior to us. Their military is much larger than ours, and they are years ahead of us in technological development. The one thing we have more of than them is time. In truth, Germany's great empire is nothing more than a fragile house of cards; their economy is in shambles, and Fuhrer Göring faces instability from within his own government regularly. Yet, their military is not toothless, and might still overpower us if we do not act now. We shall embark on one last ditch counteroffensive, and with luck, we will ensure that the German jackboot will never step foot on English shores again."
 ENG_SL_an_unlikely_victory_desc:0 "Three months ago, our nation's greatest fears were realized: the gears of the German military machine began turning once again, with its eyes this time focused on us. Few believed that our poor, war-torn nation would ever be able to counter the massive heer on our own, and resigned themselves to life once again underneath the National Socialist jackboot. However, the clouds have lifted over our island, and by a miracle, England has survived. The Greater German Reich has collapsed, and they find themselves unable to continue the fight, instead suing for peace. We are unbowed, but not unchanged. The scars left by the German invasion will last for many lifetimes, but for now, we can once again say that Britons never shall be slaves!"

Once again, the aircraft of the tiny and outnumbered RAF took off to challenge this foe.\n\nOn the North Sea, a destroyer patrol noticed a submarine on it's radar. Having been given the notice that they were potentially at war with the German Reich, they followed standard procedure, and dropped a sonar buoy to better pinpoint it. Then, more contacts showed up on the sonar. And they noticed that one had fired a torpedo. Once again, the undersized and outdated Royal Navy was called upon to respond to this threat.\n\nAcross England, the army was called into action. They lined the coast, manning defensive fortifications, setting up machine gun nests, and laying barbed wire across the beaches. They knew the Germans would attempt to make a landing soon. And they knew there wouldn't be much that the other branches could do to prevent this. Once again, an understrength and inexperienced force would meet the mechanized and mighty German army once again.\n\nEngland would fight valiantly. Everything they had would be put against the threat. But nobody was under any illusions as to how hard this conflict would be."

I can tell you this has provided some extremely satisfactory results, which I will go over in detail in this letter.\n\nThe Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center in Tuscon, Arizona has provided a number of surplus jet aircraft, totalling 200 in number, that can be used for immediate combat action. These aircraft are of extremely good quality, and will be suitable for your defensive needs.\n\nAs for your naval request, I have very good news. The United States Navy has currently been testing, but has not accepted, ten new non-ballistic missile submarines. Owing to the tense political situation surrounding the builder's bankruptcy and union disputes, the President has decided it best to allow these submarines to be used by the Royal Navy instead.\n\nAll equipment and ships mentioned above will be sent to Iceland immediately. Once there, you will be allowed to take ownership of the items and place them at your disposal. You will be allowed a small auxiliary force from the OFN to familiarize your forces with the equipment, but all pilots and seamen in combat roles must be provided by your government.\n\nUse them well,\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland"

Yet, the tide then comes out. The beach is still there, and the German is half-buried in it. And as the tide recedes, the carnage of wrecked Panzers, beached landing craft, and bodies torn by machine gun fire is plain for the world to see.\n\nTrue to the American predictions, the German economy has collapsed, and has brought Göring down with it. Germania is in absolute chaos, and so is most of the continent, for that matter. The Germans lucky enough to have made it off the beach have either surrendered, retreated home, or have been utterly annihilated. Sealion II is an objective failure by any means, and the consequences have been devastating for the Hun who flew too close to the sun.\n\nEngland is not unscathed, however. Bombing has ravaged her cities. Shelling and fighting have left ruins and shell-holes that dot the countryside. The consequences of this destruction are immediately obvious. The economic devastation will be felt for years to come.\n\nBut the buildings would be rebuilt. The shell holes would be plowed over. The pulse of life, growing stronger and stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares. And England would rise again, stronger than before, and without any chains to bind her to the will of the Pakt. For with these three disastrous and tense months, England had purchased the right to be a nation worthy of a great power's respect once again."

 FEN_SL_stealing_our_freedom_desc:0 "In 1943 the old United Kingdom was murdered. Cruelly slain for standing up for what was right and just, and it was the German Reich which committed the deed. They took our families, our wealth, our freedom, and now we have received word that they intend to do so once again.\n\nThat fat bastard in Germania Hermann Göring? He intends to do unto England the atrocities for which the word German has become synonymous. He intends not only to destroy our nation but our people too. Yet what are we if not Englishmen? Are we to go meekly into the night? Sobbing like children at the approaching nightmare? No. Our old foe knocks at the door, and behind it we wait with gun in hand, for what else is there to do?"
 FEN_SL_mobilize_the_militias_desc:0 "Even the most ardent opponents of the modern SLP have to admit that their predecessor the Left Resistance fielded the single greatest number of civilian militias of any side in the Civil War. These were vital to our victory, but Bill Alexander supported most of them disarming to keep the post war peace intact. We shall rectify this mistake.\n\nSend out the summons by radio and by car. To each town and factory from London to Carlisle we will call these men back to arms. These militias won't have the best weaponry, but what they lack in modern equipment they make up with the indomitable spirit of the working class. Once more unto the breach we go, turn ploughshares into swords gentlemen and let us remind the Germans that the spirit of 1953 is alive and well."
 FEN_SL_stirlings_men_desc:0 "David Stirling led the only rebel force to fight from the fall until the liberation without interruption. In the course of doing so he created several volunteer units which were demobilised following the end of the Civil War, men that we must now bring back into service for what could be the final battle of English civilisation.\n\nThey have their own arms, but we must find the best positions for these volunteer SAS regiments amidst our own lines so as to best utilize their particular skills. Anywhere that guerilla warfare is necessary would be well served by even a few of these men, for their loyalty to England in unquestionable, and their spirit indomitable. Who dares wins."
 FEN_SL_utilize_ofn_bases_desc:0 "It will take time for the Americans to organise a proper response to the actions of Hermann Göring, time we cannot afford. Yet the American commanders of those units stationed on English soil are amenable to recognising a temporary state of affairs in which we assume command of their forces for the duration of this crisis.\n\nAmerican troops are some of the finest in the world, and their advanced technology will come in exceptionally valuable against the more numerous Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. This battle will be the final test of the English spirit against Germannic barbarism, we will need all the help we can get in this fight. We ask the American government for its permission later."
 FEN_SL_memories_of_hmmlr_desc:0 "HMMLR was always a well organised force, but what truly impressed the outside world was its ability to unite the disparate groups of communists, monarchists and everything in between under a single banner. Where the Republican Spaniards, WRRF and even China have failed we succeeded, and now we will need to bring that spirit back to life once last time.\n\nMostly we can use the memories of the Civil War to organise the same partisan groups who put aside their differences back then. Göring's men have plenty of experience cracking down on starving Russian peasants, let us see how they fare when put up against men who have more than 1920's era rifles to bring to bare."
 FEN_SL_remobilize_the_english_air_force_desc:0 "The Battle of Britain was our finest moment for good reason, and we put up enough of a showing to delay invasion by almost two years. Yet that battle and the numerous restrictions imposed upon England by the Germans and their traitor allies left us with a number of planes, but a paucity of pilots.\n\nThis time when we fight Göring's Luftwaffe we will again need to take to the skies against that overwhelming horde, and we will need every pilot we have to win. We will mobilise the civilian pilots, American "volunteers", even what few of our old retired veterans still live. The knights of the sky shall slay the German beast, Goerinbg's men will choke on their own confidence."
 FEN_SL_cut_their_suppply_desc:0 "Battleships and carriers did not help us overmuch in the last war. Such expensive ships would be too few in number to make a difference at this point anyhow, even if half of them weren't at the bottom of the Atlantic or in former colonies across the seas. Instead let us turn the German's own tactics against them this once.\n\nSubmarines won't do much against the Kriegsmarine proper, but then those vessels aren't the ones we shall target. Troopships, supply vessels, anything that might enable the Germans to continue the fight in England without support. Our navy will sink them one and all, let the Fuhrer see his vaunted navy establish superiority in the surface waters. We will rule the deep and send his men there soon enough."
 FEN_SL_we_shall_fight_on_the_beaches_desc:0 "The Dover beachhead was the beginning of the end for us in the last war, and our strategy will have to reflect the reality that if we allow the Reich to gain a permanent foothold our end becomes a much more serious possibility. But is it even a war for England if she is not faced with utterly outrageous odds?\n\nWe are a nation bowed but unbroken. We threw the Germans off our isle once and we shall do it a thousand times over if that's what it takes. Failure is not an option, cowardice is not an option. Communist and capitalist, monarchist and republican, men and women all. We will fight together, we will die together, and the Germans will be driven back into the foul abyss from whence they came!"
 FEN_SL_we_shall_fight_in_the_fields_desc:0 "When they take the beaches we will meet them in the countryside. The roads will be mined, bunkers and fortifications established at key points. The Home Guard will have their orders, to hold as long as they can in time for proper forces to dispatch German offences. Every hillock, paddock and pen will be denuded of any resources the Reich might use to further their conquest. Every mine will be collapsed, every farm burned, every shelter denied to our enemy.\n\nFor this is a sacred war, a war of the righteous against the forces of darkness, of civilisation against depravity and a struggle in which we must emerge victorious not only for ourselves but for our families. Steady, men of England. We are not gone just yet."
 FEN_SL_and_in_the_streets_desc:0 "We have some experience in turning our homes into fortresses, Carlisle held for almost a week, and what parts of London were entered before the surrender cost the Reich thousands of men. Now we face the same challenge, but unlike the weak men of the first war we will never surrender meekly at the first sign of loss.\n\nBoard up the windows. Establish defensive networks along the canals and streets. Booby traps must be prepared and covert weapons stashes reestablished. Every house must be a deathtrap, every street a fight unyielding and every Englishman must be ready to do their duty. This will destroy our history, as buildings are turned to rubble and our monuments rent asunder. The past might die, but the present will live. England will prevail."
 FEN_SL_we_shall_never_surrender_desc:0 "Göring will show us no mercy. No more than Hitler did to the Russians and other peoples of Eastern Europe. Those not killed outright will be enslaved and made to create the homes for German colonists, our culture will be burnt to make room for that of the Reich, and in two hundred years the term England will be a geographical curiosity.\n\nThat is the fate which awaits us should we surrender, and it is why we will fight until the end this time. We will die together, our motley alliance of left and right. Every bullet must be spent, every German killed is just another victory. So long as even one man in England bares arms the Germans will never win. Winston Churchill was a man whose legacy was always uncertain, but he never surrendered. Neither shall we."
 FEN_SL_our_old_base_desc:0 "It is with great regret that our government has come to the conclusion that defending the entirety of England is simply not going to be a doable objective in this war with Göring's Reich. To this end, it falls upon the government to have a designated fall back area should the worst occur and significant German forces land in English territory.\n\nThe English North, stretching from Lancaster to Carlisle and Newcastle has always been the area of England most friendly to partisan forces, with HMMLR once basing itself primarily out of the region and its forming the core of our territory in the Civil War. Now that we face another, more dangerous war it might be that we can make use of the North once again. If we prepare defences, we can wait out the German tide."
 FEN_SL_repel_their_planes_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe has always been the primary focus of Hermann Göring, something we felt when it sought to level England to the ground over the course of WW2. Hence, any stratagem we employ must have some method of removing or at least relieving the pressure it will put on our forces.\n\nFortuitously, one thing we have in great supply is anti aircraft devices, both older style flak weapons for dealing with paratroopers and more modern american pieces for eliminating the threat of jet aircraft. Most of these will naturally be placed in the north where they can aid in our rebdout, and perhaps even ensure its survival. In the last war the Reich thought itself untouchable, let us see if that continues when we eliminate their airforce and kill all the pilots who bail out in time."
 FEN_SL_fighting_on_hills_desc:0 "England is not an especially hilly nation, with no great chains of mountains outside the Welsh border and few natural positions upon which a defence could be centred. Except that is, for the North. The North York Moors, the Pennines, the Lake District, all areas of rough terrain upon which we can base our defensive positions.\n\nThe Reich has little experience of fighting in the hills and valleys, their wars mostly being centred on the European plains and we might be capable of turning that to our advantage, should we take the effort to do so. Critically, we will have to ensure that there is an ample supply of weaponry and ammunition in case we lose the major factories, and perhaps leave some buried surprises for jerry as well?"
 FEN_SL_stall_them_in_the_north_desc:0 "The Manchester to Hull line, known more formally as the New Redoubt, is the plan by which if holding the south of our nation becomes untenable due to the number of German troops landed or sufficient casualties are inflicted in repelling them such that we lack adequate troops to defend the rest of the nation, we will withdraw all but a token force to defensive positions centred on and between the cities of Manchester and Hull.\n\nThe region is well fortified by both natural and artificial means, and the country is difficult for the Germans to use their armour superiority to full effectiveness. Any assault of the region should be capable of being repelled unless there is a great disparity in troop numbers. God save those outside our protection."
 FEN_SL_fight_for_our_liberty_desc:0 "The battle is nigh, the Reich assaults our island and now it is all or nothing. Gentlemen and ladies, it falls to use to win this war not just for ourselves but for the entirety of the free world. It falls to us to avenge the horrors inflicted in Russia, Africa and France. We will make our stand and we will show that obese tyrant in Germania why it is that the sun never set on the British Empire.\n\nCome one and all, we fight not merely for ourselves but with the strength of an entire world at our backs. There is no surrender to be offered or accepted. There is no deal we will take or bargain we shall make. For liberty we fight, for justice we fight. We fight for the murdered and the oppressed, and for those uncounted millions who births never were. England will not merely be the defeat of Germany, we shall be its tomb."

What else can one call a single small island rent by war and ruin fighting and defeating the old tyrant of Europe?

Their ruined planes rot in our fields. Hear this o tyrants far, for should you fight against Englishmen with nought but oppression at your back you too shall meet the just fate wrought onto Germany at our hand.

All flights in and out of the country were halted with immediate effect. Any plane headed to the country was turned around and redirected to Scotland, while all departures were canceled as well. There would be free skies for England's air force, and clear runways for the fighters to take off to meet the threat.\n\nAll oceangoing operations on the East side of the isle had been halted long ago. Ships were kept in harbor or close to the coast, and any new ship was ordered to approach from the west of the country. So when a number of vessels were sighted, the English navy knew these were not any errant civilians, but enemy warships. Thus, the vessels could storm ahead to challenge the intruders.\n\nAnd when the alarm went out, the same militias and guard units that had answered the call just a short time ago once again mobilized. They took their weapons, manned their same positions, and prepared to face the inevitable once again. This time, the enemy would come, he would land, and that was inevitable. But he would be challenged at every step, be it on the sand of the beach, on the fields of England, the paved streets of her towns and cities, or on the wooded undergrowth of her forests.\n\nEngland once again prepared to face an enormous threat. Everyone knew what failure would mean, they had experienced it. They had vowed never again, and now they were determined to ensure that reality.

The British Army, on the other hand, was like a saddle made of rope: not as nice to observe, but when something broke, you tied a rope and got on with the job. And in a modern Waterloo, where the English faced against another Napoleon, the comparison proved apt once again. The English had suffered many troubles and misfortunes, but they were always able to tie a knot. And when the Germans suffered the foretold setback, they found themselves completely out of luck.\n\nAt an instant, the authority from Germania ceased, and the attackers flew into a panic. With nobody in charge, the invaders either gave up the fight or were wiped out. The economic disaster that befell the Third Reich had taken the place of Blücher's Prussians, and their timely arrival ensured another English vanquishing of a threat to the world.\n\nThe cost had been tremendous. Cities and towns had been burned. Fields had been trampled over. Many young Englishmen had lost their lives in the struggle for English freedom. And the civilian death toll was tremendous. The effects of this war would be felt on the English economy for the longest time. And some of the deepest scars of the past three months would never heal.\n\nBut England had survived. Once again, the people of England had rallied to her defense. They had stood up to the greatest power on earth. And when they had been written off, they had stood up once more and emerged victorious.

"Our agents have discovered it this past week, and the President made the decision to inform you all immediately.\n\n"I'm sure it's no surprise to you that the Germans have been sore about your victory, and you have been expecting some sort of retaliation after the Germans had organized themselves. The CIA, as you know, had some doubts about that, feeling the Germans would concentrate on their internal political situation and not take vengeful and cost-intensive actions for the purpose of prestige. Unfortunately, that assumption was based on the mistaken belief the Germans were rational people.\n\n"Our sources indicate airplanes and landing craft are already being assembled in Northern Germany. Fallschirmjäger units are preparing for operations, and regular Wehrmacht forces are undergoing naval training. They are going to launch an attack on this country, and it is only now a matter of when and where, not if."\n\nThe English cabinet processed this information. Then, they all turned to the Prime Minister, who was lost in thought.\n\nFinally, after a long moment, he said "alright then. Let's get on with it.""

The empire has awoken with the rage of not one, not two, now three soldier-generations seeking to reclaim their homeland. And at the helm of this movement to reclaim the greatness of Britain is not a lazy sellout or a supposed "realist" but a man who's single-focus on revolutionary fascism finally won the day over all challenges.\n\nEven now, in the moment of ultimate triumph, do the forces that so long relied on the complacency and tolerance of the British People doubt him. They expect him to teeter and fall, perhaps into another orgy of bolshevism and violence. And it is true Chesterton is one of the last original blackshirts to take up the call for strength and purity. But he will cement the unity of the British people so the Empire may last a thousand years."
 ENG_NF_all_the_countries_a_stage_desc:0 "Can human endeavor avail to save our nation from decline, and forge for it the revolution which will ensure it enjoys a more abundant life in the years to come? The Second Generation of the Lost believes so, and they hold fascism to be the answer. From the deceived and betrayed servicemen of the Empire comes a new wave of those who will battle against the disruptive factors of civic life.\n\nFountaine from the Seas of the Pacific, Jordan from the battlefields of England, Tyndall and Pirie from the vigilance against the socialists, brave and loyal all. A new class of bright young men, educated and devoted to the preservation of Britain against the scourge of international capitalism and socialist decay. They will carry the banner for the next stage of the eternal struggle against the decline and fall of society. And they will be in our cabinet as the future of Fascism."
 ENG_NF_cry_havoc_and_let_loose_the_dogs_of_war_desc:0 "In these hard times, there is no time for pleasant diversions, no posturings, fancies, daydreams, no dawdling by the wayside. These are as useless as a butterfly in a gale. For the foundations are life are threatened, and it calls for decisions to be made in black and white. The Fascist Revolutionary knows he cannot pick flowers in these pretty fields, he has no time to spare, no surplus energy.\n\nOur Blackshirts now go forth to speak, or to protect those who speak from the argument of broken bottles. This will not be easy work, nor will it be expected to be. But above the frippery and temptations our men shall place the duty they have been entrusted. Victory shall come to us by ruthlessness and discipline, this is the sacrifice we are willing to make."

Their time will come soon. But the people of England who have wholeheartedly joined our crusade against materialism and degeneracy will know this is merely a step on the road to building the necessary nation to face the future."

We are disinterested in the criticism of the fool and the ameatur because when such criticism is heard, there is always the racketeer standing behind the curtain. And such criticism as it applies to the leadership principle must be destroyed or diverted into less socially dangerous channels, not the party.\n\nIf a ship or building is ablaze, the appointed leader takes charge premptoraly or a natural one rises to take its place. And Chesterton is that leader for this emergency. The people show a deep desire for leadership, not to be betrayed yet again by another charlatan who presents himself as a superman. And nobody who seeks to destroy this leader can be tolerated, even within our own party. Examples must be made."

 ENG_NF_lend_me_your_ears_desc:0 "As paradoxical as it may seem to the charlatans and fraudsters of the world, our government offers something the parliamentary system has not ever seen; freedom. The democracies of the world negate leadership for the reason that if they step on a single group's feet they would be driven helter-skelter from office. Many in the Royal Party know this, terrified of their party's whips and groups of their constituents, no matter how small. And they seek a way out.\n\nWe offer freedom to express convictions, no matter how many they alienate. We offer the spirit to carry on to war-weary people. And to the ailing and weak Royal Party, we offer their members something they have always sought but could never obtain.\n\nPower, and true representation."
 ENG_NF_frailty_thy_name_is_woman_desc:0 "For a few brief weeks the leader of Britain is claimed as the roof and crown of all popular desire, fulfilling Britain's very deep and earnest desire for leadership. However, this leader is almost invariably a plausible and self-seeking rascal, well versed in the arts of compromise, camouflage, and the multitudinous devices of low cunning. In that respect, Margaret Thatcher, the leader of the Royal Party is no different, a young woman being propped up by the fraudsters and racketeers behind the scenes.\n\nFortunately for us, many within the Royal Party have had enough of her already and wish her gone. Together we will collaborate on getting rid of Thatcher from within her own party. And we will give Britain a true superman to gather around."

But we all remember being on the troopship to France, the winds playing rough-and-tumble with our hair, as we gazed straight ahead, fearless eyed,  the doom of battle brought forward with every breath. We remember the visions we had, of a future sanctified in the fields of blood-caked agony that held no place for the sordid futilities of the past. A future denied by the refusal of the Political Pundits and Lords of Business to sacrifice amongst our millions of lives. And that, we can all agree on.\n\nWe do not wish for violence and social disruption as our enemies claim. There is instead no other way but to defend our nation's social order and race from the malignant forces of International Money Power and Dollar Imperialism. We offer a commitment to secure policies that preserve our nation and Imperial heritage. And we are prepared to fund this future as well, perhaps on the side if necessary..."
 ENG_NF_to_combat_shylock_desc:0 "How could it be that the great nation of England, once the most powerful civilisation to ever grace the face of the earth, has fallen so low? The simple man would assume that the answer to this question is easily found: our regretful defeat in the Second World War, no doubt? The truth is far less convenient than that, of course. The brave defenders of Britain were defeated not by the might of the Wehrmacht, but through a knife in the back; planted squarely by traitors cloaked as honest Britons.\n\nThe National Front will not make the same mistake. The foreigner, the communist, and anyone else who holds nefarious designs for England, shall be exposed as the vermin they are. Once the people of England see the truth before their eyes, they will surely welcome the Blackshirts with open arms as their noble protectors,\n\nWith the Blacksirts signed into law as a legal arm of the English government, we need never fear the traitor ever again."
 ENG_NF_beware_the_ides_of_march_desc:0 "Some in the Royal Party no doubt breathed a sigh of relief when the resistance was crushed by the brave soldiers of Britain, knowing the day of their reckoning would be delayed a little longer. These Representatives have enjoyed their corruption, decadence, and sloth for far too long. Many questionable acts have been committed by them - and they must answer for it.\n\nNonetheless, we are capable of mercy, and we must allow them the opportunity to support Britain and Chesterton of their own free will. If they refuse such an offer? Then there will be consequences. There are some who would call these acts extortion, but how else should these examples of corruption be treated?\n\nNay, what we shall do is not extortion - it is justice."
 ENG_NF_all_that_glitters_is_not_gold_desc:0 "If coercion against these criminal representatives fails, then we will play their game. Such men are ultimately self-serving. They are blinded by the lights of parties; inebriated with the taste of champagne; and become senseless as the sight of money, or the promise of power.\n\nWe will give them what they want.\n\nWe will pamper these pigs. We will spread wealth, wine, and power across this rotten system for our own ends. For the greater good, we will reluctantly punge our hands into this filth that is Parliament - as one cannot perform such a thorough cleansing without getting their hands dirty, after all.\n\nThese fools will sell us their freedom - and the day they realize it, it will be far too late."
 ENG_NF_the_promotion_of_british_ideals_and_culture_act_desc:0 "Imperialist. Racist. Murderer. Colonizer. That is what the liberals, the communists, and the intellectuals would call the simple Englishman. Such slander is for one purpose only - to make the Englishman ashamed of his nation, his culture, and himself. No longer will this be tolerated.\n\nTo be British is to be part of the greatest civilization on Earth and be part of a rich and humbling history. For it was the British who spread civilization throughout the world and tamed the savage lands. It is past time we embrace this noble past.\n\nWe will ensure that the true heritage of the British is known and taught through this Act. There will be no apologies. There will be no shame. We will embrace our nation and culture with pride - and those who dare spread lies and undermine our nation will be punished."
 ENG_NF_to_be_or_not_to_be_desc:0 "The fate of the Act hangs in the balance.\n\nWhat shall be the outcome? Will the Parliament reflect the will of the British people? Or will the corruption of the old ways hold back the future? Britain will be set along a path no matter the outcome - but what that path is remains undecided.\n\nChesterton knows the outcome will determine how he is viewed. To pass the act would be an endorsement. To deny it would be an indictment. Yet does such matter now? Can it matter when neither passage nor failure would prevent him from doing what is necessary for the nation?\n\nAll  willwatch with bated breath, for soon, Britain's path - along with Chesterton's - will be decided."

Our promises of peace and security for all have won over all but the most ardent of our detractors, and we have prevented the repeat of history that would surely have occurred under a NDL government. Likewise the far too radical changes that the SLP would have sought to implement in government are also now a fantasy.\n\nYet we cannot sit on our laurels. David Stirling did not idly wait for 20 years before liberating us from the German yoke. He planned and he worked his hardest and he never once considered defeat, and now to fulfill our promises we must do the same. To honour the dead, to preserve the living, the M, S and A will defend Britain whatever the cost may be."
 FEN_MSA_lions_rightous_grip_desc:0 "Our movement is centered around David Stirling, it is true, and we take no shame in this. It was he who led us to victory over the traitors and their ilk after all, and it is his ideals we seek to spread and embed within British society. But no man is a castle, unassailable. Stirling did not get here alone, and he shall not continue his journey alone either.\n\nRichard Hull, a fine commander of men who will be our voice on the field of battle. Arthur Harris, who was right all along about how Germany should be fought without mercy. Pauline Gower, a fine pilot turned finer politician with connections to the upper class. And finally, John Woodhouse. An old colleague of Stirlings with some ideas about how to proceed with the economy. With men and women of this calibre behind us, we cannot fail."
 FEN_MSA_trust_in_the_people_desc:0 "There is something to be said for the value of cooperation. Yes it is true that our political opposites are, to a one, morons. Yet that doesn't mean we can't find favourable terms to set the new political reality in stone for the long run. Likewise, the people of Britain will doubtless enjoy some degree of cooperation amongst Parliament's disparate factions as opposed to a ceaseless cycle of squabbling.\n\nPerhaps the MSA should make inquiries with the NDL and SLP on the subject. Wilson and Jellicoe are likely as not sick of the radicals they made foolish bargains with for power. Yes, trusting in the democratic process is our safest option at this juncture. We are not the Royal Party after all."
 FEN_MSA_appease_the_ndl_desc:0 "George Jellicoe is a drunkard, a womaniser, and man harkening for an age destroyed decades ago, but he is an old comrade of the Prime Minister and we should not forget his services to the cause of liberation. The NDL might be a disparate alliance, but they are wary of us to a one. We should ensure that they have less reasons to be paranoid and more to play by the current set of rules. Powell won't budge, but Stevas and Jellicoe might be willing to accept changes in return for guarantees of their old order remaining untouched. Yet it would not do to be too incautious. We should remember that the ilk of these men are the ones who failed Britain all those years ago."

If we were to give the SLP assurances of our support of the democratic process regardless of our personal feelings about some of their party membership, we might make a compromise for them to offer us limited support in parliament.

Such tomfoolery can be reserved for the cesspits of the world like Ireland and Italy.\n\nNo, we do not need a hidden blade when the open hand is far more effective.

But who is Pauline Gower, exactly?\n\nBorn in 1910, Gower was fascinated with flying from a very young age, and she made a name for herself during the Second World War, being in charge of the women's section of the newly-created Air Transport Auxiliary. When the Isles fell to the Germans, she joined the English Resistance, and found herself with men such as David Stirling and Arthur Harris, with whom she struck a close friendship.

Born in 1922, Woodhouse saw himself as predicted to a military career, being the son of a Colonel from the Dorset Regiment; after enlisting in 1942, and even as the Allies lost more and more ground during the War, his true loyalty remained with England. However, he couldn't stand seeing his country becoming a vassal to the Germans, and he quickly joined the resistance, rapidly rising through the ranks, and becoming personally involved with Stirling himself.\n\nNow, the collaborator regime has been toppled, the elections have concluded, and Stirling sits in Downing Street; Woodhouse, while far from a politician, could only accept as his old friend called him to become the chancellor of the Exchequer. The nomination has shocked some and surprised many in the British political landscape, but one thing is now clear: John Woodhouse is here, and he is here to stay.§!"

One of Stirling's oldest collaborators, and one of his closest friends, he was one of the key figures in coordinating air warfare during the Civil War, and now stands as one of the most commended icons of the Resistance, as the dust begins to settle.\n\nHowever, Harris' life took a somewhat unexpected turn with Stirling's ascension to power, as he suddenly entered another battlefield, less dangerous but just as cutthroat: politics.

Leaders who were afraid of the will of the people. \n\nClaude, Alexander, and many others. Liars who had sold the fighters of the Most Loyal Resistance on the dream of democracy, only to backstab the free men and women of England by undermining it in one of their first acts. So long as the Young Democracy Law remained in place, Britain would not be a free democracy. No matter what, this undemocratic measure would be dealt with. He would see to it. \n\nThe question, of course, was how exactly to do it. \n\nIt had been a question Stirling had been pondering over the previous days, and after speaking with his advisors, trusted representatives, and soldiers, he had a solution. He would use an Act as the primary mechanism, but one which would not outright destroy the law, but reduce it to irrelevance. It ran the risk of being seen as a power grab, so the details would be important to blunt that inevitable attack. \n\nTo do this, the Act would be written in such a way as to limit the military's influence in politics - but at the same time, it would create a number of 'oversight' positions, which would take away the power of Claude and Alexander to act against him. Subtle enough that it couldn't be portrayed as a power grab - at least not openly.

It had hosted ministers and diplomats and scholars. Most of them were good men, decent men, committed to Britain and its people. They had faced many struggles to preserve the British way of life.\n\nAnd yet, Stirling doubted many of them had faced the steep odds he did now. Everywhere he looked, there were Nazis, socialists, and would-be dictators. The British empire had been dismantled and England stood alone, vulnerable. It seemed to him that he had expelled the vermin from a great manor, only for him to discover the foundation rotting beneath his weight. No matter how dire his warnings, none of the soft men in parliament seemed to recognize the extent of the rot.\n\nHe sat down, his breath growing quicker. He would not be a steward of a crumbling house. He would not allow the fat, complacent men who made up parliament to lead England to its ruin.\n\nStirling looked at the black phone on his desk. It would be so easy to make a few calls to secure the resignation of several MPs, resignations that he could use to fill the parliament with strong, well-equipped military veterans. He could call up some of his friends and allies from the armed forces and grant them informal positions in his cabinet as "advisors" positions that would allow them to escape hearings and paperwork.\n\nSure, the tabloids might question the legality of the move, might raise alarm about the politicization of the military and the erosion of norms, but did he care? He could find some justification. He could find some loophole or ignore the outcry altogether.\n\nStrength might be the only thing to save the British people from its decaying institutions. A few military men wouldn't harm anyone.

Stirling didn't want to shame him, but he didn't need to - not directly. All that was needed was to put a little dirt on the pristine image of a hero. Show the nation who the true Auk really was. Rumors were powerful, and when word got out that Claude had once had dealings with many of the collaborators... \n\nWell, it might make people a little more hesitant to listen to what he had to say.

It had probably been Alexander who had pushed Claude to draft the Young Democracy Law in the first place, as Alexander would prefer a controlled "democracy" to the fascist collaborators. If the law were ever to be used against him - and Stirling knew one day it would be - it would be Alexander who would advocate for pulling the trigger. \n\nUnfortunately for him, Stirling knew what he would do, and he wasn't going to wait around.

Oh he had to have guards, the Cabinet had been insistent on that, but they kept their distance and left the Prime Minister to enjoy his contemplation.\n\nFor as he sat on the park bench, idly listening in to the sounds of nature and the bustling city intruding upon it, David Stirling was given a rare opportunity to reflect on what he wanted to do with his life. He'd done the thing he'd set out to do all those years ago. Britain was free of the Reich, a man could walk the streets be he jewish or gentile. A man could speak as he wished, when he wished, and to whom he wished.\n\nBritain wasn't shackled by the barbarism of fascism, or the small minded petty thuggery of the traitor government. She was free, and so too were her people. Free to forge a path for Britain, where the future would be bright, even if David Stirling didn't quite know how it would come about.\n\nHe'd leave the doing to others. But so long as he lived, Britain would remain safe enough for that future to be built. That was a promise he could live with."

There had been many times during the resistance where his people had gone missing, his operations failed, and his plans went awry. Friends and subordinates had died because of his mistakes. Sometimes it had been difficult to go on. Working with limited resources and with the odds stacked against him was in a way coming home, be it in alleys and warehouses, or in the halls of Parliament. \n\nThe Act had failed. He was disappointed, but not surprised. \n\nHe might be Prime Minister, but when there were so many so opposed to him, even his power was limited. He'd done his best, but the reach and influence of Claude and Alexander, along with the independent representatives with their own motivations, had been too much to overcome. He sighed. \n\nDemocracy would remain hostage for another day. \n\nHe clasped his hands behind his back, as the moon shone over the city. His first attempt had failed. So be it, there would be more to come. He would ensure that Britain became a strong, independent, and disciplined nation regardless of if one Act passed or failed. He had been elected to protect and lead his nation, and that was what he would do - no matter who tried to stop him. \n\nHe would find a way to break the hold the tyrannical Young Democracy Law held over him and the nation, but with this defeat today, he realized it was going to be more difficult than he expected. If that was how it was, then so be it. He was to be the bulwark of democracy, and so he would embrace it."

"But if the British system was so weak then why was it that the Poles and Soviets fell so completely as well?"\n\n"Feh." The old air marshal waved off the words as he took a sip before continuing. "We were weak, had we gone to all lengths we could have pulled through instead of surrendering like beaten dogs."\n\nThe Prime Minister for his part indulged the grumbles he'd heard a thousand times over the decade he and Harris had been working together, letting the man relax before he continued. "I rather disagree Arthur, it was not our system, our people who were weak. We proved that by continuing the fight when our leaders would not." Stirling paused to take a sip of his own scotch. "It wasn't the system Arthur. It was the men in command. They led lions, but bucked and brayed when they could have found victory." Stirling eyed the office he'd taken over in disdain. "Our government needs to understand that Arthur. I need you to drill that into the heads of our generals. It will be their willingness to compromise, to surrender that will doom us should the huns come again. And one other thing." The Marshal looked up at that, seeing the determination lighting Stirling's eyes like candles.\n\n"Make plans to deal with those who seem unwilling to go all the way in the event the worst comes to pass.

All was quiet, except for the slow tick of a mantle clock and murmuring carried from many floors below.\n\nHe needed to do something, he told himself, but his body refused to move. He needed to write a speech or convene a cabinet meeting. He needed to get his allies together or find some scapegoat to rail against. Still, his body would not move. There was a terrible thrumming in the back of his head. He buried his face in his hands and felt a warm pressure grow behind his eyes.\n\nHow could parliament do this? How could they displace one set of tyrants and then roll out the carpet for another? So many men had died in the War. Good and brave boys had sacrificed their lives, their families' lives, to forge a Britain where democracy could thrive. What freedom could be found under the Young Democracy Act? What kind of system could arise if Britons were always living in fear of the next dictator, the next coup? Would Auchinleck and Alexander even let there be another election now that he and his party had risen up against them?\n\nStirling felt his hands slide from his slick face. He rose and turned to face the mantle clock, staring at his sickly face in its reflection.\n\nThe Young Democracy Act had to go. Stirling was prepared to make any decision, take any action, to dismantle the chains that kept Britain scared and weak. Even if it required him to go above parliament and destroyed him in the process, Sir Archibald David Stirling would not allow the light of Britain to be extinguished from the Earth.\n\nThe prime minister turned away and shuffled toward his phone.

On what he could have done differently, on what he would be remembered as, having now been the only British monarch to be dethroned twice. On Wallis, who he hoped had made it to Bordeaux.\n\nThus, when the men marched into his cell and dragged him out he hadn't the time to think what it might be for. Until he saw the courtyard, until he saw the line of men with guns. Regrets flashed through his mind then, of words not said between brothers and the thoughts of his friends who might soon be meeting the same fate. All he could say though, was something rather more simple.\n\n"A shame, I'd hoped to offer apologies to my niece." He spoke as though discussing the weather.\n\nThe burly sergeant struck him for that. Apparently kings weren't supposed to make commentary on their executions. Edward couldn't help but reflect on that as they tied him to the post. His whole reign, both of them, had been defined by what he could not do. He couldn't marry who he wanted, he couldn't say what he wished. He couldn't help those who'd needed it. Perhaps history would look upon him with a kindness his own mind couldn't fathom.\n\n"Take aim!" The shout rang across the silent courtyard.\n\nBut he rather doubted it.\n\n"FIRE!""

Yet it would also be one of the ones which most harkened back to the old Britain of her youth. She was fairly certain most of the clothing on those present had to have been worn at her father's coronation. Even if those wearing it were almost to a one, strangers in her eyes.\n\nToo much of the aristocracy had fled, been slain or been tainted by the touch of collaboration she'd been told when the planning for the event had begun. Of the hereditary House of Lords, barely a fourth of its members could be called to attend without leaving prison cells, another country or the grave. The Bishops had shown up in force at least, and the revelation that the Archbishop of Canterbury had maintained a loyal following for her right to the throne even in absence of her presence on British soil had been a relief. What really intrigued her were the men who sat about beside those she had expected.\n\nMen, and even a few women standing or sitting proudly in military uniforms, many with the knife patches of Stirling's SAS. Winston, her longtime friend in exile, sitting and chatting amiably with that fanatic air force man she'd heard so much about. Even the communists had seemingly decided to send a representative to show the appropriate amount of disdain for the affair.\n\nBut as the crown was placed upon her head, Queen Elizabeth the Second couldn't help but glance out the corner of her eye at Prime Minister David Stirling, who seemed oddly distracted by something nobody else could see. Perhaps he had plans, as for a brief moment a smile flickered on his face."

Yet fate had surprised England once again, and the island collectively helds its breath, both anticipation and fear as the greatest embodiment of British fascism took office.\n\nBefore Buckingham Palace, Chesterton stood. Microphones were set before his podium, which would broadcast his words across the radio. The smug cheer on Chesterton's wrinkled face was apparent, and his wispy white hair blew in the wind as he beheld the press before him. Their expressions were guarded, fearful, repelled - but attentive.\n\nTime to begin.\n\n"People of Britain," Chesterton began. "Your voice has been heard! It is because of you that I stand here before you. It is because of you that you once more have a voice in the halls of power. It is because of you that corruption, degeneracy, and treason has been soundly rejected. So let my first act as Prime Minister be to thank you. I promise that your support will not go unrewarded."\n\nAcross England, Chesterton's words sounded. Around radios families huddled, listening attentively, and sometimes fearfully. Some mothers rushed their children inside, as they saw Blackshirts marching down the street. Jews held quiet conversations with each other, speaking fearfully of the future, as the new Prime Minister's speech continued.\n\n"I promised you a new British age!" Chesterton said, lifting a finger as his voice rose. "And this promise, people of Britain, is one I will deliver! An age of stability! An age of power! And age of order! Lift your heads high, people of Britain, for the Empire is reborn - and it is time the world be reminded of our glory!""

 ENG_NF.2.desc:0 "Men could only govern effectively if they surrounded themselves with men who were reliable, effective and above all, loyal to the one whose vision guided the nation. It mattered not if Chesterton possessed the vision for a strong and restored Britain, if he was surrounded by those who sought to depose him. He would select his knights carefully, the men who would be his instruments to forge a new Britain. Four such men had been selected, and each of them had been called before him today.\n\nThe first to enter was Andrew Fountaine, a man who was never without a bowler hat, and who had a perpetually frowning face. His eyes were bright, and shown with ambition. Behind him was Colin Jordan, the man who would be the face of England to the world. The balding man had a perpetually amused face, with eyes that gave nothing away.\n\nDenis Pirie was next to enter. The smaller man dressed sharply in an all-black suit was one of the youngest and most passionate of the National Front. Slightly-tinted glasses rested on his thin nose, behind which calculating eyes lay. Finally, there was John Tyndall, a man with a rectangular face, and an expression that seemed perpetually stoic; ensuring that nothing was given away.\n\nChesterton, Prime Minister of England stood when they entered, with Tyndall closing the door behind him. He was silent for a few moments, as the aging man appraised his cabinet; those who would be his voice, will, and weapons of his administration. He nodded once.\n\n"Gentlemen, welcome," he began. "Each of you have found yourselves here because you have proven yourselves to me. Effective. Willing. Loyal. Such qualities in men are rare these days, and I expect you to not betray this trust." He clasped his hands behind his back. "We face many enemies within and outside the government. We must be vigilant for their machinations - and today we will begin our great work.""

Blackshirts across England had chafed at the disrespect, but they had none to support them.\n\nNow that had changed.\n\nFrom across England, Blackshirt leaders traveled to London to have a personal meeting with the Prime Minister. The guards of Westminster escorted them inside, though more than a few did so reluctantly. Soon, all of them were together in a room with Chesterton, who greeted each one as they arrived.\n\nTime to get started.\n\n"Your ostracization is over," he began. "The old politicians failed to see the good work all Blackshirts have done in keeping our nation safe, and our traditions protected. When they came begging to you for help in crushing the resistance, you answered - and you will be rewarded for your service to the nation."\n\nHe clasped his hands behind his back. "It will come as no surprise for you that there remain many enemies. There are many who oppose me, and my mandate. But as the political landscape changes, so too must the Blackshirts. They must become ordered and centralized as your responsibilities expand. Have no fear, for you will have the funds and resources to manifest this change."\n\nA restructuring that would be overseen by himself - as there were even some Blackshirts whose loyalty was questionable. But he kept that detail to himself. As  he looked into the eyes of many, all of them anticipating being let off the leash, he smiled. Yes, his hounds of black would be a useful counterweight, in case the police proved incapable of doing what was necessary to protect the nation."

 ENG_NF.4.desc:0 ""Come Dungeons Dark, or Gallows grim, this song shall be our parting Hymn!" The Workers sang and chanted, loudly and passionately reciting the infamous anthem of the long-dead Labour Party, echoing Harold Wilson's dying words.\n\nThey continued to stare down the armed men in black who had entered the run-down Birmingham neighbourhood, batons in hand, to deal with a recently formed trade union that was illegal under current English law. Yet the Unionists refused to back down. Many of them were minorities, strongly affected by the wave of discriminatory and antisemetic laws coming into effect, making it harder and harder for them to keep their jobs and feed their families.\n\nAfter a short yelling match between the two sides, with many of the Unionists yelling obscenities at the them, the irritated Blackshirts suddenly and startlingly lunged forward, and within seconds, were beating several of the workers with an animal-like rage.\n\nSeveral of the workers, fearing for their lives, retreated in a panic, yet every one of them would be arrested later that day. The workers who stayed fought to the very last, yet within a few minutes of the battle starting, it was over. 7 workers lay dead, 18 injured, all of them shoved into the back of an unmarked truck and off to an unknown fate.\n\nThis wasn't even the first time this week. This same scene had occurred in Bristol on Tuesday, twice in the same day in London, in Liverpool and Newcastle on the same day hours apart. Yet all the while, the police were either completely apathetic and allowed the Blackshirts to extralegally "punish" and assault the workers, or even outright sided with them during the crackdowns. It had become clear to all now, the Blackshirts were no longer a shadowy, fringe organisation. They were out there, and they were out for the blood of 'England's enemies', as they defined them."

Though all of them hadn't been told why they were coming, and a few noticed other odd things, like how there was no media, nor any official police protection. Instead security was handled by smartly-dressed blackshirts.\n\nWhen the Prime Minister entered the auditorium, the crowd burst into applause, Chesterton smiled and took his place behind the podium. "My friends," he began. "Today is a day of victory, we have done what all said was impossible! Britain is ours!"\n\nAnother round of applause, as Chesterton continued. "For all those who have supported me, who trusted me, I thank you," he trailed off pensively. "Unfortunately, there are some who have seen fit to act against me in our moment of triumph. I have learned of this conspiracy, and you will hear it from one who orchestrated it."\n\nHe stepped to the side, as another man walked up, his hands trembled, and his face was pale. He took the podium, facing a crowd whose atmosphere had chilled in seconds. In a slow, halting voice he began describing in detail the conspiracy against Chesterton. As each name was listed, Blackshirts moved to where they were seated, and escorted them out. Five were removed. Then ten. Then twenty. Terror gripped the audience as they realized what this was.\n\nChesterton smiled, without saying a word.\n\nMore were taken away. He did not see the first person who did it, but when one of his enemies was removed, they cheered loudly. In moments others had joined in; a frantic attempt to show their complete support to him - and as traitors were removed, one by one, the cheers only grew louder."

 ENG_NF.6.desc:0 "Politics was an art, not a science, and those who were able to effectively wield power understood this fundamental truth. Politics was the utilization of charm, pressure, and influence for certain ends. It was a game of ever-shifting rules that one could either react to - or write themselves - and Chesterton preferred to write the rules.\n\nOne might expect that after his victory, he would ostracize the Royal Party as they had done to him, but nothing could be farther from the truth. To punish the Royal Party was unfeasible, and more importantly, undermined a core promise he made to the British people - the restoration of Order. Order could not come about with a divided, stagnant, and gridlocked government.\n\nNo, the Royal Party would have another use.\n\nIt was why, tonight, he held a small gathering of senior and crucial representatives of the Royal Party, those who chafed under Thatcher's machinations. This secret gathering had been situated away from Thatcher's eyes and ears. Dinner and drink were served, and Chesterton weaved between the small crowd, speaking to each individually.\n\nNow, towards the end of the night, it was time to make the proposal.\n\n"I believe now that we have spoken, we align on much," Chesterton said, in a center of the attendees. "And I know that you are concerned with the direction Thatcher is taking your party. Each of you have the opportunity to change the rules, and serve with pride - not fear. So tonight I will make you a promise - support me, support Britain, and I will deliver the Royal Party into your hands."\n\nThe offer was clearly tempting to some of them, he could see. Some would politely, but he did not need all of them. He only needed enough."

 ENG_NF.7.t:0 "A Tragedy of Potential"
 ENG_NF.7.desc:0 "There were few things that were more tragic than wasted potential.\n\nMargaret Thatcher was the embodiment of wasted potential.\n\nIn some ways, Chesterton admired her. She was an excellent example of a strong woman, one who was simply not content at being relegated to the sidelines by her peers. She embodied ambition, drive, and in his estimation - would almost certainly break the strings the Royal Party was attempting to impose on her.\n\nThat was the kind of woman he wanted in the National Front. She would have made an excellent member - if not for one fatal flaw she possessed: Her alignment to reformism.\n\nIt was an eternal shame that her politics were the opposite of his. If she was just a simple representative, he would not care overmuch. But she was intelligent, and had influence - and such a person against him with those qualities would simply not do. The fact was that she was an enemy now, and it was past time she be treated as one.\n\nChesterton calmly folded up the memo he had just signed, placed it into an envelope and set it atop a small stack which would later be distributed later. A few phone calls would be made. A few people would be summoned. And soon the media would be abuzz all about Thatcher - and leave her reputation in tatters.\n\nMedia campaigns were a useful tool in this era, ones of sophistication even more so. He did not want Thatcher simply silenced - he wanted her destroyed. He felt a tinge of regret for the avalanche of hate, harassment, and anger that was about to befall the poor woman - but such was the fate of those who stood against him."

 ENG_NF.8.desc:0 "Waves splashed against the rocks, and a cool salty air blew as Chesterton stood along the cliffs of Dover, looking across the English Channel. To beyond where his eyes could see, the Black State laid. It was a crisp day, and this was a place where he believed they could speak freely. "I am certain you have each heard many rumors and accusations," he said, turning to the two men he had come to meet. "I am here to dispel this slander in person. I have no intention of harming the army, or your own positions."\n\nGerald Templer and Bernard Montgomery were in uniform, and their faces were hardened. They clearly had reservations about them, but Chesterton did not intend to solve this issue today, but lessen the tension. Both men were heroes to the English, and it required a delicate touch in dealing with them. Montgomery spoke first. "I'm less concerned about the military, Prime Minister, and if you intend on keeping the principles of liberty intact - for all Englishmen."\n\nMeaning the minorities, was the unspoken implication. "I assure you," Chesterton said. "No harm will come to those who do not threaten our nation. I have made this clear many times." Montgomery clearly did not appreciate the caveat, but bit his tongue as Templer spoke.\n\n"I want a guarantee," he said. "Directly from you, Prime Minister, that the army will not, under any circumstances, be tampered with."\n\nChesterton smiled thinly. "I already told you my intentions, Templer - or lack thereof. You have to be satisfied with my first answer."\n\nNeither man seemed particularly happy with how the conversation was going, but Chesterton was fairly certain that he had mollified them somewhat. They would likely mutter amongst themselves, but they would not do anything yet. They would remain in line, and that was all that mattered."

All of these rat-like groups plot our nation's plundering and total destruction in front of our very eyes, and we simply will not allow it!".\n\nPrime Minister Chesterton's speech in Brighton early that morning was somehow equally stoic and Icey as it was volatile and fiery. Fascists and supporters of the National Front called it the "Speech of the Century". Opponents and dissidents called it a 'Madman's lunacy-filled Tirade'. In particular, Harold MacMillan, chairman of United England, responded to Chesterton in a radio broadcast, calling the Prime Minister a 'Filthy, lying, degenerate mobster' with a tone of fury and sadness at the direction the country has taken.\n\nThe nation however, didn't get long to mull it all over, as later that day, Downing Street announced the official introduction of the 'Promotion of British Ideals and Culture Act'. The provisions of said act would solidify the Blackshirts position as a 'Supplementary Law-enforcement organisation', expand their arrest and policing powers drastically, and place it under the Prime Minister's de jure and de facto control.\n\nWith reports of several Jewish-owned businesses being violently attacked by NF supporters, and Blackshirt units emboldened to march right through minority neighbourhoods, many people who have become targets of increasing discrimination have begun boarding boats and planes to Ireland, Iberia, Italy and elsewhere. Underground militia groups made up of Jewish, Polish, Irish, and even Indian citizens of England have even started forming to protect themselves and their communities. It can no longer be denied that a silent war is now being waged over this Act. The Battle lines have been drawn, as both sides prepare for a Titanic Struggle."

Pass or fail, he would not be surprised by the outcome, and had planned what to do in each scenario.\n\nHowever, a victory was vastly preferable. Presenting such a bill as his first piece of legislation was risky, as a rejection would inherently weaken his mandate and immediate influence. Yet great men did not shrink from gambles.\n\nThe voting began, as one by one, the representatives cast their vote. Chesterton's expression didn't change from just an interested bystander, though as more votes were cast, he did not hide the smile that grew on his face. Murmurs, both excited and worried, grew louder as the voting came to a close - and it became clear what the outcome would be.\n\nThe Speaker made it official. "It is the will of this chamber that the proposed Act has passed."\n\nThe reactions were immediate. The National Front members cheered loudly, and were met with a chorus of challenge and opposition from the other parties. Anger, joy, shock, and horror filled the atmosphere, and Chesterton savored their defeat he saw on their faces and in their eyes. His own eyes found those of Thatcher and MacMillan, both of whom returned his stare with unrestrained fury and hatred.\n\nThe few Jewish representatives, who had finally been able to be elected, reacted in one of two ways. Some angrily stormed out of the House of Commons in a fury, while others sat shocked as the implications of what had happened hit them. There would be none who could deny it after today.

This was the cold, sinister claws of the National Front at play, grabbing them and slowly pulling them into a dark future where their lives were inherently worth less than someone else's, on account of who they were born to.\n\nWages were far from the only thing, several families stopped receiving benefits and pensions, which weren't very high to begin with, even if their Jewish heritage was absolutely minimal. Those that challenged this rising discrimination in court were instead found guilty of sedition out of nowhere and thrown into a cell at the behest of a NF-appointed judge.\n\nIt wasn't long either those of Indian, Irish, and Polish Descent began finding themselves at the receiving end of these practices as well, many being forced out of their jobs and workplaces, their new bosses citing "Treasonous and scheming attitudes" as their cases for doing so. In the span of a few weeks, minority groups had fallen under a proverbial iron boot from which they couldn't escape, and the Blackshirts made sure of that through terrorising, brute force.\n\nMeanwhile, several state schools have begun teaching a new "Patriotic, Race History" course, forcing out Teachers opposed to its implementation, and the indoctrination caused by it has caused Jewish children to be singled out, and in several cases this last week, brutally beaten by other students.\n\nIf one hadn't been paying attention, they may have missed all of this.

The guards were attempting to push back, but they were simply overwhelmed. This had gone on long enough. It wouldn't do for the vagrants to break through the gates themselves. He calmly walked over to the phone, dialed a number, and gave a single order. "Put them down."\n\nHe set the phone down gently, and returned to the window.\n\nIt was only a few minutes later that he saw canisters fired into the crowd. Clouds of pale tear gas erupted, and from along the streets and Westminster itself marched Blackshirts to put down the protest.\n\nHe stood quietly, watching for hours as the Blackshirts ruthlessly broke the protest apart with batons, tear gas, and dogs.\n\nChesterton was under no illusions as to what it would take for his vision of Britain to be fulfilled. Montgomery, Templer, they would react poorly to this for certain. No doubt they were hatching a grand conspiracy against him, but Chesterton was unbothered. Plots, conspiracies, he knew them well, and if these inexperienced men wished to try their hand against him, then so be it.\n\nThe day turned to night, and as he saw smoke rise over the city, he retired to his bedroom, satisfied.

In particular Harold MacMillan, without a doubt the most vocal and furious opponent of the Act, and indeed the Government in general, practically leapt out of his seat in joy upon the revealing of the results. Letting a few tears roll down his cheeks, he pulled Reginald Maudling and several of his colleagues into warm embraces, congratulating them on standing their ground. Margaret Thatcher seemed indifferent, but also appeared to revel in the chaotic scene before her in the Government benches.\n\nWhat a scene it was too. Chesterton glanced around as his own ministers and MPs jeered and howled, bellowing accusations of fraud and bribery. A couple of MPs came down and whispered into his ear, insisting a re-vote had to occur. He simply nodded along, silently, but in his mind, he was already planning ahead. A re-vote was unnecessary, detrimental to his plan even.
