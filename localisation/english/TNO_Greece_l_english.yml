 POLITICS_THEMELIS_DESC:0 "Just as modern Greece is a dim shadow of the world-spanning empire of Alexander, so Georgios Themelis is to his deceased predecessor, Theodoros Pangalos. Where Pangalos was defined by bold action, seizing power from the collaborator government and convincing Italy to allow him to restore stability to Greece, Themelis has muddled his way through leadership with little action of distinction. Where Pangalos commanded the loyalty of the Security Battalions and had at least the appearance of a plan for Greece, Themelis barely commands the loyalty of his own government and has allowed its endemic corruption to bubble over into the public eye.\n\nThe president is not unaware of the precarious situation in which his state exists, despite the grumblings about his inaction which can be heard in every bar and eatery of Athens, but he has greater concerns than the petty worries of the common people. He is first beholden to his Italian overlords, who have tolerated his government for the lack of trouble it presents to them, and second to the clique of officers who have been appeased by what they have been permitted to steal. Themelis himself is no stranger to feathering his own nest at the expense of the Greek people, but sometimes he does wonder how long this state of affairs can last."
 POLITICS_DIMITRIOS_PSARROS_DESC:0 "Whether the king in Athens or the king in Rome, Greece has long been vexed by the various cruelties imposed by despots on the people. After decades of plunder by amoral tyrants, the country has never been poorer or weaker. Yet the spirit of resistance remains deeply embedded in the people, as Greece's bravest sons risk their lives to build a future they may never live to see. Few have risked as much or fought as long as Dimitrios Psarros, one of the most respected figures of the Greek resistance.\n\nPsarros, born in an unremarkable village in central Greece, became a steadfast servant of his country at a young age, fighting in a variety of conflicts throughout the 1910's. A fervent believer in the liberal-nationalist ideology of Eleftherios Venezelos, Psarros eagerly defected to the pro-Entente National Defense government during the First World War and would later join the failed Venizelist coup in 1935. While certain other Venizelists saw the Italian invasion as an opportunity to topple the monarchy, Psarros saw only the replacement of one king with another, and he went underground as a freedom fighter. His resistance group EKKA was small but well respected, and ideological similarities to EDES saw their consolidation postwar.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Gizikis government, Psarros received the temporary title of president due to his status and popularity. He and his brothers in arms at EDES are at the cusp of achieving their dream of a free Greek republic, but a number of challenges still sit in their path. An ongoing communist insurgency and utter economic devastation imperil the new Greece, but if Psarros can successfully manage them he has all he needs to establish a nation that would make Venizelos proud."
 POLITICS_KOMNINOS_PYROMAGLOU_DESC:0 "Since he was a teenager, Komninos Pyromaglou has fought for the liberation of the Greek people. At only 17 years old, a year before Greek entry into the First World War, he travelled into Ottoman territory to join with miltia fighters resisting the ongoing Greek Genocide. For six years he fought the Turks, his bold rescue of 200 encircled Greek soldiers in 1922, and involvement in the 1922 revolution, would later earn him enormous respect among Greek liberals. Exiled by the Metaxas dictatorship in 1938 for his liberal activism, he returned to Greece in 1941 to resist the Italian puppet government, quickly rising to become one of the top leaders of the EDES resistance.\n\nThroughout the 40s and 50s, Pyromaglou worked to unite liberals and reformist socialists alike behind EDES' mission to establish a representative democracy in Greece. Alas, the iron fist of fascism forced him to treat into the most remote areas of the Greek countryside, while violent clashes with the communist EAM stifled effective anti-fascist resistance. With the death of EDES founder Napoleon Zervas in 1957, Pyromaglou became the official head of the organization. He was the main architect of the 1963 truce between EDES and EAM, allowing both organizations to establish a united front against the Themelis government and establish a provisional republic in 1964. With four decades of patriotic struggle behind him, Pyromaglou was shortly thereafter swept into office to become the first democratically elected president of Greece in three decades.\n\nHis ambitious platform, which garnered support from hardline socialists and left-leaning capitalists alike, emphasizes universal healthcare and education for all Greek citizens. His right-leaning opponents argue that his plans are too expensive and would stifle Greek efforts to industrialize the economy. Even the far-left of his own party criticize Pyromaglou for his supposed neglect of industrialization and labor rights."
 POLITICS_PANAGIOTIS_KANELLOPOULOS_DESC:0 "Born to a wealthy family in 1902, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos developed a passion for political science early in his life, and was an accomplished lawyer and respected scholar before his 30th birthday. Elected president of the Social Insurance Institution in 1934, Kanellopoulos was a rising star in the Greek republic, but alas, with the fall of Greek democracy, he found himself exiled to a small island in the Cyclades. Arrested by Italian forces in 1942 after attempting to establish a resistance group, he miraculously escaped captivity and shortly thereafter joined EDES.\n\nKanellopoulos was an unusual fit within the largely republican EDES, being a conservative-leaning monarchist. A hindrance to his influence within EDES for most of his time in the resistance, it became an enormously valuable asset to himself--and the resistance movement more generally--in gaining moderate conservatives' support for the provisional government. It was for his ability to appeal to the provisional government's many skeptics that Psarros appointed him interim deputy prime minister. Shortly thereafter, his promises of an economic golden era for Greece earned him the presidency, becoming the first democratically elected head of state Greece had seen in three decades.\n\nNow Kanellopoulos seeks to rapidly industrialize and modernize the Greek economy, to escape from the poverty which the Greek people endured through decades of dictatorship and warfare. By abolishing most of the stringent financial regulations put in place by the collaborationist government, he believes that both foreign and domestic investment will naturally follow, and transform Greece from forgotten backwater into a bonafide jewel of the Mediterranean."
 POLITICS_ANDREAS_PAPANDREOU_DESC:0 "In a world where extremes are the norm, Andreas Papandreou and the EDA seem out of place. Himself son of EPEK's party leader Georgios Papandreou, Andreas is a relative newcomer in Greek politics, having fled his homeland due to his leftist inclinations during Metaxas's regime. He found himself studying economics at Harvard in America, graduating with a PhD before joining the United States Navy in its war efforts until its inevitable defeat, after which he worked as a professor in numeros universities across North America.\n\nDuring the late 50's, after a little over a decade spent in the New World, Papandreou came back to Greece at the enquiry of various EDES figures - namely Konstantinos Karamanlis -, in prevision of post EEE Greece. Now, a few years after setting foot back on his homeland, Andreas finds himself President of Greece after its second elections since the fall of the EEE.\n\nMarking a stark contrast with the first members of the EDES, Andreas is intent on following his predecessor''s measures in establishing a welfare state. Some speculate he might even further them, as his supporters chant his slogan "Allagí! - Change!""
 POLITICS_GEORGIOS_PAPADOPOULOS_DESC:0 "Few had ever heard of Georgios Papadopoulos before 1964. The son of a schoolteacher in a remote village, young Georgios saw enrolling in the Military Academy as a path out of poverty--and perhaps more importantly in his mind--a path towards greater power. He has been clawing his way to greater power ever since. He sought military glory as an artillery second lieutenant in the Second World War, and only two years later joined his erstwhile enemies to find power within their ranks. Through the 1940s and 1950s he gradually rose through the ranks of the Security Battalions. But while Papadopoulos could tolerate working under Theodoros Pangalos, he had nothing but loathing for the weak-willed and incompetent Themelis. Thus, Papadopoulous established IDEA, a secretive group which aimed to replace the government and put Papadopoulos at its head.\n\nIt was treason of the highest order, and necessitated the greatest secrecy to succeed. On the eve of revolution, Papadopoulos had established an extensive network of contacts within both the Greek government and with Greek insurgent groups. He was trusted by the Italian Duce and not suspected by Themelis. When EAM and EDES combined forces and ousted Themelis, he appealed to the Italians to assist him in a coup to restore order and prevent the spread of communism. They agreed, and now Georgios Papadopoulos and IDEA reign over the Greek nation.\n\nHis stated aims are ambitious, bordering on quixotic, to rapidly industrialize the Greek nation, to purge it of communism, unite the nation behind traditional Christian values, and achieve economic independence from Italy. His administration is brutal and arbitrary in its punishments, acting with consequentialism taken to its most violent extreme. His ability to remain in power will depend on maintaining amiable relations with Italy, securing his regime against the threat of terrorists in the hills and nefarious agents within his own government. Most importantly, he must ensure that the Greek people remain tightly under his thumb--sufficiently respectful and fearful of the security forces so as not to boldly protest in the streets, and not desperate enough to rise up anyway."
 POLITICS_GEORGIOS_GRIVAS_DESC:0 "The European political landscape following World War Two saw many self-styled patriots collaborating with the fascist invader and Georgios Grivas is no different. Grivas was born in Cyprus and moved to Greece in his early adulthood to embark on a career as an officer in the Greek Army, against his family's wishes. Right after his graduation in 1919, he was immediately posted on the Asia Minor front of the Greco-Turkish War, where he distinguished himself for his bravery. The failures of the war convinced him that only a strong hand could save Greece and bring forth Enosis, the reunification of all rightfully Greek territories. For that purpose, he created Organization X, an ultranationalist, monarchist cell within the Greek army and plotted for the eventual revolution that would defeat the liberal traitors in the government and give Greece her rightful place in the world.\n\nBut even the best plans laid by men can still be thwarted and that's what happened to Grivas. The revolution actually happened in Greece, but a liberal one. The fascist regime in Rome needed a loyal man in Athens and Grivas was just what they needed. Enticed by promises of power and wealth, Grivas aligned himself with the fascist invader, Organization X became the Party X of National Resistance, and from Athens he heralds a new era of strength, glory and prosperity for Greece. All while the Italian fascist jackboot rests on the neck of his motherland. While he might think otherwise, Grivas is no longer a loyal son of Greece. He is nothing but another puppet for a foreign regime like any other."
 POLITICS_ARIS_VELOUCHIOTIS_DESC:0 "Born to an upper class urban family, the life of Aris Velouchiotis seemed set. Yet during his education, he became infatuated with leftist ideals, eventually joining the communist party and participating in left-wing movements. When Metaxas cracked down, Velouchiotis was jailed, tortured and forced to recant his beliefs.\n\nAimless for a time, he joined the military and participated in the Greco-Italian War, before being forced to retreat as the Axis stormed the country.He was instrumental in organizing a guerilla resistance, which eventually merged into the EAM.\n\nWhile the remnants of the KKE were initially skeptical due to his forced recantation, Velouchiotis regained their trust as he struck blow after blow against the Hellenic State, year after year, no matter how bleak or hopeless things become, becoming the de-facto leader of the partisan organization.\n\nAbove all else, Velouchiotis is driven by the dream of a true communist Greece - a vision that he will fight to the death to see realized, regardless of how many democrats, republicans, and fascists stand in his way."

 gre.1.t:0 "과도정부 수립 선언!"
 gre.1.d:0 "To look at the recent change in the state of being as a singular revolution might be a bit misguided. Certainly, revolution occured in Hellas, but it was far from a unified effort. Though the plain cross of EDES, the crowned cross of Organization X, and the standards of various defecting army units and Security Battalions marched side-by-side into Athína, their visions for the future of the nation clashed drastically.\n\nIt is perhaps a mercy that the bulk of all the revolutionary forces converged on the capital at once, so that none could claim legitimacy over their ideological rivals. The only thing that they agreed upon was that this was not a republican, a monarchist, or a militarist revolution, but a Hellenic one, and it would be there that common ground was found.\n\nOut from the Hellenic Parliament, once a bastion of cronyism and corruption, emerged the leaders of revolution. Komninos Pyromaglou, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Georgios Grivas, and Georgios Papadopoulos walked in the sight of revolutionary, civilian, and hastily-assembled press alike on the steps, hands clasped in hands.\n\nAs one, they raised their fists to the sky, and with this firm display of revolutionary solidarity, they proclaimed with one voice the formation of a new provisional government to oversee the Hellenic state. The government would be modeled like the Parliamentary Democracies of Pre-War Europe, and as a People, they would decide what the path of Hellas would be.\n\nThe fate of Hellas is far from certain, but now more than ever, the people of the nation have hope for the future. Now it is time for Hellas to move forward once more. "

 greneg_ita_ciano.1.d:0 "Greece has been gripped by chaos, as partisan groups wreak havoc and are coming closer and closer to seizing control of the country with every day that passes. The collaborator government is equally worried as we are, and has sought the protection of the Italian garrisons in and around Athína, that, in combination with the Security Battalions, are the last hope for our allies to maintain control. However, even that chance is slipping away. After months of endless fighting, our troops being constantly assaulted, ambushed and routed, Attikí is the only true stronghold we can rely on.\n\nEven though occasional rumors of partisans carrying out resistance activity in the suburbs of the capital have reached Rome, the area still remains the only one we safely hold. Thus, we must make our decision on what our response will be. The High Commissioner to Greece, Luigi Mascherpa, who represents our interests there, has remained neutral on this issue so far, awaiting for a response from the government, but he seems to possess a better understanding of the situation on the ground.\n\nThe honorable Admiral and his closest advisors have debated the best course of action for days now, and little seems to have come out of it. As the National Resistance closes in on the capital, and threatens to end the EEE government, an immediate order to the Italian garrison must be sent. What shall it be?"

Once having to hide behind the mountains and the woods, the partisans of the EDES and the EAM have nothing to fear anymore. They have not only openly engaged in "a war of liberation", but now can claim to be the legitimate government of the nation.\n\nThey have done just that, in fact, as the Provisional National Democratic Government has been formed in the Greek mountains. Before any power and influence Italy can exert on its former ally ends forever, Duce Ciano has decided it is time to hold actual negotiations on its future. As our best diplomats work day and night to contact the provisional government and begin talks, a formal conference must be arranged if we are to sign lasting peace.\n\nMany ideas have been thrown around about the location of this conference, and it has now become a question of whether we want to have the upper hand by holding it somewhere we have control, or hold it on Greek land. Where shall we organize it?"

Whether they are republicans, communists or monarchists, they all want to get their freedom back and return to their homeland, and so does the victorious resistance.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't be so quick about returning them, as they could still be a bargaining chip in negotiations.\n\nTalks between the Italian government and the united front of Greek rebels continue, and it is in our best interest to have the high ground in negotiations, or at least that's what some claim. Many others have also voiced their support for showing our good will to the new regime in the Balkans, by releasing them or at least promising to do so soon.

 greneg_ita_ciano.4.d:0 "The EAM has made itself notorious to the Italian forces stationed in Greece. Created by the communist party at the very start of the occupation, its aim was to become a "popular front" that would unite all ideologies to achieve a common goal the nation's liberation. This was never achieved, as most of the center and the right looked to alternatives such as EDES to join. However, that did not stop EAM from growing more and more, becoming the first resistance organization to shift from a small circle of select units and guerrillas to a nation-wide movement that encompassed every corner of the country.\n\nThe fall of the collaborationist regime in Athens has changed the situation dramatically, as the socialist organization is free to continue building up troops and influence in the government. This has made some people in the cabinet and the army rather worried, even afraid that it puts the carefully built order in the Balkans in danger.\n\nRecently, we were approached by a group named the "Sacred Bond of Greek Officers", also known as IDEA. They are a group of ambitious military commanders in the mess that is the current Greek army, and they have dedicated themselves to fighting communism. They have been the ones to inform us of the latest EAM operations, and have even offered to help in the investigation.\n\nThe troops of the National Liberation Front, especially active in the mountainous areas of Greece, have amassed significant support and are possibly preparing an offensive, both literally and figuratively, to seize control of the Provisional Government. The Servizio Informazioni Militare has been assigned to finding information about this threat, but has found nothing so far and would require deployment in Greece to figure out what's going on. At the same time, IDEA still wish to lead the charge in the investigation without raising much suspicion."

Obviously, this mission has failed, as is evident by the fact we are currently negotiating with the new regime that overthrew our allies. Still, the question of what our garrison force will do once Greece gains its full independence remains.\n\nThe Greek negotiators have been quite insistent on Italian withdrawal from their soil, but there is still room for deciding the exact details of that. For example, High Commissioner Mascherpa has suggested a program by which Italian military presence will be reduced to 30% of its original size. This way, we might be able to appease the Provisional Government, but still maintain some troops there. Of course, there are always more extreme options..."

Their proposal was the maintenance of Enosis, the term for the union with Cyprus, as a concession by Il Duce. What we have mentioned as a counterpoint is the great difference between the situation there and in Greece itself. While the partisans have seized control of the mainland, Cyprus is still under our firm control. Even though EOKA, the radical group advocating for Enosis, has intensified its activities as a result of the victory of the resistance, it has not been enough to force us to evacuate.\n\nThe possibility of a democratic plebiscite has also been considered by diplomats of both countries. A referendum organized jointly and held under the supervision of our garrison seems like a good middle ground, and it would show our commitment to liberty and justice. However, we should keep in mind that, if the Cypriots are given a choice between staying in the Empire or joining Greece, the majority will likely vote for the latter."

Greece is a nation that is within the traditional Italian sphere of influence, whose loss would not only deprive the empire of another market and its resources, but would also potentially destabilize its Balkan neighbors.\n\nIt's clear that intervention is the only choice, Italy's prestige demands it, but high command is split on how to proceed. Until the situation solidifies, everyone agrees that a defensive posture is needed, and to this end, two plans have come to the fore.\n\nThe first would establish what is referred to as the "Sulla Perimeter" around the City of Athens. A precarious position and difficult to hold, but our continued occupation of the city would prevent any of the rebels from gaining legitimacy by taking the capital.\n\nThe second is the "Salamis Perimeter", where we create a flexible and easily defended perimeter around a section of the Aegean Retreat, which we simply hold until the situation becomes more clear and we can begin to make plans.\n\nUltimately, the final decision falls to the Duce."

 greneg_ita_scorza.2.d:0 "With the situation rapidly deteriorating on the Greek Peninsula, simply holding the line against the rising tide of chaos is only delaying disaster. If Italy is to restore order to Greece and secure her sphere of influence, an offensive strategy will need to be formulated and agreed upon.\n\nOne major wall that high command has run into is whether or not we should recruit and involve collaborators from Greece in the operation. While this is standard practice for Italian interventions in other regions, the fact of the matter is that every time that the Italian Empire worked with Greek collaborators in the past, they'd gotten burnt for it. In fact, even the rebels they were planning against right now had former collaborator elements as part of the rebellion.\n\nA number of hardliners argue that the plan to restore order to Greece cannot involve Greeks, and that their presence will only subvert and compromise any attempt to keep the Peninsula in check. Then there are those who are of a more conciliatory mind, accepting that the Greeks had proven untrustworthy in the past, but arguing that the downsides to an only-Italian operation outweigh the problems that involving the locals on the campaign and occupation would cause.\n\nEither way, Italy will face fierce opposition from an incensed and defiant Greek people, but this decisions could make the difference between a stable, friendly Greece, and a hostile, mutinous one. No one knows which path will lead where, though, and the Duce will need to make the final call."

 greneg_ita_scorza.3.d:0 "We have ships moving into position to the east and south of Athens, and boots on the ground are starting to gather on the Hellenic coast while the Royal Air Force dominates the sky above the turbulent peninsula the rebellion has taken control of. It's going to take some time, but we will soon be ready to move against the rebels, but before we do that, we ought to draft and deliver to them a list of demands. If we can avoid a fight, we should do so.\n\nOf course, it's easy to decide on the bulk of the demands. The standing Greek rebels will stand down, Italian forces be allowed to re-establish control over the peninsula, the formation of a new government underneath Italian supervision, that all is well and good. But the question of amnesty has proven to be difficult to come to an agreement on. Some argue that we need to take a hard-line stance against the ringleaders and generals of this rebellion, if we are to prevent the same thing from happening again, or happening in other parts of the Empire's sphere of influence. Others argue that an offer of amnesty would- should the leadership of the rebellion refuse, allow disillusioned and forward-thinking generals to defect safely and make the campaign that much easier.\n\nSeveral Greek leaders- in particular, notable Security Battalion veterans and other former collaborators- have already expressed interest in laying down their weapons in exchange for guarantees from the Empire, one such leader has even suggested that he could mediate negotiations between the two sides. These statements only serve to both enrage the hardliners, and simultaneously encourage the more lenient commanders."

He only wished that it hadn't been in order to hold a gun to its head.\n\nThe bay south of Athens was littered with the cruisers and destroyers of the Regina Marina, as well as the occasional supply convoy making its way towards Hellas to supply the Royal Army present there. For simple police action, the sight of it conjured long-buried memories of the sounds and smells of the World War.\n\nThe Admiral peeled his eyes from the city and to the man in charge of the operation, Admiral Antonio Legnani. A cruel and harsh leader by all accounts, but those traits were expected out of a submarine captain, no matter how high they rose afterwards. Even still, Mascherpa made his appeal.\n\n"I strongly urge you to reconsider this, Admiral. Th-"\n\nLegnani interrupted, as he often did during these conversations. "Do you now? I must not have noticed the last hundred times you urged me, but now that it's a strong urging..." His mouth twisted into a mocking smirk as he spoke.\n\nWith an accusing finger gestured at his fellow admiral, Mascherpa's voice rose. "The Impero is clearly visible from the city, the Hellenes see the guns, they see the ships, our point is made! There's nothing to gain and much to lose by shelling the city!"\n\nLegnani shook his head as his eyes turned out towards Athens. "What good is a threat if they don't believe we will follow through with it? I think your time among the Greeks has made you sentimental, admiral."\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Legnani brought up Mascherpa's time as the High Commissioner in Hellas, but that didn't stop him from taking the bait. "It is not sentiment, only practicality!" He spat back. "We'd only serve to embolden the rebels and drive more Hellenes to join them!"\n\n"And is this simply a civil disagreement? We're here to punish Greeks, not befriend them." He turned on his heels before Mascherpa could respond. "Besides, it's too late. I've already requested permission from the Duce. Best hope the Duce loves the Greeks as much as you do, my friend." Mascherpa could practically hear the condescending smile on his face as he walked away."

Was written in bold, Greek letters beneath a colorful drawing of two hands shaking, each of them showing the colors of the Italian and Greek flags. As gaudy and ostentatious a thing as Ernesto Botto had ever seen.\n\n"Always with the Ancients..." He muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand, handing the flyer back with the other. He shifted his weight onto his right leg, the sound of the iron prosthetic causing the floorboards beneath him to creak quietly. "When did we turn from an Air Force to school teachers?"\n\n"I just thought they might be more receptive to-" The man from Ministry of Popular Culture began to make his retort, but Botto was already walking away.\n\n"We need to remind them of their hopeless position, paperman," called back Ernesto "Iron Leg" Botto on his way out the door, "not of factoids. Try to have something worth its ink when I return, or else explosives may replace your papers."It wasn't a long walk from the offices to the armory, though to call either makeshift, hastily erected front line structure by their name felt severely inappropriate. Botto gave the doorless frame of the building a knock as he entered, seeing that there was no one to greet him, he made himself at home instead.\n\nBombs were lined up against the far wall of one of the few additions onto the building made out of concrete, bombs that should they be needed, would blast Athens to rubble. But something seemed... Off about them. Upon closer inspection, the reason became obvious. Painted on each of the bombs was a seemingly personalized message.\n\n"Stay in Your Caves" on one, and "This One's for Gotzamanis"; "Augustus is Back" sat next to "Pyromaglu! Suck my Cock!". Apparently, the pinnacle of wit and cleverness that you could expect out of Italian bomber crews.\n\n"Commander! I didn't hear you come in!" Piped up the quartermaster, scrambling up behind Botto, only to follow his gaze and realize what Iron Leg was reading, and his complexion began to whiten.\n\n"I am... Curious, quartermaster. What exactly is the value in these... Writings?"\n\n"Insults to demoralize the Greeks when we bomb them, of course."\n\n"I see. And... They are supposed to read these... When, exactly?" Botto turned his gaze back to the quartermaster, who had no response save to rub the back of his neck nervously. "Just get the men back to work, we need to drop something, and if it isn't bombs, they may very well be papers instead.""

While for now they had to set up shop along the barren coastline of the Aegean Retreat, the time for organization was ending, and the time for action was beginning.\n\n"It is always better to act in reply." Two men marched along the coast, two of the principal commanders of the upcoming battle, named Operation Corinth, Enrico Martini and Tito Agosti. The two men could not be more different, and that was reflected in the argument that they currently had.\n\n"Reacting is what you do when you are on the defensive, Martini. In case you haven't noticed, we are the invaders here." Agosti retorted, a finger pointed towards Martini's chin.\n\n"And what more would a partisan love than to see a column of tanks roll right into their traps? We should hold and let the rebels show their hand, they will no doubt be eager to retake the land we've occupied already."\n\nAgosti looked out and into the Greek interior, before gesturing broadly to the vague silhouette of Piraeus's harbor in the distance. "Look at it, Piraeus sits there, ripe for the taking. It is near enough that we don't need to fear your terrifying partisan, and its fall will send a signal to the rest of the rebels."\n\n"It's a foolish decision. There's no point in taking Piraeus without having some idea of the ability of the Greeks to make a counteroffensive. We'd only be overextending ourselves!"\n\n"We could extend ourselves along the whole of Greece if we should wish it.

The current status of the collaboration government is unknown, but they are believed to have fled or are captured.\n\nWe have identified the culprits as the EAM, one of the most powerful and influential resistance organizations that had been operating in Greece. The previous government had expressed concerns about their growing influence, though had assured us that they could be handled.\n\nThis assessment has proven exaggerated, and in the absence of a central authority, the armed forces are either in disarray or have defected to the resistance. The EAM adheres to radical left-wing ideologies, specifically varying flavors of socialism or communism. Their leader, Velouchiotis, has taken nominal control, and has declared that the Greek revolution has been successful.\n\nThis is an unacceptable development, and we cannot have these dangerous radicals so close to us. There is no option for negotiation as they would demand the recognition of their communist state, and would destabilize the entirety of the Balkans. Direct intervention is necessary before Velouchiotis can establish a degree of stability to the nation.\n\nOur military forces have been mobilized on the Albanian-Greco border, and naval invasion forces are preparing to launch from our ports.

Our battleships and carriers are ready to leave their docks, our planes prepare to rain hell and our men are eager to fight.
