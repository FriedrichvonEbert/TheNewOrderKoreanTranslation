  ##### Ministers Description ######
  PRU_Carlos_Moreyra_hog_desc: "§YPresident of the Council of Ministers\nSecond Vice President\nConservative Democracy§!\n------------\n§LBorn in 1898, Moreyra is an engineer and politician. He served under Prado as Minister of Development and Public Works, where he disagreed with Prado's policy of playing both sides during WW2. Postwar, he worked in the Agrarian National Society until Prado's return to Peru in 1956. As keeping the door open for Japan lost Prado support from the landowners, Moreyra convinced him to join the ACDN, and became Prado's second vice president. After Beltrán criticized Prado's government, Moreyra mediated, and Beltrán became Minister of Economics and President of the Council of Ministers, or Premier. Following Beltrán's resignation, Moreyra took over as Premier, and remains a close friend of Prado.§!"
  PRU_Alvarado_Garrido_pol_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nConservative Democracy§!\n------------\n§LBorn in 1907, Alvarado Garrido has been a lawyer and diplomat for a record 40 years, teaching in the UNMSM and PUCP as a professor, and served as ambassador to Bolivia in the 1950s. His long and stellar career has impressed Prado, who appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1960. Alvarado is tasked with dealing with the Ecuadorians, and keeping good relations with the US and Japan.§!"  
  PRU_Gallo_Porras_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance and Commerce\nFirst Vice President\nConservative Democracy§!\n------------\n§LBorn in 1894, Gallo Porras is one of Peru's most outstanding politicians. His post as mayor of Miraflores and Lima during the 1930s gave him invaluable experience. He joined the ACDN in 1955, and was Prado's running mate in the 1957 elections. After Beltrán resigned as Minister of Economy and Finance, Gallo took his place, and continues to be one of Prado's closest friends in these trying times.§!"
  PRU_Ricardo_Elias_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Government and Police\nConservative Democracy§!\n------------\n§LBorn in 1906, Elías Aparicio is an experienced lawyer. Commissioned by the Benavides government in 1938 to investigate Germany and Italy's penal systems, Elías became interested in Peru's own penal system. This led him to later work for the military and police. Appointed Minister of Security by Prado in 1960, Elías is presently worried about the ominous silence in the north, and sporadic terrorism in the countryside.§!"

  ### Leader Description ### \n
  POLITICS_MANUEL_PRADO_UGARTECHE_DESC: "Born in 1889 to a wealthy family and son of ex-President Manuel Ignacio Prado, Manuel Prado Ugarteche is a civil engineer who became one of the major players in Peruvian politics during the 1940s and 50s. Rising through the ranks, he was tapped by President Oscar R. Benavides to be his successor, and won the 1939 election. Prado continued Benavides' suppression of the outlawed APRA and PCP. As the Nazis invaded Poland, Prado's government changed the course of Peru with a new foreign policy. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Prado publicly supported the US and the Allies to keep Peru's good relations with Washington, but he kept the door open for the Japanese as an option. By 1944, the war seemed undecided, yet the US still stood strong. So Prado kept his 'neutral' foreign policy, up until the fateful day that Pearl Harbor was erased in a flash of blinding light, and the US signed a conditional surrender to the Axis Powers.\n\nStunned by how the mighty northern giant had fallen, Manuel Prado was yet convinced that he had made the right choice, expecting that everything would remain normal. After his term ended, he left Peru for the US and Canada. He watched from afar as his homeland descended into chaos, then returned to a semblance of normality. That normality convinced him to return in 1956 to run for the 1957 elections, but he couldn't run without popular support. His close allies convinced him to form an alliance with Beltrán called the Alianza Conservadora Democrática Nacional and work with Manuel Odría. The fateful 'Pact of Monterrico' was sealed, where Prado would win the elections as the ACDN candidate, in exchange for sweeping Odría's corruption under the rug. In his second term, Prado lifted the National Security Law but kept the ban on the APRA and UR while releasing some of their most moderate members. He also worked successfully with Pedro Beltrán to stabilize the economy.\n\nIt's been five years since Prado became President, and yet so much more needs to be done. With elections looming, factionalism in the ACDN, the investment war, and the threat of APRA, Prado prepares to make his final moves before he leaves office. He will continue in his traditional tactic - that of doing nothing until everything goes back to normal. It has worked before, it will work again. §RRight?§!"

  PRU_idea_fake_democratic_dream: "헛된 꿈"
  PRU_idea_fake_democratic_dream_desc: "페루는 겉보기에는 굳건하며 건강한 민주주의를 가진듯 하지만, 깊게 파고들면 그 진실은 복잡해집니다. 페루의 민주주의는 1939년 프라도 대통령의 당선으로 회복되었지만, 리마 전투라는 가장 힘든 시기를 마주해야 했습니다. 페루의 민주주의는 승리했고, 사람들은 민주주의가 강하다고 믿었습니다. 하지만 1950년 선거에서 투표용지를 조작했다는 부정선거 의혹이 제기되면서 오드리아 정부의 이미지에 상처를 입혔습니다,\n\n페루가 오랜 꿈인 민주주의를 다시 실현할수 있을까요? 아니면 역사를 다시 반복시킬까요? 우린 이 문제에 조심스레 신경써야 합니다. 만약 실패한다면, 우리의 꿈과 함께 §R사람들의 민주주의에 대한 믿음 또한 죽을 것입니다§!. 하지만 성공한다면, §m민주주의는 실현될 것입니다§!."
  PRU_idea_silent_liberation: "조용한 해방"
  PRU_idea_silent_liberation_desc: "리마 전투 이후, 북부의 친APRA 지역은 어느날 그들이 멈출때까지 부스타만테 정부와 오드리아 정부에 맞서 반란을 이어갔습니다, 그리고 그곳엔 침묵만이 남았습니다. 병사들은 총격이 없음을 보고했고, 경찰들은 자신있게 모든것이 통제하에 있다고 보고했습니다. 그리고 시민들은 아무일도 없었단 듯이 행동하고 있습니다. 하지만 이 침묵은 안좋은 징조를 의미합니다, 우린 북부를 한시 빨리 확인해야 합니다. §R저 APRA 놈들이 여전히 숨어있는걸 알고있으니까요...§!"
  PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy: "두 초강대국과 하나의 경제"
  PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy_desc: "Since the signing of the Akagi accords and Prado opening up the economy to Japanese investment, there has been an economic investment war between America and Japan in Peru. Peru, in many political theorists' eyes, can be Japan's entry point into South America; accordingly, both nations have been heavily investing in Peru to achieve their objectives.\n\nInvestment from both the Rising Sun and the American Eagle was courted by various Presidents of Peru throughout the 50s, with President Odría attracting millions of yen of investment into Peru from Japan. American investment remains strong however as they are unwilling to let a single nation drift into Japan's sphere without a fight.\n\nThere are frequent American-Japanese economic clashes, especially in the Northwestern Industrial and Oil Refinery zones in Talara. If Peru can continue courting investment from both superpowers, they can expect riches to flow into the country. However with riches comes problems: inequality has risen with rich Japanese and American families taking large swaths of wealth from this investment and becoming as rich as Peru's upper class. While Peru is benefiting economically, there is a backlash amidst the working class of Peru which, if not dealt with effectively, could result in a return of violence in Peru."
  PRU_idea_peru_diverse_problems: "다양한 문제를 떠안은 국가"
