 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_DESC:0 "나치즘은 민족주의에 대한 호소와 대중을 휘어잡는 지도자라는 두 가지 개념에 강하게 의존해왔으며, 히틀러의 후계자로 거론되던 인물 중 보어만 이상으로 이에 적합한 인물은 없을 것입니다. 보어만은 총통의 비서 시절 배운 그의 통치 방식을 흉내 내며, 바로 자신이 국가와 대중을 위협으로부터 지켜낼 "제 2의 히틀러"임을 믿게 만들고 있습니다. \n\n대중에게 보어만은 자신들과 같은 평범한 "보통사람"처럼 생각되지만, 정계에서의 그는 매서운 협상가이자 정치의 달인, 협잡꾼으로서 정계를 사격장처럼 일방적으로 주무르고 있습니다. 독일이 내외부의 위협으로 골머리를 앓는 동안에도, 의회는 항상 보어만의 통제 아래에 있었습니다. 만일 정치만으로도 전쟁에서 승리할 수 있었다면, 보어만은 진작에 세계를 정복했었을 겁니다."
 
 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_FUCK_DESC:0 "다색의 황제가 게르마니아의 피투성이 왕좌에 앉아있고 당은 그의 앞에서 아양을 떠네. 그의 적들은 모두 죽었다네, 개혁주의자, 군국주의자, 반체제 보수주의자... 그들 모두 죽었다네. 그의 통치를 위협하던 기관조차 모두 무너졌다네. 위대한 보어만 만세, 보어만이 독일이며 독일이 보어만일지어다. \n\n경직된 관료체제는 더없이 성장해나가고, 당원들조차 존경이나 사랑이 아닌 순수한 공포에 눈이 먼 지금 독일은 끝없는 시위, 폭동, 소요, 테러에 몸살을 앓으며, 동부의 위협은 점점 커져만 가는데, 우리의 총통은 암에 걸리셨다네. 그러자 음울한 의문이 하나 떠오르네.  \n\n"다음 총통은 누가 될까?""

 bormann.1.desc:0 "보어만은 구석구석에서 독일의 깃발을 흔들고 있는 국민들이 그의 도착만을 원하며 붐비는 가운데 게르마니아의 잔해속에 대성공을 이끌며 라인의 황금이 연주되고 있는 국회의사당으로 향했습니다. 의장대가 그곳으로 그를 맞아들였고, 거기에서 국가의 새 총통은 재빨리 신질서에 대한 계획을 발표하기 시작했습니다.\n\n보어만은 연설에선 자신의 통치권은 독일 내전이 아니라 이미 제2차 세계대전의 승리 속에서 확립되었다고 강조했습니다. 독일의 정당한 통치자로서, 그는 이제 수십 년 전 독일인들의 피와 땀으로 쌓은 질서를 다스리게 되었고, 현 독일인들에게 10년 동안의 구원을 가져다 줄 것입니다.\n\n미국과 일본 모두 더 많은 것을 준비하고 있기 때문에 국제적으로 둘다 침묵을 취하고 있습니다."

 bormann.5.t:0 "거의 확보된 승리"
 bormann.5.desc:0 "조국은 의기양양하게 서있습니다! 슈페어와 그의 더러운 쥐새끼들은 도주했고 괴링과 수정주의자들은 파괴되었으며 힘러의 꼭두각시 하이드리히는 저주받은 부르군디로 갔습니다! 그러나 전쟁은 아직 끝나지 않았습니다 - 독일이 원래 가졌던 위대함을 되찾기 위해서는 단 한 가지 장애물이 더 남았습니다. 그것은 슈파이델과 그의 게르마니아 방위 부대입니다. 신의 도우심으로 우리의 세계수도 게르마니아는 전쟁에서 거의 피해를 입지 않았으며 그 거주민들은 슈파이델과 그의 옛 지휘관 에르빈 로멜을 독일의 아름대운 기념물들을 구원한 공로로 찬양합니다.\n\n독일을 재통일하고 영광을 되찾는 마지막 단계는 슈파이델이 그의 방위대를 물리고 우리가 게르마니아로 들어가게 하는 것입니다. 아직 슈파이델은 그의 군을 통제하고 있으며 우리에게 굴복할 지의 결정은 그의 손에 달려있습니다."

 bormann.6.desc:0 "우리가 살고 있었지만 지금은 상처입은 독일은 지난 며칠 동안 슈파이델이 그의 군을 무장해제하라는 우리의 요청에 대한 대답을 고심하며 긴장이 감돌았습니다. 그러나 슈파이델과 롬멜이 독일이 내전에 빠져든 이래로 처음으로 그들의 사단을 해제하고 보어만의 병력이 게르마니아로 평화롭게 입성하는 것을 허가함을 발표하자 온 나라는 안도의 한숨을 뱉었습니다. 바이에른의 교회에 종이 울리고 게르마니아의 펍과 맥주 홀에 즉흥적으로 모인 군중들의 손에 맥주가 들리며 국가의 모든 곳에서는 수많은 독일인의 피를 요구하던 참혹한 내전의 끝을 축하하고 있습니다."

 bormann.8.t:0 "반 하이드리히 협약"
 bormann.8.d:0 "오늘 북독일에서 우리에게 믿지 못할 소식이 전해졌습니다. 배신자 알베르트 슈페어가 이끄는 개혁적 자유주의자들이 우리에게 접근해 휴전을 요청한 것입니다. 안타깝게도 이는 그들이 우리의 대의에 동참하기를 원하기 때문이 아니라 그들에 눈에 우리의 세력보다 더한 위협이 대두했기 때문입니다. \n\n라이히에서 의문의 여지없는 최악의 남자 라인하르트 하이드리히는 다른 세력들이 서로 싸우는 동안 점차적으로 힘과 영향력을 얻어왔습니다. 이제 그는 괴링과 슈페어와 동등할 정도의 가시적인 위협으로 떠올랐습니다. 슈페어파는 이를 우려했고 이제 우리에게 접근해 서로간의 차이를 제쳐놓고 공동의 적- 친위대와 저주받을 부르군트 체제를 파괴할 것을 제안해왔습니다. \n\n당연히 우리의 병사들은 대부분 학생 민병대 조금의 도움 없이도 친위대의 망나니들을 쉽게 처리할 수 있다고 믿고있지만 병사들을 자유롭게 가용할 수 있게 만든다면 이 위협을 분쇄하는데 꽤나 도움이 될 것입니다. 선택은 우리의 몫입니다."

 bormann.9.t:0 "반 하이드리히 협약"
 bormann.9.d:0 "네 명이 독일의 미래를 건 전투에 뛰어들었지만 대다수의 사람들은 보어만, 괴링, 슈페어라는 세 명의 도전자만이 있다고 생각했습니다. 네 번째 인물 하이드리히에게는 대중에게서도 육군에게서도 지지를 받지 못하고 영토 역시 분할되며 패배가 임박했다고 밖에는 생각할 수 없었습니다. 대부분의 사람들은 시작부터 그의 승리 가능성을 배제했고 어떤 이들은 그가 제일 먼저 패배해 악몽이 끝날 것이라고까지 예측했습니다. \n\n불행하게도 사건은 우리가 예측한 방향으로 흘러가지 않았습니다. 하이드리히는 빠르게 속도와 가속을 얻었고 많은 이들의 저항에도 불구하고 독일을 거머쥐는데 진정한 위협으로 평가받았습니다. 우리가 경쟁자들을 싫어하는 것만큼 동의할 수 있는 사안이 있습니다. 하이드리히는 분명히 라이히에 죽음과 파괴만을 불러올 것이며 그가 라이히를 지배하도록 놔둘 수는 없다는 것입니다. \n\n따라서 우리는 우리의 경쟁자들을 초대해 일시적인 "반하이드리히 협약"에 대해 논의했습니다. 이는 내전에 대한 완전한 해결책은 아니지만 하이드리히가 우리가 상대하기에 너무 강해지기 전에 그를 멈출 수단이 될 것입니다."
 bormann.9.a:0 "뭉치면 살고, 흩어지면 죽는다."
 bormann.9.b:0 "우리는 배반자들과는 절대 동업할 수 없다!"
 
 bormann.10.t:0 "괴링의 거절"
 bormann.10.d:0 "실망스럽게도, 괴링의 바보같은 의식이 그의 뇌를 이긴 것 같습니다. 이제는 놀랍지도 않지만, 충격적일 정도로 우릴 자극시키는 메시지에서 괴링은 자신의 집단만 있어도 그 일을 하기에 충분하다며 우리와의 휴전을 거부했습니다. 원래부터 공격적이였던 남자의 대답은 그럴 것 같았지만, 사막에서 바늘이라도 찾던 심정의 우리를 실망스럽게 했습니다.\n\n하이드리히를 물리치고 그의 본거지로 그를 보내버릴 우리 군대의 능력은 확실하지만, 만약 모든 병력들을 라인강에 집중시킬 수 있었다면 더 간단했을 것입니다."

 bormann.0.desc: "내전의 참상을 뒤로하고, 총통은 겉으로나마 질서와 안정이 제국에 돌아오길 바랐습니다만 안타깝게도, 그러기에는 어려워 보입니다. 총통의 자비로 반역자 괴링 휘하의 잔당의 일부가 제국군으로 복귀 했으나, 그들의 수장인 쇠르너는 여전히 독자행동을 하려 들며, 마찬가지로 슈페어의 잔당도 젊은이들에게 자유화니 개혁이니 헛바람을 넣으며 각종 소요를 선동하고 있습니다. \n\n따라서 개혁은 행해질 것이지만, 슈페어가 시도했던 것처럼 국가를 타락의 구렁텅이로 몰아넣는 것과는 다를 것입니다. 총통의 명령대로 반체제 인사들은 재교육을 통해 사회로 재통합 될 것이며, 반군에 의해 무시당했던 선대 총통 아돌프 히틀러 각하의 유지는 다시 한번 제국 유일의 사상으로써 자리매김할 것입니다. \n\n판무관부들에 관해서는 총통께서 직접 노예제도를 좀 더 생산적인 방향으로 개혁하는 방안을 고민 중이시며, 또한 이미 요충지에 배치된 군에 의해 원주민들의 반란은 총통께서 거듭 약속하셨듯이 신속하게 진압될 것이고 판무관부들은 정상화될 것입니다. \n\n이를 부정하거나, 의문을 품는 등 총통께 불온한 생각을 품은 이들은 신속하게 처리될 것이며, 총통께서는 이미 본인의 정치적 수완을 통해 불온사상이 뿌리 잡은 기관의 썩은 부분을 도려내고, 빈자리를 국가사회주의에 충실한 이들로 대체하기 시작했습니다. 그로 인해 군은 선을 지키게 될 것이며, 학생들은 타락의 구렁텅이로 가는 길이 아닌 올바른 길을 보는 법을 배우게 될 것입니다. \n\n그리고 모든 일이 끝나면, 제국은 세계의 정상으로 굴기해 세상에 국가사회주의의 영광을 전파하게 될 것입니다."

 bormann.26.t: "노예 문제"
 bormann.26.desc: "노예제 문제는 오랫동안 라이히를 좀먹어왔습니다. 독일이 유럽의 주인이며 슬라브는 후진적인 동물이나 다름없는 존재라는 것에는 의심할 여지가 없습니다. 유럽에서는 이 열등인간들이 아리아인 정복자들의 명령에 따라 노역하는 일이 기본적인 생물학에 따른 자연스러운 일입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 노예제가 경제에 미친 영향이 긍정적인 것만은 아니라는 것을 인정해야합니다. 배신자 슈페어가 토해낸 역겨운 오물은 그 자체로 국가사회주의에 대한 완전한 배신이지만 실제로는 조금이나마 일말의 진실을 담고 있었을지도 모르겠습니다. 노예제에 대한 과도한 의존은 하위 계층의 실업 문제에 도움이 되지 않았으며 고용을 늘리기 위한 수익성없는 헛된 프로젝트는 우리의 경제적인 문제를 지연시키기만 했다는 것을 말입니다. 평균적으로 독일의 남성과 여성들은 소비자로서 점점 더 적은 소비만을 하고있으며 이는 노예제가 존재하는 것이 독일 경제의 몰락으로 이어질 수도 있다는 공포를 유도합니다.\n\n라이히는 노예제의 상태에 대해 냉혹한 결정을 내려야만 합니다. 당 내의 많은 보수주의자들은 내전 기간 동안 파괴된 노예 캠프을 재건해서 슬라브 놈들을 걷어차 다시 일하게 만들어야한다고 주장합니다. 그러나 조금 더 실용적으로 타협해서 노예제를 정지하고 그 잡종들을 고립된 도시 게토에 수용하는 방안이 있을지도 모릅니다."

 #THE SHOWDOWN
 bormann.28.t: "국방군 지도자와 만남"
 bormann.28.desc: "마르틴 보어만은 깊은 한숨을 내쉬며 눈을 비볐다. 몇 주 동안은 낮이 점점 더 길어지는 것만 같았다. 그는 아주 잠깐, 사소하게나마 순간적으로 라이히를 보존해야 한다는 엄청난 부담에서 벗어나 저녁 일찍 잠자리에 드는 자신의 모습을 상상하기도 했다. 그는 창문으로 흘러들어오는 달빛을 바라보며 큰 참나무 책상으로 향했다. 달빛처럼 단순한 것들을 감상할 시간을 마지막으로 가진 게 도대체 언제였을까?\n\n"하일 보어만." 졸음에 겨운 목소리가 그의 말도 안 되는 상상을 떨쳐냈다.\n\n"하일 보어만," 보어만은 전화에 거칠게 대답했다. "슈파이델, 그대를 총통 관저에서의 사적인 만남에 초대하겠네. 만약 설득력 있는 제안을 제시한다면, 나는 그대를 기꺼이 새로운 국방군 최고사령부 수장의 적임자로 지명할걸세. 페르디난트는 이미 우리와 합석하는 데에 동의했다네." 망설이고 있군, 보어만은 그리 생각했다. 처음에는 초대에 의기양양하고 만족해하던 쇠르너의 목소리도 슈파이델의 이름이 언급되는 순간 분노를 발산하기 시작했었다.\n\n"알겠습니다, 총통 각하," 슈파이델의 피로한, 약간 혼란스러워하는 목소리가 짧은 멈춤 후 들려왔다. "하일 보어만"\n\n보어만은 투덜거리며 전화기를 내려놓았고 그의 눈은 또다시 못생긴 형태를 가진 카펫을 놀라우리만큼 아름다운 무언가로 만들어주는 빛무리로 향했다. 보어만은 의자에서 일어나 방을 가로질러 잽싸게 전등 스위치를 켰다. 그러자 달빛이 순식간에 사라졌다. 보어만은 책상으로 돌아와 펜을 집어 들고 끼적이기 시작했다. 그런 유치한 방해 거리에 주의를 돌릴 틈은 없다.\n\n보어만에게는 할 일이 많다."
 bormann.28.a: "회의가 기다리고 있다..."
 
 bormann.29.t: "총통 관저에서의 만남: 미래의 방향"
 bormann.29.desc: ""들어오게!" 보어만은 벽에 걸린 자신의 초상화에 시선을 고정한 채로 외쳤다. 그의 뒤에서 문이 열리는 소리가 들렸고 두 사람의 외침이 겹치며 뒤따랐다. "하일, 총통 각하!" 보어만은 군복 차림의 두 장교, 사자 가죽을 두른 안경 낀 뱀들에게로 몸을 돌렸다.\n\n보어만은 낮은 목소리로 말했다. "환영 인사는 생략하지, 자네들. 앉게나, 이 토론을 더이상 지연할 수는 없다네. 국민을 지키고 영토를 보존하기 위해서는 조국에 강하고 안정적인 군대가 필요하다네. 그대들의 주장을 경청하는 게 총통으로서 나의 임무일 테지." 보어만은 의자에 앉으며 팔을 꼬았다. "나를 설득해보게."\n\n슈파이델이 탁자에 있는 의자에 앉으며 말을 꺼냈다. "저희에게 이런 기회를 주심에 감사드립니다, 총통 각하. 국방군을 재활성화하고 현대에 맞게 적응케 하는 것만이 독일을 새로운 발전의 시대로 열어가는 유일한 방법입니다. 현대에도 우리의 병사들을 과거의 진창에 밀어 넣을 수는 없습니다. 우리는 새로운 전략과 전술을 탐구해야만 합니다. 국방군에 대한 완전한 재검토가 필요합니다. 유능하고 존경받는 이들도 제 이상에 많이들 동참하고 있습니다."\n\n"슈페어에게 했던 것처럼 말이지." 쇠르너는 비웃었다. "총통 각하, 우리의 군대는 세계 최강이 아닙니까? 우리 힘으로 연합국과 소련을 격파하지 않았습니까? 우리는 위대한 전술 이상 가는 위대한 정신이 있고 세상에서 가장 고귀한 이들을 지휘하고 있습니다." 쇠르너는 슈파이델에게 삿대질을 했다. "이 녀석과 겁쟁이들의 집단은 '개혁'이라는 이름으로 국방군을 완전히 해체해버릴 것입니다!"\n\n두 장교가 계속해서 논쟁을 이어나가자 보어만은 무거운 한숨을 내쉬었다. 이 만남은 길어질 것이다..."
 bormann.29.a: "슈파이델이 옳다. 우리 국방군에 대한 완전한 재검토가 필요해."
 bormann.29.b: "쇠르너의 논리는 흠잡을 데가 없군. 우리의 국방군은 이미 위대하지!"
 
 bormann.30.t: "총통 관저에서의 만남: 징병"
 bormann.30.desc: "보어만은 그의 시가에 불을 붙이며 말했다. "다음 주제로 넘어가지. 징병에 관한 자네들의 입장은?"\n\n 쇠르너가 그의 날카로운 코에 걸린 안경을 올리며 말했다. "총통 각하, 제가 이전에 이미 언급했던 대로 우리의 군의 전략은 성공이 입증되었습니다. 하지만 군대는 사람이 없으면 아무것도 아닙니다. 라이히는 워싱턴의 유대 자본가들부터 동방의 권력에 굶주린 원숭이들까지 사방의 위협에 포위되어 있습니다. 만약 그들이 우리를 침공하려 한다면 어떻게 해야겠습니까? 우리의 국방군이 무력하게 지켜만 보는 가운데 우리의 수고의 결실을 빼앗기게 놔둘 수는 없습니다." 쇠르너는 탁자를 손가락으로 찍었다. "우리는 더 많은 징집병이 필요합니다!"\n\n슈파이델은 좌우로 손을 흔들었다. "비대한 군대는 비대한 병사만큼이나 그 무게로 군을 효과적으로 파괴할 것입니다. 징집병을 줄이면 우리의 군은 더 허리띠를 졸라맬 것이고 효과적으로 국방군을 전문화할 것입니다. 전문적인 지휘관과 전문적인 병사로 무능력한 예스맨들이 이끄는 겁에 질린 신참 대포 표적들을 대체하는 겁니다. 우리의 주안점은 양이 아니라 질이 되어야 할 것입니다. 따라서 새로운 징병법은 자원병으로 - "\n\n"자원병?!" 쇠르너는 폭소를 터트리며 탁자를 두드렸다. "용서해주십시오, 총통 각하... 하지만 이 자는 지금 라이히의 젊은이들에게서 전투의 영광과 명예를 제거하자고 제안하고 있습니다! 전쟁은 우리를 영웅으로 만들어줍니다. 슈파이델은 다 함께 싸울 수 있는 시민들의 권리를 박탈하려고 합니다. 고작 소위 전문적이라는 그 소집단으로? 도대체 뭘 한다고?"\n\n보어만은 손가락으로 탁자를 두드렸고 생각으로 눈썹을 찌푸렸다..."
 bormann.30.a: "슈파이델이 옳은 말을 했어. 군대의 양보다는 질을 우선시해야 해."
 bormann.30.b: "쇠르너가 군을 잘 이해하고 있군. 더 큰 군대는 더 강한 군대지."
 
 bormann.31.t: "총통 관저에서의 만남: 국방군의 역할"
 bormann.31.desc: "두 남자가 서로에게 손가락질하며 언성을 높이자 보어만은 관자놀이를 문질렀다. 그는 아돌프 히틀러가 영광스러운 나날들에 그러했듯 그의 금언에 매달리는 아첨꾼 장군들의 무리에 포위당해 있었다... 가장 큰 소리로 쉭쉭 대며 가장 센 힘으로 물어뜯고 있는 이 군복 입은 뱀들의 논쟁을 지켜보고 있자니 보어만의 속이 울렁거리기 시작했다.\n\n"그만!" 보어만은 그의 세 번째 시가를 재떨이에 던지며 소리쳤다. "마지막 주제로 넘어갈 시간이네. 우리의 위대한 라이히에서 국방군의 정치적인 위치는 어떻게 해야 할까?"\n\n슈파이델이 말했다. "군대는 조국 내에서는 비정치적인 조직이 되어야 한다는 것이 저의 신념입니다. 국방군의 의무는 국가와 국민에 봉사하는 것이지 정부에 로비하고 정치적인 의제를 추구하는 것이 아닙니다. 군이 자신을 당과 동일시한다면 당 그 자체를 대체하려고 하기까지는 시간문제일 것입니다."\n\n"언제나처럼 거짓말을 쏟아내는군!" 쇠르너가 쏘아붙였다. "네놈은 국방군을 단순한 도구로만 보고 있을 뿐 우리나라 내부의 주요한 힘이 될 거라고는 생각도 못 하고 있어! 당은 라이히의 머리이며 국방군은 강한 주먹입니다. 함께 한다면 우리의 적들을 파괴하는 데 협력해서 일할 수 있겠지만 분리된다면 모두 다 피만 볼 뿐입니다. 군대는 완전히 정치적이어야만 하며 국가사회주의 사상의 진정한 기준점이 되어야만 합니다. 비정치적인 국방군은 불충한 국방군이 되고야 말 것입니다.""
 bormann.31.a: "슈파이델이 맞아. 국방군은 비정치적인 세력으로 기능해야 해."

Even though word had not been given directly to the public about their mission, it was obvious to all what the Wehrmacht had come to do.\n\nThe thunder of jetcraft rattled the government headquarters even as riflemen shouted orders at panicking security officers who, in the true spirit of the GGN, had not received warning from their superiors. By the end of the hour, Hans Frank's clique and all attached political officials had been - sometimes forcefully - placed under arrest and evicted from the centers of power in the Generalgouvernment. By the end of the day, NSDAP functionaries and other assorted party members had been installed throughout Krakau as the heads of the new Interinregierung and immediately set to work on their herculean task; dousing the political fires Hans Frank's clique had left to consume the entire administration."

This has not proven to be a simple task.\n\nConsulting records from Germania has directed our investigators to reports and bureaus that exist more on paper than do in actuality, while viewing documents from Krakau and other bureaucratic hubs only shows how much of Hans Frank's internal system was based on cryptic whimsy and boldfaced deception. A functionary of the Interinregierung might discover reports detailing a transfer of funds and personnel to a managerial department only for another functionary to find that same department having been consolidated into a completely unrelated bureau whose new records are kept using archiving methods that can only be described as 'labyrinthine'.\n\nThe remnants of the bureaucrats and secretaries of the administration have been less than cooperative as well. This is not due to some personal resistance to assisting our operation, but rather that those individuals know less about the overall picture than even our own functionaries and investigators. It has become torturously clear that the bloated departments of the GGN's administration must be entirely dissolved and reconstructed from the ground up if the region is ever to be brought into line with the basics of governmental standards and accountability, much less function in step with the Reich."

The matter at hand, however, concerned less the final analysis of the Clique's blunders and abuses, but rather the fate of those involved. By all measure every last one of them was guilty of high crimes against the Reich and its peoples; embezzlement, fraud, dereliction of duty, even technical treason to the Vaterland, and each carried a very high price to the accused. These charges could not be dismissed, for as much as some in the NSDAP would wish to put the entire failure behind them, the citizens were incensed at the fact that on Germany's very doorstep such a national embarrassment was allowed to transpire at all, much less continue unabated for years.\n\nBormann stood from his desk and strode to the windows, considering the bustling sprawl of Germania and the Reich before him. The accused would be punished, but the question remained to what degree. Should they be subjected to the full purview of the law then the people of the Reich would be relieved and, perhaps most importantly, witness firsthand Bormann weeding out those corrupt officials and thereby cement his commitment to justice. However, there are notable members in the party who would take exception to such drastic punishments to their compatriots, and Bormann's control in the nation is not yet absolute. Inversely, letting the clique off with just a figurative black eye would endear a swath of the party to him and his judgement, though surely the people would not favor such a decision."

Further, the overall region is rectified enough that our efforts can be consolidated under one acting director again." Bormann reclined in his chair slightly, focusing on the conversation occurring through the telephone. The Führer had long known where the discussion was going, that of a new Reichskommisar for the Generalgouvernment. In advance, he had considered many capable officials whom he knew he could trust, yet none of the candidates were so superior to one another that the choice was obvious. Still, if there was one thing the Führer knew above all else, it is that politics has a way of making a decision for you. Of all options, there were three men Bormann considered.\n\nFirst was Eduard Wagner, the man responsible for The Reich's logistics during the Second World War and a notable militarist. The GGN is vital to the Reich logistically, and accordingly Wagner will excel in such a position, though he will have to step down from his military rank to receive it. Second is Theodor Koch, the industrialist of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring company. The GGN has untapped industrial potential and a savvy man like Koch will handle the aforementioned logistics well. Finally, Werner Dollinger, a reformist and famous Bavarian economist, would perform admirably in reconstructing the economic prospects of the GGN itself.\n\nBormann brought the phone to his lips, paused, and came to a decision."

It was originally to be a short - and unimportant - meeting that was quickly pencilled in between more pressing matters of state, however, it would seem the future of Germany's northern dominion evidently rested on a foundation of beans.\n\n"Let us be clear..." began the Führer, "...you are saying that the agrarian reforms in Norway fail us not because of a lack of arable land or the farmer's resistance ties, but..."" Bormann splayed a beige folder before him and surveyed sheafs of densely worded reports on nutrition and yield before continuing, "...instead as a result of the quality of Norwegian beans." It was not a question. The academic straightened his tie and replied as candidly as he was able, aware that his entire career could be made - or unmade - by the Führer's reaction to his findings. "Yes, my Führer. Norway has been limited in production of food since the medieval era, and it will never be able to approach continental lands in production, for example. By 'insisting' on forced agrarianism for the Norwegians, not only are they fighting an uphill battle with the arable land and the terrorists, as you've said, but they are also fighting against a lack of proper carbohydrates. The energy and nutrients in Norwegian oats and other native foodstuffs simply fail to meet the Reich's requirements for the population to properly contribute, in labor or otherwise, without continental imports." The Führer did not immediately respond, but digested the information carefully."

I have a few topics I would wish to bring up before I would be willing to rejoin the Pakt. After all, what's good for Norway is good for Germany, in my opinion."\n\nThe diplomat laughed. "Of course, of course. Now tell me, Lunde- what is it you would wish to change? Industrialization? A defense force? Say what it is, and I'm sure we can deliver."\n\n"Well." Lunde thought for a moment. "I'm not sure how positively you'll react to what I say here, my friend." He smiled.\n\n"Oh, come on. You'll never know until you say it." The diplomat replied again. Lunde breathed in, steeling himself.\n\n"I believe that Norway should be independent of direct German rule. We've proven ourselves loyal, we've proven that we can defend ourselves, and we've proven that Norway, by and large, supports the Aryan ideal. It seems only fair that we gain something in return for our steadfast support, and autonomy- real autonomy, not the fake client states that you held over Serbia and Bulgaria- seems like a good compromise, does it not?"\n\nThe diplomat stared at Lunde like he had two heads.

"You've done well for yourselves, and you've done well for Norway, nothing can be more true. Even still, it has not been enough. With every passing day, the weak men in government degrade all that National Socialism has done for Norway. With every month, the wolf of bolshevism creeps closer to destroying everything that is good and right, and your government gladly leaves the door open to it. You know it, the people of Norway know it, and, luckily for us all, the Reichstag knows it too. Today I bring you a proposal. My superiors and the highest echelons of power in The Reich wish to see Norway set free again; you do as well, more than anyone.

Pro-German fascists and national socialists have emerged in the capitol and marched on the Storting, the supreme legislature of Norway. While the city's police forces rapidly deployed a response, Norwegians loyal to Germany have already blocked off roads and bridges across the city with vehicles and makeshift barriers. Inside the houses of government, armed fascist paramilitaries are attempting to find and seize particular representatives and heads of government; by and large these attempts have been met with failure as a last-minute tip off sent several of the legislature's members into hiding, although the putschits have already begun "prosecuting" those they've managed to find so far.\n\nOutside the city proper, ad hoc militias are being formed as the news spreads to the rest of the country and citizens discover the fragility of their liberty. Brawls and light skirmishes have already begun devolving into open gunfights in and around the city-under-siege even as military formations form up outside the city and prepare to deploy. Still, whispers of traitors and hidden pro-german elements have stalled confidence in the ability of the guard to put an end to this threat, to say nothing of its ability to actually engage with the coup's potent German support. Regardless, the current equilibrium cannot be maintained; as the military and citizens already fight tooth and nail against the storming of the capitol, the pro-Germans and fascists are rounding up the last heads of state as hostages. All that remains to be seen is the soul of the nation and the will of the people."

Finally, word was received from our intelligence services that the putschists have failed to resist the police and military crossing into the city, and resulted in the loyalists being arrested or shot to a man.\n\nWhile our professional intelligence services assure us that no physical trace was left to connect us officially to the attempt, it is more than likely that coup members will confess and implicate us at the highest echelons.\n\nAnother swathe of Germany's lands have against all reason fallen away from the guiding light of the Fatherland; it is time to ensure it never happens again. The Führer is already meeting with the General Staff and Kriegsmarine to employ all possible options to guarantee a nation hostile to The Reich does not lie at it's very doorstep."

Even now, the putschists have begun detaining the previous members of government, and evidently also those citizens who did not make their loyalties clear during the coup itself. Our contacts in the new regime assure us that in the coming days the entire nation will be under their control and order and stability will reign once more in Norway.\n\nThis is a momentous occasion; not only will we be able to maintain our military presence in the Arctic and North Seas with the benefit of Norwegian bases, economic utilization of the region will also be able to continue as planned. Further still, we have demonstrated to both ourselves and the world the strength of National Socialism and denied our enemies a safe haven on our doorstep.

At first thought to be a fool's errand, exploration increased after finding natural gas in Germany's western-most Reichskommissariat in the early 1960s. Since then, private investors from both Norway and Germany have been looking for precious black gold offshore, following and prospecting the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of costly drilling, they finally did it. Located on the southern tip of the shelf, the wealth that had been found under the sea is seemingly boundless. Geologists now even believe that there is more oil; much more lining huge swaths of the Norwegian coasts, waiting to be discovered. As of now, just the reserves that have been discovered are the largest offshore deposits in the world, to the elation of both Germans and Norwegians.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how the two will proceed from here, but oil reserves could give both economies a huge boost. Norway in particular could see huge economic benefits and some much needed industry and diversification, but must also consider Germany's interests.

 bormann.1062.desc:0 "News from Berlin does not tend to be good news. Just today, we have been presented with an opportunity to see if this axiom is proven true once more.\n\nThe ministry of foreign affairs informs us they have just received a diplomatic invitation from Germany to renegotiate and reevaluate our "relationship" with them; in light of our people's history with one another it is a bold step for the Germans to say the absolute least. However, it is more than clear that The Reich does not handle failure and loss well, and by accepting this potential olive branch we could begin working to avoid any diplomatic - or military - incidents in the immediate future.\n\nThis a purely preliminary message; the place and time, and even the attendees, have not been specified in the text itself, though the message attempts to assure us that it will be given all due consideration on both sides. Regardless, this does place the Prime Minister in a rather delicate position. For decades our people have had the Nazi boot stamped on our throats, and there are many in the nation and government who would gladly fight the German rather than speak with them; but as much as some of our more recalcitrant citizens might wish for our two nations to glower and scowl at each other from across the sea, this is not a viable long term solution.\n\nFurther still, while we have succeeded in throwing off the tyrant's yoke once, our current military forces are infantile compared to the bloated German war machine; perhaps a treaty would do what a division of tanks could not?"

Words such as sovereignty, dignity, rights, interests, and more adorn the letter from top to bottom, notably all in contrast of or in reference to us. Ignoring their attempts at diplomatic insults, the contents of the letter is in fact quite promising! They seem to have accepted our overtures at diplomatic negotiations and are interested in pursuing a formal meeting between our representatives, preferably as soon as we are able. Though much work now lays between us and a successful conference with the Norwegians, this is an excellent first step towards managing control of the region. Not only does this spare us engaging military forces in Scandinavia, it indicates that the Norwegians are aware of their precarious position and seek to avoid any overt conflict, in politics or otherwise. This gives us the obvious advantage. Even so, there could be wisdom in refraining from pushing them too hard with any demands, for if they don't maintain their display of 'sovereignty' they might be pushed to abandon the negotiations altogether and force more... unsavory methods at resolution.\n\nRegardless of the goal, all that we need to do now is put on a smile, act polite, and engage in some bloodless - if not painless - realpolitik."

A response from the Norwegian foreign minister arrived today with their answer, and to call it a cold response would be a mild assessment.\n\nThough the language they used was colorful at times in its declination of our offer, they refrained from anything that would force the Führer on the warpath should he read the text itself, though only just barely. The closing statement of the missive in fact reads that their "...inherent rights of national sovereignty and dignity were demonstrated quite clearly once, and the German people surely do not need to be reminded again", to clear any lingering doubt about the message's true meaning.\n\nIt surprised no one in Germania that the Norwegians resented us, this much was known, but what no one was truly ready to accept was the possibility that they'd spit on the hand holding the olive branch. Their nation is unstable and their ability to resist an invasion is feeble at best; it's difficult to determine if this is a calculated move or a flash of madness.\n\nUltimately, all this does is narrow down our choice of response. Norway is valuable, in resources and strategic position, but we must determine if it's value is greater or lesser than the effort it would take to retrieve it; and yet still another variable in this equation of state is the insult this refusal's very existence imposes on us. The Führer is not known to forgive - or forget - easily."

The first - and perhaps most important - factor in deciding how the meetings will occur is first determining where they will occur.\n\nThe first choice, put forward by our staff, is to conduct the conference in Kopenhagen. Advocating for this locale will be seen as advocating for a position of strength to the German people and - more importantly - our support in the halls of government. Bringing the Norwegians to our table in our territory will please our supporters to no end, though Norway will take notable offence at the suggestion and the signalling of the lack of neutrality.\n\nThe second option, suggested both by the Norwegians and our intelligence services, is Oslo. Going to the home of our opponents after they detached themselves from us might signal weakness to some in Germany, but it will undoubtedly foster goodwill and bring them to believe we are sincere in our purpose. Further, if negotiations sour, our presence in the capitol will embolden our loyalists in Norway and perhaps assist in future operations in the area.\n\nFinally, as an overture to the spirit of good faith, the conference can be held at Göteborg in Sweden. This is a neutral meeting place and, with the Swedes acting as moderators, will be seen by both Norway and Sweden as a commitment to improving relations in all of Scandinavia, though perhaps less intently than if we simply went to Oslo."

Germany, a superpower by right, has come in the interest of peace in Scandinavia and laying the foundation for relations to last the remainder of its 'thousand years'. Norway, a land who just months ago was under the thumb of the Nazi hegemony, successfully slipped its bonds and comes to fortify its future in the shadow of the goliath. Though the haggling of details leading up to the conference might've seemed like a battle, it is waged in the name of avoiding a war. By extending one another the olive branch it is hoped that the swords will stay in their sheaths, though if their animosities flare there is no telling what will become of the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nFor now though, the opening ceremony and first rounds of negotiations, both in front of cameras and behind closed doors, will proceed in the hopes of peace over the coming days.

The German military is relaxing along the North Sea, and the Norwegian people are collectively breathing a sigh of relief for perhaps the first time in decades. The Prime Minister of Norway has lauded the ambassadors who attended the conference and spoken publicly in support of the results, whilst simultaneously the Führer has paraded this diplomatic victory to the acclaim of Germania. Though the true opinions of the delegates and ambassadors will forever be veiled behind their smiles, it would seem they too are looking forward to furthering their craft and normalizing relations between their nations.\n\nAlready, newsprinters across Europe and the world relay the revelations; all look towards the German and Scandinavian spheres with new interest."

The lead negotiators themselves have been found in diametrically opposed positions, neither side willing to give ground in the arbitration, and what was once thought to be the hope of peace in Scandinavia has come crashing down around them. Simple disagreements have become verbal disputes, and verbal disputes have, in at least one instance, become physical altercations.\n\nThroughout the negotiations the ambassadors generally managed to maintain propriety and politeness, but the uncompromising nature of the latest round of discussion laid bare the contempt each side had for the others' position. As one particularly recalcitrant pair of junior delegates had to be pulled apart, the signal that this attempt at compromise would never bear fruit was clear for all to see, and the Norwegian delegation left the conference in practiced defiance.\n\nBoth parties now return to their seats of power, empty in hand and low on patience; a microcosm of their respective nations' attitudes towards one another.

Further technical discussion occurs behind closed-doors, and only time will tell what exactly the final result, if any, will look like."

This was one of our most desired goals of the conference, and to gain it in full is a boon we will not squander.\n\nAside from the material military benefits this affords us, it also grants us great political power both within Norway and Germania. With garrisons throughout the nation we will be able to resist Norway potentially distancing itself in the future, and by securing these basing rights the admiralty won't be able to say we do not support them."
 bormann.1070.a:0 "On the field of battle or the boardroom, German might cannot be resisted."

 bormann.1071.t:0 "Norway Demands Fairer Terms"
 bormann.1071.desc:0 "There's been a slight hiccup in negotiations with the Norwegians over the past week.\n\nNorway understands - rightfully - that the Kriegsmarine must be allowed to dock at Norwegian ports and make use of their harbour facilities, but the Norwegian delegation has been quite adamant in their refusal to allow the Wehrmacht to station a wider permanent garrison within their borders. Though attempts were made at discovering how flexible the term 'permanent garrison' could be, it seems that the Scandinavians have little to no interest in stationing German armed forces on their land. This is undoubtedly a result of previous military traumas in Norway, and it is unlikely that they can be made to freely come to terms on this issue.\n\nHowever, it could still be possible to wean them towards accepting the basing of 'military sailors' in camps 'near' the ports themselves. While it's unlikely we could get away with hosting an armored company, this potential compromise would allow us to maintain some degree of direct military control should the need arise, all while maintaining the Norwegians' sense of sovereignty. We've gotten them to accept most of our demands so far, and pushing further on this will surely test our diplomatic abilities, but leaving Norway without a direct Heer presence - no matter how small - is incompatible with the region's continued stability."
 bormann.1071.a:0 "Our relationship is fundamentally strategic, a full garrison is required."
 bormann.1071.b:0 "A few brigades on shore leave is surely more agreeable."

 bormann.1072.desc:0 "The Germans have never had qualms about flaunting their belligerence, and the recent demands from the Reich's delegation do not remedy this in the slightest. Even though we have been generous in accepting the Kriegsmarine basing in our waters and dockyards, the Germans are still demanding we also allow the rest of their armed forces full garrison rights.\n\nOnce we had drawn up the language concerning the docking rights we anticipated the rest of this matter to follow smoothly, but their zealous insistence that both of our 'national securities' rest entirely on the presence of German jackboots in Norway has sought to evaporate all of our diplomatic gains thus far. We've only just thrown off the pointless and harmful shackles of the German, and inviting their tanks back into our towns is no different than inviting the Swastika back into the Storting. Not only is this untenable to our ambassadors and delegates, the common people would resent any such concession, seeing as they bore the brunt of the German's weight in the occupation.\n\nAny attempt at compromise disintegrates on both sides, and the Germans' calls for acceptance only grow louder by the hour. With no immediate solution presenting itself, we are stuck at an impasse. We can swallow our pride and assent to allow the Germans to occupy strategic locations within Norway, in the hopes that the Germans do not renege on the accords, or we can let the conference crumble around this seemingly intractable issue."

 bormann.1073.desc:0 "In spite of the Germans' insistence that a full national garrison is 'critical to European security', today they have chosen to present a more lenient set of terms.\n\nIt is clear that the new terms are borne only in the spirit of compromise, seeing how it is both more than we care for and less than they asked. Instead of full garrison rights for the Nazi military, they request that 'military sailors' be allowed to station in 'camps' near the Kriegsmarine in the ports and harbors. Their intent is still clear, painfully so, but through this accord we should be able to secure Norwegian safety much easier. There are those in our nation who think it treason to allow even a single German to stand on Norway's soil, but many more wish for nothing but safety from the Reich, even if we must stand aside them. Though it's not ideal - things in these times rarely are - it is a binding and paradable victory should we assent to it.\n\nStill, it would mean allowing armed Wehrmacht personnel to base - en masse - near our economically vital ports; should relations sour in the future, who knows what use they could be put towards..."

They have agreed in large parts to host our marines and sailors at the dockyards and ports, and have assented to whatever means facilitate this. Though we will be legally limited from introducing other troops outside of a defined radius from the ports, this will allow us to at least maintain operational readiness and strategic integrity in the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nIt wasn't the resounding victory we sought, but it will at least meet the objectives of the Kriegsmarine as well as allow us to continue further negotiations with Norway. Both us and the Norwegians have shown we are willing to fight for what we need, but neither of us is above meeting the other part of the way in mutual interest. Though the Norwegians have shown determination - perhaps to a fault - we expected nothing less of a once model aryan Reichskommissariat."

 bormann.1075.t:0 "Germany Presents a Pakt Economic Program"
 bormann.1075.desc:0 "Now that immediate matters have been settled, the second series of programs have been brought forth to the convention. The German delegation has come with the proposal of a somewhat staggering series of economic and industrial pacts and treaties to 'explore, expand, and exploit' the economic potential in the region to 'mutually improve our nations'.\n\nTheir lofty words preceded several no-less lofty proposals: The introduction of a shared market program with current and future Pakt nation-states, pinning Norway's currency to the Reichsmark off the exchange in Germania, mandating the use of German-made industrial tools and quality standards, integrating continental German dockyards for all naval construction, and much more besides.\n\nThe Norwegian delegation's eyes widened into dinner plates reading the list of 'suggestions' in what can only be described as a Nazi Corporation's wet dream. It became clear to any reader with even a modicum of economic knowledge that this series of proposals would render Norway dependent on the Reich economically, guaranteeing a long-term relationship. If the hypothetical projections are to be believed, however, it would result in large and relatively immediate benefits for the average Norwegian business owner, so long as the nation does not mind tying their future to Germany's.\n\nNow that the cards are on the table, the parties involved lean in to their compatriots in hushed whispers as the negotiations begin in earnest once again."

After the press signalled that the conference was arriving at an understanding on the economic proposals, the Berlin stock exchange underwent a minor upswing. Already, the heads of German industry are sending their representatives across the Baltic and North seas to meet with potential development partners and investors in the region in the hopes of securing vital industries and contracts once the political deal is finalized and enacted.\n\nThough the conference is not over yet, this indicates that a long and prosperous relationship between our peoples lies ahead; it requires only that we follow through and seek it out, together."

 bormann.1077.t:0 "Norway Demands Fairer Terms"

Qualms over such issues as 'tenuous demand', 'impossible economics', and even 'fiscal terrorism' were raised in some of the more private meetings at the convention.\n\nEven if they choose not to see the prosperity our offer inherently brings, they have not yet left the negotiating table. They are interested in the potential opening of our markets to one another, but evidently they demand far 'fairer' terms such as not binding their currency to ours or removing the strictest mandates on production and use. The economic advisors we have brought to the delegation warn that by agreeing we ensure the region's growth will decelerate, but we must consider the possibility that it would behoove us to have a substandard policy in place than none at all."

Any economic threats we levy are feeble without another open market for us to safely engage with, and the Germans know this well. In all areas of the proposals, it seems the Germans refuse to give an inch where we need a mile.\n\nWe have been handed an ultimatum, one that will not be resolved well in either case. We can assent to the original demands in full and practically monetarily sew our nations together at the hip for the foreseeable future, or refuse the demands and be left without any form of economic treaty with the neighboring superpower, and likely the collapse of the conference as well.\n\nThe delegates are leaving the closed meetings now to deliver their reports."

 bormann.1079.t:0 "Germany Presents New Terms"
 bormann.1079.desc:0 "News arriving from the conference today indicates a shift in the stances from the German delegation regarding their latest round of extreme demands. In another back-room meeting discussing the finer details of the hypothetical treaty, the Germans dropped their stand-offish attitudes and instead offered an amended version of the proposals that would waive several of the more draconian measures. Norwegian currency would no longer be penned to the Reichsmark for a start, and other industrial collaboration would actually favor the common Norwegian in several instances as opposed to the few strictly corporate benefits Norway may have received otherwise. Though they are loath to give any ground, the Germans appear to have realized the value a fairer treaty affords everyone.\n\nEven so, there are parts of the economic projects that do not benefit us in the short term at all, as well as the peripheral understanding that acceptance means we will be dependent on them in trade for years to come. At this point though, holding out for a better deal does not seem to be in the cards, and the rest of the conference cannot continue without a definitive solution to Norway's economic situation."
 bormann.1079.a:0 "For the time being it is affordable. Inform the delegation."

 bormann.1080.desc:0 "The Norwegians are as the glaciers of their homeland - cold and resolute in the face of all our calls of bargain and reason - but even glaciers retreat in time.\n\nAs hours turned into afternoons, the latest negotiations were thought to be in danger of becoming irrevocably mired in details and conflicting demands. Even as leading economic attaches from the Pakt made clear that Scandinavia lacked the capital, workforce, or technical expertise to survive alone as a modern economy, it was almost believed that our translators were sabotaging us, such was the resistance to the economic integration that was proposed. However, with the newly amended proposals, such as allowing their currency to float without being pinned to the Reichsmark, it would seem that the interminably cold reception has finally thawed.\n\nAll their posturing was simply that, a rather bold attempt to take every inch from us they could be allowed before either of us reached the breaking point. Even now the members of the conference are concluding the final alterations to the now-accepted economic deal, and relief is a widely felt emotion in the conference hall. Some may call it greedy of Norwegians - and several of our delegates have said so privately - but so long as this amended deal produces value for the peoples of Norway and Germany it will help ultimately secure the conference, and that itself is worth much more than mere Reichsmarks."

All other accords have been met, any surviving compromises have been accepted, and the capstone of the meeting may now make itself known.\n\nAfter a cordial declaration of gratitude to the Norwegians for their acts of diplomacy, the day's business was proposed to the filled delegation hall. The first - and only - motion presented by the Germans was thus; a full invitation to the nation of Norway to rejoin the Einheitspakt.\n\nBy reembracing the Pakt, the two nations would be sworn to mutual defense, to commit to embracing common laws domestic and international, and - most prominently - to stand in opposition to the enemies of Nazism around the globe. This proposal was not a shock to any of the men gathered in the conference that day, but its weight was not dismissed or lost on any of them. The results of this German demand would have resounding repercussions. Norway in the pakt would project German power to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, as well the British Isles; even the Americans in Iceland will also undoubtedly feel the ripples of this action wash upon their shores.\n\nAs the German ambassador solemnly finished his closing remarks, he relinquished the floor and rejoined his delegation to prepare for any... terse negotiations that would follow. The Norwegians mirrored this, rapidly forming a preliminary consensus as they too prepared for the coming days - and weeks - of resolving this demand."

While the revels were underway, the gritty details of their acceptance were being formalized by communications between the Norwegians and their government as well as the party bureaucracy back in Germania. While the success of the garrison and economic deals were foundational, this is truly the crowning achievement of the summit.\n\nWith this victory we can show to the Reich's citizens, the Pakt, and the wider world that Germany's power is neither temporary nor receding - rather it is eternal and growing by the year. While our Norwegian brothers have certainly not been model members of the Reich's community, this could mark a turning point.

 bormann.1083.desc:0 "It was known going into this week's crucible of negotiations that getting the Norwegians to return to the fold would be a near-Herculean task, and the resistance of the Norwegian delegation did not disappoint. According to their protests, the fundamental reasoning behind their nation accepting to attend a meeting of equals was to secure their future, not ours. They decry that by being forced back into the Einheitspakt, they would be forfeiting theirs and all future generations of Norwegians' "freedom".\n\nThey do not understand; so long as even a single enemy of Nazism stands, none can be truly "free". Yet, maddeningly, whenever we elucidate this point to them they push back harder than before. They have nowhere to run and we've already proven our good faith in our terms so far, so even if they cannot accept that we are fighting for the common interests of our race just yet, perhaps there are methods by which we can meet in the middle. Suggestions of permitting Norway to be granted "Pakt Observer Status" have been made, a measure that will herd them into our fold but still grant them their degrees of leeway in interacting with the wider world, even if they would not be made to observe all Pakt member laws and orders. Still, they have no other harbor in which to turn. The Reich stands astride Europe, Nazism is stronger than ever, and we stand willing to shelter them; by pressing the issue further they will surely realize the futility of resistance to the coming future."

We've come so far into the conference that the safety and security that the treaty would afford us is finally within our grasp, but by presenting this ultimatum all of it could be for nought. If we refuse, nothing protects us from the Germans - who have demonstrated throughout the conference their open lust for our union with them - or otherwise would leave our nation economically abandoned.\n\nPerhaps worse still, if we accept we would be signing away large degrees of our national sovereignty, liberty, and simple dignity. For as far as we can envision into the future our nations would be intertwined, militarily, economically, and politically. In a nuclear age where a single misstep by the arrogant Nazis - or the retribution of their enemies - could spell the end of their entire alliance, it is perhaps more dangerous to join them then spurn them. All attempts at delaying the German delegation from demanding an answer are begging to break down, and if they are not presented with a response they are not likely to continue the conference at all."

They have proposed that, failing full reintegration to the pakt, we could be offered 'Observer Status' within it. This would mean that we would have to adopt certain regulations and diplomatic stances endemic to the German's alliance, but we would be allowed to retain large measures of our autonomy and freedom in Scandinavia, Europe, and the wider world to a degree. We would be openly declaring our allegiance to those we struggled against for decades, but we would be afforded mutual-defense and market access, things that we would stridently benefit from.\n\nThis being a notable concession - as well as likely the most sought demand of the Reich - any further negotiation on the subject is not likely to bear any fruit. It would seem, then, that our delegation finds itself at a crossroads; accept membership in the Nazi community and all the risk that entails, or refuse outright and risk suffering the results of a failed conference."

Though it is a concession to not have Norway re-enter our alliance as a fully-fledged member nation, its Observer Status will meet all our of our immediate strategic goals in the region, as well as lay the foundation for furthering diplomatic progress in the future; perhaps with this coming taste they will see the wisdom in joining in full, one day.\n\nRegardless, this means that all of the capstone accords and goals of the summit have met with success, in one way or another, and has proven the conference's worth many times over by finding a way to please all parties involved."

Praise was liberally lauded upon Norway's people for our exemplary dedication to our shared national values and so on and so forth; it wasn't until the latter half of the brief memo was read that the true nature of the message made itself lucid to our foreign minister. The Germans have extended an offer to our nation to unilaterally rejoin the Einheitspakt, the Reich's hemispheric alliance, as soon as in the coming days and weeks at the earliest.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly. While we are more similar to the Nazis of the continent than we are different, we are not certain if we should stand by them at this time. We only just achieved what many in Norway sought for decades, sovereignty, and by rejoining the Pakt we would be ceding much of our newfound lateral powers to Germania's direction. Further, while it would be puissant to join our ideological allies in this dangerous world, there do exist differences in our goals, both material and political. It takes only a cursory glance to see what the extremes of Nazism have wrought upon Europe and the wider world, and if we join them we would be binding ourselves to the very thing we are trying to reform. Regardless, a cold war rages all around us and now by casting off from the Pakt we expose our nation to all the forces that would seek our downfall; Germany, least of all, would certainly not take such a response kindly."

Already, bureaucratic and party forces are making the necessary arrangements so as to smoothly facilitate the expansion of the Pakt, and a personal letter of gratitude from the office of the Führer is being drafted for delivery to the Norwegian heads of government. With this, our control of Northern Europe solidifies, and our ability to project military and diplomatic forces over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the wider continent return to their rightful status. More than one voice dissented as to the prospects of the Norwegians rejoining us in arms; it was feared that with their newfound sovereignty their judgement would be clouded and perhaps reject our hegemony.\n\nWisely, they realized - just as all will eventually realize - that the Reich's might is not temporary, nor fading; it is eternal and growing by the day."

It was honestly believed that as a result of the Norwegians rather dire straits they would accept membership in our international community, gladly or otherwise, but perhaps it was naive to assume so. Norway's new government has made clear to all watching that they disapprove of our true brand of National Socialism and seek to develop their own 'national destiny'; this declination is the natural outcome of our guiding absence and is evidence enough of their present and future failings.\n\nFailing to return Norway to our geo-political sphere will have lasting consequences; direct control of the North Sea and our ability to project power over the Scandinavian Peninsula will be undermined. Further still, this example sets a poor precedent moving forward to the integration and loyalty of our administered territories; if we let this stand Norway will be first to spurn us, but they may not be the last."

The debate over whether he should keep his job has begun to get hot, and it's up to the Führer to make the final decision.\n\nKoch himself notably sided with Göring and his militarists- something that has made him the personal choice of that wing of the Reichstag. However, it also calls his loyalty to Bormann into question. In terms of administrative competence, it seems his record as Reichskommissar is mixed. Removing him would certainly cause a wave of rebukes from the militarists, but keeping him in power- though with a few more checks on what he does- could prove fruitful. After all, Ukraine is one of the few Reichskommissariats to remain loyal during the Bürgerkrieg. Certainly, he's doing something right.\n\nOn the other hand, replacing Koch with Theodor Oberländer is a similarly viable option. With a history of loyalty to Bormann and competence in his affairs, Oberländer may make a stellar Reichskommissar for Ukraine. Of course, swapping him with Koch would anger the militarists, but it may be worth it for what could be a more useful ally in the east.\n\nIn the end, it's Bormann's call.

Georg Leibbrandt, acting Reichskommissar of Ukraine, has sent a letter detailing the issues of Ukraine to Bormann's desk, and his plans to fix them.\n\nIt's a very long letter.\n\nAccording to Leibbrandt, Koch's incompetence has led to numerous problems spiraling into major issues for the Reichskommissariat. Resistance, famine, and general native discontent all headline the letter, each detailing Koch's failure to solve them and Leibbrandt's plan to fix them. However, Leibbrandt correctly assumes, he can only introduce these reforms if his position as Reichskommissar is officially instated by Bormann.\n\nThis leaves Germania in quite the situation. While Leibbrandt clearly has a plan for Ukraine, his ideas seem to point to him being closer to the reformists in the Bürgerkrieg- a group not known for its loyalty to Bormann. However, if what he says is true, his plans may be necessary to preserve the Reich's presence in Ukraine.\n\nAlternatively, replacing Leibbrandt with Theodor Oberländer is a similarly viable option. With a history of loyalty to Bormann and competence in his affairs, Oberländer may make a stellar Reichskommissar for Ukraine. If Leibbrandt is telling the truth and Ukraine truly does need these changes to survive, Oberländer may not be the right fit for the job.\n\nAt the end of the day, it boils down to Bormann to make the decision."

Curious as to what it said, he opened it.\n\nTo the Führer, Martin Bormann-\n\nI hope this letter finds you well. I, Pieter Schelte Heerema, acting Reichskommissar of Ukraine, wish to ask you to renew my mandate as Reichskommissar. I ask you this because I have a grand plan for Ukraine, and I believe that my vision will benefit all the Reich.\n\nMy plan will embark on a vast industrial campaign to turn Ukraine from a backwater of Europe into its factory. Under my guide, the fields will fill with industry, the slaves will toil twice as hard, and the whole Reich shall benefit. If you worry of the potential cost, fear not- I promise that my assets will be used heavily in order to protect the Reich's finances. I trust you will see the potential in this and approve of this plan.\n\nBormann read the letter with interest- after all, an industrial Ukraine certainly held potential for his plans. He looked at the letter in his other hand- a letter dismissing Heerema in exchange for his original choice, Theodor Oberländer. Oberländer was good, certainly- loyal, competent, and intelligent. He would make a fine Reichskommissar. Then again, if Heerema could pull off what he said he could, perhaps the dividends would be more than worth the potential downside. As Bormann considered his options, he decided-"

Whether they be in the daily newspapers, the evening radio broadcasts or the televised news programmes, stories of Stahlecker's rise from industrious minister to Reickskommissar are sweeping the nation.\nNaumann's order to contrast Stahlecker's many achievements with the incompetency, avarice and brutality of his vanquished opponents has succeeded in presenting him as the only legitimate successor to Hinrich Lohse.\n\nParticular emphasis has been placed on the close personal relationship between the Führer and the Reichskommissar, who have often met to discuss Ostland policy and exchange bureaucratic advice. Stahlecker, while subservient to the Führer, shares much in common with him: Both men have served their duties with impeccable devotion, both men are loyally attached to the conservative wing of the NSDAP, and both men have triumphed over their respective rebels."

The Führer was all smiles today as he safely arrived in Ostland and met with Franz Walter Stahlecker, the rightfully appointed Reichskommissar and crusher of its insurrection. Salutes and handshakes were exchanged as the two old friends reminisced about the past and committed themselves to a bright future.\n\nJoining Stahlecker in front of the cameras were two representatives of his Foreign Ministry, Minister Hans Cramer and his State Secretary Reinhard Schmidt. After a few minutes of pleasantries, the four men moved behind closed doors to initiate a five-hour meeting with the rest of Stahlecker's cabinet, in which the future direction of Ostland policy was discussed."

Obtained letters (see page 44) reveal sympathy for Speerian-esque economic reform alongside criticism of Stahlecker's competency...\n\nReinhard Schmidt: State Secretary of Foreign Affairs for RK. Ostland. Proclaimed loyalty to Stahlecker at the beginning of the Ostland Civil War. Obtained diary entries (see page 49) reveal a repudiation of Stahlecker's 'sanguine' attitudes towards the other eastern RKs, and several insulting remarks regarding the Führer's height and lack of hair...\n\nNorman Wasserhaus: Deputy Minister of the Interior for RK.

His stomach rumbled with an animalistic groan, begging Tauscher for the breakfast he'd had to skip. Why had Stahlecker called this meeting at such short notice?\n\nHe blew on his clammy hands and rubbed them together with vigour. As usual, Heidi had hidden his gloves the evening before. It had become the morning routine for Tauscher to humour his daughter's silly little game and hunt for the gloves, but unsurprisingly she was still tucked into bed, and there was no time to go rummaging. Which genius had decided to organize this meeting for 5am?\n\n"Herr Tauscher?" came a reedy voice, suddenly pulling him out of his thoughts. A stranger stood before him, dark trench coat billowing in the wind. The gentleman's nose was tinged red from the cold wind, and a polite smile was stretched widely across his face. Tauscher was just about to respond when a blinding pain exploded across the back of his head, and darkness enveloped him.\n\nFlashes of light. Shouts of anger. Screams of mercy. Tauscher felt as though he were floating across the floor. He heard a voice he recognised, screaming about a diary. Reinhard Schmidt? A gunshot rang out. There was silence. Tauscher suddenly jolted forwards and landed on the cold hard floor. White-hot agony. He staggered to his feet, the stony walls closing in on him. He turned around to the uniformed man blocking the doorway of the cell and dropped down to his knees in prayer for the first time in decades.\n\nTwo shots rang out, echoing throughout the corridors for all to hear. Orpo officers heard it as they played card games next to the cells. Deputies heard it as they whispered their final thoughts. Ministers heard it as they hastily tied their shoelace nooses, hoping against hope that the torturers would not return. Within twenty-four hours, there was no one left in the building to hear anything.\n\nThe briefing arrived on Bormann's desk.

As the conflict in the Reichskommissariat escalated into furious mayhem, Meyer-Landrut forged his own path, crushing his foes against all the odds.\n\nThis degenerate represents the antithesis of National Socialist doctrine. This man, a manipulative liberal who desires to improve the living conditions of the Slavic scum in Ostland, stands firmly to the left of even Albert Speer and his acolytes. Of all the potential conquerors of the Civil War, it is Meyer-Landrut who provides the greatest ideological threat.

With his sharp suit and slicked back hair, the new ruler of Ostland looked the figure of respectability. The group took their places at the meeting table as Walther Hewel cleared his throat.\n\n"We appreciate your arrival," Hewel began. "Needless to say, it was not an easy decision to grant immunity to your government, considering our... ideological differences. Were it not for the Führer, we may never have even considered it."\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Meyer-Landrut nodded towards Bormann, trying to hide his surprise. "I understand this situation is a difficult one."\n\n"It's time to look forward," Bormann waved the statement away dismissively. He plucked up a document and studied it intensely. "Your land reforms have proven to be most controversial. They go against the very concept of Germanization itself. As for the issue of 'native rights'... are these reports true? Do you really stand by these reforms?" Ulrich Sahm shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Oskar Schindler raised an eyebrow and turned to Hans von Herwarth, who was defiantly staring at Bormann.\n\nAt last, Meyer-Landrut shrugged. "Yes. We do."\n\n"Then so be it," Bormann sighed.

The warmth of the sun, which had finally escaped the clouds, spread across his body. They descended the steps towards the five cars that awaited them. Meyer-Landurt suddenly stopped. His men and him had shared two cars on the journey to the meeting. Why were there five? One for each of them?\n\nA burst of muffled cries broke out behind him. He whipped his head around just in time to see the black bag over Ulrich Sahm's head shaking side-to-side as two Orpo officers grappled him. Before he could react, Meyer-Landrut's vision was painted black as something tight was thrust over him. Both arms were wrenched back as cold metal was pressed against his wrists. He was thrown forwards into something cramped and humid, his shouts answered only by a heavy slam overhead.\n\nMartin Bormann watched from the window with growing satisfaction as the liberals were handcuffed and carted off.

Under the competent guidance of Hinrich Lohse, Ostland had been loyal to Hitler and the Reich, becoming a model colony for Germanization. With the ascendancy of Jeckeln and his Schutzstaffel cohorts, however, its connections to Germania have been severed, and the National Socialist ideals that made it so strong have been torn out and replaced with the totalitarian nightmare of the Burgundian System. This madman's fanaticism towards the principles of Himmler and his Ordensstaat fiefdom is overshadowed only by his pure hatred for Martin Bormann and the Party.\n\nThe Ostland crisis has become a topic of fiery debate in the upper echelons of German politics. The Reformist wings of the NSDAP and the Wehrmacht alike have capitalized on the political chaos by drawing ominous parallels between the SS thugs to the east and the radical Militarists within Germania. Are Jeckeln's rants about purifying his newly conquered land of its so-called traitors any different from the many speeches of Hermann Göring during the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg? Is Jeckeln's treasonous rhetoric regarding the failure of the eastern Reichskommissariats so dissimilar from the tone of Ferdinand Schörner? Would anyone deny a correlation between the anti-Hitlerist tenets of the Burgundian System and the proposed form of 'true National Socialism' as espoused by the Militarists?\n\nThese arguments are guaranteed to boost the popularity of the Reformists, to the fury of their Militarist foes."

There is no question that Himmler and Jeckeln will stop at nothing to further stretch their black tentacles across Europe's fertile land, despoiling it with their revisionist filth. The Führer's highest military officers have advised him that precautions must be made for violent actions against the Fatherland.\n\nWith a violent rattling of their sabres, the radical militarists within the Party and the Wehrmacht have seized upon this new security threat with their usual fervour. They have openly stoked fears of an Ostland invasion of the Reich and are predicting that the other Reichskommissariats will soon collapse into sinister Burgundian fortresses. Jeckeln was supposedly emboldened by the weak state of the German army, and only by meeting the militarists' demands can we prevent further civil wars and SS plots throughout Europe.

 bormann.1128.desc:0 "With Moskowien once again under full German control, the difficult task of reconstruction can finally begin, and slowly but steadily, funds and materials will be sent to the war-ravaged cities across the region: houses, factory and infrastructure will be restored, and life will return to a modicum of normality. There is, however, a serious threat of bandit attacks, and many terrorist cells linked to the Russian independence groups are still reported as active and dangerous: should they strike at our vulnerable administration, we risk suffering a serious setback!\n\nTo address this issue, the Führer has decreed that Moskowien will be supervised by a provisional military administration until the reconstruction is over. Walther Wenck, a capable officer from the Wehrmacht, will be appointed as military governor, and given all he needs to protect the rebuilding efforts and crush the last remnants of the secessionists."
 bormann.1128.a:0 "Moskowien needs a steady hand to recover."

 bormann.1129.t:0 "Truth Or Dare?"
 bormann.1129.desc:0 "Alone in his office, Martin Bormann reflects upon his next decision.\n\nWith Moskowien rebuilt and finally stabilized, the provisional military government is no longer needed. The time has finally come for the civilian administration to step in: soldiers will leave their place to policemen, quartermasters to engineers, generals to bureaucrats. This would be the best choice for the region: a military government is by definition inefficient, and the population won't tolerate to remain under the boot for much longer, however...\n\nFrom a different point of view, turning the provisional military administration into a permanent structure would grant the Führer a political victory. Ensuring that the militarists are sent to man distant outposts in Moskowien would cripple the militarist faction in Germania, and dramatically reduce their influence over the affairs of the Reich.\n\nA small sacrifice in Moskowien for a boon in Germania, or the contrary? Bormann can't help thinking that both choices have their own value, but one can't hesitate for all eternity: in the end, it's much better that Moskowien..."

 bormann.1130.desc:0 ""Dietrich entered the officers' canteen still holding the paper in his hand. From the expressions on some his colleagues' faces, and a few whispered words, they too had received the same message: the Führer personally congratulated each of them for their new assignment to Moskowien, thanking them for their "dedication to the Reich" and their "willingness to serve in such a difficult environment", a quality "only the best officers of the Wehrmacht possess"\n\nHe wasn't stupid of course. Coincidentally, most officers belonging to the unofficial militarist faction of the Heer had been reassigned - or even promoted - to remote garrisons and outposts in Moskowien. Even more coincidentally, their departure was scheduled "immediately". He knew Bormann's true scheme, just as many of the others: remove the militarist faction in Germania by sending all of its members on permanent assignment to Russia.\n\nHe was furious about it, of course, and many agreed with him, but what could he do about it? Nothing. Bormann had them, he had them all. The bastard had put them in a gilded cage, one they had no hope to escape from without revealing their factionalism, and in the Reich, there were no factions, at least outside of those the Führer approved of. And Martin Bormann didn't approve of them.""

 bormann.1131.desc:0 "A wide shadow descended upon Moskowien, swamping its rivers and roads in darkness. Another shadow, taller and slender, crept across France and Iberia. Bormann pounded the map with his fist, jabbing a finger at Moskau itself.\n\n"They were right," the Führer spat. "Himmler and Göring, those pompous oafs. They were right. Siegfried Kasche should never have been appointed Reichskommissar. He's little more than a glorified street thug." Bormann placed his hands behind his back and paced furiously.\n\n"It's a disgrace, my Führer," Gehlen responded, shaking his head. "Radio silence from our largest, most delicate colony. I fear the worst."\n\n"Time for the FHO to prove its worth yet again. I want your best men working on this. Launch an excursion into Moskowien, find out what the hell is happening to my Reichskommissariat." Bormann glared back at the map. "Bring me Kasche. If he peeks out of whatever rotten ditch he's been hiding in, I'll hang him from the top of the Volkshalle myself.""

 bormann.3900.t:0 "A Cordial Invitation"
 bormann.3900.desc:0 "Behind his ornate mahogany desk, Martin Bormann, Führer of the German People, faced a dilemma. In front of him was a blank sheet with the Reichsadler header marking it as an official missive from the Reichskanzlei to the Italian Empire: he had tried to convince his secretary to handle the issue as usual - or, more precisely, to "write all the niceties those haughty bastards like so much" - but his aide been adamant: for such a momentous circumstance, a hand-written letter from the Führer was the best choice.\n\nFor a moment, he was tempted to simply give up, but he would have lost face with his own government, and with the entire world. Nonetheless, making the first step still felt like a humiliation for the proud Bormann: while politics and intrigue were his mother tongue, he had never been one for international diplomacy. The Reich was destined to rule over the world, why bother with petty squabbles and traitorous partners? Still, after the civil war there was little left of that Reich, which brought him back to his current predicament.\n\nSighing, he steeled his resolve. He had to do this. His mind made, he started reflecting upon what to write. The Italians were adept diplomats - even he had to admit that keeping together an alliance of nations that were at each other's throats most of the time for almost fifteen years was quite the feat - and they clearly still held it against the Germans for Atlantropa, which meant that he had to be cautious not to fail even before beginning.\n\nAs he pondered, an idea struck his mind. When the Axis was still an actual alliance, he had studied a bit of Italian, if only to make a good impression on the dignitaries that regularly visited Germania when it was still called Berlin: perhaps he could use this to endear his potential interlocutors to him? Yes! That was the solution! Or at least a start... still, better than nothing. He bathed the nib in the inkwell, and began."

 bormann.3901.t:0 "An Unusual Invitation"
 bormann.3901.desc:0 "Today, our Ministry for Foreign Affairs has received a missive from its homologous in the German Reich. Signed by Führer Martin Bormann himself, the letter states the need for "a new dawn in the Italo-German relationships" which would usher "a renewed age of prosperity" for both countries, just as it was when we were still part of the Axis. To this end, he invites us to send a diplomatic delegation to Germania for the first time in almost two decades.\n\nWhile sudden, this change in tone is far from unexpected. The German Reich has been devastated by the civil war, and can no longer afford its old domineering stance over Europe: with most of its colonies and puppet regimes lost or no longer willing to accept German authority and exploitation, the Reich needs new trade partners to sustain its recovering economy, and the Italian Empire - the largest surviving European economy - is the ideal candidate.\n\nThe Ministry's cabinet council suggests extreme caution. While a dètente with the German Reich, and the subsequent trade deals, would be a boon for our economy - and also allow us to divert much-needed reinforcements from the Alps to the rest of the Empire - we risk feeding a beast that might one day come back to bite us. In the end, however, the choice is not theirs to make: how should we answer?"

 bormann.3902.t:0 "A Dinner with Rome"
 bormann.3902.desc:0 "Sitting at the head of the long and ornate dinner table, Martin Bormann allowed himself a moment of self-gratification. Everything was going according to plan: the Italian delegation, led by the new Ambassador, Gastone Guidotti, had symbolically passed through the Brennero border post, and the Führer had personally welcomed the Minister in front of the Reichskanzlei, showing only a tinge of envy for the beautiful Lancia Flaminia. Of course, the Italian diplomats had been impeccable, bringing gifts worthy of a leader of his stature: a golden, Reichsadler-shaped centerpiece for Bormann's office from the Duce, and an ancient, miniated copy of the Nibelungenlied from Emperor Umberto II.\n\nObviously, Martin Bormann had given the Italians ample proof that he, too, could be a courteous host. The Marble Corridor of the Reichskanzlei had been turned into an impromptu banquet hall, where the two delegations were now feasting with the finest foods from all of the Pakt - the drinks were courtesy of Umberto's own wine cellar - and mingling with each other: the guest of honor at the Führer's right was the Italian Ambassador, while his own Foreign Reichsminister was sitting at his left. Drinking from a glass of fine Lambrusco, Bormann decided it was time to know his opponent better.\n\n"How do you find the roast, Ambassador?" he asked in what he hoped was good - if a bit guttural - Italian.\n\n"Wonderful as expected, Führer, just as your mastery of our tongue" his guest replied in perfect, unaccented German, bowing his head slightly in gratitude, "however, it would please me immensely if we continued our conversation in German: it has been so long since the last time I practiced it..."\n\nBormann mentally rolled his eyes. As expected from those damned diplomats, complimenting him, saving him from embarrassment and subtly accusing him of having refused an Ambassador until now, all in the same period. For some reason, this brief exchange felt to him like some sort of salute before a duel, where your opponent gives you a moment of respite before going all in."

Out of the corner of his eye, Bormann could see his Foreign Minister begging him with his eyes to make the right choice, and the silence that had fallen into the room told him that everyone had heard the question. Dozens of eyes were upon him, and he knew that the answer would either save the conference, or sentence it to a quick and painful death.\n\nOf course, the Führer had his own idea - that Atlantropa was a perfectly-justified project, and that the Italians had no right to complain - but he'd never say it. The Ambassador wanted him to admit that the Reich had wronged Italy. The easy way out was to lay the blame on his former rival, Albert Speer: he had been the one to design it, and the Ambassador would have surely accepted such an answer, but it still equalled to say that the Germans had been responsible.\n\nBormann thought about the potential alternatives. The relations between Italy and their former Iberian allies were abysmally low after the end of the Triumvirate, perhaps they'd be happy hearing him insult their newest rivals? Also, there was the eternal trump card: since fascism and National Socialism share many common tenets, perhaps he could accuse the Jews - the Swiss ones especially - of having tampered with the German economy?

They wanted to sow dissent between our two great countries, and so they prevented the Dam from ever serving its true purpose!"\n\nAmbassador Guidotti couldn't believe his ears. Did that barbarian truly think he would believe such a blatant lie? From the face of the German Foreign Minister, who appeared to wish for the earth to open and swallow him, the man was thinking the same thing: a pity that he wasn't the one conducting the talks. He was tempted to leave that table immediately - an insult to him was an insult to the Italian Empire, and therefore unacceptable - but he wasn't one to give up immediately. He would give the buffoon another chance.\n\n"Do tell me, Führer" he argued, still as polite as ever, though it cost him every ounce of his being, "what would the Iberians have gained from sabotaging the Dam?"\n\nWatching that triumphant expression being washed away from Bormann's face was already a small triumph for Guidotti, so he pressed on.\n\n"Have you ever been to Barcelona?" he added, sipping with nonchalance from his glass, "I don't think so, otherwise you wouldn't have failed to notice how that beautiful city, gifted with a soul of its own, has been turned into a shell of its former self, just as the rest of the Eastern Iberian coast. Valencia, Maiorca, Almeria, and many others have been ruined by that dam, just like Genoa, Venice and Naples. The fact that our relationship with our former allies has soured doesn't mean that I will rejoice at such unfounded accusations"\n\nAt the end of his speech, the Ambassador looked Martin Bormann in the eye, waiting for his answer. This, he thought, is why politicians make abysmal diplomats. Then, he heard something move under the table near the Minister, and the Führer suddenly flinched as if in pain. He barely repressed a laugh: the man had guts, did he really kick the Führer on the shin? He must have been desperate...

 bormann.3909.desc:0 "As he passed the Brennero border post, Ambassador Guidotti felt at home, and not just in a physical sense. His experience in Germania had taught him - or rather, reminded him - that the Reich was not yet ready to face the civilized world once more: indeed, one did not need scientific proof that the Germans were of Aryan descent: just as their ancestors, they were uncivilized, arrogant, belligerent and hell-bent on the destruction of all things fine, even themselves.\n\nAs he looked at the Italian soldiers hurriedly repositioning the road barriers, he felt a pang of sadness. It could have gone differently, if not for the utter unwillingness of the German so-called "diplomats" to even consider admitting their responsibility: diplomacy is first and foremost compromise, how can there be diplomacy when the other demands nothing but obedience?\n\nThe sadness he felt quickly became indignation. He had parlayed with diplomats from Iberia to Japan and the United States, and everywhere he had gone throughout his long career in service to Italy, he had always found respect and openness from his counterparts, no matter their official stance towards his homeland: how did the Germans think they would be able to return a world-leading nation, if they can't even convince their direct neighbor - and former closest ally - to open an embassy?\n\nAs the mountains of Trentino gave way to the verdant hills of Veneto, Gastone Guidotti felt those negative emotions slowly ebb away. He had done his duty, and he would keep doing so, no matter his task. One avenue had been closed, but many more remained open, and he would make sure that they remained that way: the Italian Empire was ascendant, and there was no place for old relics such as the Reich in this new world. He only hoped that the Germans would understand it, before it was too late."

Everyone knows what the first alliance between Italy and Germany did for the world, who knows what this second one will bring?\n"

Until then, we hope that you will reflect upon the damage you caused to the Mediterranean countries, and feel sincere regret for all this pain.\n\nDutifully yours, Gastone Guidotti, Diplomatic Responsible for Northern Europe."\n\nMartin Bormann read the letter for the third time, then he crumpled it, and threw it into the dustbin. His mind was a whirlwind of emotions, the most prominent ones being indignation and rage: did the Italians really refuse to even meet with him? Did they really have the gall to refuse his diplomatic overture? They perfectly knew that this refusal would result in his own humiliation in front of the world, and yet they had landed the blow. As he silently fumed, he promised to himself that the Italians would be made to pay for this.\n\nAll of them."

With the support for these measures soaring, any action taken against them would make the government's popularity plummet, and make powerful enemies out of the traitorous bureaucrats: it seems that we'll have to live with the consequences..."

Since the Gibraltar Dam has become the Damocles Sword menacingly hanging over Europe, it has been a nightmare not only for politicians but for cartographers across the Reich. He focused his attention on the old nation of the Caesars and its vast colonial empire, noticing that almost nothing remained from its famous boot shape.\n\n"Ungrateful bastards. We gave them weapons, taught them battle techniques, and endowed them the knowledge of the Aryan race. We made them who they are now," Bormann scornfully blew a puff of smoke over the Italian part of the map. On the other side of the table, Walther Hewel kept scrambling through the papers of his file.\n\n"I still remember how enthusiastic they were about the project. And they had the gall to shift the blame to us when it failed!" Murmurs of approval filled the room as the Reichministers agreed with Bormann's assessments on the Italian treachery. "There must be something about the Mediterranean race that makes them treacherous leeches, my Führer," Baldur von Schirach haughtily proclaimed.\n\nWith a smirk of satisfaction, Hewel grabbed the paper he was looking for and closed the file. "Fortunately, our ministry has developed approaches to deal with the issue. We can keep our current confrontational position to make sure that the Italians don't bite more than they can chew. However, we can also try a détente to keep cordial relations. It would be inconvenient for us if the Americans or the Japanese get a foothold in the continent,"\n\n"Whatever the case, they'll eventually come back to us crawling.

The man had been talking for twenty minutes now about the effects of the oil price crash in the Reich; all information that had been drilled into his head a dozen times now. More generic sameness; the man's name didn't even stand out. Steiner? Boch? He couldn't remember.\n\n"Enough." Bormann folded his hands. "I was called here for a briefing concerning the Middle East, not domestic affairs. I know how market prices work. Tell me about Syria, Iraq, Persia."\n\n"Ah, yes, uh, apologies sir." The man managed to stay composed, and shuffled his massive binder of notes. "What's important to us is that the status quo is breaking down in the Middle East; it has been for months, years. You could say this started with the conflict in Yemen, but sentiment has been boiling in the Middle East for a decade now, perhaps even longer." The speaker looked at Bormann, who gave him a shrug. "Uh, but you knew that. What's important is that the revolutionaries, the Ba'athists, are fighting to overthrow the status quo. That is of course the Italian and Saudi hegemony in the region." Although our economy hurts, we have to look past temporary financial setbacks." Bormann's face turned a shade of red, but before he could speak the man continued. "Now is the time for action! The Ba'athists oppose the Saudis, Italians, and various other regional players. Geopolitically, they are currently isolated. They have however already seen many successes, and would be much deadlier if they had some modern equipment. Without assistance, the Ba'athists will lose; there's too much pressure aligned against them. The situation looks different with our intervention. Starting with small arms and support equipment, we could of course increase our flow of supplies, and consider boots on the ground as the situation develops. What we need to keep in mind is victory for the Ba'aths means defeat for the Saudis, and more importantly, Italy. Italy is dealt a HUGE economic blow, one that would be felt for years. Disrupting Saudi Arabia is an added bonus, since they work closely with Italy to maintain their hegemony. This is the moment we've been waiting for to shatter Italy's influence in the region." The man's speech came to an end. He took a breath."

He bit the inside of his checks. "Stop shaking, idiot!" he thought. He had to get himself together. He hated presenting, but the Generaloberst entrusted Wagner to brief these men and give them their instructions for the upcoming mission. The room was filled; the last of the NCOs sat down. "Gentlemen..." he began quietly. No one in the room looked up, the NCOs were making conversation and didn't notice. Wagner cleared his throat. "Ahem. Gentlemen!" The whole room went silent. Better. "To the task at hand..."\n\n"You all have heard rumors that we may be deploying overseas soon. The rumors..." Wagner's nerves began to settle. "...are true. You men are the best the officer corps have to offer, and you have been selected for the intervention force in the Middle East. The Generaloberst has been referring to you all as the new 'Afrika Korps' The name is still pending." Wagner gave the men a second to process what he said; many of the young faces looked shocked. Some looked proud.\n\n"To hopefully answer some of your questions; you men will be leading boots on the ground, directly supporting the Ba'athist revolutionary movements scattered throughout the Middle East. That means some of you will be sent to Iran, some to Syria, and so forth. Questions?" The room was quiet. "Great." All of Wagner's nervousness was gone; he now strutted in the front with confidence. "Now, it may seem odd to help zealous nobodies in the middle of a crisis at home. Maybe it is, but command sees an opportunity to hurt the Italians and boot their asses out of the Middle East. This means that we'll be fighting Saudi Arabia indirectly, so be prepared. Success means cutting Italy off from its largest cash cow, their oil. You all sitting here, you have been handpicked, literally. You are about to embark upon a Great Crusade. The eyes of the world are upon you.

Most, however, are turned away, as many unfortunate souls are forced to push their vehicles, their fuel tanks dry and their engines lifeless, off to the side of the road. Gas station attendants rush outdoors either to plaster "No More Fuel" signs onto the sides of the road, or to replace the now-outdated pricing figures with a higher sum.\n\nThe oil crisis has arrived.\n\nAlready, the economy of the Reich is feeling the full force of imminent economic collapse. What began as a shortage of oil and a dramatic spike in prices has evolved into the absolute devolution in investor confidence in the German economy. Even the grand mega corporations such as IG Farben and Siemens brace for impact and rapidly prepare plans to downsize operations.\n\nBy the day, more and more citizens find themselves jobless as even slave labour begins to lose its value. Not only do our future plans sit in jeopardy; so too does the entire state of the German economy. There are no options on the table. Action must be taken. Current and future projects cannot continue.

Up until recently, these acts were committed in complete anonymity.

All of them are veterans of some war, and although they don't speak much off duty, they carry themselves like true warriors. Many of the younger Germans that pass through our command centers are of higher rank than these men, but look upon them with much respect and awe, and unlike their other younger peers, they don't burst into anger when they aren't saluted, which has yet to be seen from these men. It is very likely from how they carry themselves (and their numerous scars) that we have veterans from the German Civil War or from Africa among us.\n\nOur new recruits hate them, to put it mildly, but the men's new training is already paying off.

According to OrPo reports delivered directly to the Führer, tensions have been simmering in universities throughout the Reich, where toxic anti-government propaganda is dripped into the ears of naive and impressionable young Germans by their fellow students and subversive academics alike. As with most student protests, the marching in Hamburg began rather pathetically and looked set to dissipate within the next day.\n\nOver time, however, the ranks of these protesters began to swell as more and more student groups joined them, carrying their cardboard signs and chanting treasonous nonsense. The protests have only grown with time, and older citizens are also beginning to march down the streets in fury.\n\nThe screeching masses writhing through the streets of Hamburg pose no real threat to us. The German people, especially the hot-blooded youth, need to let off some steam every once in a while. Such protests are not entirely unheard of, and while the demonstrations in Hamburg are admittedly larger than most, this is likely due to the current political climate. They may angrily accuse the Party of suppression and purging, but their eventual boredom will lead them back to their studies and jobs.\n\nThis is but a small thorn in our side."

What started as a small demonstration in Hamburg has spread throughout the Reich like a disease, infesting many major cities and universities. The Fuhrer has instructed Werner Naumann and the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment to completely ignore these demonstrations and focus on unifying stories instead.\n\nThe Party's patience has its limits.

Cigarettes are far more to my taste." Gehlen exhaled some smoke with a slight grimace. "According to our reports, it is not one but many different groups conducting the upcoming demonstration in Germania. Mostly students, but not all. I've provided a detailed list in this document." He patted the chunky stack of papers before him with a pale hand.\n\n"This is absurd," Bormann growled. "I want the OrPo to block off all routes to the Reichstag, and to break up the protesters as soon as they begin to coalesce. I won't have the Wilhelmstraße blocked up by a petty band of miscreants."\n\n"My Führer," Gehlen said hesitantly, "there may be a course of action that benefits us more.

While trying to escape, a few hundred stragglers were tackled to the ground and arrested for their treasonous activities.

One shop was set on fire, though it was quickly dealt with by the fire brigade.\n\nWhatever sparked the violence and chaos did not just infect the minds of the protestors.

The brown Party uniforms were pretentious, the gigantism of Germania's buildings grotesque, the various medals and portraits and symbols denoting nothing but pretentiousness.\n\nYet, it was all necessary. Necessary for changing the hearts and minds of the people. Necessary for maintaining the Reich's legacy. How would future generations of Aryans look back upon Bormann's years as Germany's triumphant leader? The thought gave him immense pleasure. Adolf Hitler, the First Comrade, forger of the Third Reich. Martin Bormann, its savior.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen," he boomed into the microphone.

Was he anything, really, that wasn't just a number added to labor statistics? He was given his own, shoddy apartment, and his status was changed to 'employee', but to him, his liberation didn't feel like anything special. That morning, he had been looking around for Aleksy, as it had been three days since he disappeared, and, while he initially assumed that Aleksy had some sort of injury and had to recover, Antonin was starting to get concerned. Though many didn't recognize the name - one did. A woman named Zuzanna.\n\n"Can I ask you what happened to Aleksy?" Antonin asked, feeling a worry that he never thought he would have felt again after the Germans shoved him into Litzmannstadt and left the ashes of his past to rot.\n\nZuzanna seemed hesitant to respond, looking away for a moment; Antonin's gaze, however, fierce and unrelenting, forced her to look at him. "He's been relocated. Got freed three days ago and was transported to Poland proper."\n\nSomething about the tone of her voice struck her as off. In it, he could feel traces of a concealed truth. He acted on instinct rather than thought when he continued talking, and he wasn't certain why. "That's not all!" He almost shouted, and Zuzanna flinched. "S-something else happened as well- did he get there? Safely?!"\n\nShe was tempted to run, but something about Antonin possessed a sort of diehard trait to know. "... he...

I'm sorry."\n\nAntonin's head hurt as hard as if he had a migraine. Nodding emptily towards Zuzanna, he looked at his shaking hands.

As the days wear on, the debate narrows to two options:\n\nThe first contends that instead of wasting lives and equipment to re-establish the clearly defunct Generalgouvernement, the Reich should negotiate and establish a Polish client state. The militarists in the Party and the Wehrmacht are bitterly opposed, asking why the Reich should bind itself into making concessions to the Polish Untermenschen - and it remains unclear what the Poles will demand in response.\n\nThe competing offer is elegantly simple on its face, if costly - an ultimatum for the Polish state to surrender to a renewed Generalgouvernement, or to face forced reintegration into the Einheitspakt. There is little doubt the proposal will be refused, and even less doubt that the Poles can resist - and the militarists are counting on a swift victory to buoy the spirits of our people at home.\n\nAs the Führer mulls his options, Wehrmacht and Polish divisions assemble at the border, digging trenches to the echoes of the last war."

Polish had been declared a dead language, useful only to historians - just one of the many untruths in the late Hans Franks' reports to Germania.\n\nMuch of the work was now complete. They'd found a handful of Polish translators, identified their red lines, and even settled on the menu for the working lunches - a formal banquet would be 'too good' for the Poles.\n\nAll that remained was to send the invitations and to prepare the city where the negotiations would take place - Danzig. The city that had been the stated cause for the last war, would now play host to negotiations to prevent the next one. It was an ironic compromise - for the Poles were unwilling to travel to Germania, and the Reich's diplomats would not set foot in hostile territory.\n\nWhatever happened now, history would be made - again - in Danzig."

There is no disguising this fact, and accordingly we will not camouflage our aims behind implausible fictions. While we welcome this opportunity for discussion, if our minimum guarantees cannot be met, then we will spare ourselves even this last fiction - for Poland's honor demands it."\n\nThe German delegation digested the statement, both irritated at the Poles' presumptuousness and relieved at their bluntness.

"Wait. Imprecision will be the death of us all. Define 'sovereign territory' - claimed, or held? And what becomes of the Germans who remain in the territory held by your organization?"\n\n"As I said before, these are our minimum demands.

They are to be referred to as such in any and all official documentation, diplomatic communications, and government policy of the Greater German Reich."\n\nThe German delegation pursed their lips. While the question logically followed from the question of autonomy posed earlier, the legal terminology of the various states in the Einheitspakt posed specific problems. Accepting the demand would make Poland, for all intents and purposes, more similar to the pre-civil war Kingdom of England and the French State, accorded far more respect and prestige than the colonial Reichskommissariats that had controlled much of Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd all on Germany's doorstep!

He hadn't reached for force as his first option - keeping everyone in the Party guessing, and the world hopeful. And as he read through the rest of the document, he saw the ploy of his negotiators taking shape - the full forfeiture of Polish territorial claims, guarantees for the rights of what Germans remained in Polish-held lands, an open market for German corporates.\n\nPoland would be free, but only in name.

Namely, the previous privileges granted to the Reich- we believe that it's fit to go over these."\n\nBormann scoffed. "Of course. You want to cut all our benefits, do you?"\n\n"My government sees the removal of these limits as critical in these talks. I'm sure we can find a compromise, but this will go much smoother if the Reich concedes here."\n\nBormann's expression soured. It was what he expected, but he had hoped deep down that the Swedes wouldn't be so obstinate on the issue. With a roadblock in the way right as talks began, he'd need to choose if now was the time to make his stand."
 bormann.1514.a:0 "Fine, but there better be something in it for us."
 bormann.1514.b:0 "Absolutely not! Give us old rights!"
 
 bormann.1515.t:0 "라이히스베르케 문제"
 bormann.1515.desc:0 "Bormann sighed as he read through the papers. Another issue was in his hands. At least he would get to drop this one at the feet of the Swedish minister, instead of the other way around. He looked at the other man before beginning.\n\n"Minister Nilsson, I've been informed by one of our larger companies- Reichswerke, you may know it- that the benefits they enjoyed before the Bürgerkrieg have been revoked. Is there any particular reason for this change?" Bormann questioned, tilting his head, noting how Nilsson tensed a little as he heard the question. Nilsson cleared his throat.\n\n"The Reichswerke has had their benefits revoked, yes. We did so at the beginning of the Civil War- it was no longer an economic aid to us. As such, our government decided to cut our losses."\n\nBormann scowled. Swedish bastards were more greedy than the Jews or the Swiss, he thought, scarpering off with the money of good German companies at the first hint of trouble. A boiling anger raged deep within him- an impulse to strike back, to demand the restoration of Germany's status- but he held it in. Blowing up in the face of the Swedes would do him no good. Still, however, perhaps insisting on their restoration would be a good touch, even if it did strain negotiations."

 bormann.1516.t:0 "Geilenberg Protests!"
 bormann.1516.desc:0 "Bormann opened the letter with a mixture of distaste and dread- he knew from experience the seal on the front, and he was more than certain that the contents would be exactly as vitriolic as he expected. Geilenberg was not one to take insults lightly, and a man like that was a man who took any setback as an insult.\n\nTo the honorable Führer, Martin Bormann,\n\nYour recent decision to allow the matter of our benefits to slip off the negotiating table has been cause for much concern among us industrialists. Those benefits were crucial building blocks to building our base of operations in the Scandinavian market, and your failure to reinstate them will certainly be a great setback in our attempts to restore Germany to its former wealth. Rest assured that we will not take such insults as these sitting down, and it is expected of you to negotiate a deal that is favorable to our interests. Perhaps a reminder of who backed you in the Bürgerkrieg is in order.\n\nSigned, Edmund Geilenberg.\n\nOnly the megacorporations could make such a thinly veiled threat against their Führer and get away with it, Bormann simmered as he put the letter back on his desk. His hands shook with anger as he lit a new cigar- one day, those smug bastards and their fine suits would know who the real power in Germany was."
 bormann.1516.a:0 "Who will hear him?"
 
 bormann.1517.t:0 "The Slavery Question"
 bormann.1517.desc:0 ""I'm sorry, Herr Nilsson, I simply must insist." Bormann flashed his smile, cold and calculating, and Nilsson took a moment to think. Bormann's smile morphed from a fake, diplomatic one into one of enjoyment- he would make the Swede squirm, one way or another, that was certain. Nilsson's silence pervaded through the room for a near minute before he finally began his response, slow and deliberate.\n\n"I'm certain we can reinstate those economic benefits, Herr Bormann, on one condition."\n\n"I'm all ears."\n\n"No slaves. None. Not in Sweden. You agree to that, we have a deal."\n\nExternally, Bormann's face remained unmoved, but rage shook the iron bars of his mind. Those bastard Swedes! A simple agreement, and they moralize and twist it into something rotten and corrupted, all for their profits and morals. It almost made one sick, and it was certainly something that gave Bormann the impulse to leap from his chair and strangle the diplomat then and there. He scratched his neck as he thought, trying to find some way out of his own hole."
 bormann.1517.a:0 "I shall meet with Geilenberg."
 bormann.1517.b:0 "Let us discuss other matters, no?"
 
 bormann.1518.t:0 "Negotiations with Geilenberg"
 bormann.1518.desc:0 ""Are you mad?"\n\nGeilenberg's intonation cut into Bormann's ear like a chainsaw, and the Führer sighed in frustration. "It's not what I would like either, but these fucking Swedes- they're playing hardball, you understand? Moralizing Jew bastards won't accept anything less than it."\n\n"Well, aren't you the silver tongue? You can sort out an agreement, can't you?" Geilenberg's disbelief slid slowly towards anger, and Bormann winced as he noted the change. He looked out the window as he considered his next words- Sweden, for its faults, was certainly a beautiful country. A shame that their government had to be so corrupt- it would have made a fine addition to the Reich.\n\n"Look, it is what it is. I'm sure you can spare a few slaves, can't you? I can't convince-"\n\n"You certainly can." Geilenberg's sharp voice cut Bormann's speech off, and Bormann could only listen as the magnate continued. "I expect this. . .foolishness off the table. Make it happen." Bormann resisted the urge to toss his phone out the window- one way or another, a choice had to be made."
 bormann.1518.a:0 "To hell with that! You'll thank me later."
 bormann.1518.b:0 "Don't say I didn't warn you."
 
 bormann.1519.t:0 "Sweden Refuses Consessions!"
 bormann.1519.desc:0 "Nilsson smiled as Bormann re-entered the room, taking his seat heavily. The diplomat's glasses seemed to spark as he nodded, light reflecting off their glossy black rims. "Herr Bormann." He began. "I trust you have made your decision regarding our compromise?"\n\nBormann slumped in his seat, forcing himself to doom his own proposal. It was stupid, he thought- the companies could certainly spare some slaves, could they not. He was no liberal, but certainly some compromise could be made. No matter. Politics demanded that this be his hand, and so he would play it- good or bad. There's no folding at the diplomatic table.\n\n"Indeed. I have spoken with Geilenberg, and we have come to the decision. No compromise. Take the slaves or leave the business. It is yours to decide."\n\nThe look of stunned confusion that flashed across Nilsson's face almost made the whole ordeal worth it. He stammered for a moment before finding traction, recovering his poise with haste. "Well, Herr Bormann, I'm afraid that we have no deal on the benefits. We simply will not accept slaves in Sweden."\n\nBormann's face did not react to the setback- indeed, it would almost be satisfying to see Geilenberg's demand blow up in his face if Bormann wasn't going to take the fall for it. He slowly nodded, his displeasure shining through his tone- "That's very unfortunate, Herr Nilsson.""
 bormann.1519.a:0 "Shall we move on?"

 bormann.1520.desc:0 "A spontaneous outbreak of violence in Saxony, leaving 30 dead. An explosion outside a staff break room in Bavaria, leaving 12 guards dead and another dozen wounded. A slave mob forming in a factory in Poland, causing widespread destruction and requiring Heer intervention to put down. Slave violence is no stranger to the Reich, but a recent spike of incidents in Reichswerke factories has caused much concern- and anger- at our recent actions in Sweden.\n\nBormann's refusal to drop the compromise of leaving slavery out of Sweden, while successful in restoring benefits, has been directly correlated to the worrying trend of increased violence. This, of course, does not endear ourselves to our corporate friends, who's anger at our refusal to concede to them has only been compounded. What should have been a great victory for our Foreign Ministry has been turned into yet another issue to fix.\n\nIn the end, however, the benefits have been restored successfully. Perhaps one day, our success will become apparent. Until then, however, we will have to put our head down and march forwards."

 bormann.1521.t:0 "Sweden Wants Access to Reich market"
 bormann.1521.desc:0 "Herr Bormann, we have received your demands regarding German preferences in Swedish markets, and we have discussed it among our delegation." Nilsson began, his eyes peering out through the lenses of his glasses. Bormann raised an eyebrow and nodded for him to continue. "We find them acceptable, on one condition."\n\nBormann kept his face neutral, despite a wave of irritation rising inside him. "What condition is that?"\n\n"We would like similar preferences in German markets. Manufacturers like Volvo or Ikea." Nilsson cooly replied. Bormann scoffed.\n\n"German manufacturers have no need for foreign competition. Why should we accept?"\n\n"Well, besides the immediate ramifications of a failure to make a deal, perhaps some competition would be useful for your business, yes? Besides, I've heard that some in your government have called for economic liberalization, and it certainly wouldn't hurt your economy to open up a little, would it?" Nilsson smiled in a way that made Bormann want to crush his skull. Of course, he did have a point- opening up the markets wouldn't be a catastrophically unpopular move. He sat, deep in thought, before replying."
 bormann.1521.a:0 "Yes, perhaps it would be better."
 bormann.1521.b:0 "Nope. There is only for Germans"
 
 bormann.1522.t:0 "Industrialists are Protesting!"
 bormann.1522.desc:0 "To the Glorious Führer, Martin Bormann-\n\nOnce again, disheartening news has reached us from our contacts in Stockholm. If these reports are true, we must voice our great discontent, for they seem antithetical not only to our business practices, but to the fight against decadent western capitalism that National Socialism has espoused for decades.\n\nAllowing Swedish companies into German markets will not only threaten our shares and stakes in the European market, but allow capitalist corruption to seep into the very depths of our society. Such an opening will be exploited in full by our enemies, and we will be corroded from within by western spies.\n\nIf this sudden change in course is not corrected, we will have no choice but to preserve National Socialism by any means necessary. For the sake of our Reich, see reason and say no to these capitalist pigs.\n\nEdmund Geilenberg."

 bormann.1523.desc:0 "The next morning, Bormann traditionally walks through the corridors of the Reichkanzlei, watching the officials arriving at their offices. But this day was not like the previous ones. Passing the mime of the industry departments, Führer observed only the dead emptiness of the premises. There was no rustle of documents, no tense calls between ministries. Absolute silence.\n\nBormann understands that in a situation of tense negotiations with the Swedes and industrialists, such behavior means nothing more than sabotage, and understands that a long downtime of key departments will lead to inevitable discontent of both party officials and the general population.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to make the main choice - are we ready to strike a blow at the industrialists' lobbyists in the Party, or should we succumb and yield to them in negotiations with Sweden?"

Things aren't going well. I've been ordered to tell you that the government is demanding a... large repayment for lost minerals."\n\n"I'm sure the Reich can..." Hewel's eyes widened as he heard the sum laid out. "Billions of dollars?!"\n\n"Yes, that's the sum the economists calculated. Look, I didn't make the number-"\n\n"I don't care about that!

He let them rest near his mouth. "Okay, what to do..." He said, contemplating how to reduce the damage as much as possible. He stood up suddenly. "I'm not taking the fall for this. This is all you, got it? This means it's your job to salvage this mess. If it's out of your control, come get me."\n\n"Führer-"\n\n"Get out of my office, I'm extra busy now because of you."

 bormann.1527.desc:0 ""Oh god, this is worse than I thought." Bormann said, staring at the stack of letters on his desk.

Almost the entirety of the Reichstag wanted Hewel gone. Bormann sighed. He thought he had already made his position clear. He began writing a memo."

 bormann.1528.t:0 "An Awkward Silence"
 bormann.1528.desc:0 ""I'm not firing Hewel, and that's final." Bormann ended his announcement. There was an angry cry from down below. Evidently those scheming bastards in the Reichstag had convinced them that Hewel was the one to botch the negotiations. While this was good for avoiding the blame for the failed negotiations, it wasn't good for Hewel. Bormann knew that an unruly mob could easily be pacified. Those bastards in the Reichstag wouldn't get him this time. He'd fire a few more men, but not poor Hewel.\n\nBormann sat at his desk, calmly filing paperwork to the sounds of the Orpo firing on a crowd."

All the men I knew in it are gone and replaced with some party bureaucrat who hates me." Bormann had a realization. He had fired too many people. "They're sort of contented but... I don't think I have as much control over them as I used to. It's more of an autonomous organ separate from me. This might cause some... problems if left unchecked."\n\n"Well I'll be sure to check it then. Good day." Bormann rushed Hewel out of his office. He began contemplating how to fix the situation."

 bormann.1530.desc:0 "Every year since the 1930s, the tonnage of ore traded from Sweden to Germany has, save for the economic crash of the 1950s, seen an upwards trend. It is an undeniable fact that the delivery of Swedish ore into our hands is essential, not only for economic reasons, but for defence reasons too.\n\nWith recent trade negotiations having thus far concluded favorably, this upwards trend is due to continue for decades to come. However, with the increased consolidation and organization of the German-Swedish ore trade, a question has risen as to who will be the responsible party for the increased transportation of ore: Germany or Sweden?\n\nUpon one hand, German firms would water at the mouth to place their hands upon the government transportation contracts which would follow such an arrangement. Adversely, such contracts could prove costly to the Reich, and the corporations would surely invent a plethora of novel costs that would suddenly be associated with the transportation of ore -- costs that they only incur now that the Reich is footing their bills.\n\nUpon the other hand, it could be left to Sweden to deliver their exports of ore henceforth, with German firms receiving their goods all the same, and the Swedish being left to foot the bills and handle the blame should shipping arrangements go awry. Our firms may be irked at such an arrangement, but the cogs of our industry will continue to turn all the same."

Is Sweden worth dooming an industry?"\n\n"You don't understand how important Sweden is." Bormann spoke up. His voice was filled with rage. "I'm a very busy man. Please leave." Bertram opened his mouth again, then realized nothing he could say would change Bormann's mind. Bertram left, disappointed.\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with similar complaints. When there was a lull in the rapid series of complaints, Bormann wondered something."
 bormann.1531.a:0 "Was it worth it?"

 bormann.1532.t:0 "Mistrust on the Ship"
 bormann.1532.desc:0 "It was the day after Bormann had decided to leave the logistics to the Germans. The Swedes stared at him oddly. A blanket of silence had descended on the ship. Bormann and the Swedes did their paperwork separately for a while. The silence was occasionally broken by meaningless banter between delegates, but nothing substantial came of it. Bormann could almost feel the unresolved tension in the air as he and the Swedes passed papers back and forth. Despite all the papers filled out and signed, no progress was made that day."
 bormann.1532.a:0 "I don't think it was worth it."
 
 bormann.1533.t:0 "Final meeting"
 bormann.1533.desc:0 "Hewel and Bormann stepped onto the ship for what would hopefully be the last time. The Prime Minister of Sweden himself, Tage Erlander, was there. The negotiations progressed at a snail's pace, getting stuck on menial topics of debate frequently. It would all be worth it at the end. Bormann had to leave, but Hewel could hopefully secure it on his own.\n\nBormann sat in his office, awaiting the news. Suddenly, Hewel burst into the room..."
 bormann.1533.a:0 "So?"
 
 bormann.1534.t:0 "Negotiations succeed!"
 bormann.1534.desc:0 ""Good job!" Bormann said. He looked happily at the photograph of Erlander and Hewel shaking hands.

That'd show those ignorant bastards in the Reichstag how Bormann was competent. While Hewel had signed the deal, the majority of the work had been done by Bormann, hadn't it? Bormann would make sure the official reports said this, as it was true, after all. Hewel was more of an... advisory. After Hewel had left the office, Bormann got on the phone with the censors."

We have Curt Göransson, head of the Army, Nils Montan, a Swedish ambassador to us, and the Prime Minister himself, Tage Erlander. The fourth person here is their translator." Hewel said. Almost as if on cue, Bormann walked into the room. Hewel and Wenck rushed to greet him. Bormann waved them off and sat at the table. Erlander spoke up. The negotiations begun.\n\nIt was finally decided after three grueling hours of menial discussions. There would be more negotiations like this over a series of days, with the absence of Bormann and Erlander."

They seemed pleased.\n\n"Now, about what we came here for. You see, the world is currently very unstable, and we should prepare for any instability. If we take a look here..." Wenck pointed to a spot on the map as he roughly explained German intelligence about its rivals. A discussion began about what to do if the OFN invades. Though the Swedes noticeably recoiled a bit at the more... racially charged parts of the discussion, the talks seemed to go well."

The Pakt Wargames could be used as a tool to help our relations with Sweden. We could invite all their branches of service, bringing us both closer together. This may be viewed as a violation of Sweden's neutrality, however. We could also only invite their ground forces, which could feel less like a violation of Sweden's neutrality but not creating as much of a bond between the two nations."

While they may not be willing to fully align with us, they are willing to provide us with assistance. If Sweden were to become heavily aligned with the Pakt we would surely be able to influence Finland as well, leaving all of Scandinavia with us."
 bormann.1538.desc_not_nor:0 "Since Norway has fallen into degeneracy once more we have lost our foothold in Scandinavia, losing much of our influence in the region. Thankfully, a new opportunity has arisen in the "neutral" nation of Sweden.

These are supposed to just be joint military exercises between Sweden and Norway." Göransson replied. As usual, Montan raced to pick up the pieces.\n\n"What my colleague means here is that German involvement in affairs between Sweden and Norway could be seen by... others as a breach of our policy of neutrality. I hope you understand what effect this could have on us."\n\n"I do." Wenck said. He cleared his throat."

You want protection, right?"\n\n"Yes, but we don't want our country turned into an airfield! Come on, Wenck. This is like us demanding Germany to pay for airbases to be used by Sweden."\n\n"Göransson, you forget," Hewel butted in. "Sweden is not as strong as the Reich. You need our protection. It's only fair we ask for payment in return."\n\n"Then how have we-"\n\n"Alright, settle down. Do the Germans still demand we build airbases in Sweden for their use?

 bormann.1544.d:0 "Karl Dönitz walked into the room, surprising all those present at the negotiations.\n\n"Gentlemen, I have a proposal." He slid a stack of papers onto the table. The translator read them out loud to the group in both German and Swedish.\n\n"Give the Kriegsmarine the right to dock and repair in Swedish ports? That seems a bit... superfluous, wouldn't you say?" Montan said.\n\n"Yes, what the Swede said. Why does the Kriegsmarine need Swedish ports in the Baltic when we already have dominance over the region?" Wenck agreed.\n\n"You don't see it, Wenck. We need Swedish ports so we can project our dominance further over the Baltic. Our hold will become stronger. We will be able to more effectively pressure Finland and prevent an OFN invasion." Dönitz explained. "The Swedes will benefit from this, of course."\n\n"You understand that giving up port space to German ships will endanger our neutrality further, correct? It could even be seen as a violation of our sovereignty." Göransson countered.\n\n"Well I think it's a good idea. Hewel, how about you?" Wenck asked."
 bormann.1544.a:0 "I think Dönitz has the right idea too."
 bormann.1544.b:0 "The diplomatic hassle would be more trouble than it's worth."
 
 bormann.1545.t:0 "The Question of Arms Trading"
 bormann.1545.d:0 "I hope you don't find this as overbearing. We have our own demand for the Reich." Montan said. The group looked at him boredly. "We request a discount on German weapons in exchange for the restoration of Swedish exports to Germany to their pre-Civil War level."\n\n"No. You'll pay the same price for our arms as everyone else." Wenck snapped.\n\n"What? You can't just-"\n\n"I just did."\n\n"Hang on, I need to speak with my colleague in private for a bit." Hewel said. He dragged Wenck outside. "Dammit Wenck, what the fuck are you thinking?"\n\n"We have the finest arms on the planet! We don't need to give them a discount!"\n\n"This isn't about how good our arms are. This is their only demand, if we reject it we look like selfish pricks! Come on, just tell them you've changed your mind and we can put this issue to bed.""
 bormann.1545.a:0 ""Alright, fine. But I won't be happy about it.""
 bormann.1545.b:0 ""They'll buy our superior Aryan arms at the same price as everyone else!""
 
 bormann.1546.t:0 "Concessions, Protections"
 bormann.1546.d:0 "It's simple, we want to protect Reichswerke's concessions. Our land, our police." Göransson declared plainly.\n\n"It's our company, though. The Heer will do the job easily." Wenck argued.\n\n"Do you really think we can't protect our own land? I assure you, our police are some of the most well trained in the world."\n\n"You don't need police, you need soldiers. Who knows what insane bastard will attack-"\n\n"Which is why our professional police force will handle it easily-"\n\n"Your police force is neutered! They can't"-\n\n"Stop! Okay, this is due to a misunderstanding." Montan butted in. The sudden shout put all eyes on him. "Wenck, you realize that if we let the Heer protect them it'll make Sweden look weak and vulnerable, right? This is why we insist on the police protecting them instead. If you really insist, we'll let the Heer protect them. So, let's move on, shall we?"
 bormann.1546.a:0 "The Heer will be the ones to protect it, that's final."
 bormann.1546.b:0 "Well, in that case I suppose the Swedes can handle themselves."
 
 bormann.1547.t:0 "Wissenschaftliche Gruppe"
 bormann.1547.d:0 "Let's see... what's next on the agenda..." Montan said as he attempted to organize the talks. "Ah, the Cold Climate Research Group."\n\n"The what?" Hewel asked. "I wasn't informed of this." Hewel made a mental note to fire some people once he got back to Germania.\n\n"Oh. Well, apparently some German and Swedish scientists have gotten together to research combat in the cold. They're using the north of Sweden as a testing ground." Montan explained.\n\n"What are they testing exactly?"\n\n"I'm not sure of the specifics, but they want the backing of both of us."\n\n"I'm not sure about this. We don't need to test things we already know." Rapp butted in. He and Hewel had the same suspicions about what was being tested. Pressuring Sweden into this could seem like a breach of neutrality, though if Sweden accepts we could test some... untested weaponry."
 bormann.1547.a:0 "We can't pass up an opportunity like this. Let's fight and research together!"
 
 bormann.1548.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
 bormann.1548.d:0 "The negotiations had gone on for days without any progress. It had become a screaming match between Wenck and Göransson as they both argued about which country could defend against or crush the other. Hewel and Montan sat idly by as the translator was preoccupied with the fast-paced whirlwind of insults going on behind them. Montan didn't like Hewel that much either. His head hurt from the loud screaming. He could see the writing on the wall. Montan stood up. Wenck and Göransson's argument fell into a lull as they stared at Montan.\n\n"Alright, we can all see where this is going." We said firmly. "Absolutely nowhere. So," He began picking up the documents laid on the table and stuffing them in his briefcase. "I'm going to stop this right now." He closed his briefcase, and walked towards the coatrack hanging in a corner of the room. "Sweden will not be joining the Einheitspakt as an observer. We will still continue to deal with the Germans, it'll be business as usual." He absentmindedly put on his coat and hat as he spoke. "We are neutral. We do not pick sides, okay? Neutral. The Swedes depart the negotiations. Good day." Montan left the building. Göransson followed.\n\nWenck and Hewel were left sitting in a stunned silence. Finally, Hewel spoke."
 bormann.1548.a:0 "The Führer'll have our heads!"
 
 bormann.1549.t:0 "Negotiations succeed!"
 bormann.1549.d:0 "A strange thing had happened at the negotiations. Over the past few days, Wenck had noticed that he was getting along with Göransson. The negotiations had turned from a tense argument into a friendly discussion. Everyone could see where this was going, and everyone liked it. After a bit of small talk, it was finally done. Montan looked over it with glee."
 bormann.1549.a:0 "A toast to our new cooperation!"
 
 bormann.1550.t:0 "The Letter"
 bormann.1550.d:0 "Bormann stared incredulously on the manila envelope. The rich quality paper had its smooth texture broken only by the delicately curling letters reading "Der Führer." But he had seen plenty of formal letters over the past twenty-odd years. What really threw him off balance was the wax zeal on the back of the envelope. Two lions holding a crowned shield adorned with more lions and crowns.\n\n"It's the royal se-" one of the small gaggle of secretaries who had brought the letter to his office began to say, but Bormann cut him off with a hand movement.\n\n"I know what it is, I saw this back when I was the Old Führer's assistant, before the War. But why the- I mean, what reason could the Swedish royals have for writing me? Even when the Führer nominated me successor, I only got a curt congratulatory call from that limp wristed loser they call a prime minister. I haven't seen them since the Führer's funeral, and the Reich Chancellery hasn't gotten a letter directly from Stockholm Palace since the invitation to the coronation in 1950!"\n\n"Maybe you should open it, my Führer?"\n\n"Of course I am going to open it, you mouthbreathing Bavarian turd-peddler! Siegfried, have that man demoted for making idiotic remarks about his Führer! And make sure he knows he's lucky he doesn't get worse. You! With the glasses! Letter opener, now!"\n\nOne of the other four secretaries stepped forward, lightly trembling, and gave the Führer the letter knife that had been lying on his desk in front of him. With a swift movement, Bormann opened the wax seal and glared angrily at the secretary until he retreated several steps back. The Führer let his eyes scan the single page. "Seems the Swedes want to join the Pakt. Cowards, aren't even going to put up a fight like their neighbors. Maybe that makes them smart. Oh well, one of you prepare a response praising them for their wisdom and stating I will make a state visit as soon as possible. Make sure to make it clear I want Orpo officers on the ground helping with security, I don't want some Norwegian bolshie getting any ideas. Oh, and inform Gerda she can buy some furniture if she comes along. Might put her in a better mood.""
 bormann.1550.a:0 "Off to Stockholm!"
 
 bormann.1551.t:0 "Dinner with the King"
 bormann.1551.d:0 "The assaulting smell and taste of the surströmming almost made Bormann retch, but he did his absolute best keeping it in and keeping his eyes locked with the Swedish king sitting across from him. He couldn't show weakness in front of all the dignitaries and officials from both Sweden and the Reich, especially as the Swedes had insisted a photographer be present at the dinner party. The monarch gave the suffering Führer a seeming look of genuine concern, but Bormann noticed the sparkle of playful joy in his eye.\n\n"Are you quite alright, Herr Führer? Maybe our cuisine is not to your liking? I can have the cooks prepare something else for you."\n\nBormann swallowed with great effort and gave a pained smile.\n\n"That will not be necessary. And it is 'my Führer,' Your Highness."\n\n"Your Majesty. And not quite yet."\n\nThe king gave another patronizing smile as Bormann suffered through another bite. That royal asshole, he was doing this on purpose! Fucking Bernadottes, Napoleon should have had them all shot!\n\nBormann forced another smile. "I must say I am delighted that Sweden has seen reason and wishes to join with the Reich and its loyal allies in building peace and prosperity for all Europeans. I am looking forward to the signing ceremony later."\n\n"Indeed, a remarkable change of policy, Führer Bormann. I must say, over the past decades I have heard hundreds if not thousands of stories of the peace and prosperity the Reich has brought our Scandinavian neighbors since the courageous liberation of their lands from their governments. German justice, swift and effective, wielded with the efficiency and skill of NSDAP."\n\nBormann felt like he had been insulted, but couldn't put a finger on it, so he simply gave another sheepish smile and forced another piece of surströmming into his mouth."
 bormann.1551.a:0 "How much longer must this go on?"
 
 bormann.1552.t:0 "Final Negotiations"
 bormann.1552.d:0 "Today marked the culmination of our ongoing efforts to facilitate Swedish entry into the Einheitspakt and the facilitation of friendship between our great country and their... somewhat less great nation. While the Americans and Japanese might complain and whine, suggesting we "strongarmed" or somehow forced the Swedes to this point, the solemnity and pomp of today's ceremony at Stockholm's Royal Palace should awe even the international press into silence.\n\nIn the dozens of gilded halls of the palace, hundreds of dignitaries from all over Europe have been clinking crystal glass with expensive Riesling and eating Swedish delicacies. At the center of it all has been the Führer, the royal family, and the Prime Minister of Sweden, the evening culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Stockholm, marking the final integration of Europe's last truly independent Germanic state into the economic and military structures of the German Reich's mighty alliance. The Pakt will rise again after the troubles of recent years,  stronger than ever before!"

 bormann.1600.t:0 "Look to the North"
 bormann.1600.d:0 "The light of evening twilight thickened over the busy streets of Helsinki at the moment of the arrival of Walter Hewel by plane. From the very beginning, the Reichsminister took a contemptuous dislike to the city. At the outset, he was greeted by the inhospitable and damp weather of the North, but what was more not to his taste was the appearance of the Finnish capital itself, with its congregation of the lines of small, dull houses, rarely flavored by the architectural legacy of the Swedish and Russian colonists, lacking of monumentality, intrinsic to the cities of new Europe. In Hewel's mind, the landscape of Helsinki revealed the essence of the Finnish people in the most laconic way - a tedious city worthy of its complacent, immature nation.\n\nOf course, neither Hewel nor the Reich could afford to write off the whole nation only because of their personal sentiments towards. Finland was - and still is - a stalwart fortress against the Russian menace. Being a faithful ally and adversary to Germany during her push towards the East, Finland preferred to stay aside from events of Central Europe, sticking to their politics of "neutrality" and being satisfied with her status as a Pakt Observer, while keeping their modest approach towards the degenerate nations of Japan and America.\n\nThe Reichsminister was able to get the first impression of his Finnish counterparts only early in the morning. Being flirtatious and friendly at surface, the Finns clearly understood what they had to bargain for and demonstrated their assertiveness behind the facade of respectability. Bringing Finland back to the lodge of the Pakt was not a straightforward task, but what's the Reich if not a persuasive, fearsome hegemon, and who's Hewel if not a man who understands it the most, after the Führer himself, of course?"
 bormann.1600.a:0 "Negotiations will proceed."
 
 bormann.1601.t:0 "Attache Meeting"
 bormann.1601.d:0 "The meetings between the German attaches in Helsinki and the Finnish military delegation passed with great punctuality. The initial arrangements, flight and landing to the Finnish capital, escort to the headquarters, an evening dinner - all has been arranged accurately to the minute. After the initial share of courtesies and pleasantries, opportunity to move on to pressing problems provided itself during the meal. Among the Wehrmacht representatives, the initiative of talks laid on the shoulders of Hans Krebs, a man familiar to military diplomatic missions and officer of great dedication to the mission of National Socialism.\n\n"We appreciate the hospitality of the Finnish noble leadership," said Krebs, slowly putting his hands on the patterned table covered with a patterned coverlet, "but at the same time, we have come with a clear task. Ever since the triumph of Führer Martin Bormann in Germania, the Finnish government showed no response in regards to the German aid. As you know, we have come to correct this misunderstanding."\n\n"Herr Krebs," said General Marlota, barely hiding his hesitancy, "the circumstances did not suggest a viable alternative for us. The conflict between Führer Bormann and power pretenders across the Reich made it impossible to rely on the aid from Germania. With the rising tensions on the Russian border, we could not afford to neglect our territorial security."\n\n"We were assigned to help you in resolving those matters," Krebs responded. "After all, it would be a disgrace to our reputation if the Greater Germanic Reich failed to secure peace and stability in Europe by armed means. The inviolability of Finland is as much in our interests as yours and we desire to reinvigorate the military cooperation between our nations to demonstrate our intentions.""

 bormann.1602.t:0 "Rearmament"
 bormann.1602.d:0 "To Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs\n\nWalther Hewel\n\nOn the occasion of a new stage in relationship between the Greater German Reich and Finland, we present you a short account of the state of the Finnish armed forces that has been thoroughly examined by assigned specialists for the last few decades\n\nDespite the lack of faith in the [FIN.GetLeader] government and the rise of political opposition to the current rule, the morale in the Finnish society shows no signs of decline. Although dissatisfied by reckless actions of the [FIN.GetLeader] administration, an average Finnish soldier stays loyal and patriotic to his country, partly in fears of the possible Russian invasion of Karelia.\n\nSuch flattening words, however, can't be said about the state of Finnish military technology. Despite their vindictiveness against the threat incoming from the Slavic barbarians, the Finnish government showed little interest in developing modern equipment for its armed forces, rendering their weaponry and vehicles outdated towards the increased demands of modern warfare.\n\nAs the result of close examinations, we advise you to negotiate with the Finnish representatives on either of two possible options. Rearmament under the German guidance is regarded as the most desirable option by the OKW, but success of this initiative entirely depends on the willingness of the Finnish government to accept the increased presence of the German military. An alternative option includes the reduced barriers in equipment trade between the two countries, but such measures, while beneficial to the Finnish military, will come at the price of our influence in the Finnish affairs.\n\nHeil Bormann!\n\nYours obediently\n\nKauffmann\n\nMilitary advisor to the Minister of Defense of Finland."
 bormann.1602.a:0 "Offer them the rearmament program on our terms."
 bormann.1602.b:0 "Giving them a discount in our weapons is enough."
 
 bormann.1603.t:0 "Send our Generals?"
 bormann.1603.d:0 "Regardless of questions of morale and equipment, the Finnish military doctrine has traditionally centred on infantry-heavy, defensive operations. If the Finnish military is to be brought up to date with modern tactics and strategic doctrine, they will require assistance from an experienced military, and what military is more experienced than the Wehrmacht? We could offer the Finns, as an additional sweetener to any economic assistance, to borrow the generals Karl-Adolf Hollidt and Hans Krebs for six months to help train and reorganize their forces along modern lines. This would however leave us without their skills and long experience in the intervening period. What is the Führer's decision on this matter?"
 bormann.1603.a:0 "Offer them Hollidt and Krebs."
 bormann.1603.b:0 "The generals are needed in the Reich."
 
 bormann.1604.t:0 "Base in Lapland?"
 bormann.1604.d:0 "One of the conditions of our treaty with Finland to cede them Kola in the aftermath of the war with the Soviet Union was that we would be allowed to open a series of military bases in their territory. During the West Russian War this system coalesced into a single, very large base in the Lapland region, from whence we could exert influence across all of Northern Europe. However, only a few years later our precarious economic situation and post-war military budget cuts saw the base abandoned. We must now consider whether reasserting our influence in the region is worth potentially angering the Finns by forcing them to return the base, which would both cost them a valuable installation and be seen as a violation of the neutrality and independence guaranteed them by the Reich so far. We must judge the situation with care."
 bormann.1604.a:0 "Reopen the base!"
 bormann.1604.b:0 "Leave it to the Finns."
 
 bormann.1605.t:0 "Medical Retrofitting"
 bormann.1605.d:0 "A persistent and worrying problem for the Finnish Army is their great depletion of medical resources in the wake of the economic devastation of Europe by the repeated conflicts of the last decade. It would be sensible for us, with our great pharmaceutical firms like I.G. Farben once more producing more than enough for the home market, to offer to negotiate lucrative supply contracts to once more bring the Finnish supplies of penicillin, sulfates and vaccines up to par with that needed by a modern army in the event of large scale conflict. We must however beware the inescapable fact that the dominant firms of the pharmaceutical industry, especially I.G. Farben, will use this influx of money to greatly expand their influence."
 bormann.1605.a:0 "Negotiate the contracts!"
 bormann.1605.b:0 "We cannot cede more power to Big Pharma!"
 
 bormann.1606.t:0 "IG Farben Wants to join the Finnish Market"
 bormann.1606.d:0 "As expected, the IG Farben's CEO, Abs, has heard about the proposal to negotiate for supplying the Finnish market, and he has written the government requesting IG Farben take the lead in this supply chain, having preempted our plans by moving in directly and all already coordinating a medical equipment contract with the Finnish Army. We will now have to decide whether to allow our plans to carry on with Abs taking a leading role, or use his preemptive action as an excuse to force them out of Finland. This latter option would however upset both Abs and the Finns, and potentially make other companies more hesitant to sign up for our negotiation scheme."
 bormann.1606.a:0 "We cannot risk the plan over Abs."
 bormann.1606.b:0 "Abs must be stopped!"
 
 bormann.1607.t:0 "Chemical Labs in Lapland?"
 bormann.1607.d:0 "Abs has written us again, informing our government that the Finns have granted IG Farben the right to open a number of special cold weather labs near Rovaniemi to test experimental compounds. Normally this would be considered a welcome product of our ongoing financial involvement with Finland, but with IG Farben's alarming independence from the state apparatus, this letter has aroused suspicion among the Abwehr that more nefarious substances than just medical chemicals will be tested there. More fanciful ideas have even been posited suggesting Abs may test chemical weaponry there. Still, what Abs asks for in his letter is a relatively modest grant and permission to continue. Is it really worth upsetting the Finns at this critical stage over some wild conspiracy theories?"
 bormann.1607.a:0 "Let him have his labs."
 bormann.1607.b:0 "We cannot take the risk."
 
 bormann.1608.t:0 "Missile Defense Question"
 bormann.1608.d:0 "With the rising threat of the seemingly unifying Russian statelets in the east, the strategic missile command has asked to redeploy strategic short and medium range missiles to Finnish sites, in order to help cover the Reichskommissariats in the east from the potential danger. However, many in Finnish political circles greatly oppose this, seeing it as a blatant violation of their neutrality and possible political suicide. Should we try to force the Finns to accede for the sake of our common defense, or should we back off this question for now?"

If such unnecessary escalation of international tensions for no discernible gain but the imperial ambitions of the German state, the United States will be forced to consider escalation of economic and military countermeasures to secure itself and its allies from such naked aggression. I, and my colleagues in the Organization of Free Nations, strongly urge you to cease such inadmissible activities before you cause further international problems.\n\nWith regards, the President."

 bormann.1610.t:0 "The Question of the Eastern Border"
 bormann.1610.d:0 "Since the unification of the Reich, it has looked East for further expansion. The Drang Nach Ost reached its greatest extent with the defeat of the Soviet Union, but overambitious plans to stretch the Reich's border between Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan fell short with the West Russian War, a colossal surprise to a Reich that had thought the Russians a defeated enemy. Their violent and savage assault was halted at the outskirts of Moskau, and though their Red Coalition was defeated and Russia sundered once again they have continued to thwart our efforts to maintain control of our Lebensraum.\n\nMoskowien is a famously hellish station, an underfunded garrison expected to deal with both the Russians within and the Russians without. As the warlords to the east begin to consolidate their holdings, they once more establish themselves as a threat to be feared rather than an inconvenience to be driven off, and it is the quiet belief of the OKW that the time will soon come that we face a unified Russia once more. When this time comes we will have a vast front to defend, and will require all the strength we can muster to once and for all confirm our dominion over the Eastern Territories. There is only one other nation that faces the same Russian woes that we do, of Russian partisans and the rising Asiatic hordes, an unlikely ally but one that will be dragged into the Second Russian War whether they desire it or not. "

 bormann.1611.t:0 "A United Border Service?"
 bormann.1611.d:0 "Our sole partner in the East, and another ancient enemy of the Russians - Finland exists as the only independent nation of Europe save ourselves to stand ever-alert against the Asiatic hordes of Russland. Before the war they were fearful of the Soviet imperialist desire to retake the former Grand Duchy, which itself was wracked by civil war against the Bolsheviks when the Empire fell. Instead they expanded to push the Soviets out of the Scandinavian Peninsula, taking the remainder of Karelia and the valuable northern port of Murmanni. They are protected from the violence of the Russian Hell by the Anti-Communist Guard of Onega, yet still must invest a great deal in ensuring their borders remain secure from raiders and bandits - the West Russian Revolutionary Front still maintains it's icy grip over Arkhangelsk, and may yet prove a threat against German and Finnish Lebensraum.\n\nAs the greatest power of Europe and its protector from the forces of Bolshevism, the Finns would be well served by partnering with us to protect their gains from the Russians. Indeed they have approached us with the proposal for a united Fenno-German border service to stem the tide of smugglers, bandits and revolutionaries that seek to gain entry into our lands. It is obvious that we would bear the brunt of the burden of both funding and manpower as the senior of the two states - this would however go a great deal towards establishing Finland as a truly friendly state, rather than as a reluctant ally."
 bormann.1611.a:0 "We would be glad to have a partner on our patrols."
 bormann.1611.b:0 "They think they can leech from us to guard their own borders? Think again!"
 
 bormann.1612.t:0 "A New Mannerheim Line?"
 bormann.1612.d:0 "It may seem ridiculous now, but there was a time when Bolshevism was feared to take over all of Europe. Despite a White victory in their own civil war, it seemed only a matter of time before the Russian Reds turned their gaze westwards once more. To stem the tide, the Mannerheim Line was constructed, a series of fortifications across the Karelian Isthmus to halt the Russians as soon as they left Sankt Petersburg. This invasion however never came, and it was the Russian portion of Karelia that changed hands when their state crumbled against the might of the Wehrmacht.\n\nSince then, the Mannerheim Line has fallen into disrepair - but while the Finns concentrated their efforts on expelling Russian influence from Karelia, the warlords of the East consolidated their territories, and drew their plans against them. One day, Russia will come looking for its lost lands, and both Germany and Finland must prepare for that day. The Finnish government is cash-strapped however, and there is little demand for a new Eastern wall when there are so many problems at home.\n\nThe Reich has the resources to fund the construction of another expanded Mannerheim Line. Providing assistance and security would improve the natural friendship between our two nations, as well as strengthening our negotiating position. We could also expand the plan by further integrating our own border fortifications with those of the Finns and restoring the integrity of these fortifications all the way down to the Caspian Sea. The cost of this expanded plan would be exorbitant - but can you put a price on security?"
 bormann.1612.a:0 "The Finns think they can build a wall and make us pay for it?"

 bormann.1613.d:0 "Not only is Finland short of funds to defend their portion of the line to our satisfaction, but they are also chronically short of men. Their army may be elite, but the forests and lakes of Finland are even less densely populated than the vast wastes of Russia, and any series of fortifications they construct across the hundreds of kilometers of border will be drastically undermanned. Our garrisons in Moskowien, while overworked in keeping Russian national sentiment quelled, are numerous and experienced in defending against raids from beyond the border.\n\nA small vacation might do our troops good - during the day they can ensure the Finnish portion of the line is held just as firmly as our own, and by night they can relax in the saunas with the beautiful women of Finland. They may not share Germanic blood, but as Führer Hitler declared, the Finns are honorary Aryans. The Reich may not hold so much to that idea these days, but it will continue to be circulated as long as the Finns themselves prove useful."

 bormann.1614.t:0 "Tensions in Moskowien"
 bormann.1614.d:0 "Our drive to secure the borders of Moskowien has pushed our garrisons away from the cities and ever-further east towards the border, as well as diverting a great number of troops northward to supplement the Finnish garrisons. Our Russian subjects, used to the constant presence of our troops to keep them in line for all these years have begun to question their future now that the German grip has loosened and the warlords of the east have begun to stabilise and make threats towards our rightfully won Lebensraum. This sickness of the mind has yet to spread too far, and there are still treatments available before they become too churlish.\n\nThe natural method would be to transfer additional troops and police officers into Moskowien to make up the loss, that the Slavs will only spend a short time wondering where their overlords have gone. A less expensive and manpower-intensive alternative would be to begin a campaign of disinformation throughout Moskowien, to quell any dissenting tendencies with propaganda before they get the chance to spread in earnest."

 bormann.1615.d:0 "The Reichstag, like the ancient Roman Senate, has long been unimportant as anything other than a debate hall and an old men's club. Formality dictates that every law and budget be first passed to them before it's inevitable confirmation, and while usually they pass by without issue today they have evidently become bored and raised a fuss.\n\nThe issue of the reconstructed Mannerheim line might have been approved the first time round, but in review several holes have been picked into its fabric. Whilst construction proceeded as planned with minimal delays or additional expenditures, it was once construction was completed that issues arose. The Finns' chronic shortage of manpower extends to their new fortifications, which after their completion more often than not simply lie empty while the Finns conduct maneuvers or see to the most important areas.\n\nThe party bureaucracy, impertinent penny-counters that they are, take great offense at what they see as a vast waste of money better spent at home. While the Reichstag has little power to actually do anything other than shake their fists and complain at the expenditure, they are nonetheless deeply annoyed."

News travels slow between the trappers and loggers of Northern Finland, but word has reached us that there are a strange set of newcomers in Lapland and Kola. Clad in midnight black and bearing the badge of the twin lightning bolts, this can only mean that SS-Ordensstaat Burgund has interests in Finland.\n\nThe purpose of this mission, as with all Burgundian missions, is unknown, though the explorers have been observed taking weather readings and soil samples in the region. Their presence is no doubt part of some insidious plot to harm the Reich, and the Führer will not tolerate their presence. We could make it a condition of our new treaty to expel these enemy agents from Finland immediately to prevent their mission being fulfilled, whatever it's nefarious purpose.\n\nAlternatively, we could simply... ignore them. What harm can a couple of explorers do above the Arctic Circle that could outweigh that done to our negotiations by making too many demands of the Finns. Their presence in the official report can be omitted, and the Führer will be happy nonetheless."

 bormann.1617.d:0 "Initially, the Scandinavian Defense Initiative was an interstate treaty of friendship and protection between Sweden and Norway under the patronage of the Reich. But, of course, the SDI is a good way to influence the officials and the military in Sweden, and, of course, the idea of inviting Finland into a similar organization became the most logical and beneficial for the Reich. However, while Finland is likely to benefit greatly from cooperation, many Finnish politicians will suspect us of trying to force Finland to step back from its status as a "neutral" power and become an puppet for the Pakt.\n\nHewel once again leaned on the back of his chair and pondered..."

 bormann.1618.d:0 "The negotiations between the German and Finnish governments are complete. The draft of our treaty is finished, but it must still pass the final test of being negotiated through the Finnish Parliament, which does not obey our own, more efficient system of Führerprinzip. Their Prime Minister must steer the treaty through the treacherous waters of democratic discussion inn order for these discussions to have been of any merit. Whilst Parliament is not a place for a foreigner to speak, our observer was permitted to listen to the Prime Minister's defense of the proposal from a shaded alcove. The Prime Minister gave an impassioned speech, which whilst it may not have paid sufficient time towards the virtues of the Reich, gave a strong argument for defensive cooperation between the Republic of Finland and the Greater German Reich. After a brief round of hear-hears, the floor was opened for debate."

 bormann.1619.t:0 "Deal with the Devil"
 bormann.1619.d:0 ""Humiliating", "Degrading", "Disrespectful of Finnish sovereignty". Just a small sample of the words used to describe the prospective defense agreement bby Finnish parliamentarians, interspersed with a great number of "Saatana" and "Perkele"-s. The opposition called the bill degrading, and patronising, and once the floodgates of criticism had opened it was impossible to close them.\n\nAfter several rounds of fierce debating, a vote was taken, but by this time the outcome of the vote was already known. Once the formality of counting the votes was performed, the bill was rejected to a chorus of jeering by the opposition - our observer left the chambers and exited the country before anti-German sentiment grew to too great a heat.\n\nThis is an unfortunate end to the months of negotiation between our governments regarding our Eastern border, and when the inevitable Russian conflict does come, we will face it separately."

 bormann.1620.d:0 "It has been a long while since generals Hans Krebs and Karl-Adolf Hollidt made their way to the Frozen North to drill the Finnish troops to the quality demanded by the Wehrmacht. Their absence was noted by their fellow officers, with many a snide comment produced about how they were spending more time in the saunas together than they were defending against Russian raids, but nonetheless they have returned with the gratitude of their Finnish counterparts.\n\nKrebs and Hollidt quickly assumed control of their divisions regardless of the opinions of their previous officers, and established a harsh training regime that would rapidly bring the Finnish soldier to a German standard. Their tactics proved most effective in combat exercises, and whatever the Finns' opinion of them their techniques were quickly noted and replicated. Now that they have returned it will be seen whether Finnish tactics can add anything to our own repertoire, but regardless we can be a little more sure that when the time comes, Finland will hold."

 bormann.1621.d:0 "After several fierce rounds of debate and a near-fistfight between heated government and opposition parliamentarians, a vote narrowly confirmed the mutual defense agreement between the Republic of Finland and the Greater German Reich. Few spoke in favour of the agreement in strictly ideological terms, instead emphasising the necessity of the agreement to ensure the Republic's defense against the rapidly-stabilising Russian statelets to the East and the security of the region of Karelia.\n\nThe treaty is to be signed in the city of Sankt Petersburg, itself only a hop across the Finnish border. With only a hearty handshake between the Führer and the Prime Minister and a pair of signatures, friendship and cooperation will be restored between our two Aryan nations, and security and prosperity restored to the East."

 bormann.1622.d:0 "Marja could see Königsberg over the horizon. The journey from Helsinki had been perilous, and she had been at times unsure that they would make it. Simö had been more optimistic about their chances, which was a blessing in and of itself. Her husband had not been so lively since before the first war, when Zhadanov's cocktails had taken one of his arms. Quietly, for only a moment, she allowed herself to think that the revolution had been a good thing. As her breath stained the air white, she dismissed such thoughts, her cheeks red with shame as well as cold. Hundreds of men had died, and she was thinking of only her husband's temperament.\n\nWhen the Russians had come for Onega, the country had called Simö back to service, and he had reluctantly gone. With so many enemies in the East, they had a need for old veterans in the military service, and Simö was perhaps the oldest veteran that could still command a division. His battalion of green men had not yet left Helsinki before the lines had broken, and the eastern madmen had taken Karellia from them. Then, when their own people had risen up under the red flag, Simö and Marja had found shelter on this boat, this arc seemingly sent by God.\n\nThere were men below these decks that Marja had long applauded, and those whom Marja had rallied against. Soldiers, politicians and bankers... Perhaps the least likely refugees that one could think of, Marja thought with a quiet laugh. And yet, now they all huddled together and hoped that the Germans would take them in: Those scarred by war, and those that had been all too willing to wage it.\n\nFrom somewhere behind Marja, the captain radioed in for permission to dock. The whole ship seemed to fall silent as they awaited the answer."

 bormann.1623.t:0 "Conference in Reichskanzlei"
 bormann.1623.d:0 "The assembly was utterly at a loss at what to do, but that was only in a collective sense. Individually, several men were very opinionated on what should be done about the Finnish issue. They made their voices known, often shouting over one another so that the gathered men would only hear their views.\n\nThe more militaristic aspects of the party, of course, seemed to favor a rather direct approach. Their spokesman made it rather clear. "We cannot allow a Bolshevik state so close to the Reich. An invasion must be planned immediately, and Finland cannot be allowed to operate with so free a hand in the future. To do otherwise would be both to show weakness and to allow an enemy of the master race to plot against us."\n\nThe reform-minded members of the assembly, however, were less enthusiastic, and a voice soon spoke clearly for them. "An invasion? Are you mad? We are overstretched as it is! The Finnish are within our sphere of influence. Yes, they may have fallen to Bolshevism but we are the only possible ally they have against the Russians. Their unsustainable state will collapse and then we will move in, as their saviors, and bring them back into the fold."\n\nBormann considered these things silently, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option in his mind. What to do with the Finns? What would serve to best help the Reich stay strong?"
 bormann.1623.a:0 "The Führer stood to speak."
 
 bormann.1624.t:0 "보어만의 연설"
 bormann.1624.d:0 ""The Finnish State, once a stalwart ally against the Red Menace in Russia, has now fallen under the influence of Judeo-Bolshevism." Bormann declared to the assembly, firmly. "As such, any policy of friendship and alliance we have previously held towards them must now be rescinded immediately, and the Finnish State will have this made clear to them in the strongest terms." The Führer declared, attempting to rally the assembly together with his bold speech. The militarists certainly looked rallied, though the rest of the assembly was not as swayed.\n\n"However..." Bormann continued. "At this time, an invasion of the Finnish State is not in the best interests of the Reich, which is what must be kept foremost in the minds of this assembly. The Einheitspakt must be strengthened and the Reich's power fully restored before such a thing can be done. As such, I will now lay out the plans of the Reich in regards to the Bolshevik disgrace calling itself Finland."\n\n"As of now," The Führer searched the crowd for Hewel and Lange, to ensure that they were present and that they were paying attention. It seemed they were. "The German Reich will be holding Finland in a state of total embargo. We will furthermore permit none of the nations of the Einheitspakt, nor any other nation, to trade with these communists until this regime is toppled. The Kriegsmarine will fully enforce this measure, until the Finnish are liberated."\n\nAs Bormann stepped down, those assembled began to bicker amongst themselves, though none dared raise a voice to Bormann himself. It seemed that nobody was entirely satisfied with this new policy."
 bormann.1624.a:0 "That's how you know it's a good compromise."

 bormann.1630.d:0 "REICHMINISTRY OF ECONOMICS\n\nSTATUS OF THE FINNISH BLOCKADE\n\nFINLAND - BOLSHEVIK STATE - UNDER GERMAN BLOCKADE\n\nThe recent embargo of Finland has been highly successful, with an estimated 80-85% of attempted imports and exports being stopped. The attempts have not declined nearly as much as anticipated, however, with the daily attempts to bypass the brigade sometimes reaching as many as a dozen. We expect that this trend will not continue, though we cannot be certain.\n\nWith these estimated trends, we can extrapolate that the Finns will begin feeling the harsh impacts of this blockade sometime in the next few months. Without the food and luxuries provided to the Finns by German companies, the Finnish people will probably rebel against this government much more quickly than they did the last, especially considering the lack of action against the Russians.\n\nThere are some concerns that goods are being smuggled into Finland via Sweden, though the Swedish have assured us that they intend to respect the German blockade in full. At this moment, we see no reason to doubt the truth of this statement by our Swedish friends, as the Bolshevik state is perhaps an even greater threat to them than it is to us.\n\nThe operation is expected to be a success."

 bormann.1631.t:0 "Paper, Paper, Paper!"
 bormann.1631.d:0 ""Paper? We're in a shortage of paper?" Bormann read aloud the report Lange had handed him. "How did this even happen?"\n\n"Well, my Führer, it comes down to our bureaucracy. We need a lot of paper to run the Reich, and we don't have enough. We're doing relatively alright at the moment, but it could turn into an incredibly nasty situation soon."\n\n"Well, let's get some more paper for the Reichskanzlei." Bormann said. Lange quickly interrupted him.\n\n"Well, you see, that also could cause another problem. The shortage of paper applies to the Reich as a whole, not just the Reichskanzlei. If we divert paper to the bureaucracy, we would get a shortage of paper in the military and for civilians. The other problem is, if we don't divert our current supply of paper to one of them, all of them will suffer. It's up to you where we send our paper, my Führer."\n\nBormann leaned forward, deep in thought. Lange anxiously awaited his answer. The quiet seemed to last for hours. Finally, Bormann spoke again."

I never specified the schools." Bormann said. He didn't seem angry, merely mildly irritated. Lange froze again.\n\n"I- Well, I assumed you were talking about the schools when you said to divert paper to the civilians." Bormann didn't respond. "Of course, you could, theoretically, divert paper to the entertainment industry to keep the people occupied. That could lead to them being less unhappy during the shortage, but it would come at the cost of their education. Teachers may not be able to teach their students properly. Honestly, my Führer, I think that diverting it to education would be for the best." Bormann once again sat and thought for a while. Finally, he spoke."
 bormann.1632.a:0 "Divert it to entertainment."
 bormann.1632.b:0 "Divert it to education."
 
 bormann.1633.t:0 "To the Party"
 bormann.1633.d:0 ""Well, that's great." Lange said. "I'll give out the order to divert more paper to the bureaucracy. Our administration will not suffer from a lack of paper anymore." he smiled. "Thank you, my Führer. We really needed this."\n\n"It's the most logical thing to do." Bormann said. "You'd have to be a moron not to."\n\n"Well, you certainly aren't a moron, my Führer."

"There's a problem with that. We need to direct papers either to the Wehrmacht or the Orpo. The Orpo has a massive database filled with criminals that needs a large amount of paper to maintain, and the Wehrmacht needs large amounts of paper to document military goings-on. Whichever you choose, the other is going to suffer significantly."\n\n"Better than both of them suffering." Bormann replied. "How about...""

But how did it hold up? Looking at it now Bormann found it to be a bit... idealistic. It was filled with decrees of war against the Jew and the Slav and all degeneracy everywhere but... hadn't Germany already won? Endsieg had already been achieved, hadn't it?\n\nThere were two answers to this question. One was "No, it hasn't yet." This answer was a militarist one. It didn't align with Bormann's views at all. It was better than the other one, which was "Yes, it has." This was even worse because it implied that Nazism was a failed idea. The two answers to this book's question on Endsieg promote ideas that Bormann finds... unfavorable. If it was any other book it could just be banned, but this is the official book of the Reich itself; Hitler's masterpiece. But Hitler isn't alive anymore. There's a new Führer, and with a new Führer comes new ideas..."

We're supposed to discuss forests."\n\n"You see, we at the Reich are experiencing a shortage of paper and we need more wood from any source possible. Upon your entry into the Pakt, as an observer, of course, we expect you to import wood to us."\n\n"This is outrageous! Those forests are our national pride and joy! We need that wood!" Krebs butt in.\n\n"We also need that wood. We're running out of paper, and we desperately need more." Lange said. "Our bureaucracy may suffer from this immensely if we don't resolve it quickly." he turned to Hewel. "Come on, Hewel. Aren't you tired of having to write so small you get cramps?"\n\n"Well yes, but we can't just boss around our Finnish friends like this. We can harvest from Moskowien." Hewel replied. Lange glared at him. "However, it would take an incredibly long time for the shortage to subside if we tried to use Moskowien more. Our infrastructure there isn't as developed." Lange smirked at Krebs. Krebs sighed.\n\n"Are you sure you want to force us to do this? We won't take kindly to it.""

While many would consider economic negotiations with the Finns a terrible fate, including Hewel himself, he followed this dull banshee's call and ended up at the negotiation table once more. Lange was beside him, no doubt to pressure the overwhelmed Finnish foreign minister even more.\n\nThe Finns, despite their relative weakness, were a much needed ally of the Reich. Even if they only joined as an observer, their nickel, iron, and wood would be invaluable to the entire Pakt as a whole. It could significantly improve the Reich's economy due to a large amount of resources available for a cheap price.\n\nThat is, if Hewel can get the Finns in the Pakt in the first place."

It's still using Soviet Union era infrastructure. This is a problem in a lot of railways leading to Finnish cities." Krebs cleared his throat for a moment, gauging the reactions of Hewel and Lange. Hewel looked rather bored, while Lange leaned forward in his seat, listening intently. "Luckily we have a... benefactor who may be willing to help us." Krebs winked. "If Finland is to join the Pakt as an observer, we'd like the Germans to rebuild our railways. I'm sorry, but you'll all have to pay for it."\n\n"I'm no economist, but I don't think that that's worth it for us. Lange, what do you think?" The two looked expectantly at Lange. Lange took a breath."
 bormann.1638.a:0 ""I think that's a good arrangement.""

Our developing economy-"\n\n"I know about your developing economy." Lange said, tired of Krebs's requests. "How badly are these upgrades needed?"\n\n"Very badly. You know how most of our major cities are currently connected by an old Soviet railroad? It's like that but with our equipment." Lange glanced at Hewel, who was eyeing the Finn closely.\n\n"Are you sure? I find it to be unlikely that a nation such as yours would have such terrible equipment AND terrible railroads."\n\n"Well, you see, Our lack of updated equipment has prevented us from fixing the railroads." Krebs explained. Hewel didn't buy it.\n\n"Then why didn't you ask for that in the first place?" he remarked. Krebs narrowed his eyes.\n\n"Look, I'm not the one who made this stupid schedule, but we really need updated equipment. You're not an economist, and neither am I. Let's ask the economist here what he thinks." Krebs turned to Lange expectantly. Lange sighed."

Lange explained. "They want special nickel concessions, and they want a lot of them. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot."\n\n"Do we have to?" Krebs asked. "First you ask for our wood, now our nickel too? I'm not sure our economy can handle this. You're our main trading partner, after all."\n\n"Well it's better than not getting any trade with us at all." Lange retorted.\n\n"Everyone will be angry at you. This may doom the negotiations, you know."\n\n"I don't think it will, but diplomacy isn't my expertise. Hewel, what do you think?""

"The Finnish government has said the reason was outdated repair equipment... oh no." he put it down. "This doesn't make us look good. Should we help them out?"\n\n"Well, I've been thinking about that." Hewel said. "There are two options: One, we help out, it helps us save face with the Finns, but we still look sort of bad. Two, we don't help out, we admit no responsibility whatsoever, and no one but us and the Finns know about this. The second one will hurt the relationship between us and the Finns, but at least we won't look like we collapsed a bridge out of malice."\n\n"That's a... bit of a conundrum."

Especially Siemens, they're our primary supplier of electronics! This is insane, and we, as the Reich, are forced to-" Lange exclaimed.\n\n"Nokia won't even take up that much of the market. Come on, do you really think a small Finnish electronics corporation can take on your corporations? It's not like we'll destroy your economy. In fact, both our economies may prosper."\n\n"You obviously know nothing about economics. Come on, Hewel, you agree with me, right?" Lange asked. Hewel scratched his chin."

Krebs shook his head.\n\n"We can't align with you all fully. The Japanese and Americans shutting off our markets would destroy us. We want to, but it just isn't possible. Visa-free travel could show the unity between us even more."\n\n"It sets a bad precedent; it makes it look like any member of the Pakt can just opt out of concessions and still get the full benefits of the Pakt. Can you imagine what that would do to us diplomatically? Hell, even the economic ramifications are bad, right Lange?" Hewel turned to Lange expectantly, awaiting Lange's affirmation. Lange spoke."

Surrounded by Pakt members eagerly discussing economic benefits as well as pressuring the meek diplomat sent into a field he didn't specialize in- it would be like taking candy from a baby.\n\nThe awaited moment finally came.

"I'm sorry to disappoint, but I never had the intention to sign this in the first place."\n\n"Why did you come, then?"\n\n"I thought it would be polite." Krebs began disorganizedly stuffing the papers he had brought with him into his briefcase.

 bor_econ.100.d:0 "Martin Bormann, as ever, was early. He strummed the table impatiently as Reichsminister Lange and his men filed into the room and took their places at the table.\n\n"Hurry up, gentlemen. We have so much to discuss." He spread his arms open. "Reichsminister Lange and I have drawn up a new initiative destined to secure the Reich as the absolute hegemon of Europe. We have called it 'The Modern Wunderwaffe'." The economists looked at each other with impressed faces and nodded eagerly. "We shall initiate various governmental infrastructure and pipeline projects throughout Germania. This city shall become the nexus of the continent in the next decade! Reichsminister Lange, if you please."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Kurt Lange nodded. He was a colourless, bald man in a dull grey suit. A model functionary of the state. "As we all know, the overreliance on slavery has crippled our economy and decimated the working class. Slaves will barely be involved in the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative, mark my words. It is the German worker who shall toil and sweat over these projects, and their newly-earned wages will encourage more spending. Many German firms are financially collapsing and cutting jobs, but the economic boost provided by this new wave of spending should ensure a rise in employment."\n\n"All we need to do is push, and the snowball shall grow into an avalanche," Bormann finished with smug satisfaction."
 bor_econ.100.a:0 "But what is to be done with the slaves?"

 bor_econ.101.t:0 "A Corporate Solution"
 bor_econ.101.desc:0 ""Listen up!" Bormann shouted at the chattering economists gathered around the table. They snapped into silent attention. "Here are the final Modern Wunderwaffe proposals formulated by Reichsminister Lange and myself. For this initiative to succeed, we must deal with the slave question. To make way for the working class, the slaves will be deported to small ethnic territories and newly established ghettos throughout eastern Europe. Whether these destinations are in their nation of origin is of no interest to the bureaucratic process. They are all, essentially, untermenschen."\n\n"I have a couple of questions, my Führer," one of the bespectacled functionaries spoke up, awkwardly raising his hand. Bormann nodded at him to continue. "How long can we expect this process to take? And how are the Big Four going to fit into this?"\n\n"It will not be instantaneous," Bormann explained. "The deportation will be at a sensible, gradual pace. The most able slaves will be deported last, of course, so that during the waiting process they can supplement the infrastructure projects with their labor."\n\n"As for the Big Four, if I may," Kurt Lange continued, shuffling his notes. "Presumably you are referring to the mega corporations? Well, we will be attempting to enlist the help of all four, but naturally one will become our primary partner. Siemens is the smallest and most loyal corporation and so will require the least down payment for cooperation. Daimler-Benz is relatively loyal as well, although Reichswerke is less so, and IG Farben's allegiance is by far the most dubious - although it must be said, they are the largest and most powerful, and therefore the most useful."\n\n"Enough, Reichsminister," Bormann interjected. "I have already made my decision.""

The stuffiness would have them sweating like pigs, and he was unsure if the psychology of the grandiose sculptures, paintings and symbols would have much effect on such a powerful man.\n\nErnst von Siemens entered the room with a smile. The Grey Eminence, Bormann thought to himself smugly. The man's demeanour was lifeless and grey. His hair was thinning and grey. His suit, ill-fitting and grey. Yet, embedded in this figure of mediocrity were two sharp eyes, brimming with intelligence. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand we are mostly in agreement? Your corporation will aid the state in these deportations and the establishment of ghettos and camps throughout Europe. You have proven yourself to be a true National Socialist, and so you have my undying trust."\n\n"I am here to fulfil our agreement," von Siemens concurred, "and not to negotiate. The Siemens corporation is not rich enough to engage in the scale you were hinting at during our phone call, but we shall try our best." He leaned forwards, smiling gently. "I will make one thing absolutely certain. I will not budge on this at all. Siemens is the only German mega corporation tolerated in the international community, because we haven't engaged in the same levels of slavery as our competitors. These territories, ghettos, camps - whatever you call them, I want them officially covered up by the state. Agree to this, and the deal is done.""

He was an old man with a dark brown suit too large for his slender frame, and two untrusting eyes that surveyed the room with suspicion. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand your apprehensions. You have benefitted immensely from slavery, and have many friends in high places who support it. Yet here I am proposing that you abet its gradual decline." Flick smiled politely, but said nothing. "As a cunning businessman, Herr Flick, you must understand that the continuation of slavery as it currently operates will drag down all aspects of our economy, including Daimler-Benz? This is an opportunity to not only serve your Reich and the cause of National Socialism, but to make a profit while doing so."\n\n"I want a larger offer of collateral," Flick finally spoke after a minute of intense silence. "I'm sure you will be happy to negotiate. After all, I have a good amount of resources for these camp constructions."\n\nBormann knew that appealing to the man's dual love of ideology and currency would sway him. He could probably be trusted, but nonetheless Bormann would ensure that a great level of oversight would be provided to Daimler-Benz's contribution to the Modern Wunderwaffe."

Were it not for his immaculate dark grey suit, Bormann would have mistaken the square jaw and beady eyes for those of an OrPo officer. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "Your hesitance is understandable. After all, Reichswerke is a huge company, and investing so much into the slave camps and ghettos poses an obvious risk."\n\n"I know it does," Edmund snapped back. "I travelled this way to hear your arguments, not mine. Reichswerke is rich and powerful, and will hugely benefit your plans. But why should I help you?"\n\n"Not as rich and powerful as IG Farben," Bormann responded, restraining his anger at the CEO's impudence. "Yet. Such a high risk project would yield a high reward, high enough to propel you far above your rivals. When people talk of corporate giants, it is Edmund Geilenberg they shall think of - not Hermann Josef Abs."\n\nThe man's beady eyes lit up in interest. Bormann had to proceed with caution. He knew what a risky partner Reichswerke would make, and effective oversight would be difficult to maintain."

He was a portly man with a greying mustache and a black three-piece suit. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began.\n\n"Cigar?" Abs interjected, opening his case. Bormann stared into the businessman's cunning eyes, unfazed, and accepted. The two men puffed deeply on their thick cigars and filled the room with smoke. "I was most intrigued by your offer. IG Farben, naturally, is the largest corporation in Europe. We have the most resources to utilize for your... projects. Unfortunately, slavery has been a large part of our success, if your plans for economic revival fail, then so will my company. I will need many, many subsidies and assurances if you expect me to agree to this deal."\n\n"Then there is much to negotiate," Bormann replied, blowing more smoke into the air. Abs was a ruthless businessman, one whose help would almost guarantee an improved economy. Of course, if the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative proved successful, Abs and IG Farben would only grow more powerful.\n\n"Let us begin. My Führer." His tone was almost mocking."

Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, constantly on the move, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip followed by a pained yell that always accompanied it. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nHe had worked in a car plant before for some company he never got the name of, but apparently the higher-ups decided that he was 'worthy'. Worthy of what - dying before 50 from overworking himself to death? The other men around him were much younger than he was, and the slightest suspicion came to him that he was merely an administrative error. No matter. He had railroad tracks to lay, work to do, a life to keep. Even if it was a hollow and meaningless one.\n\nOne day, Antonin came to work and saw that a young man had come up to him - Aleksy, he was called. A bright man, he was. A shame the Germans didn't look at him that way.\n\n"Mister Antonin!" He shouted, calling the man to attention. "Mister Antonin, have you heard the news?"\n\nHe sighed, tempted to give Aleksy a taste of black humor, but relented. He didn't have to be a depressive man to be around. "What is it, Mister Aleksy?" He asked, half-curious and half-not, but the younger man seemed excited.\n\n"They're tellin' us..." He rubbed the back of his neck. "Well... I've heard, I guess, that some of us might go back to Poland. Live with our own!" The heavy steel that creaked Antonin's back was set down on the floor as Antonin gave him a glare shot with both concern and copious amounts of distrust.

 bor_econ.107.d:0 "There was a reason there was a saying for it. Like rivers, the great streams of Europe's infrastructure controlled the ebb and flow of people and resources into the estuary of Rome. Caesar had seized an Empire with symbols and blood, but Rome kept an empire with roads. When all roads lead to Rome, victory can only travel in one direction. However, even the mightiest of Empires fall, and Rome fell to none other than the Germans themselves. Decadence and degeneracy had gripped the nation, much like it gripped Europe before the Germans wrestled rightful control back over the continent.\n\nOne man can't rule an Empire, though if any man could, Bormann knew it was him. Regrettably, he had to share the reins with the petty Führers of the Reichskommissariats. It was these individuals that he needed to build the roads to his new Rome. Goethe had called Rome the 'capital of the world', but that title belonged to Germania now, and it was time the economic flows of the continent reflected it.\n\nBormann entered the Volkshalle's main meeting room to find the bickering dukes of the Reich's colonies suddenly standing to attention. 'Heil Bormann!' The Führer nodded approvingly, and sat down. The Reichskommissars followed.\n\nThe plan was laid out. Infrastructure projects across the Reichskommissariats would be built to ensure the direction of power went to the Reich. Germany must remain the undisputed hegemon of Europe, lest it fall back into the liberal decadence Hitler rescued it from. Railways, oil pipelines, electricity grids. "Think of it like integration," Bormann said. "The Reich and her allies combined to become more powerful collectively than they could ever imagine separately."\n\nBormann added a final touch. "Of course, for their own defensive purposes, the Reichskommissariats would be wise to collaborate with the most powerful military in Europe," the Führer stated. "Germania's enemies fear her for a reason."\n\nFor a second each, Bormann made eye contact with the Reich's Dukes, making sure they understood what he meant. Satisfied with his work, the Führer rose, and exited the room."

More accurately, this involves giving a lot of scientists a lot of money and hoping they come up with something. The best thing is, this strategy usually worked.\n\nBormann sometimes considered himself a man of science. He had massive respect for the discipline, and the great Aryan minds who had originated its every moment of progress. It was these minds who he had now bestowed a massive investment in; research and development firms across the Reich were now to receive government grants for every new project started. Germany was already indisputably the world's centre of science and thought, but the Führer knew it could be so much more.\n\nBeyond realising the German ideals of science and progress, Bormann understood that these investments would provide a massive boon to the German economy. As a centre of innovation, the Ruhr would now be able to compete with the best of California or Tokyo. This was just securing this reputation however. There was never a doubt of German supremacy, of course."

In an effort to better bind the notoriously independently minded firms to his will, Führer Bormann has declared the introduction of a set of price controls and asserted that whilst raw material may be extracted by private firms, this material is property of the Reich and must be purchased at prices set by the Economic Ministry. Similarly all sales to the government will be made at predetermined prices.\n\nWhilst this would otherwise cause a colossal shortfall in revenue for these titans of industry, the price controls are accompanied by a generous plan of subsidies to make up the shortfall. Notable figures such as Hermann Josef Abs and Friedrich Flick are reported to have voiced their displeasure in private, though they have little recourse other than to bow to the Führer's wishes and continue business as usual, lest they want to find their firms dismantled and themselves behind bars.\n\nThe money will continue to flow, but every transaction now takes place one step closer to the government. Bound with paperwork, their leash has been shortened. "

He could indeed see practically anything he desired - production figures in Hamburg, unemployment in Munich, administrative expenses in Germania.

However, today there was some news that briefly dispelled the perpetual scowl on his face that he bore in private.\n\nIt was a short, simple report, one informing him that with the construction of the Minsk-Sankt Peterburg Line, the Breitspurbahn project was now halfway done. It was a milestone that Bormann recognized as important, and was personally quite pleased by. There was still half of the project to complete, of course, but already the Breitspurbahn was bearing fruit.\n\nLogistics, civilian and military, were notably improved. The citizens were happy to see a project being successful, and that it was able to be used by the average citizen subsequently improved their image of him - and his Reich. All in all, there was nothing but good things to come out of this so far. It was costly, but he expected the return on investment to be substantial.\n\nThe newspaper that also rested nearby on the desk had a picture taken of the inauguration of the line. Each of the inaugurations had been dutifully attended by crowds; crowds which had only grown as word of the project had spread.

Most notably, Reichswerke has been found to own a selection of companies registered in the United States of America, through which they have been investing in American companies and funneling foreign currency towards their own accounts, by which they divest their investment in companies worldwide.\n\nDue to the refusal of many nations to accept the Reichsmark as valid currency or even exchange it for their own, the value of the Reichsmark in relation to other currencies is highly variable at best. Reichswerke however has subverted this obstacle by exchanging their goods directly for American dollars through shell corporations in Sweden, a close trading partner of the Reich that also maintains contact with the USA.

Missing a figurehead and terrified of triggering a civil war over a lost cause, the Reformist Heer soldiers swiftly surrendered to Schörner's Militarists.\n\nThe OKH had released their Party Chancellery prisoners upon the Führer's furious orders, who was swift to initiate another state broadcast explaining the innocence of these men and the treason of Hans Speidel.\n\nThe Führer crushed his cigar into the chipped ashtray. Hans Globke claimed to have been misled by the Reformists, and accepted his firing with politeness. Bormann would have preferred to see the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery swinging from a rope, but without any concrete proof of his connection to Speidel, the man had evaded arrest."

Bormann allowed himself some rare indulgence as he sipped his wine, contentedly picturing Speidel slumped dead over his desk, exactly as the OrPo report had described it.\n\nYet he could not relax. He had failed to uncover the truth behind this plot, and many brave Heer soldiers had paid for it. More importantly, the markets had paid for it. Following the violence in the city, as well as the turmoil surrounding the Reichswerke controversy, the markets had continued to tumble. Reichsminister Lange had confided in Bormann that a swift recovery was unlikely.\n\nBormann watched the Feldmarschall down another glass of wine.

Baldur von Schirach was jogging towards him, clutching a folder of notes. "Are you heading to the Reichstag?

"Baldur, you have been briefed with the knowledge I saw fit to provide. I need you to run the Reichskanzlei while I'm– "\n\nThe sound of a gunshots pierced the air and a hole exploded in Bormann's stomach.

There have been no major operations here, no significant movement of new troops into the region, no local recruitment campaigns."\n\nAt that, Chief of the Party Chancellery Baldur von Schirach chimed in.

In celebrating their victory over Schörner, the Führer would be certain to condemn all radicals alike, and express above all how Schörner too had pushed for the Reich to change. Speidel may have had a loud mouth, but he would not be able to stand up to a true challenge from the Reich's finest. Bormann would stamp out the last of the militarists, and in the process, paint Speidel as Schörner's liberal mirror image. Both, however different they claimed to be, would lead to collapse."

 bor_post_disI.6.d:0 "Speidel was furious, no matter how hard he tried to hide it. Bormann had asked him to stand beside him for the speech, which Speidel had readily agreed to. The issue was, however, that the Chief of the OKW had expected simply a condemnation of Schörner's actions. He had even allowed himself to imagine that Bormann would be praising Speidel and his men for the good work they had done in the name of the Reich. However, it seemed the Führer had other plans for this address.\n\nHe had first begun discussing Schörner's treason, yes, but he had quickly taken a turn into more unexpected political venues. "When our soldiers pledge their loyalty to the Reich and to Hitler, they attempt to place their actions on the Reich and the Great Führer himself. They are not able to defend themselves against madmen, and as such, lunatics like Schörner are able to bastardize their ideals by professing that their treason is done in the Reich's name, or to fulfill Hitler's vision. From now on, all soldiers are to pledge loyalty only to the Führer. After all, the Führer is Hitler's successor, and his will is the will of the Reich. All else is unnecessary."\n\nSpeidel's jaw dropped, the man in awe. The arrogance and self-absorption it required was astounding. For a moment, he considered walking off stage, or verbally condemning Bormann, though he knew such thoughts were scandal and folly. All he could do was simply stand beside the man, making it clear by his frown and furrowed brow that he did not endorse this move. He would never renounce the oaths he had sworn to the German people and German nation, no matter what Bormann said. But as the crowd erupted into applause, it was all Speidel could do to keep himself composed. The masses loved a tyrant, it seemed."

 bor_post_disI.7.d:0 "With Speidel destroyed, Bormann had assumed that the OKW would rather cleanly fall into line. After all, Speidel was the biggest threat to the stability of the Reich, the imbecile who promised freedom and equality to the faux intellectual closet liberals that made up the Heer's reformists. Without his treasonous nonsense, the Führer had thought, the discontent in the military would be so insignificant as to be negligible. It appeared that hadn't been the case.\n\nSchörner, that jingoistic bastard, had taken the opportunity to show that the Reich was vulnerable without its military. Bormann knew he had been boasting about Speidel's destruction as if it were all his doing, and that fact infuriated Bormann to no end. A thick headed goon with less power than he had brains, claiming the accomplishments of the Führer as his own! Bormann had to resist the urge to call him to his office and curse him out, though he muttered obscenities nonetheless.\n\nBormann began to write missive after missive. He could not allow Schörner to consolidate power, that was for certain. They would need to find a way to discredit the man. Naturally, he could not be permitted to retain his position as Chief of the OKW, but Bormann also figured that, whilst they were cracking down on the Reformists, they could perhaps happen to find evidence of sympathies on some of Schörner's associates. Truly, it would be hitting two birds with one stone. The Führer would once again be the unquestioned head of the German Reich, and the pretender's ambitions quashed."

I have always served the Reich ably and faithfully, and I beseech you to give me the opportunity to continue to do so." Though he was pleading and begging, his tone made it sound more like a demand. He had an infuriating habit of doing that.\n\nThe Führer was unmoved. "Herr Schörner, I'm afraid you are needed elsewhere. You have served dutifully as Chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, as you say, and I imagine you will be able to further serve the Reich in..." Bormann took a moment to relish the look on Schörner's face. "Another position. Once we find one worthy of your degree and talents, of course. Perhaps something in Moscow, or the Ukraine." The smugness in the Führer's offer was hard to miss.\n\n"Damn you." Schörner suddenly snapped, having lost his patience with Bormann's taunts. He stood, revealing his whole height to the seated Führer. "First you remove the army's pledge to the Reich and Hitler, for no cause but to inflate your own damn ego. Now, you dismiss the man who kept Speidel from stringing you up outside the Volkshalle. Is it an army you want, or a mad pack of dogs who will sit for any fucking man who offers them a treat?"\n\nBormann did not rise, instead eyeing the man up and down from his seat. Nor did he respond at first, waiting to see if Schörner was done before replying to the man's outburst. With a look of almost spiteful boredom on his face, Bormann spoke."

This term originates in the mythology of the Greeks, the supposed once rulers of the world, living on through name in those who ruled in the present. Now, in the culmination of Bormann's plans, the pillars of the economy, the absolute giants that dominated German life, were to become as much a part of the past as the Titans.\n\nThrough a mixture of threatening, bribery, extortion, and, in some cases, even some legal means, Reichswerke was no more. Now, there was a completely and utterly different company, Reich's Industrial Holdings, that just so happened to coincidentally own the exact assets once owned by Reichswerke, and, just as coincidentally, happened to be completely and utterly personally subservient to the Führer. As the mythical Atlas held the sky, so too did Reichswerke, and as Reichswerke held the sky, so too must Bormann. However, Bormann was no Atlas, and none of the physical care routines his doctors put him through gave him quite the strength to hold up the sky - as such, he had to get help.\n\n60% of Reichswerke - now RIH - was to be sold off to the highest bidders. These were not as friendly as Bormann would like, as it just so happened that the highest bidders, with uncomfortable frequency, happened to like reform, but Bormann had no alternatives, and no excuses for turning down the reformists' offers. Still, the 40% share remaining within NSDAP control was more than enough for him to control Reichswerke, to control Atlas, to control the sky, and it was quite to his satisfaction."

The Orpo needed blackmail on some rich individuals, and in some of the establishments frequented by Germania's wealthy, it was almost like they were begging to throw all their blackmail material at you. Getting in was easy - it was quite fortunate that Germania's elite has spectacularly bad taste - just wear their vomit-worthy fashion, look rich, and act like an asshole, and you're in.\n\nGetting into the establishment was easy, and getting the blackmail was even easier. Jung found a table with a fair few rich-looking men that were visibly a few drinks in, and decided to invite himself to their table. Then, spending the Orpo's generous mission budget on rounds for the bunch, the rest got progressively drunker, never noticing that Jung seemed quite reluctant to partake in the drinks himself. His sobriety advantage rapidly mounting over his good jolly fellows, goading them into a lovely round of gossip took about as much effort as everything else he'd done that night.\n\n"Y... hic... ya see that banker there? Eric Straussman?" said Rudolf, an overly friendly, overly drunk, and overly red-nosed banker, leaning into Jung's ear.\n\n"Seems nice," Jung lied.\n\n"Oh..." Rudolf chuckled for an uncomfortably long time. "He acts nice and all... wants to push for the slaves to be treated nice and good and all... but ya know his secret?"\n\n"You'll have to remind me."\n\n"He likes women..." Rudolf started laughing at something that seemed to be only funny to him. "Well... maybe that ain't the truth, haha... Ya see, he likes them, but not enough to stop hitting 'em!

Rubbing his forehead and gulping down a few glasses of water, something caught his eye. A manila envelope had been slid in from under the door.\n\nWell, isn't that strange, he thought. He remembered the days as a youth in the Weimar Republic, when there would be all sorts of flyers handed out by the various radicals. Oh, maybe there'll be a day when this Reich was gone, in a few years less than a thousand. What fortune brought him to such power and wealth, where he could oppose the Führer. Now opening the letter...\n\nDO NOT OPPOSE THE FÜHRER read giant, bold letters. What, did the Orpo have mind reading devices now? He knew he had to support the Führer, hell, it was ingrained into every person in this godforsaken country. Now, the second page, that was a bit more worrying. They knew he didn't like how slaves were treated, didn't like the Führer, didn't like much that had to do with the NSDAP. Well, that was unfortunate, but unsurprising, as his political views were a pretty open secret with the Germania elites.\n\nNow, the third page and beyond, that was trouble. No text, just pictures, more than enough to tell a thousand words. Bruises on various women, women that he recognized, women that he had nights with that were pleasant for him, and unpleasant for them. A thousand nights of justifying to himself his actions ran through his head - well, he hurt just a few dozen, while those NSDAP officials hurt millions! God, that didn't matter now, did it? He hated those Nazis, oh did he, but he had no choice, no escape from the pain, while the hangover kept on splitting his head. He had to be loyal. He had no choice left."

 bor_disII_discovery.1.desc:0 "Generalleutnant Reinhard Gehlen, head of the Militärischer Abschirmdienst branch of the Ordnungspolizei, marched into the Führer's office with grave concern etched onto his blanched face. A thick black briefcase rested by his side. Bormann was about to scold the man for not knocking, but restrained himself. Such a rude act doubtless spoke to the severity of the upcoming topic.\n\n"Heil Bormann," Gehlen panted with a salute before placing the briefcase onto the desk and pulling out a vast assortment of documents, folders and tapes. He finally sat down, took a deep breath, and stared at Bormann straight in the eyes. "My Führer, what I am about to say is a consequence of both research and speculation." He adjusted his square glasses. "I have reason to believe there is an internal conspiracy against your leadership. A conspiracy within the Government itself." Bormann stared back silently, grinding his teeth. Gehlen cleared his throat and ran through the evidence. "I have tape recordings and their transcripts. I have obtained letters and diaries. I will admit that none of this evidence is solid enough to make any arrests, and I am willing to accept that confirmation bias is at play... but I don't think we can take that chance."\n\nBormann sat in silence for a few moments, staring at the documents before him."

Effective immediately."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Gehlen smiled, his eyes lighting up. "I will use every means at my disposal. It will be completely clandestine, naturally."\n\n"Naturally." Bormann's mind raced with possibilities. Could it be true? Was there a shadowy force lurking within the corridors of the Reichstag and in the offices of the Reichskanzlei?

It was almost a tragedy to undo so much of his work, but the Führer demanded results and Gehlen had resolved to be the man to deliver them.\n\nHis first action, as dictated by Bormann himself, was a total restructuring of the organization under his leadership - and how could he refuse such an offer? The power of the pencil-pusher was an oft underestimated one. With but a flick of his pen he could remove Müller's most trusted men from contact with one another and send them to opposite ends of the Reich. Yes, with this newfound control he could begin the task of digging out conspiracy root and stem. The Führer would hear only good things from now on - he would make sure of it."

He had ordered an investigation into who was sending these letters, which seemed to be being circulated throughout the lower levels of the party. He had been informed, however, that whoever was responsible was skilled at covering their tracks, and arresting everyone found with a copy of the letter would require a purge of the party, an action he was not yet ready to take.

"I would think that is obvious. Treason is a cancer that must be dug out at its root. I want a list of everyone who has ever spoken to these traitors. I want a list of their families. I want you to start digging graves."\n\nGehlen nodded. "With your permission I will mobilise the OrPo immediately."\n\n"You have it. Get out." Startled by the brusqueness of his reply, Gehlen rose and stepped outside the door. Once he closed the door, he stood stationary for a moment, curious.\n\nBehind the door, he heard the Führer exhale, long and slow. He heard him rise from the chair.

The tension filled the air - even those too young to remember the Party's first rise knew what was coming.

Even with the Reich's own sources of oil in Kaukasien, petrol has become prohibitively expensive for the common citizen. Many Germans have instead resorted to cycling or walking to work - if they have work to return to. The economic slump has resulted in upwards of a million Germans losing their jobs."\n\nBormann turned off his television with a sigh. He was receiving more flak than was fired in the Battle of Britain, and this crisis wasn't even his fault! He should have expected this crash as soon as the Italians established their empire.

He could forge his own conspiracies and outmaneuver these foes. With sharp political cunning and a firm hand, he could strengthen his hold on power and punish those who had tried to weaken it.\n\nBut only a weak man would play the conspirators at their own game. What would Hitler have done, if not destroy the conspiracy with ruthless efficiency? Weakness and compromise were foreign to National Socialism. Only the strongest may survive. Bormann could take no chances. Like Alexander and the Gordian Knot, he would raise his sword and slice through this black web in one single stroke."

While his thoughts were a blurry mess of sorrowful memories and regrets, he barely even registered the banging at the front door at first, but when he heard a guard cry out in alarm before disappearing in a storm of what he recognized as gunshots even in his current state, Göring stumbled to his feet. The French! The French were attacking the aerodrome! Why had that fool Reinhard not ordered the planes up before they got this close? He tried to concentrate. Small arms fire, not fighters. Damn, he needed a pistol! Where... ah yes, of course, his coat! Scrambling to the closet, he found his hat and coat, to his relief with his trusty Luger in it. Putting on the clothes as best he could, he stumbled towards the office door and towards the sounds of combat downstairs.\n\nGöring emerged at the top of the staircase, firing a shot blindly at one of the blurry soldiers battling below. He noted with satisfaction that the figure grunted and fell over, before taking aim at another figure. Click. He looked with confusion at his weapon. Why would he have loaded his gun with only one bullet? With a dissatisfied grunt he made his way back to the office. Maybe there were some rounds in a desk drawer.\n\nLocating something small and round in the top drawer of the desk, Göring decided to pull aside the office curtains for light.

For whatever reason, he never put a second shot in Marcel, but retreated to his office. The young man's heart had been pounding the entire rest of the battle, until they stormed Göring's office. Luckily for them there was no casualties in taking the man into arrest, as he was already dead by the time they arrived.\n\nHe turned to the officer from Germania, who was ordering the other mercenaries and soldiers from the Heimat to grab shovels.

The former claimant to the Führer's office was thinner and paler than he remembered, looking slightly sickly.The Reichskommissar made a mental note to send one of his good French doctors by, but remained all smiles.\n\n"Hermann Meyer! Good to see you, it has been too long my friend! When did we last meet, '58?"\n\nGöring smiled weakly. "In another world, Siegfried. I see there is still no hiding from you though, hunter instincts to the last."\n\n"Ah, but today you are not the prey, Herr Meyer. At least if you and your... companions get into my car and leave this crisp Hitlerstadt air for a week's hunt with me, you can enjoy the hunt like last time. Also, going elsewhere, well.." Müller turned and motioned as if showing off the neighborhood. "Let us just say it would mean we would not have to inconvenience any Abwehr agents who may or may not have requested to search this part of town for signs of some refugee politician."\n\nGöring grinned, for the first time in years."

He was almost normal only a few days ago."\n\nThe doctor began packing up his kit to return to Müller's residence across Congo Lake. "Malaria can kill quickly in patients with underlying health conditions, and Messieur Göring has been skipping out on his quinine. I would need to do an autopsy to be certain, but my guess is critical liver failure. The liver cannot take being hammered by both... relaxing substances, and malaria at once. My condolences for your loss."\n\nBernd paled. Göring was dead. Göring the war hero, Göring the political operator, Göring the icon for millions of younger men like him. He had not died in battle or from an assassin's bullet in the night, but from a completely regular and treatable tropic disease, wasting away in this sweltering shithole. This wasn't right, the world wasn't right.\n\nSwearing an oath in his mind that he would not rest until the Reichsmarschall was avenged and that swine Bormann deposed, Bernd stood up and raised an arm towards the pale body of Hermann Göring."

Even the most dense of Abwehr agents could make the connection between the rumors of Göring's death from malaria and the militarist pilgrimages made to the mansion in his crown jewel of a city. To top it off Bernd von Brauchitsch had penned a short biography of the tragic life of the former Reichsmarschall, called "Richthofen's Heir." No, Müller had to make this statement, and now. A producer signaled to him to start.\n\n"Citizens of the Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika! This is your Reichskommissar, Siegfried Müller. I speak to you to bring you grave news! The former Reichsmarschall and alleged traitor of the Reich, Hermann Göring, has been found dead in Hitlerstadt, apparently having caught malaria while hiding from our patrols searching for the possible fugitive. While this traitor has found justice in death, I would like to remind all citizens that public gatherings without official approval is illegal..."\n\nThe tape arrived in Germania the next day. Bormann did not watch it, in fact he barely emerged from his office for a full day after receiving the news via telegram. When he finally did emerge, his face was like a wax mask, frozen and neutral.

An advantage without any drawback.\n\nWith a look of contempt, the Führer tossed the letter into the dustbin, and returned to his activities.

The occultist sects, degenerate gatherings of misbegotten people bent to foreign influence and irrational beliefs, had been banned almost thirty years ago thanks to his personal intervention, but now they have risen once more: sprouting as fungi on a rotting trunk, these parasites threaten once more the purity of the Aryan people...\n\nAs he crunches the papers in his hand, he already knows the answer to a thousand unspoken questions. Heinrich Himmler - the snake! - has always been a devotee of the occultist creed, and many prominent officials kept practising their debauched ways under his wing even after the Hess-Aktion, kept away from righteous punishment by the powerful SS-Reichsführer: ever since the Ordensstaat was created, Himmler had dropped all pretense of compliance to German law, and now everyone can see the fruits of his criminal intent.\n\nThere is no time to be lost. Every new occult circle is an eye from which Himmler can spy on the Reich, every new acolyte a potential minion: these tumors must be excised immediately and without hesitation. As Bormann calls his secretary, he already knows what he needs to do: all occult clubs will be banned once more, as will all the petty superstitions such as esoterism, homeopathy and its many pseudo-medical ramifications.

He knew his mommy would scold him if she caught little Thomas sitting so close to the TV - it was bad for his eyes, she always said - but this was his favourite show, and he wasn't about to miss a single moment.\n\nThomas couldn't decide which of the villains he hated more: The balding Speer, dressed in crimson, was always threatening the innocent civilians with his hammer and sickle; the crazy Göring, a rabid dog with the bloated face of a human, couldn't stop spewing foam over his three chins; and the terrifying Heydrich, the black marionette pulled around by devilish schemers off-screen. Thank God they were all gone!\n\nThe villains were as dastardly as their nemesis was heroic. Thomas loved Bormann, the tall warrior clad in shining armor like a Teutonic Knight from the history books. No matter how much the villainous trio tried to destroy Germany, the Führer would arrive without fail by the end of the episode, foiling their evil plots and brutally smiting their henchmen with his mighty sword. Whenever Thomas saw Bormann giving a speech on TV, he waited eagerly for the man to don a suit of armor with a smile and a wink.\n\nEvery episode capped off the action with the "Heil Zeit!", a minute-long musical segment in which the Horst Wessel Lied played over dramatic images of Hitler and Bormann. As glued as he was to the TV when the show was playing, Thomas never failed to get up onto his feet and yell for the neighbours to hear when the 'Heil Zeit!' played. He'd happily sing and heil along, laughing all the while. "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!"."

He was Thomas' favorite cartoon hero, braver than Captain NSDAP and Hans the Eagle combined. The episodes weren't all about the Civil War anymore, although the same villains from that arc still made appearances sometimes. Their crimes against the Aryan race could never be forgotten, after all.\n\nThe latest episode focused on one of Bormann's friends, a stupid plump man named 'Ferdinand Schörner', and his plot to betray the nation by placing the rabid dog Göring in charge. Thomas had never heard of Schörner before today, but now he hated the fat idiot. Finally, a new villain! He had grown tired of Süß the Jewish Bolshevik and John Smith the American Mongrel.\n\nTowards the end of the show, Thomas watched in horror as Bormann was ready to forgive Schörner's betrayal, only for him to go rabid like his master and bite Bormann's hand. That was the last straw, and Germany's hero could take it no longer. Thomas cheered as Bormann beat Schörner across the head and crammed him and Göring into the same dog kennel. He punched into the air along with Bormann, and couldn't help but snicker as the camera zoomed in on Schörner's whining face.\n\n'Heil Zeit!' played afterwards, and Thomas sang and saluted along, just like always. There was only one picture of Hitler this time, right at the beginning of the song. All the rest were of Bormann. Thomas preferred it that way. Hitler had been Germany's savior once, but now Bormann was in charge. He deserved the credit. "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Bormann!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Bormann!", "Heil Bormann!"."

Thomas loved his little brother, but he couldn't stand sitting around as he played with his stupid toys and watched silly cartoons. Whenever the two brothers hung out, Thomas would quietly read or do homework while his brother stared fixedly at the TV. Yet there was one show that made Thomas pay attention. His childhood favorite.\n\nRoland seemed to like it just as much as he did, and hanging out with his brother gave Thomas an excuse to see how the show had evolved. Despite the improvements in animation, it was mostly the same drivel: the knightly Bormann would face off against a bunch of cartoonishly evil villains and destroy them with ease. This time the episode was about the 'Oil Crisis'. Bormann was helping the German army fight against its vague enemies in the Middle East, riding through the sand on a white horse with a golden lance. Thomas felt a pang of anxiety as he pictured his older cousin in the Heer, fighting on that foreign soil.\n\nWhen the 'Heil Zeit!' began, the unsubtle minute dedicated to praising Bormann, he rolled his eyes, though soon found himself overwhelmed with nostalgia. Roland was begging him to join in. Their parents wouldn't be pleased if they overheard their older son chanting along to a morning cartoon. After all, Thomas had caught his parents sharing a few choice words about Bormann over coffee in the mornings. Yet when the Heil Zeit was nearly over, and Roland continued to salute and sing and chant, Thomas humored his little brother and joined in right at the end, giving one last message to his childhood hero."

He was hit by a wave of nostalgia. Heil Zeit, the shitty propaganda cartoon that ended with pictures of Bormann's fat face over some bombastic music. This episode heavily featured the late Parteikanzler Baldur von Schirach, a posh effeminate man with limp wrists and a mincing gait, who schemed to destroy Germany. He was beaten up by Bormann in the end, who was wearing that same antique suit of armor Thomas remembered from the old days. He grinned at the ridiculousness of it all. How had he ever enjoyed this garbage?\n\nAs an ignorant child, he had feasted on Nazi propaganda like a starving man with a bowl of stew. Bormann had been a symbol of unity and pride for the Fatherland. He was, as his uncle often proclaimed, a humble man continuing Hitler's legacy. Yet as Thomas had aged, so had the bloated Führer. The country was torn apart by the mass purges, and his Catholic father had suffered a mental breakdown after the abolition of the churches. Thomas' mother had not gone a day without crying since the death of her brother, shot alongside all of the secretaries and deputies of their Gauleiter. He had been purged during the Second Night.\n\nHe heard the doorbell ring, and quickly turned off the TV, grabbing his jacket and placard. Something held him back. Thomas knew he was placing his family at risk. His father, his mother, his younger brother Roland. Yet he had no choice. Someone had to stand up to the sadistic thugs in power. As he leapt into the car and they drove towards the protest, the radio began broadcasting an address by Leopold Gutterer, the new Propaganda Minister. The lads broke into a chant to drown him out."

He looked uncomfortable; he was always more at ease behind a desk than behind a podium. Nonetheless, he began his speech with a practiced bombasity, doing his best to emulate the oratory of the great Führer who had preceded him. If he failed, he wouldn't know it. There was nothing he could do or say there on the podium that the sycophants of the inner party would not cheer and applaud.\n\n"The Reich's devolution into chaos, hardship and brotherly war," Bormann began, awkwardly at the papers on his podium, "can be placed at the feet of one organization, and one man. Some within our Reich would foolishly blame National Socialism, and seek to reform the country to adopt the degenerate customs of the West. Others would worship the Wehrmacht above all, seeking to turn our Reich into a mindless animal, lashing out at all around it. These false ideas and the traitors that held them have been justly excised from our Reich." Bormann paused here again, subtly gesturing with his hand for the crowd to cheer on the deaths of the militarists and reformers. They did, tepidly, and he continued. "But they all failed to see the true problem that plagued us. The only one of our great internal enemies that yet lingers on. Heinrich Himmler and his servants in Paris!" This time, the Vollshalle needed no prompting. They enthusiastically applauded the vilification of Himmler and his hated SS, and kept cheering as Bormann finished. "It was their machinations, their sabotage, the mistake of gifting them their fiefdom, that weakened our Reich and caused so much devastation for our people. It is their hands that are dirtied with the blood of so many fallen sons!""

Ironically, it was the limits imposed on their state by Germania that had doomed them. The skeleton army permitted by Hitler had no chance of resisting Himmler's SS, and their downfall had been in many ways inevitable since the last Führer's passing.\n\nStill, it would not do to meekly accept their downfall at the hands of our new enemies. The rebellious SS-Ordensstaat might occupy a lion's share of former French territory, but France still lives on in the south, and we are better throwing our lot in with them than permitting Himmler to rule over his fiefdom unchallenged. The Reich shall issue a formal declaration, to France and to all nations, firmly denouncing Burgundy's invasion and refusing to recognize under any circumstances the territorial acquisitions of the SS during the German Civil War. Of course, simply saying as much will do nothing to reverse those acquisitions, but it will at least remind the French regime that we are their friends, and remind the whole world that it is not the Reich that is the black state polluting the face of Europe: it is Burgundy."

In return, they asked of us only to recognize and defend Brittany's continued independence, and to legally accept their borders as defined following the Franco-Burgundian War.\n\nThe Treaty of Breizh accomplishes these terms. With Bormann's signature, this piece of paper drafted by the Breton government wins back Brittany into German domination, admitting the Republic of Brittany into the Einheitspakt in exchange for our recognition of their independence and present borders. The remains of France will surely object, insisting that the Bretons were co-belligerents in the Burgundian war against them, but what do they have to offer us that Brittany does not?

The main dilemma inside the OKW, however, is exactly what kind of assistance the Reich is to offer its French allies. One camp is of a mind that the greater participation Germany has in Fall Rollo, the codename for the invasion of Brittany, the better. They wish for the Reich to officially declare war against the Republic of Brittany, and to directly participate in the invasion alongside the French State. Another camp, consisting of the more discrete members of the High Command, instead prefer merely offering war materiel, intelligence, and military training to the French State.

The tree that the black eagle lives in is home to another nest, in which a careless and lazy bald eagle chick lives. The black eagle's mother makes sure her nest is strong and stable, and builds it on the thickest branch on the tree. The bald eagle's nest is built on the tallest branch, a thin little twig that juts out about the rest of the tree, from where the bald eagles look down on the black eagles.\n\nOne day, a great storm comes, turning the sky black with dark clouds, and shaking the tree on which both nests are perched. The black eagle chick stays safe in its nest, swaying only slightly, the chick safe underneath its mother's wings. The weaker and taller branch that the bald eagle's nest is built on sways wildly in the wind, and the bald eagle falls, unable to fly in the storm and plummeting to the ground unseen. The bald eagle chicken looks up at the sky and sees the dark clouds in the sky begin to form into the black sun sigil of the SS, illuminated by lightning. As climactic music plays, the bald eagle's branch snaps, and the nest and chick both fall down into the dark sky below.\n\nOnce the storm fades, the watching children witness that all of the branches on the tree broke off, except for the one: the strongest branch, which the black eagle mother had wisely picked. The black eagle mother talks to the children of Germany directly, telling them to listen to their elders and to stay safe and protected from the storms that might come to their own tree. The chick agrees, as it leaps out of its nest at its mothers behest and begins to fly for the first time, soaring amongst a bright blue sky."

Now having received eager confirmation from the French government, they were forwarded to Rome with little delay. Alongside them was a small Italian portfolio detailing how recent German moves towards reconciliation with the Breton state had driven a wedge into already strained Franco-German relations, prompting Bordeaux to look for new allies abroad with Italy being a major element in their considerations.\n\nThe document now sits on a polished desk in Rome, and two options have made themselves clear: To embrace France's desperation and solidify our relations with a new European ally or to abandon the French in their frantic search for allies. Both decisions will surely alter the balance of powers in Europe, allowing us to either dedicate resources to a new and willing bulwark against German influence or, on the other hand, to shun the Bordeaux government and consolidate our own sphere of influence against German aggression.

The current German Führer, Martin Bormann, is reportedly furious with the French for their disloyalty and has vowed punitive measures for defying the articles of the alliance the French claim the Germans have been ignoring almost since the start.

Himmler had never been a friend, but outwardly they had maintained a veneer of cordiality and respect. In reality, one had always tried to undermine the other, and both were locked into a Great Game for the control of the Party. This Game lasted well into the West Russian War and ended with the Reichsführer's betrayal and the attempted SS coup. Now, Bormann thought, Himmler and himself were locked into a Cold War, one that was heating up every day that passed.\n\nHis cigar was close to burning his fingers. The Führer threw it in the ashtray and lit another one. He tried reading one of Hewel's documents, but his mind once again wandered to the past. The SS coup had been the perfect opportunity, the one sure way to get rid of Himmler and his cabal of mindless brutes. However, before Bormann could spring his trap, that little snake played his card. Hitler announced his plans for the creation of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, and Bormann's protests amounted to nothing. The Reichsführer of the SS had his own fiefdom, far from Martin's influence. A decade has passed, and the Shadow State remained, uncaring about the changes happening in the Fatherland. This situation was unsustainable, Bormann thought, and he had to gain the upper hand. No more could Himmler be allowed to rule his little realm with no consequences.\n\nThe Führer's entire office reeked of smoke now.

So many sites of triumph over the Bolsheviks and Jews! The gears in Bormann's head turned, and an old map turned into old memories, filling his mind.\n\nBeginnings of their alliance to conquer the world. A time of squalor and degeneracy then, yet a time of promise. First it was the Italians who joined the Axis, then the Japanese. Different races, of course, but they had a common enemy of the Bolsheviks - at least they knew who the real threat was. While the Reich triumphed over its enemies - oh, how his heart filled with joy when he remembered the subjugation of Europe - the Japanese fought their own enemies, crushing the communists in China, and asserting their own supremacy in the Asian continent.\n\nHis eye returned to the real world for a momentary, painful second, before finding a hole within the Pacific, on the small island of Iwo Jima. Even those Asians could have their triumphs, he supposed. Reports spoke of how the sea filled with blood and iron, a graveyard spanning the waves, and the complete rout of the Americans. It was not long after that that the ultimate weapon of the Reich, the product of the world's greatest minds was detonated in Pearl Harbor, and the war came to a close.\n\nWhen the war ended, the world belonged to the Axis. There were no more Bolsheviks to conquer, and so in triumph came ruin to the Axis. No more unifying enemy, and no more reason to cooperate.

Foreign Minister [GetJAPforeignminister] himself commented that "the inconsistent and interchangeable 'racial theories' the German heralds is testament to his fickle temper and naive understanding of the world" - a far cry from Germania's violent rhetoric in recent weeks.\n\nAlthough the news has come in a series of striking diplomatic measures to apply pressure to the Co-Prosperity Sphere, if Führer Bormann's stated purpose in this act is to strike a fear into the hearts of the Japanese, then he has failed abjectly."

He took a few notes - his superiors back home were quick sticklers for the details - and set off for the meeting place with the Japanese ambassador.\n\n"Merkel-san", said Ambassador Kaneko, "it is an honor to meet you." They shook hands - Merkel was pretty sure that, legally speaking, the Japanese were degenerates now, but it would have been too rude to refuse his hand. "Likewise," Merkel said, quickly cut off by Kaneko's rapid speech. "On the behalf of the Empire of Japan, I would like to apologize for the assassination attempt on your previous Führer, and the great harm it had causes not just to him, but to your nation. We recognize words may not be enough, however we are open to diplomacy, as ever."\n\n"Thank you, Ambassador Kaneko," Merkel said. He was surprised by how easily the ambassador apologized, but he wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth. "It is excellent to hear such words. On the behalf of the Führer of the German Nation, it would be my honor to serve as the representative in opening up diplomatic relations between our countries." Kaneko was taken aback - to be honest, a declaration of war seemed more likely than an attempted normalization of relations, given Bormann's recent remarks, but Kaneko had precisely the same opinion on gift horses as Merkel.\n\n"Excellent.

Excellent to see that the Japanese trusted him for some reason, Bormann thought. An embassy needs phones, of course, so he would make sure the Reich sent phones. They technically weren't pre-bugged - they were just incredibly, incredibly easy to tap into, so there was no need to have findable bugs on them. Next, he needed to ensure the new transfers - spies very, very thinly veiled as diplomats - were settling in well.\n\n"Mein Führer," Ambassador Merkel said on the phone - one of the Japanese ones, for now - "diplomatic relations are going quite well, and the Japanese seem to trust us. Ambassador Kaneko had held a tea ceremony, and -"\n\n"You had tea with the degenerates? Christ. Anyway, that doesn't matter. Have the new transfers settled in?"\n\n"Yes, they have, but, forgive me mein Führer, they do not seem to have much experience in the way of diplomacy-"\n\n"That's fine, I have full faith they can do their assigned jobs well - and that job is not fucking having tea with vermin.

The representatives had brought with them graphs and documents, each to present the potential economic gain in welcoming German business in the East.\n\nAs the delegation chatted on, grinning with sly smiles and crow's feet, [JAP.GetLeader]'s eyes were locked on to the blazing red armbands wrapped around the representative's sleeves. He clenched his teeth; the dark black void of a swastika revolted him, as he thought about the ravaging chaos of German presence in Eastern Europe and Africa, as millions had been displaced, abused, and outright cleansed from the earth so the Führer could have his way.\n\nSwallowing with a dry throat, [JAP.GetLeader] looked back up at the men suspiciously.

Hewel's main goal was to reaffirm the Reich's commitments to Iran and its defense, but also to learn about rumors on the Shah's opposition, who seemed braver than ever lately. His ride from the airport to the palace had been insightful. Tehran was indeed more beautiful than ever, but one could see its decay and the unrest among its people. What the minister needed was to hear it straight from the lion's mouth.\n\n"So, while we can expect some aggression from the Iraqis-" the Shah was in the middle of his sentence when Hewel raised his hand in dismissal.\n\n"Your Majesty, forgive me for my bluntness, but you and I both know Iraq is no threat to your nation."

 bormann.1812.desc:0 "The origins of film's mastering has often lied in propaganda - take the Birth of a Nation in America, a very clearly racist film, yet responsible for many modern film techniques that really have modernized cinema. As such, while many of my countrymen are denouncing Zanjeer as a thinly veiled anti-Japanese propaganda pic, it is a genuinely innovative and enjoyable picture!\n\nMoving away from Bollywood's obsession with romance films, Zanjeer is a dark and gritty crime drama. The lead actor, Amitabh Bachchan, proves himself to be a versatile actor, but he really isn't the star of the show. The film has garnered controversy for its portrayal of its setting, that being Japanese occupied India. Corruption is utterly rampant, and most of the police are useless - Bachchan's colleagues in the police force, mostly Japanese, revel in cruelty and are hopelessly corrupt, making lavish purchases off the bribes they accrue over time.\n\nIt is worth noting that the film's propagandistic tendencies get much more noticeable as the film goes on. When the protagonist is arrested, the prisons are a horrifyingly gritty depiction of life under the Japanese, with barely any food for the prisoners, and an unbelievably brutal prison staff toes the line between a terrifying portrayal of the Japanese horrors and a laughable attempt at being brutal for brutality's sake. Of course, most people don't think of nuances like the portrayal of the Japanese when pointing to the propaganda of this film. After the film ends, credit rolling, in big white letters comes "A REAL PORTRAYAL OF LIFE IN JAPANESE-OCCUPIED INDIA. MAY WE RETURN TO THEM AND REJOICE IN PEACE."\n\nOverall, Zanjeer was an excellent film, and I look forward to seeing the future of this director and these actors - and, like much of India, I look forward to seeing us being reunited with our countrymen who are under the Japanese."

Accusing the Calcutta Government for 'radicalism' and 'treason' for committing itself in a military alliance with Tokyo, many in Delhi and across the subcontinent have been persuaded by the rhetoric that the Government of Free India must be confronted by means of words or war sooner rather than later. To little surprise, this has raised many eyebrows in Japan as many wonder if violent conflict is brewing on the horizon.\n\nHowever, and rather unsurprisingly, the Reich seems to be encouraging the Delhi Government, beating the drums of war to push Japanese influence out of Bengal. Whilst it is predictable that Japan's primary adversaries are backing a hostile regime, the diplomatic consequences of the heightened confrontations ring alarm bells behind closed doors. This has come in a series of heightened tensions between Germania and Tokyo as Führer Bormann presses for greater influences in the peripheries beyond immediate German military presence.\n\nThe Japanese keep watch over Bengal, awaiting further measures taken by Delhi in the coming weeks and months - anticipating the moment where they may have to draw the line in the sand."

There were no pillboxes, few trenches, and their weaponry was of notably low quality. It was a perfect depiction of the rebel groups put down by the Reich so many times.\n\nASSAULT REPORT: The Kriegsmarine began with a shelling of enemy positions, though there was not much to shell. Many enemy casualties occurred in this time, far more than usual, as Kriegsmarine soldiers noticed a great many enemies that showed signs of being killed through explosions.\n\nCASUALTY REPORT: The Kriegsmarine reports 25 dead and 156 wounded.\n\nCONCLUSION: This was a predictable success against a far inferior enemy. In fact, the Kriegsmarine was almost TOO careful - in future assaults on enemy positions like this, it would be safe to shell the enemy for a longer time, instead of rushing to an assault in fear of the assault coming too late - it's simply not possible for the enemy to prepare for an assault under the conditions they were in."

And, of course, in between all of those, this "fourth world", the neutral nations under the control of no global superpower, independent from the blocs locked in this cold war. Here, he would find his allies.\n\nIran was an obvious choice. Their government was already somewhat aligned with the Reich, and it would not be difficult to get them to partner with Germany against the Japanese empire. There are rumors of internal instability, but those rumors existed in almost every country on the globe. There was not much reason to pay them any mind.\n\nThe next country was another obvious one, India. Though the Indian government tended to lean far more left than the Reich would find appropriate, and there were rumors of their partnership with the Americans in some areas, the modern world was all about realpolitik, and it was impossible to pass down a partnership with a nation that big, and with such a good reason to hate Japan - they were occupying their territory, for god's sake!\n\nFinally, Afghanistan. It was less powerful and less developed than the other two; but that doesn't matter. What matters is that Afghanistan is the Graveyard of Empires, and there is a certain Empire that Bormann would like to dig a grave for.

His journalistic thirst had forced him to accept the interview, a decision he had quickly grown to regret.\n\n"Heil Bormann!" came a voice. Dudman shot to his feet as the saluting midget approached. The man was squat and burly, with a plain round face. This was the Führer? He looked like a butcher who had suffered a mid-life crisis and joined the Boy Scouts. Dudman raised his own arm in response.\n\n"Uh, Heil Dudman?" he responded. Bormann's eyes flickered to his adjutants. Amusement? Anger? A chill ran down his spine. This was no local butcher, he had to remind himself. This was the butcher of Europe. The Führer sat down opposite him, joined by a bespectacled translator. "Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Mr Bormann. What do you hope to achieve in your upcoming conference in Stockholm?"\n\n"Führer Bormann," Bormann's translator corrected with a false smile. "Well, Mr Dudman, I wish to improve Germanic-American relations. The time has come for the ice to thaw. The upcoming conference is a gesture of my diplomatic goodwill."\n\n"So, Führer Bormann..." Dudman trailed off. The uniformed Nazis around the room were staring at the journalist with polite smiles and burning eyes. A pang of inspiration hit him. These Nazi bastards could control the interview, but they couldn't control how the American public perceived it. Dudman grinned. "Another hardball for you, Führer Bormann. Do you have a pet?""

 bormann.1902.desc:0 "For the first time in what seems like ages, several representatives of the United States of America and the German Reich have gathered without a firefight breaking out or the threat of nuclear annihilation dangling ever closer to a reality. The conference is meant to serve as a means of detente and warming of relations, though for the men who will be attending, the tension is seemingly more palpable than ever. If the conference goes well, both sides seek to benefit from increased cooperation. A poor result, however, could lead to a rather sharp escalation of the conflicts between the two sides.\n\nMeeting in the capital of neutral Sweden, the President and the Führer exchange brief, meaningless pleasantries in the public eye before continuing into the building that has been set aside for the conference. The United States would speak first, setting the terms for what they deemed necessary for increased cooperation between themselves and the German Reich. The Germans would respond in kind, and as such the conference went well, at first, with the two sides making minor concessions and avoiding most discussion of the South African War.\n\nEventually, however, the United States delegation made a proposal that would require more consideration than the previous ones had: The Americans wanted the Germans to consent to give their President a direct line to the Führer, for quick action in times of crisis. The German delegation quickly began to discuss the matter amongst themselves."

 bormann.1903.desc:0 ""A necessary facet of cooperation is communication."  The American translator announces in slightly accented German, speaking more to the room than to Bormann himself. "If the Reich wishes to work with the United States, they must consent to the installation of a hotline between the Oval Office and Germania. This is a simple measure to create trust between our nations, and allow quick resolution of any incidents that may arise. A method for our leaders to resolve such issues is critical for the expanding of relations."\n\nThe Führer felt less sure of the benefits of such a plan. It was certainly possible that it would lead to resolution of some disputes, but he also knew that it would lead to the Americans making demands of him on a much more frequent basis. It was one thing for the United States to object to the Reich's actions in the form of a speech across the sea. It was another to give them the power to make these criticisms directly to the Führer, at any time they saw fit. It would elevate the Americans almost to the level of equals.\n\nAs the German delegates argued amongst themselves as to the German response, Bormann allowed himself to think on the merits of the proposal. In the end, Bormann made his decision, relaying it to his fellows and instantly stopping all further debate over the subject. The German translator gave the Reich's official response to the American proposal."

Unless a major wrench is thrown in the works near the conference's end, it seems likely that Germany and the United States will be able to find common ground.

And yet somehow, Bormann has managed to turn the issue into a debate.\n\nDespite our insistence on the importance of the issue, the Germans have refused to commit to a hotline, merely saying that such a thing "could be a possibility in the future, if the situation permits." While this may mean that they will be willing to broach the issue once relations have normalized, it could also mean that they are unwilling to fully commit to detente.

Refusal to meet it, they say, will be seen as refusal to cooperate with America.\n\nWhile many of our delegates believe that to turn back on our prior stance would be a sign of weakness, others argue that it is for the best of Germany to give in to the Americans just this once. It's beginning to look as if talks with the Americans will totally break down if the Führer does not permit this plan to move forward."

The Americans were willing to come to a deal, and the Reich would reap a great deal of benefits from it. Naturally, the Americans had not become friends overnight, but the Führer had no need for friends. He had a need for American missiles to be aimed at Tokyo rather than Germania, and that was what he had gotten. Any more than that was simply a blessing.\n\nThe Führer, a rare smile playing on his face, returned to the delegation, who were gathering their supplies to leave the conference center. "We have won a great victory for the Reich today." He informed them. "Be proud, of yourselves and of your country, for the fine work you have done today." They had not all been particularly helpful, of course, but he was in too fine a mood to complain.\n\nHe glanced around the room, and his eyes met that of the American president for a brief moment. He wondered what Hitler would have made of what had happened here today. Would he have denounced Bormann's actions, condemned the prospect of ever allying with a nation full of jews and capitalists? Would he have permitted the Reich he had forged in blood and iron to work together with a corrupt country built upon liberalism and democracy?\n\nBormann's thoughts were interrupted soon after, however. "My Führer."  It seemed Reichsminister Hewel wanted something of him. "It is thanks to your wit and bold view for the nation that this feat has been accomplished." Hewel glanced back at the diplomats. "In celebration, I suggest that we stay for a round of the finest Swedish vodka before returning to the Reich.

With this agreement, hopefully, such a thing would never happen again. The Organization of Free Nations was safe from any further attacks, at least from the east. If the Japanese in the west began to mobilize against them, meanwhile, the Emperor would be facing the might of two superpowers, not just one. The Free World may very well have been saved in this very room.\n\nJack Kennedy had been lauded across the nation for solving the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, true. But what would the American public think of the commander-in-chief who had stopped the Breton Missile Crisis before it had even happened? It certainly had been an eventful day, that was for sure.\n\nAs the American Delegation was escorted from the Conference Hall by the Secret Service, however, the President happened to lock eyes with Bormann, sitting amongst his fellow Nazis, who were babbling excitedly in German.\n\nThe weight of what the President had done finally hit. America had, for the first time ever, struck a deal with the krauts. A fascist power, brutal and cold in its repression of all dissent, and the world's beacon of freedom had shown itself willing to compromise with them. Suddenly, what had happened to the boys in South Africa was no longer a reassuring thought.\n\nNonetheless, the President shook themself of dread, placed their doubts aside and stepped through the conference hall doors. Immediately, a gaggle of reporters swarmed the group, flashing cameras and asking questions. A single reporter's voice was heard above the rest, asking the President what had occurred behind those closed doors. The President took a breath, and answered."

It would be an ungodly mess\n\nFinally, the Führer had enough of all the talk about hotlines. He had given his answer, hadn't he? He gestured to get the translator's attention, and asked him to change the subject to that of tariffs. Hopefully, the Americans would get the message that he was unwilling to budge on the matter and drop it.\n\nWhat the Führer did not expect, however, was for the American President to begin shrieking words at him in a rather hostile tone. Bormann waited, and found no answer. Impatient, he glared at the American translator. "Well? What did he say?" The Führer demanded. "Answer me." The translator remained tight-lipped, shaking as the Führer stood. It was some mockery, then. Bormann would not permit mockery.\n\n"This whole conference has been a farce." Bormann declared, clearly filled with some amount of well-contained rage. "The United States is clearly unwilling to work with my government without my total capitulation on every matter! I asked for a detente, but clearly America is unwilling to achieve one. This meeting is over."\n\nThe Führer stormed out of the room, leaving behind a frantic translator attempting to simultaneously relay Bormann's message and Reichsminister Hewel's continued attempts to negotiate around the hotline.

If the two countries did not have the means to work together, the alliance would fall apart. The President was sure Bormann had finally been convinced. He almost seemed to be nodding slightly, as if in agreement. When he gave his response to the translator, the President did not hear a single 'nein' in there.\n\nInstead, what the translator said was, "The Führer would now like to discuss the status of the embargoes between our two nations."\n\nIn response to this, the President, consciously or not, expressed a few choice sentiments to the German Führer. The American translator, keen to avoid sparking a nuclear war, chose not to pass those sentiments onto Bormann. Nevertheless, he seemed to have gotten the gist of what the President had said.\n\nBefore anyone could say anything more, the German leader had made several bold declarations about the legitimacy of the conference and the American's intentions. All was silent in the room for a few minutes, both delegations too stunned to act.\n\nFinally, Hewel spoke, his voice somewhat weak.

As if the OFN was an alliance of friendship and ideals, instead of a military pact just like any other.\n\nNevertheless, this had to be addressed. If the Americans and the Reich were to work together, Britain could not be allowed to serve as a floating missile silo just outside the Einheitspakt. The Führer was certain the Americans would understand this.\n\nNot wishing to miss a moment of the broadcast, Bormann kept his eyes on the screen as he grasped around for the phone. He felt his hand close around the receiver, and immediately pulled it up to his ear. "I need Hewel to get the fuck in here."

Wordlessly, the two agents swapped the information, each giving the papers a cursory glance before stowing them away.\n\nThis continued for another ten or so minutes, each of the men offering information about the Japanese and the other giving a separate list of details about the Sphere to swap it with. The first few days of these negotiations had been more tense, with more bartering and discourse, but Franz and Hank had quickly realized the actual amount of information being exchanged between their countries would never be changed. As such, they had devised a faster method to do it.\n\nAfter the day's quota of top secret documents had been shared, the two exchanged glances in the silent room. Franz spoke first.

Naturally, this also meant that the Reich invading the small island and forcing them into the German sphere of influence was also off the table. It seemed that England would be forever doomed as a neutral at a time in which neutrality was less and less sustainable.\n\nWhile of course not ideal, these were things easily agreed to. The safety of the Reich came first, and England was not a prize worth jeopardizing that. The deal was also an early sign of how beneficial Stockholm had been. The Americans and the German Reich would continue their close, friendly collaboration, and the little wrinkle that was England was easily smoothed out.\n\nThis victory serves as a reminder to the doubtful of how truly beneficial Stockholm was to the Reich.

The ramifications this carried were plain for each to see."

Distant chants of protest were drowned out by the chattering of journalists and cameramen alike, who encircled the Nazis like vultures from behind the protective wall of OrPo bodyguards. The American government had closed off the entire section as a 'gift' for Bormann, claiming that they wanted the German people to see how Americans lived.\n\nBormann was no fool. This entire expedition was an attempt to mock the Führer, to provide amusing footage for the American Minderwertige to guffaw over. Unbeknownst to the State Department, Bormann knew how to fight fire with fire. The American audiences would receive their propaganda... while the German people would suffer an insight into America's degeneracy. He had entered the lion's den, not to let the beast consume him, but to stand before it as a superior being.\n\n"Would you like fries with that?" asked Goofy. Bormann's translator whispered into his ear.\n\n"I just want the burger," Bormann snapped. The translator relayed the reply, and the large anthropomorphic dog handed over a small greasy meal. Bormann snatched it and wolfed it down. He threw the wrapper into a nearby trashcan and turned to the cameras. "Gentlemen, you can start filming now." The translator shouted the order in English.\n\nBormann crossed his arms and stared defiantly at the indulgent display of capitalism that surrounded him. Gerhard Klopfer joined him, hands on hips, grinding his jaw in anger. Walther Hewel quickly passed his cotton candy to Mickey Mouse and strode in front of the cameras, shaking his head in disgust."

In order to achieve a detente between our peoples, the German nation would need to fully dismantle their system of National Socialism, and relinquish their unwanted hegemony over the nations of Europe, destroyed at the Nazi hand in unjust, causeless wars."\n\nThe German Führer unleashed a stream of curse words as he read the letter. The incompetent Jew in the White House, it seemed, was a true member of his despicable race. He considered for a moment that he could blame the whole idea on Hewel, but decided against it. Even the most silver of tongues could not convince a weed to befriend the weedkiller. If Bormann were to truly free Germany from Jewish influence, it had been a foolish idea to collaborate with a nation so ripe with hatred for Aryans and Western civilization.\n\nAt the very least, Bormann considered it a propaganda win. He could show his fellow nations that he had tried to be the reasonable one, to reach out with a hand of friendship: something the United States had slapped away. Surely, one could not now think of the Germans as the aggressor in this Cold War. Besides, it would give the German people strength to know how infested with liberalism the United States was. How deeply into their culture hatred for the German people was rooted. It would prove, once again, that the German people remained under constant threat from the forces that had worked against them for so long."

It had always frustrated him, when someone had shouted obscenities at them and Grandpa Mike had just laughed them off. He had never understood it as a child, even then thinking his grandfather should have raised his fists or at least his voice. If he did that, then the torment would surely stop. He never did. Michael Goldwater had been a strange man indeed.\n\nPresident Goldwater thumbed, for the third time or so, through the papers that the German delegation had forwarded to him. 'The German Reich, in light of the threat of the Japanese Menace, wishes to establish a firm and mutual detente with the United States of America. This would be to the benefit of both of our strong nations, and would serve to bring about a new German and American golden age.' Goldwater stopped reading there. He had the rest of the letter memorized already.\n\nGrandpa Mike had always been quiet about why he had left Russia. Barry had asked him, time and time again. The answer had often changed, frankly, but Barry remembered one of his answers most of all. "Well, Barry." His Grandfather began, leaning over to talk to the boy. "There were men in Russia, bad men, who did not want other men to be treated as their fellows, and instead as property. Some very good men tried to change that, and when they failed, I had to leave."\n\nPresident Goldwater wiped away the tears beginning to well in his eyes. It was not so unlikely that his Grandfather would have stayed, and that poor young Barry would have perished in Hitler's camps among so many others. President Goldwater began to write, furiously jotting down his response to the audacity, the utter hypocrisy of Bormann to offer peace when he had brought nothing but war and to offer friendship while he butchered families by the dozen."

He remembered the faces from the Stockholm Conference: the tall, jovial man in the black suit was Walther Hewel, the Foreign Minister; the scrawny, scowling man holding a cluster of documents had to be Gerhard Klopfer, Chief of the Reich Chancellery; and the squat bulldog of a man could only be Martin Bormann, the Führer.\n\nBennett forced a synthetic smile as the official White House photographer began snapping photographs. The other car doors opened to release a brown wave of uniformed bureaucrats and bodyguards, including a bespectacled translator who swiftly caught up with Bormann's purposeful stride. The Führer took off his peaked brown cap, handed it to Klopfer, and stretched out an open hand.\n\n"It is an honor to meet you, Mr President," the translator relayed the Führer's message."\n\n"The honor is all mine, Mr Bormann," Bennett lied, grinning for the cameras. "I trust Mr Hewel, Mr Klopfer and yourself had a pleasant trip to this beautiful country?"\n\n"Of course, Mr President," the translator spoke in a slightly more pleasant tone than his master.

He gestured to two men behind him, a cheery diplomat in a black suit and a scowling bureaucrat in a Party uniform.\n\n"I'm pleased to meet you too, Mr Bormann," Johnson replied with a thin smile. He grabbed Bormann's hand. It was a surprisingly firm grip. The President gripped tighter and drew it towards him. Bormann pulled it back and shook firmly, clenching with all his might. The smiles on their faces remained neutral. "A quick photo for the records, Mr Bormann?" The photographer snapped into action and positioned himself. The President straightened his back, placed his hands on his hips, and stood right beside the tiny dictator. The camera flashed. Johnson turned to face Bormann, towering over him like a falling tree.

"We'll send the footage to your people as well, if you'd like." Bormann listened to the translation and nodded gruffly. "I've got a proposal for you. As a sign of our thawing relations, perhaps we should open cultural exhibitions in each others' nations. The German people could experience American products made by... willing American hands."\n\n"Why should we display the degeneracy of American capitalism?" Bormann's translator did not match his Führer's scoffing tone. "Your nation is run by selfish millionaires, men who exploit the common worker to fill their pockets. Our economy is orchestrated to benefit the German Reich and the German Volk for centuries to come. Your system is not sustainable!"\n\n"Not sustainable?" Kennedy laughed cheerily, though his eyes flashed with hatred. "What about your 50s crash? I won't say that capitalism is perfect, far from it, but don't act as if National Socialism doesn't exploit the working class. Look at the megacorporations!"\n\nAfter half an hour of debating, the two men agreed to air the footage in their respective countries, shook hands, and strolled off towards the Oval Office."
