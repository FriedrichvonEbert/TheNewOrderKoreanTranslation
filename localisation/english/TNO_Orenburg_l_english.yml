 POLITICS_WORKERS_COUNCIL_ORENBURG_DESC: "The Workers' Council of Orenburg is both the glue that holds the entity together and the magnets pulling it apart. Born out of the fire and blood of the collapse of Russia, self-sufficient villages organized together in a loose confederation, called the Workers' Council. The Soviet Union, an authoritarian socialist state, gave way to the Anarcho-Syndicalist teachings of Orenburg. The city of Orenburg itself has served as the economic, political, and cultural center of the proto-state, and it is where the Council meets.\n\nFrom a first glance, the Council is a utopian socialist ideal, the culmination of hundreds of years of theory cultivated by socialists throughout history. But upon any inspection, the rotting foundation of the Workers' Council is exposed.\n\nCrippled by uncertainty, and the near-unanimous votes required for anything to be passed, Orenburg's Workers' Council seldom gets anything done. Even worse, the Council is rife with corruption and separatist tendencies that threaten to destroy what little unity the region has. Even with tentative reforms being pushed through, the lack of a cohesive executive power dictating Orenburg has sentenced it to the slow death of indecision."

 POLITICS_GEORGY_MALENKOV_DESC: "In the days of the old Soviet Union, there were great men. Lenin. Bukharin. There were brave men. Tukhachevsky. Zhukov. There were brilliant administrators like Rykov, and masters of intrigue like Yagoda.\n\nAnd then there was Malenkov.\n\nGeorgy Maximilianovich Malenkov was not offered a place in the West Russian Revolutionary Front, one the closest things existing to a "legitimate" successor state to the USSR. He was not strong or smart enough to establish his own fiefdom, either through violence or through intrigue. He had no allies and no friends. He was not even notable enough to find his way into the camp of some lunatic like Lysenko. Instead, Malenkov was forced to wander the wastes, searching for some humble town that would adopt him and his meager talents.\n\nHe found Orenburg, and there he swore that he would be disregarded and denied no more. The Soviet Union would rise again, and he would lead it.\n\nPerhaps the people of Orenburg were desperate for any sort of proper organization. Perhaps Malenkov really did have some talents, wilted though they were by the scorn of his peers. But somehow, he has found himself in charge of the city, and to the surprise of many of his detractors, he seems to be a man with a plan.\n\nFactories. Industry. Bigger. Stronger. Taller smokestacks. Larger quotas. Work them till they break, then break them till they work. Orenburg will rise by producing. It will win with lead, iron and steel, and it will win with industry. Never mind quality. Never mind durability. What matters is quantity. Let one bullet be faulty, or one gun misfire. There will always be more to replace it, men to wield them, and men to make them."

 POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_BURBA_DESC: "Ever since the founding of the Communes of Orenburg, the city has seemed to have two natures at war with itself. On one hand, its people are free. They live their own lives, and run their own little governments, free from the damaging influence of either the invisible hand of the market, or the iron hand of the state. But on the other hand, Orenburg is a state of chaos, and has been since its foundation. The Communes are filled with discord, petty squabbles and even violence. They are far richer than the surrounding lands, but seemingly far poorer than they should be. The men and women of the Communes are tough and resourceful, but the militia shrinks from even the most meager of challenges. Orenburg is great, yet it is small. It is powerful, yet it is weak. It is a symbol of the future of the Russian Wastes, and a reminder of their past.\n\nAleksander Adolfovich Burba rose to power promising a convergence of these dual natures. He promised a strong centralized state, but not the iron-fisted dictatorship of Malenkov. He promised to respect the independent desires and needs of the people of Orenburg, but not succumb to the communes' anarchic nature. And who better? Burba also seems to be made of contradictions. He is as rich a capitalist magnate as one can find among the warlords, yet he acts seemingly only out of concern for his fellow citizens. His first move in power was was to cement his control over Orenburg's institutions, yet his seconds are independent souls rather than toadies or henchmen.\n\nBurba is most of all a deal maker, and the choice he has offered the people of Orenburg is a tempting one indeed. Their city can be made great again, forged in the fires of industry into the shining jewel of the Urals, paid for with loyalty, obedience, and hard work. And is it such a terrible price to pay? Are full bellies and warm homes worth a voice in government? Are nights free from gunfire worth squares empty of demonstrators? Is a glorious future worth a stifling present? Only time will tell how far Burba's ambitions stretch, and how far the people of Orenburg are willing to go to fulfill them."

 ORE_category_centralization_gamble: "중앙집권화 활용"
 ORE_category_centralization_gamble_desc: "Orenburg's anarchist nature has slowly been undermined both in public discourse and in the previously frightfully inefficient council. This was done all in favour of providing the communes with the political benefits of centralization. Necessary reforms such as increasing conscription, changing economic policy and recruiting more militias still however take time and political effort to be agreed upon. Some more action oriented reformers however see opportunity in the current popularity of centralization to quickly push through unpopular but necessary reforms. This may be bad for unified decision making in the long run but could better prepare Orenburg for the challenges it has to face in the present."

The real reason is we like all of these things, too."

 ORE_the_fifty_seventh_congress_desc: "It is time again to call representatives of the communes to begin a great congress of the communes. A long, raucous democratic affair where every man is given a chance to discuss the state of the Orenburg commune. Problems both internal and external require the urgent attention of this 57th council. However, getting the assembly to agree unanimously on moving forward with various projects is a Sisyphean task..."

 ORE_the_matter_of_the_urals: "우랄의 문제"
 ORE_the_matter_of_the_urals_desc: "The most pressing topic on the Council's agenda is the ever worsening refugee crisis. The trickle of men and women seeking an oasis from the Russian anarchy has turned into a flood of wretched refugees trying to escape the depravity of the Black Mountain or the nazi bandits. This influx of newcomers is straining the economy of various communes in the region and has brought our sluggish political system to a standstill.\n\nTo the north, the Ural League is facing a similar refugee crisis, and has suggested we join forces to solve the refugee crisis, and perhaps even strike at the twin evils of the east. While many on the Council believe this to be the only real way to fix the crisis, a surprising level of opposition has coalesced against this idea. The Ural League's military hierarchy stands against every political principle of the Orenburg Commune, such as decentralization and bottom up leadership. Breaking the deadlock on this issue is crucial for our future defensive and foreign policy."

 ORE_the_matter_of_communal_agriculture: "집단 농업 문제"
 ORE_the_matter_of_communal_agriculture_desc: "Among the communes, only the city of Orenburg has something vaguely approximating a pre-industrial craftsmen economy. Every other commune is a loose association of local peasants working their fields in antediluvian fashion. As a result, crop yield is never very high even in good harvests. Keeping the city of Orenburg fed in a timely fashion generates much of the tension between the other communes and the city council even in the best of times. Now, the refugee crisis stresses the food stores to breaking point.\n\nComrade Malenkov and Burba of Orenburg city have for once found a topic where both agree: industrialization and organization of the various communes' agriculture must improve. Their proposal for mild reforms toward a joint agricultural policy has raised an uproar among the Council. However, others have shown interest in helping the peasants by sharing tools and knowledge. We find ourselves with the opportunity of building a coalition on the topic, or letting the reform idea slide."

 ORE_the_matter_of_communal_autonomy: "집단 자율성 문제"
 ORE_the_matter_of_communal_autonomy_desc: "Difficulties in discussing Orenburg's relationship with the Ural League and potential reforms to the Commune's agriculture originate from a single place: the centralization debate. Most of Orenburg's peasants do not feel any particular attachment to any regional identity; they work their land with their neighbors, and whenever a complicated problem arises a few local representative make the trek to Orenburg to complain and seek arbitration.\n\nThis extreme decentralization had to give way a little, explaining the creation of the Workers' Council. But few agree on what should the Council really be. Many, especially among those living in the city of Orenburg, wish to see the Council be a springboard for a more centralized government able to cut through endless negotiations and squabbles between the different communes, for the good of everyone in Orenburg. But many others argue that the Council doesn't have any authority beyond mediation and that true power has always resided in the communes.\n\nOn and on the centralization debate goes, as old arguments are brought on again and again. Meanwhile, the wolves outside Orenburg look on as our disunity threatens our land. The 57th Workers' Council is an occasion to try and sway the debate one way or the other."

 ORE_the_matter_of_trade_security: "무역 문제"
 ORE_the_matter_of_trade_security_desc: "Our land has been mercifully spared most of the devastation brought on by the Germans. Some left-over Soviet industry as well as still functional natural resource extraction facilities bring the communes what little non-agricultural wealth they possess. Over time some of the outer communes have even begun to trade with the outer world, bringing in rare tools, supplies, and even a little bit of industrial and agricultural knowhow. Orenburg city itself is visited by foreign caravans several times a year.\n\nHowever the direction that Orenburg should take with regard to trade is filled with controversy. Many decry the impact of traders on regional security. Once safe roads are now preyed on by bandits. Communal militias bear much of the costs of keeping the trade routes secure, and communes with little interest in exports still find themselves embroiled in low intensity skirmish with bandits. During the Ural League debate a young priest from Abramovka suggested that the refugee crisis was made worse by the rumor that Orenburg is an untouched oasis amidst the chaos of Russia and Kazakhstan. His words touched a nerve, and soon a working committee of isolationist communes began producing proposals to regulate trade with the outside world."

 ORE_the_communes_input: "코뮌의 압력"
 ORE_the_communes_input_desc: "The worker's council waxes and wanes as the days pass. Previously discussed topics recur again and again. Sasha, a peasant from Chernyy Otrog commune wishes to give his village's opinion on how the Ural League bastards that once bought him a cow for a fifth of its real worth. Another commune has helpfully crafted a new version of Malenkov and Burba's agricultural policy that they insist will obtain everyone's agreement.\n\nCommune by commune, village by village, family by family, all of Orenburg has the right to speak at the worker's council. Peasants plough old topics, revealing fresh disagreements. Communal representatives give their assessment of the day's proposals. Occasionally representatives from remote area stumble through the door, and other members explain to them in detail the discussions they missed.\n\nThe effort of worker's democracy continues late into every night, only stopping when the samovar runs out of water for tea."

 ORE_the_end_of_the_congress_desc: "The congress has at last reached the end of every member's patience. The representative have split off in several committees to write closing remarks, to be read during the final session.\n\nTired Orenburg city council members struggle to write their position paper. Treasures of rhetoric, energy and backroom deals have once again been spent by the centralization faction for little gain.\n\nOutside Orenburg, the wolves circle ever closer..."

 ORE_word_from_the_fringes: "Word from the Fringes"
 ORE_word_from_the_fringes_desc: "Not long after the end of the 57th worker congress, word has reached us of increased raids on isolated communes on the frontier. It is difficult to assess the extent of the danger from the conflicting stories told by refugees and the remnants of frontier militias. The rumor running through Orenburg tells of Dirlewanger's accursed brigade, having begun an invasion of the Ural league and the Orenburg commune.\n\nFiltering through the information and sending riders to the frontier communes will take time, but allow us to know what is truly going on."

 ORE_revive_the_levy_question: "Revive the Communal Levy Proposal?"
 ORE_revive_the_levy_question_desc: "Our worst fears about the military situation on the frontier have revealed themselves true. Dirlewanger's bandit army and Lysenko's NKVD remnants are preparing an invasion of the commune. The worker's council currently has no army to speak off and is unable to command the various communal militias to join up on the frontier. A controversial old idea has been brought back to life: levying troops from the various communes to form an army able to defend the region. The idea had never made it past the discussion stage in better times; let us hope that the communes will agree to collaborate in this time of crisis..."

 ORE_investigate_the_communal_militias: "Investigate the Communal Militias"
 ORE_investigate_the_communal_militias_desc: "Each village is defended by its men and women, arranged in irregular communal militias. Since each commune is free to tend to its safety independently, standards vary from village to village. If nothing else, assessing the constellation of militias will let us gauge how many men and women can be marshaled in time of needs. Knowing the current distribution of military equipment will also help us spread our meager ammunition and gun reserves to where it is most needed."

 ORE_raising_the_issue_once_more: "Raising the Issue Once More"
 ORE_raising_the_issue_once_more_desc: "With a better idea of the situation on the frontiers and of the state of military preparation across Orenburg, the worker's council has drafted a new military policy proposal. Reviving the levy idea has resulted in many a shouting match in the relatively tame worker's council between those that are for centralization or against it; now we must prepare for the coming wave of indignation when the idea is brought to every commune."

 ORE_reassure_the_communes: "Re-assure the Communes"
 ORE_reassure_the_communes_desc: "Thanks to the rough state of Orenburg's roads the avalanche of angry reactions has been slow to build up. But this morning a great commotion broke out on the edges of Orenburg city as angry communal representatives began marching into the city. The angry shouts of "traitors to the peasants" shouted at the guards brought on a counter march of refugees crying for the representatives to go argue with the raiders instead of hiding here in Orenburg city. The chaos continued spreading as neighboring villages began marching in militiamen to help restore order and ascertain that reactionaries had not taken power.\n\nIt is now a priority to send riders to as many communes as possible to stem the flow of angry representatives as well as calm things down in Orenburg city. Soothing the commune's nerves will avoid further damages to the worker's council legitimacy."

 ORE_the_fundamental_problems: "The Fundamental Problems"
 ORE_the_fundamental_problems_desc: "The fallout of the communal levy fiasco has roused many factions of the worker's council to intense debates. A strong majority of the worker's council have now been convinced beyond doubt that Orenburg's dysfunctional structure is killing it, and previously fringe ideas have begun to enter the worker council's mainstream. It is time for us to sway undecided members to the cause of reform and keep anti-centralization factions on the margin of the debate."

 ORE_we_need_a_plan: "We Need a Plan"
 ORE_we_need_a_plan_desc: "Our coalition building work has paid dividend. The worker's council now hums along as former rivals work together to hash out a new plan for the upcoming 58th worker's congress. Backroom deals, blackmail, bribery, heartfelt arguments; a wealth of political capital is being gathered to help push ambitious proposals forwards. Two men, Georgy Malenkov and Aleksander Burba have emerged as leaders in this newly energized reform movement. While both agree that economical and political reforms need to be completed for Orenburg to live, they and their supporters argue endlessly about the necessary scope of the reforms. Burba's radical proposal are believed to be too difficult to make work, while Malenkov's plan is accused of being a mess of halfway measures. Time being of the essence, a decision must be reached as to which path the reform faction desires to proceed with."

 ORE_arrange_the_program: "Arrange the Program"
 ORE_arrange_the_program_desc: "It is time again to call representatives of the communes to begin a great congress of the communes. A long, raucous democratic affair where every man is given a chance to discuss the state of the Orenburg commune. This time, however, things shall be different.\n\nThe soft and leaderless worker's council has been hardened by the military crisis and energized by a newfound sense of urgency. With the backing of increasingly desperate border communes, we have begun finalizing our preparation for the worker's congress. It will be a difficult fight, but for the good of the Orenburg commune it is one that we must win."

 ORE_the_fifty_eighth_congress: "제 58차 회의"
 ORE_the_fifty_eighth_congress_desc: "The time has come for the Fifty-Eighth Congress, a meeting which we hope shall lead to actual solutions for the issues that plague Orenburg. Much political capital has been spent, plans discussed, and coalitions formed in the Worker's Council.\n\nThe issues that shall be discussed are many - the decentralized militias, the lack of leadership on the Council, and the utter inability for Orenburg to perform any sort of decisive action. By the end of the Congress, we hope to be able to finally start addressing these issues."

 ORE_fight_the_controversy: "논란과의 사투"
 ORE_fight_the_controversy_desc: "One of the greatest controversies that has afflicted Orenburg is the issue of putting a chairperson at the head of the Worker's Council. To many in the communes, it harkens back to the days of Lenin putting down the regional soviets and the left-SRs - a dangerous and reactionary move that could lead to tyranny in Orenburg.\n\nHowever, we must be able to fight this controversy, and move past it. The Council needs a chair in this trying time, and any excessive powers that they are given are sure to have a check on them that can be used in a truly democratic manner."

 ORE_make_compromises: "타협"
 ORE_make_compromises_desc: "Currently, the Worker's Council can be separated into two: Those who wish to concentrate power into the government in the name of efficiency, and those who wish to distribute it across the Commune in the name of principle. Nowhere has their diverging opinions erupted more violently than in deciding upon the new Chairman's powers. Understandably, the firebrands for maintaining Orenburg's direct democracy to the letter look askance at any attempts to give the Chairman responsibilities beyond that of a figurehead, whereas its reformists long for a figure who can bring motion to their government past shaky, tenuous consensus.\n\nIn an ideal world either side will find all their objectives accomplished - the Chairman can be as weak or as strong as they wish. But in the war-torn remnants of Russia, where wolves gather upon hoarfrosted sheep? Compromise must suffice."

 ORE_propose_a_chairperson: "의장 제안"
 ORE_propose_a_chairperson_desc: "The time has come, to propose a chairperson for the Council. This is a drastic measure, but even if we fail in our task, there are alternatives. In addition to proposing a chairman, one of our allies has also put forth a proposal for an empowered council with a rotating chair, voted on each meeting. By putting our most extreme proposal first, even if it fails, we should be able to negotiate the Council down to choosing our more moderate proposal. The indecision and inanity ends today!"

 ORE_the_counter_proposal: "반대 제안"
 ORE_the_counter_proposal_desc: "The council has voted down our proposal, but accepted our more discrete secondary proposal. The Council shall having a rotating chairperson with the power to end discussion on a topic, so long as this measure is not cancelled by a 50% vote in the Council. Additionally, the new position will have the power to prioritize measures. This should, hopefully, open up a window where we can propose measures that would otherwise be buried in less important issues, lost, or otherwise require an impractical amount of political capital to actually bring to the floor."

Malenkov has promised stability and order above all, within the framework of Orenburg's libertine tradition, of course. Already, his faction is preparing numerous emergency measures to deal with the crisis at hand.\n\nWhile some call Malenkov a tyrant-in-waiting, he has taken numerous measures to attempt to prove to the Council that he has no grand ambitions towards seizing power or other such betrayals of Orenburg. After all, he says, such things would be counter-revolutionary, and would only be justified in the time of greatest need..."

Burba has been accused of radicalism in the past, but his well-spoken manners and painstakiningly organized plans have won over many in the Council to his side. He promises a re-organization of the economy over all, industrialization, and a more scientific and orderly means of organizing life in Orenburg.\n\nBurba has already proven his worth to Orenburg by establishing several industrial committees and schools in the past, and many on the Council are excited and pleased to see his goal of turning Orenburg into a true sparkling jewel of Russia be realized."

Many are dissapointed in the inability to push through a really strong central executive.\n\nThankfully the new chairman has managed to squelch dissent. In a rousing speech, the council's members were reminded of the unprecendented opportuntiy to reform, strenghten and organize Orenburg. We can now assign people to various committees and get the projects started."

 ORE_institute_common_judicial_guidelines_desc: ""Each commune is free to make its own justice" has always been how things are done. In practice, the few provincial lawyers left in Orenburg after the war were unable to prevent the rise of lynch mob and show trials across the vast range of communes. Even in Orenburg city crowds of people are able to sway the proceedings of the courts.\n\nThe old way of doing things, with laws imposed by a central clique of lawyers, will never be accepted again in Orenburg. But a new justice, built from the grounds up on the rights of every citizen can be established. Once the workers of a commune have built up the laws with the help of worker city's legal advisors, they shall feel compelled to let justice run its course."

Helping mediating feuds between local families to prevent bad blood amongst the jurors will also help in this endeavour, as well as gathering mobs to shout down anyone that opposes this reform."

 ORE_discuss_the_unequal_investments: "Discuss the Unequal Investments"
 ORE_discuss_the_unequal_investments_desc: "One of the causes of the Orenburg Commune's problem with centralization is the sheer weight of Orenburg city in regional affairs. While most of the communes operate on a primeval agrarian economy, Orenburg city has a roughly functioning money economy where goods are crafted and traded.\n\nThis imbalance in the resources has led to an imbalance in investments. Orenburg city foots much of the bill for regional investments, and this has generated plenty of distrust between city dwellers and rural communes. Any attempt at investment in a commune's territory is seen as a preliminary step to Orenburgian take over of the area. Meanwhile, requests of emergency investments by communes are routinely turned down by stingy Orenburg merchants unwilling to help the uncooperative communes.\n\nConvincing the communes to be equal partner in investments is the first step in addressing this imbalance. No matter how poor, the communes must contribute to the common cause. In return they shall access a greater pool of potential investment money. From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs."

Many of the smaller communes have only a few rubles worth of resources to offer us, and do not understand how such limited resources could help the greater good. A few pilot development projects entirely funded through local efforts should help demonstrate to skeptics that many hands make light load.\n\nNo matter the resistance, we must make everyone understand that the era of freeloading is over."

However, the practice of variable communal representations has contributed much to the chaos present in worker's congresses. Some communes send too few men for their population size, some communes send too many. in the winter when the fields are dormant communal representatives tend to swarm into Orenburg city, whereas in the summer many delegations are absent.\n\nFrom now on, every commune will have a fixed amount of delegates depending on their population size.

However, the practice of arriving late in the worker's congress causes endless repetitions of already discussed topics, and has an annoying tendency to bring back to the front old debates.\n\nFrom now on, every congress will be scheduled long in advance, and delegates that are late will lose their participation rights in the congress.

Hardest hit by the refugee crisis and increase in raids, the communes on the frontier have been amongst the most loyal allies of the worker's council reform faction, yet have received no help up to now.

However much remains to be done to determine the level of responsibility born by individual communes. Number of soldiers, levels of investments, quantity of resources, each village and city's contributions must be appraised and negotiated.

Left to make our own decisions by the commune, we have been mostly been free to design the structure of Orenburg's army as we see fit. Chief amongst them is the question of finding men to lead it. By tapping veterans of the great war against the Germans, and a few recent arrivals from the the Ural league and the WRRF we have drafted a structure to integrate communal militias under a clear order of command. The few experimented veterans will be used to create a high command whose supreme authority rests on the worker's council."

However, groups of peasants with a few hours of rifle shooting does not an army make. With the powers granted to the worker's council we are finally free to invite Ural League officers to improve our men's training. The League has suggested to organise a number of regional military camps, easily reachable in a day or two of travelling by nearby communes.

With the early stages of our common investment policy in effect, money and resources are pouring in to revive old factories and workshops to produce guns. Many regional militia associations have pooled up their resources to finance their own gun works in the capital, and now convoys of guns and ammunitions are streaming out of Orenburg's shops toward the frontlines. With just a little push, we could accelerate this weapon boom and help arm our men."

While we must continue to respect the principle of bottom up worker's organization, a great deal of locally elected officers are chosen by popularity instead of merits.

Orenburg faces the worst of Germany's worst, battle-hardened through years of battle across Russia. If the rumors of Dirlewanger's brigade being given state of the art weapons by the mad scientists of Magnitogorsk are true, then all of Orenburg is in great danger. Relying on the Ural League too much for help is a surefire way to lose the independent worker's democracy that every citizen of Orenburg is entitled to. Under Malenkov's strong direction, an empowered worker's council would be able to forge the communes into a stronger worker's state, able to defend our land..."

It pains Comrade Malenkov deeply to weaken the worker's democracy that sees the strength and dignity of every person in Orenburg. The worker's council and its chairman wish not to replace this honorable tradition, but instead shield it from this period of crisis and instability. In a new speech spread to every commune, the Chairman suggests a temporary state of emergency, lasting only until the defeat of the German menace. While many communes are projected to oppose this unprecedented assault on worker's rights, Comrade Malenkov's faction is very popular amongst the refugees of Orenburg city and in the communes of the eastern frontier. Building on this base of supporters, we shall convince Orenburg of the need for this state of emergency."

 ORE_reorganize_the_workers_council_desc: "The Workers' Council current organization, created for the peacetime workers' democracy is ill suited to the unprecedented level of power entrusted to the Council and its Chairman. By reorganizing the Workers' Council around its central executive and establishing a clear chain of command, the whole organization can be made into a fine-tuned political machine apt to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. While some worry about the transformation of the Workers' Council into a top down structure, Chairman Malenkov insists this is the best way to prepare for the path ahead."

 ORE_reorganize_orenburgs_guard_desc: "The Orenburg Guard had always been a militia amongst others. A large militia, befitting its defense of the largest commune of the region, but a militia nonetheless. By reforming its structure along the lines of a more traditional military we can improve the battle effectiveness of our largest contingent of men at arms, and make it easier to deploy it to the front when the time comes. In addition, introduction of officers to the traditionally equalitarian militia formations will help the Council and its chairman keep control of the soldiers and prevent anyone from usurping the Guard's ability to defend workers' democracy."

 ORE_secure_the_outer_communes_desc: "While the worker's council has authority on a large region in theory, in practice the further one goes from Orenburg city the less attachment the local communes feel. The core of the opposition to Chairman's Malenkov new reforms came from the communes in the west and north. Shielded by the Ural League from bandits, the local leaders do not feel any urgency to unite against the German barbarians in the east.\n\nBy sending members of the Orenburg guard into these misguided areas for joint militia training exercise, we hope to reassure all of our citizens that in these troubled times the council protects all of our citizen equally."

Either we do it, or they will crush us."\n\nSo begins the upcoming speech of Chairman Malenkov. An ambitious industrialization program is to be announced in Orenburg city. Every commune will be encouraged to reach its true industrial potential through a centrally planned economic plan. While some in Orenburg such as the failed reformer Aleksander Burba caution the Council that the timeline is too aggressive and the current agricultural economy too fragile to handle perturbations, Chairman Malenkov has brushed all concerns aside. Fire and steel shall transform our workers' lives!"

 ORE_heavy_industrial_commissariat_desc: "Mostly spared from the inane Luftwaffe bombing and having avoided warfare, it is a travesty that Orenburg has not yet become a hub of heavy industries. Chairman Malenkov plans to spin off the current industrial subcommittee into an independent government organ, the Commissariat of Heavy Industry, or Komtyazhprom. The idea of a structure outside of the worker's council being responsible for an entire sector of Chairman's Malenkov ambitious reforms is a new development in Orenburg's politics, but the council has been reassured that the Chairman and his closest associate will constantly monitor the commissariat's activities and ensure that our community's health and prosperity remains the principal concern of every new project."

 ORE_plowshares_into_swords: "Plowshares Into Swords"
 ORE_plowshares_into_swords_desc: "Our extant industrial base is mostly concerned with the production of agricultural equipment, leaving our supplies of weapons and ammunitions dangerously low. One of Komtyazhprom's first proposals is to convert our civilian industry to military purpose. The council's reaction to this idea has not been warm, as many representatives from the villages stress that any degradation of our agricultural production is likely to cause famine across the region. The industrial commissariat's experts have replied with arguments of their own. They argue that the thing holding back our peasantry at the moment is not lack of tool, but rather poor knowledge of modern agricultural technique and inefficiency in getting food to regions with production deficits. Besides, once our new factories begin their work whatever temporary decline in agricultural equipment production will be insignificant compared to the output of our new tool factories!"

 ORE_mechanize_the_peasantry_desc: "Developing an expertise in making tractors is one of the first objective of Chairman Malenkov's industrialization. Our peasants still labor using animals of burden to tend to their land. By giving every commune its own tractor, the peasant's task will be made a thousand times simpler! This will have the pleasant side effect of freeing up many peasants to join in our new industrial works as well as letting us obtain new horses for governmental use. Warnings that the population is ill trained to make use of mechanized equipment or that the supply of petrol to distant commune is limited are simply counter-revolutionary drivel attempting to create doubt about the capacity of the Orenburgian peasant to adapt to the future."

 ORE_into_the_factories_desc: "Already the manpower coming from Orenburg city's refugee population has dried up as our expanded Orenburg Guard and new industries have provided work for our citizens. To meet our projected manpower needs newly mechanized agrarian communes have sent us the peasants freed from farm work. The resettling of peasants away from their isolated communes and into our regional industrial centers and into Orenburg itself will help strengthen the bond between the citizen of our great nation and break the dogma of communal thinking. Of course, not all peasants are eager to abandon their villages to find new types of work, so our benevolent government must at time remind citizens of the incredible chance we have given them."

Tragically, it could never make any of its project work, hamstrung as it was by its equalitarian structure and complete reliance on negotiated compromise. Even as the Worker Council complained of the worker's congress endless arguments and ever circular discussions, the council found itself replicating in miniature the congress's dysfunction. Chairman Malenkov's imposition of a hierarchy at the start of his mandate has helped thing, but the great military emergency in the east allows no further delays. By reminding Malenkov loyalists on the council the potential of helping him stabilize the political structure and by making use of those from Dirlewanger threatened areas on the council, we can ascertain once and for all the power and legitimacy of the Chairman in his great crusade to save Orenburg from its enemies."

Misgivings about industrial policy? Honest desire to simply be left alone in this darkest hour? The secessionists can give all the reasons they want. Chairman Malenkov's love and forgiveness extends to all in Orenburg. Representative on missions to these communes, escorted by our military, will ascertain the true reason for these requests to leave our government. No doubt these were misunderstanding brought on by poor communication. The men of our Worker's Army will make sure of this."

 ORE_cut_down_the_council_desc: "Every worker of Orenburg deserves the undivided attention of the Worker's Council and its benevolent Chairman. However, the current mass of members in the Worker's Council is simply too unwieldy, especially in these difficult times. Henceforth all commune shall be limited to a single representative on the Worker's Council. To maintain the council's performances in this era of emergency, the first set of representatives will be chosen by Chairman Malenkov to ensure a team able to get along well with the people's Chairman. This emergency measure shall of course be repealed one the crisis is past."

Worker's democracy perfected in a new system where every commune has its representative, and where Chairman Malenkov is merely first amongst equals on the Council. Every month new committees are drafted to work on a variety of topic, their ideas and suggestions analysed by a cadre of men of the Council elected by their peers. We must be grateful that Chairman Malenkov's workaholic tendencies have led to his regular reelection to the supervision council, as his long nights of work have led to him being knowledgeable about the council's every project."

 ORE_the_necessity_of_military_reorganization_desc: "If we're to weather the coming storm, we must continue reorganizing our forces into a single centralized military. Our earlier work in reshaping the Orenburg Guard has provided us an efficient template to apply to follow. Through a process of negotiation with our allies on the eastern border, then with communes close to Orenburg, a bigger and bigger number of militias have entered a set of new "local strategic command" that unite several militias into an integrated command structure headed by the Worker's Council. As this reorganization spread west, more and more militia units are being integrated into our centralized army as local leaders fear being stuck outside of the security system."

With this we can finally start erasing irrelevant communal ties and replace them with a regional identity and a strong esprit-de-corp. Groups of soldier that have not yet truly internalized the greatness of the New Worker's council will be placed closest to the frontier with Dirlewanger's Brigade to teach them valuable lessons about the protection of the weak and innocent. Units with a great level of political understanding shall in turn be stationed in the west to help the local's growth. And throughout Orenburg, a clear chain of command now exists, leading to the worker's council and its Chairman."

 ORE_standardize_their_weaponry: "Standardize Their Weaponry"
 ORE_standardize_their_weaponry_desc: "The centralization of the communal guards has rewarded us with a treasure trove of weapons as men simply brought into the new army their old weapons. Unfortunately this new arsenal is ill suited to anything other than the establishment of a military history museum. Modern shooters from Zlatoust, Soviet gear stamped with the Western Russian Revolutionary Front's numbers, battered Arisaka rifle from the Co-Prosperity Sphere, handmade stuff from the Kazakh plains... The diversity of equipment makes it difficult to furnish our men with ammunition, and poor weapon reliability significantly degrades the fighting potential of our new army.\n\nStandardizing everyone to Soviet gear and equipping all of our soldiers with the same type of weapons is a top priority of our fledling industry. Everything that cannot be manufactured simply will have to be imported for the time being as we begin to build caches of equipment for our various regiments."

Our system of representative to the regions is slowly being turned into a permanent part of our army: the commissar units. Soldiers and officers with a great understanding of the Worker Council's mission will be deployed across our army and serve as the foundation upon which our men shall fight. The military emergency allows the Council to transfer extraordinary powers of military justice and prosecution to our political commissars, allowing them to try for treason units accused of dereliction of duty."

From the beginning our new army has been structured so that higher rungs of the officer ladder are staffed by those that are loyal to the Chairman and his Council.

Flyers, radio transmissions, pamphlets, speeches by priests and village chiefs, children's lullabies... As long as the message gets across the Chairman is satisfied. This also employs artistic types that might otherwise sit around in teahouses and drum up complaints against our glorious government.\n\n"Workers! Join the People's Guards to keep Orenburg safe!

Some had hoped that such men could be reformed, but it seems that they were naive. Now these dregs have coalesced into a primitive feudal system, where a caste of brutes opress the workers.\n\nWhat does the League offer? Restoration of the old order, of cold laws ran by colder men. Is their offer not as bad as the German's offer? One group offers a few days of pain and barbarism, followed by death for our thousands of citizens. The other presents a millennia of slavery and the death of untold millions to tyranny. No, comrades, Orenburg must reject the League's proposal. With them we may live long enough to become slaves; without them we have a chance at true safety and freedom!""

With everyone working around the clock to reform our army and industry, few have had time recently to ponder how the worker's paradise came to be. Malenkov had been proposed as chairman, but by whom?\n\nThe memories of earlier reformers are slowly fading away. In time, no one will remember the countless members of the old Worker's Council that had worked tirelessly to bring about reform. A thousand night of sleep lost to negotiations; gallons of ink used in writing proposals and counter-proposals; countless ambitious men eaten and spat out by the perpetual stagnation of the Worker's Congress. All their sacrifices have not been in vain, absorbed as they were in the single figure of Chairman Malenkov. His ascension has brought industrial reform and social progress. Our successes can be attributed to his tireless efforts, while Orenburg's failure come from men incapable of correctly following the Chairman's audacious vision. As the stature of the Chairman grows, so does his power and influence allowing us to move ever closer to the promised bright future."

A twisted cynic would look at the emaciated faces, eaten by famine and ravaged by fatigue and doubt the worker's paradise that Chairman Malenkov wishes to create. But a realist like our dear Chairman would simply see that the childrens of Orenburg, dizzy from success, are simply overwhelmed by the changes that the Worker's Republic have brought. On waxen wings they flew too close to the sun, and their hard work to build the promised land has simply taxed their bodies too much.\n\nChairman Malenkov understands. In his love for his children, he has already relaxed the production targets. The worker's paradise shall be built for his children, and for his children's childrens."

 ORE_balancing_the_council_desc: "The first move of Chairman Burba following his election are no mystery to the worker's council. In his days as a regular member of the reform faction Aleksander Burba always stressed the inability of the worker's council to enact the reforms needed to save Orenburg. Even with an hypothetical universal approval issued by the communes, the Worker's Council is too large to allow for internal consensus on what to do with their power.\n\nThe new chairman's demands for provisions that allow him to re-organize the economy free from the council's approvals have been met with grinding teeth. Many of those that have backed his candidacy had expected Burba to walk back from his outrageous demands and reward his coalition members accordingly, but on this point the Chairman has remained stubborn. The council's opinion on the economy will be taken into account, but the final decision power will be granted to its chief executive."

 ORE_an_orenburgian_renaissance_desc: "Chairman Burba is a man with a plan. Befitting his background as a scientist and industrial engineer, he has slowly crafted a project for industrial reforms over the year with the help of Orenburg's traders, artisans and politicians. With the breathing space given to him by the communes and the council, he has the chance of a lifetime to implement his proposal. Several of Orenburg's workshops have been targeted for expansion and mechanization, making use of the city's base of skilled workers to begin high quality industries. Particularly important are the sectors of the city's economy that produce the most desirable exports. By tapping into this lucrative vein, the Chairman hopes to strengthen the region's traders and generate capital to finance other projects that have yet to turn in a revenue.\n\nAll these projects require raw natural resources, and that is the are where the Chairman is most enthusiast to test his ideas. A metallurgist by formation, Chairman Burba desires to integrate new ideas in smelting plants to increase output and lower production costs for metal."

Several communes wish to strengthen their militias, yet lack the weapons to equip their men. Getting every willing soldier a weapon is the simplest problem to fix.\n\nMore difficult to tackle is the lack of structural standards across the region's militias. Some villages operate on a rotating draft basis, where every man must serve at least once a year. Others have a semi-permanent category of men dedicated to militia duty, supplied and nourished by the entire commune. Spreading an uniform militia structure will be difficult even amongst the communes that supported Chairman Burba's election enthusiastically.\n\nHelping us in this matter is a new committee of veteran militia officers from across Orenburg. Their advice will help us find the most pressing things to change, and the commune militias will hopefully find it easier to accept their new instructions from military men of the same village."

Training must go beyond "shooting my rifle a few times a month at the range with the lads", as one of our militiamen put it.\n\nThere is no shame in stealing from the best, and the Ural League have become experts in turning soft village militias into proper military groups. Peasants generally have little free time to use on militia training, so the League's intense exercises aim to teach small unit tactics, fortification work and the importance of maintaining morale and the chain of command. Communal militias with a higher number of full time men such as the Orenburg Guard have been given a simplified version of the Ural League's full program to help correct any deficiency in their current training."

Old Soviet guns, black market Arisaka rifle coming from the far east, hand made pistols from the Kazakh plains, some ancestral black powder hunting guns...\n\nPlanned military exercises and deployment of militias on the frontier would require us to establish supply lines for a variety of types of ammunition and guns.\n\nOnce units lacking equipment have received their new guns, we can begin to focus on outfitting every militia with standardized weapons. This shall greatly simplify future operations."

This does not mean that we cannot improve on their initial suggestions, however.\n\nReports coming in from newly appointed militia officers detail a variety of issues with the Ural League's programs. Communes located deep in the Orenburg interior often lack the military expertise found in bandit exposed Ural villages, and so training is progressing more slowly in these areas. On the frontier, the battle-hardened local militias have performed better at the new training methods than their brothers in the interior. However, they have expressed a degree of concern that many of the Ural League's tactics are better suited to the hills and mountains of the Urals than to the plains of our periphery.\n\nOur Veteran's Committee has been reading feedback from these various militias and is currently adapting the League's suggestions to our situation."

All this shall be for naught, however, if bandits infiltrate the porous frontiers and roam in the interior, ambushing supply convoys and playing havoc with our communications. for the time being these roaming packs of thugs appear to be the usual lowlifes infesting the Russian Anarchy, but many of our officers fear that Dirlewanger's men will be able to send scouts behind our lines through the same pathways.\n\nThe reorganized militias in the eastern sector are being rotated in and out of the frontier for field exercises and our few groups of permanent soldiers have begun patrolling the roads and helping villagers hunt down any bandit group. Increasing our control of the frontier will also reassure local communes and allow us to tap into the area's resources."

 ORE_deregionalization_desc: "As our ties with various militias deepen previously unthinkable integration is becoming a distinct possibility. Today Chairman Burba proposes that the advisory Veteran's Committee be used to form the high command of a new "Army of Orenburg and Associated Communes". A simple unified command structure will make deployment of militias outside of their commune much simpler than the current negotiated system. The deregionalization process will take time to implement in full. To start with, the Orenburg Guard and the militias with whom we've built the deepest trust will join in. Adhesion to a modern military capable of supplying and defending all of its member commune will be very enticing, and in time will let us convince all of our commune to join."

In practice however the Worker's Council has never been able to make use of this vast expanse. Any attempt to develop the resources of a particular area was vetoed by communes that wouldn't gain anything in return. Most communes have jealously guarded any knowledge of their land's wealth and potential to prevent encroachment by neighboring commune or by Orenburg city itself.\n\nChairman Burba has announced the establishment of a planning commission for the economy, and declared that its first task shall be a great audit of every resources Orenburg possesses. Minerals, oil, arable land, abandoned industrial sites, trade routes...This detailed economic information is crucial to unlocking Orenburg's potential. By pairing up members of the planning commission with representative of the communes being audited the Chairman seeks to spread the message that granting the Worker's Council information about an area will result in investment and development of the commune's fortune."

Hence Chairman Burba's decision to grant the independent Planning Commission full control of the economy.\n\nThis has been greatly unpopular on the Council as many accuse Chairman Burba of betraying the worker's democracy by putting in place unaccountable elites.\n\nInstead of trying to crush opposition, the Chairman has begun soothing the Council's ego and winning over to the idea. The Planning Commission's power is entirely derived from the Chairman, himself chosen by the Council. The point is that the members of the Planning Commision do not wield political power. This lets them use their expertise in economical matter without any of the political worries a Councilman might face. The commissioners will also be free from the baggage and bad blood that often ends up killing great ideas in the Worker's Council."

Without eyes on the ground and honest feedback by the people directly involved in our reform projects we risk becoming cruel, complacent and worst of all, inefficient. The communal representatives bring us a wealth of differing experiences and priorities. This human capital must be nurtured and our strong democratic traditions can be used to find talented men and women to help our industrialization.

We can lower employee turnover by ensuring that there are enough men recruited. Supply problems can be solved by building new factories only when a surplus of input material exists to be transformed.

By combing through Orenburg city's archives and by looking for the surviving surveyors across the region, this bright young man has amassed a great quantity of information on our underground wealth.

To be blunt, it's a mess.\n\nZhdanovka commune's best land is currently unused by the villagers since they've been unable to figure out who owns it. Determined peasants in Kulagino commune are trying to stop us from building a factory close to the village to preserve the view from their farm. One of our largest potential oil field rests under a cow pasture outside Poltavka that local animals don't even particularly like.\n\nChairman Burba is a patient man, and scores of peasants have ended up in his office to protest some land appropriation or another.

Previously shuttered as Orenburg's post war economy had no use for such massive factories, the Soviet industrial works of Orenburg city remained dormant as small artisanal workshops sprang in their shadows. Now the aggregate demand for industrial good is once again reaching the point where these steel behemoths are needed.

 ORE_a_more_professional_council_desc: "There are currently no qualifications for councilorship beyond being elected by a commune. This popularity-based approach is certainly democratic, but it has ironically almost brought our worker's democracy to an early demise: Men with no diplomatic ability and with few worthwhile ideas for their constituents' future populate the Council at present, hindering any attempt to improve standards of life across the Commune. Meanwhile, capable men and women languish in farms and menial city jobs, their potential wasted simply because they lack the charisma to succeed in an election.\n\nChairman Burba has caught attention by reviewing every councilor's performance up until his accession - their policies, their achievements, their expenditures.

What is the political process if not a method to transform inputs into outputs as efficiently as possible? In this case, the people's will and ideas are simply refined into good changes for our society.\n\nWith the right approach, old problems can become new opportunities as we churn through ideas to expand our reform of the political sphere.

Veterans of each militias befriended one another on our Veteran's Committee, and spread this newfound trust and respect to their home. The sons of distant villages learned how to fight together.

The League's men have explained the Worker Council that by increasing the number of factories in the area will in turn generate new industrial tools and workers that the League could tap into if needed.

One of our scouts has come before the Workers' Council to report that Dirlewanger's raiders have been spotted advancing rapidly upon one of the communes just within our borders, clearly planning to attack. The raiders are well equipped, experienced and are likely more than a match for the communes militia. So now we face the choice we always hate making. If we hurry and appeal to other frustrated communes in the area, we should be able to muster a force capable of beating back the raiders, making clear to those savages we will not simply stand by and let them abuse our people now or ever.

 ORE.4.t: "The Minutes of the Fifty-Seventh Congress"
 ORE.4.d: "The incessant mumbling and lack of cohesion in the Council of the anarchic communes was a perfect microcosm of the issues that plagued the communities of Orenburg. A well-spoken representative from Orenburg itself rose to give his argument for increased political centralization, a common issue to be raised and debated. He began with his observations on the problems created by the Council not supporting at least some standardization in trade policies and on military training. The ringing insults rained down harshly from all sides, yet the gifted orator continued unabashed, passionately stating how these necessary measures could greatly improve the lives and security of the communes. The slight loss of freedom would far be overcompensated by the proposal's economic and military benefits. The subsequent vote was inconclusive, as expected.\n\nNext, a proud yet simple farmer stood to make his case for increased private ownership; his personal farm was providing only enough for him and his family. Why should they suffer in order to feed people they would never even meet? The subsequent vote was inconclusive, as expected.\n\nA meek, nervous woman rose next, her voice almost inaudible over the din of conversations. She called briefly for unity and security before falling silent. A few representatives finished their murmurs when they saw the hollow stare that she was observing them with. What followed was a story of horror and tragedy, one that drew gasps and pained, averted gazes from many of those present. A raid, this one particularly brutal with disturbing significance. A band of rugged men in black uniforms speaking the language of the accursed invaders. Her voice gave out halfway through the story but enough had been heard for her cause to be debated.\n\nThe subsequent vote was inconclusive, as expected."

While at first the extra hands for labor were welcomed, the Workers' Council is becoming gradually more concerned as Orenburg city and the surrounding villages near their capacity.\n\nA number of propositions have been made for dealing with the problem. The more isolationist amongst the Council suggest that the refugees should simply be turned away, at the muzzle of militiamen's rifles if necessary. Some compassionate voices have insisted that the commune should instead open its doors and let them in, and work to accommodate the growing population with whatever developments the disorganized 'government' can make. A third faction suggests a compromise, where those refugees who can demonstrate useful skills should be allowed to stay while others are pointed onwards to other territories.\n\nUltimately, a decision must be made, and quickly."

It's no secret that our economic situation is, well, less than satisfactory! However, the desired continuation of the anarchic status-quo of government policy has resulted in even minor proposals being met with significant pushback by the deeply conservative peasantry.\n\nComrade Malenkov's proposal itself is indeed quite intriguing, as it's been speculated as to how he hopes to achieve such extravagant ideas. Malenkov's proposal is one of large industrialization, seemingly regardless of the wishes of the individual communes, which has already resulted in significant pushback from a large segment of the communal delegations. Comrade Malenkov argues that, by pursuing a policy of industrialization, agricultural yields will drastically increase, thereby providing sustainable nourishment for the growing population.\n\nYet, Malenkov's proposal has further inflamed the already present tensions within our 'nation', and as debates reach a new level of aggressiveness and passion, some have begun to wonder whether Orenburg will survive..."

Despite the implementation of such progressive utopian concepts, our revolutionary political experiment has backfired immensely, as our "nation" is seemingly an impoverished dystopian hellscape. Furthermore, the failure of the independent farming communes to resolve the significant issues brought about by the ongoing refugee crisis have further cast doubt upon Orenburg's governmental structure, resulting in an increased loathe for the status-quo of anarchism.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Workers' Council of Orenburg have been in deliberation over proposed measures of centralization, which has undoubtedly inflamed tensions between the various political factions of the "state". Chief among the proponents of centralization is Comrade Malenkov, who has successfully captivated a significant portion of the concerned Orenburg citizenry, arguing that Anarchism must be abandoned and that a programme of forced industrialization must be enacted to ensure Orenburg's continued survival. Whilst Malenkov's opponents, led by local industrial magnate Aleksander Burba, has put forth a convincing argument in supposed favor of increased democratization of the farming communes, and the establishment of a quasi-technocratic system of "governance" dominated fellow industrialists, scientists and engineers which would ultimately result in the betterment of the "nation".\n\nRegardless of the alarming and somewhat worrisome nature of the debates, the Orenburg Workers' Council has once again proven itself to be an ineffective and incompetent "governing body". As of recent, the debate rages on within the Workers' Council, becoming bogged down in an everlasting stream of bickering and bureaucracy. However, many representatives within the Council have become tired of Malenkov and Burba's seemingly meaningless squabbling, therefore the Council authority has voted in favour of holding a vote on the matter of centralization, all in an attempt to calm the situation and reach a consensus on the issue at hand..."

 ORE.7.c: "Perhaps we're in need for a change."

 ORE.8.t: "Trade Security"
 ORE.8.d: "Amongst the few actually interesting issues that the Council discussed this particular day, was the matter of trading with neighboring states. So far, the relative wealth of the Orenburg communes have stayed within their borders, the fear of outside threats enough to deter them from risking much trade. Ironically, this paranoia has only hampered attempts to normalize relations with Orenburg's neighbors, although they had not ever made much of an effort so far anyway. Since this has been nothing but a strain for us, the idea of perhaps opening the communes up to trade with the surrounding area has become increasingly popular, popular enough to merit substantial debate in the Council. After intense discussion, the Council members formed into two "camps" of sorts. The first were in favour of opening Orenburg up to trade with carefully selected territories and states. This also would help to establish a reputation for Orenburg, they argued. The other group, was utterly opposed to this idea and wished to continue the isolationist approach and pointed out that with bandits on every road, there would be no point in trading. After an interruption involving a dispute between a pig-farmer and a horse-breeder, which was followed by a break for a particularly late supper, the vote was finally held at a disagreeably late hour..."
 ORE.8.a: "We shall keep ourselves secret and safe."
 ORE.8.b: "There is no need for this."

 ORE.9.t: "A Debate on Infrastructure"
 ORE.9.d: "The leader of the meeting looked down at the agenda with dread. Every single proposal so far had been challenged and debated for at least an hour, even minor ones that were completely agreeable. He took a deep breath. Maybe, just maybe, this one would be quick. "Next on the agenda is a proposal to fund road building projects using recently acquired taxes."\n\nIn mere seconds, six people from different parts of the room stood up at once, and the man presiding over the meeting died inside. The first to stand up called out, "We of the communes object to this proposal!" In a voice that showed more tiredness than an elder of a thousand years, the meeting leader said "Very well, you have the floor." The villager launched into a seemingly endless rant about overreach and fascism and tyranny. These roads were a means to steal from the worker, they were Orenburg robbing the village communes to improve the city, so on and so forth for hours. If these roads were all they were made out to be, they would amount to nothing less than a fascist government being elected to Orenburg. This ended any progress that was being made for the day, and the road project was trapped in debate hell."
 ORE.9.a: "We can have our say every once in a while."
 ORE.9.b: "Can we have one thing that everyone agrees on?"

 ORE.10.t: "Burba Inaugurated as Chairman!"
 ORE.10.d: "All across our proud 'nation', the workers of Orenburg have erupted into tremendous and passionate celebration of the forthcoming revitalization of the dreary communal paradise. Today, reformist politician Aleksander Burba was officially inaugurated as the Chairman of the Workers' Council of Orenburg.\n\nA former local industrial magnate, Chairman Burba has received wide support from a variety of different factions within Orenburg. Following his arrival in the region, he first came to prominence after his successful reconstruction efforts on Orenburg itself, resulting in the city being christened as the 'Venice of West Russia'. In his inaugural address to the Council, Chairman Burba announced he will invest increasingly large sums of capital into infrastructure projects, in order to improve the disastrous medieval living conditions in the countryside. Furthermore, Chairman Burba's announced an ambitious set of reforms to ensure consistent democratic and legal principles across the various farming communes. It remains to be seen, however, if his attempt at standardization and reform will succeed...\n\nRegardless of how Chairman Burba is viewed, be it in positive or negative regard, near all of the citizenry and local authorities have concluded that under Chairman Burba, some ounce of reform will be surely achieved by his clique. "
 ORE.10.a: "Let us pray Chairman Burba brings Orenburg peace and prosperity."

 ORE.11.t: "The Guests' Proposals"
 ORE.11.d: "In recent weeks, a sect of dissatisfied communal representatives have been ferociously protesting against the Workers' Council, demanding further allocation of speaking time for guest speakers from the communes. Although it was initially believed the protests of the various delegations would cease in a short period of time, the increasingly passionate displays of resistance against the Workers' Council have in recent days intensified. As a result of this, the Council 'elite' have been summoned to discuss a possible solution, in an attempt to rectify the situation."
 ORE.11.a: "We must uphold unity."
 ORE.11.b: "No, we shan't be bullied into submission!"

 ORE.12.t: "Status of the Militias"
 ORE.12.d: "A recurring controversy amongst the Orenburg City Council is the level of preparation of the region's security forces. The current patchwork of militias barely maintains the safety of individual commune. An increase in banditry across the region and heightened pressure on the eastern and southern communes by German and Kazakh bandits have led the Workers' Council to try to standardize and improve the quality of communal militias.\n\nThis activity has not gone unnoticed by the communes, with frequent grumbling about nosy Orenburg city officials observing militia training and attempting to convince militia officers to improve their men's training. Now, frustration as reached a boiling point as a formal complaint written by several village chiefs has made its way to the Workers' Council. A new set of shouting matches between representatives and the Workers' Council has resulted, as the village representatives accuse us of being reactionary pigs trying to strong-arm the militias into serving the city's whims.\n\nIn the meantime, the goal of improving the militias' preparedness has not seen any progress. Outside of the frontier, communal militias consist of a handful of village men shooting their guns once a month. "Why bother to prepare any more?" they ask. "We have no quarrel with the outside world. We defend our farms, as we've always done.""
 ORE.12.a: "We must make sure tyranny stops at the end of the barrel."
 ORE.12.b: "The wolves outside Orenburg draw ever closer..."

 ORE.13.t: "Trade Protection"
 ORE.13.d: "Another day, another set of angry representatives from the communes. The issue of the day is the proliferation of traders from the Urals. Orenburg's relative peace and prosperity has always been a magnet for traders of the outside world. Orenburg city's craftsmen, mostly free from Luftwaffe interference have been free to crank out a variety of valuable products. The stream of resources from and to the Urals has been particularly lucrative to city residents.\n\nThis entrepreneurial spirit has not spread much beyond the city's limit. The peasants of the commune are a wary lot, and they already distrust those from those outside their village, let alone those from beyond the commune's frontier. This has not stopped more daring trader convoys to seek trade outside the confines of Orenburg city. Some look for former Soviet industrial sites that might still be operating, while others try to barter with the workers of the few remaining resource extraction facilities, or look for the rare cash crop plantation.\n\nThe villagers have not been sold on the value of free trade; they complain about the increased traffic on regional roads; they accuse traders of being scouts for brigands; one village elder accuses "those bastards from the Urals" of having knocked up his daughter. The petition brought to us demands that traders be limited to the roads in and out of Orenburg city.\n\nThankfully for once, the endless bureaucracy and negotiations inherent to the Workers' Council let us simply bury the matter until the villagers tire of asking for reform."
 ORE.13.a: "Haven't they heard of comparative advantage?"
 ORE.13.b: "For the good of those within the commune."

 ORE.14.t: "Secessionism?"
 ORE.14.d: "The Workers' Council's power ultimately rests in the people, and without the people's consent the Council is nothing.\n\nDistressingly often, a representative from a commune requests secession from the Council. For some, the fear of creeping authoritarianism in Orenburg is enough to retire their adhesion to the Workers' Council. For others, the Council is merely a failed experiment, unable to make any progress on security issues or agricultural crises. As the dream of a common democratic organization agonizes in Orenburg, too many villages turn inward and give up on the outside world.\n\nAt times we can scrape up enough compromises and bribes to keep bigger villages and towns in the Orenburg Commune. Most of the time however, keeping the commune in question is not worth the effort. The task of leaving the Workers' Council is as usual made difficult by bureaucracy, debates and the circular action of the workers' democracy."
 ORE.14.a: "That's preposterous."
 ORE.14.b: "Our powers ultimately come from the people..."

 ORE.15.t: "The Education Question"
 ORE.15.d: "Communes request an end to Orenburg meddling in education. One of the scant successes of Bukharin's Soviet Union was its effort to eradicate illiteracy across Russia. The state's school system managed to reach even the depth of the countryside.\n\nAs with all good things the education system was annihilated by the accursed German invasion. Some in Orenburg city dreamed of using the Workers' Council to restore some combination of primary, secondary and even tertiary education to make use of the decaying Soviet infrastructure, but as usual the communes' unwillingness to cooperate has ground the plan to a halt.\n\nSome villages think teaching children anything beyond the use of a plow to work the field and rifles to keep bandits away is a self-evident waste of time and resources. Other communes have been convinced by local priests to let men of God teach the next generation.\n\nToday representatives from a set of communes have reached Orenburg to ask for an end to council meddling in their education. Perhaps the villagers were convinced to refuse further help after hearing a rumor that Orenburg city instructors were Trojan horses for the city's centralization attempts.\n\nThis unhappy new has launched new debates about the futility of teaching isolated villages and communes. "There is a sufficient mass of learned people in Orenburg city. Why try to help the peasants?" Others point out that a learned population is able to read reports from the city, organize their commune better and make use of what scant industrial plants are outside of Orenburg city."
 ORE.15.a: "We're thinking beyond tomorrow."
 ORE.15.b: "At least we'll have a few more textbooks for the other kids..."

 ORE.16.t: "A Successful Congress"
 ORE.16.d: "Success! The reformist faction of the Workers' Council has succeeded to unite a strong majority of communes on several topics. The communes have agreed to help repair several crucial roads towards the Urals, in exchange for a new toll duty on traders. A few toll exemptions were handed out to important communes to keep them in our coalition. Some of the bigger regional militias have reluctantly accepted our proposal for a joint military exercise in return for new guns from Zlatoust. This brought on a new round of haggling from other villages worried about being left behind in an arms race, as the heavier weapons would be kept in Orenburg city and deployed only if the majority of the communes agreed. Finally, a joint effort to send doctors and refugees from Orenburg city to western communes depopulated by an epidemic was met with only token opposition, when the communes agreed that the refugees would be barred from voting for an Orenburg city proposal for at least ten years.\n\nOur negotiators were finally able to catch a full night's sleep today after a marathon of backroom negotiations. While the kind of consensus required for deep structural reforms still eludes our grasp, we've managed to gain approval of enough people to work on stopgap solutions for the problems that plague Orenburg. These type of success give us hope that more reforms could perhaps be started in the future. Already members of the Workers' Council reformist faction are conducting a post-mortem of the workers' congress to assess the loyalty and opposition of various communes to Orenburg, and the best places to apply seduction efforts in preparation of the next workers' congress."
 ORE.16.a: "A great day for workers!"

 ORE.160.t: "A Failed Congress"
 ORE.160.d: "Another workers' congress, another set of wasted opportunities. Several of the projects we thought were secure were defeated in the final rounds of negotiations. Disdain of Orenburg city's centralization effort, distrust of distant commune's goodwill, fear of encroachment of the outside world... Many of the causes of Orenburg's problems are also the causes for its failure to implement solutions. Some of the most carefully crafted policy proposal were vetoed without any explanation by representatives of villages with less than a hundred souls.\n\nOn the final day of negotiation an important proposal for doctors and refugees to help repopulate and restore a set of western communes was shot down by several commune representatives. A fist fight followed as desperate Orenburg city refugees in the room arguing that they had every right to leave the crowded refugee camp and seek land amongst the depopulated communes were shouted down by representatives accusing them of being plants of the Orenburg City Council. Order was finally restored when city guards began throwing out troublemakers of both factions.\n\nOur allies in Orenburg city and amongst the few commune that backed us are disappointed, but not surprised. A few have reassured us of their continued support. Others slunk out of the congress without a word. Many of our faction on the City Council despair of ever seeing any change. Once more, the deep structural problems of the Workers' Council have defeated any chance of unity and progress."
 ORE.160.a: "There's always the next congress..."

 ORE.17.t: "Raiders on the Frontier?"
 ORE.17.d: "Infrequent reports from the scattered militias that make up what passes for the Communal defender force are all the Committee has for an intelligence network. That being said, however, recent reports have been increasing in urgency (and shrillness) to an alarming degree; most of these reports were triggered by activity near our border with Dirlewanger's Brigade. Increased movements of hostile forces, coupled with observations of convoys moving along the local road network, lead us to conclude that Dirlewanger himself, along with his inner retinue, has been active along our own border.\n\nBesides the usual increased exercises our military staff propose, some amongst the Council's top ranks caution us to develop a long-term strategy in response. What the Bandit King wants is unknown at this time, but everyone is certain that in his old age he will only become more unstable, more unpredictable, and his Brigade grows ever more greedy for plunder and bloodshed. While Dirlewanger himself is still alive, he might be a stabilizing influence on his men, but when his will is no longer there to punish disobedience - no one dares to imagine what will happen.\n\nLet this be a warning to us, and to the League: the beast is aged, but when he is roused his jaws will be as savage as they ever were. We must prepare ourselves for the fight that surely lies ahead."
 ORE.17.a: "We need to be able to do something about this!"
 ORE.17.b: "Worrying indicators."

 ORE.18.t: "Reviving the Communal Levy?"
 ORE.18.d: "The council member stood up to the podium. He shook a little. Knowing that what he was about to say would be highly unpopular among the assembled councilors, he read from a script. He wouldn't risk forgetting a memorized script as he sweated so profusely.\n\n"Gentlemen and gentleladies. Today, I speak to you on a matter of importance on the survival of the communes. As many of you know, threats face us down from every angle. Oskar Dirlewanger's fascist bandits, Lysenko's pseudo-science, and even the Ural League's unchecked militancy all endanger our utopian state. Therefore, I propose a measure many of you see as drastic, but I see as necessary. I believe that the Workers' Council should begin levying soldiers from the various communes to Orenburg."\n\nThe councilors, in almost total unison, began to boo off the young, nervous councilman at the podium.\n\nThe councillor frowned. This was not a good introduction to politics. He shook his head sadly and walked off the podium."
 ORE.18.a: "He should know how this works by now."
 ORE.18.b: "You know, there's always another way..."

 ORE.180.t: "The Secret Army"
 ORE.180.d: "The eastern communes. Always our most reasonable allies, especially those on the fringes, who know damn well what the implications of Dirlewanger attacking are.\n\nThat doesn't stop them, however, from hamstrung by uncooperative representatives. Can a representative even be said to truly represent their people, in fact, if they are unwilling to provide for their security? If a man is willing to join a central army, after all, they have no right to stop them.\n\nAnd so, we shall begin a play in secret. Recruiting officers shall be sent to the leaders of Eastern militias friendly to our cause, in order to lead cooperative militia members and form a more formal defense force.\n\nOf course, while the Council doesn't exactly approve of this measure, they can hardly act against it if the local governments just so happen to voluntarily loan us soldiers, under the promise of some... implied help.\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, after all."
 ORE.180.a: "What they don't know won't hurt them."

 ORE.181.t: "Extract from Representative Pavlov's Notes"
 ORE.181.d: "Councilors of the Orenburg Communes, I have shocking news to deliver to you today. In all my years in service to the brotherhood of the workers and the indivisible union of Socialism, I have never had the displeasure of reporting on active subversive activities prepared by members of our own Council, even its highest members. [Dramatic pause for effect.] But that has changed.\n\nIn the last 72 hours, ladies and gentlemen, I have come into a wealth of information, all of it disturbing. Let me sum it up for those uninclined to read the documents I have delivered to all present in the audience; we are now certain that members of the Reformist Faction [avoid pointing fingers and gasping theatrically: Precedent declares this to be a Bad Move.] have assembled equipment, men and arms for the training and eventual development of a militia. This, of course, so blatantly contravenes the Laws that define our Commune that it beggars belief. Furthermore, it displays a lack of trust in the Council to guide the strategic direction of the Communes that borders on schism! [Note: Aim eye contact at senior Advisors at this point for maximum effect.]\n\nWhat the Council chooses to do with this information is entirely up to them, but I have no doubt that justice will be done to the Spirit of Equality that Burba and his friends have violated. Thank you. [Don't trip while walking down the stairs like last speech.]"
 ORE.181.a: "This never happened."
 a_orenburg_tt: "The speech is discovered and destroyed."
 ORE.181.b: "Everyone needs to hear!"
 b_orenburg_tt: "§RThe speech is given on the Council floor.§!"

 ORE.182.t: "From Councillor Burba's Notes:"
 ORE.182.d: "The destruction of the speech was probably the quickest part of the whole damned ordeal. I honestly can't believe the man came with notes prepared for the whole Council, but only one copy of the speech. It just goes to show the quality of some of the men gathered in our so called "Best and Brightest". If this is the future of our planning efficiency, we might be better off with Lysenko! At least when the man plans to assassinate someone, he'll probably succeed.\n\nOn to the cover-up proper; there isn't much to be said about the implanted counter-evidence. After all, the Council is a band of rats; all we really needed to do was tie Pavlov to an appetizing piece of cheese, and they fell upon him like the horde they were. Socialist unity for you, I suppose. I hear they're replacing him with the son of an ambitious farmer. Maybe some time off will do him good, especially given the nature of the accusations we pinned on him. (I don't think anyone can do things of that nature with such a diverse variety of farm animals without passing out from exhaustion, but hey, I've never been one to underestimate Orenburgian ingenuity.)\n\nI'll be honest; for a brief moment I thought we were going to fall apart, especially when we first found the leaks, but in the long run this can only do us good. We've even improved our internal security and military egress methods thanks to this. I owe Pavlov a drink. If he hasn't killed himself by then."
 ORE.182.a: "The show goes on."

 ORE.183.t: "The End of the Secret Army"
 ORE.183.d: "The Orenburg Council is an unassuming building at first glance. When the time came to produce funds to build the complex housing the legislative apparatus of the Workers, many communes turned up empty-handed; whether because of poverty or corruption no one could say. Many mock its appearance, but by far the majority of the laughter falls on its hapless representatives. (No one even noticed Pavlov scrambling into the building with a thick suitcase and a determined expression.)\n\nNo one is laughing today. The Council is out for blood.\n\nScreams, howling and the noise of fisticuffs (the latter are fairly infrequent given the ...advanced age and physique of the delegates) are heard from the building for almost 36 hours straight. The Council records, or at least the terrified scribe locked in his booth by enraged Councilors records, a breakdown of law and order for almost 2 days straight. Gunshots are heard. 5 are injured. 3 die because no medical aid is available, and none mourn their absence; after all, there are bigger fish to fry.\n\nWhen the dust settles on what will be referred to as the Orenburg Massacre, 2 things are clear. The delegates formerly belonging to the Burba clique are arrested on a list of charges so long that for once the Council authorizes a truncated version to be used in the courts. Many of them contain assorted obscenity. All of them will sentence the involved to many, many years in incarceration.\n\nAnd the power of the ideals they once held - that of moderate Industrialization and a dynamic leadership, of an Orenburg with a captain at the helm - is forever broken. What is not broken, however, is the army itself - and some are already suggesting it be turned to our own purposes..."
 ORE.183.a: "Lock them up and let the matter end."
 ORE.183.b: "We could use that manpower, actually."

 ORE.19.t: "Inspecting the Communal Militias"
 ORE.19.d: "The Alekseevka Communal Militia drilled in the hot sun outside a farmer's field, old rifles, Great Patriotic War-era carbines, and blackpowder shotguns in hand. As the local farmer watched in interest, he noticed the flaws almost right away. The drill sergeants, supposed to be teaching, were instead casually talking with militiamen as they clumsily cleaned and field-stripped their varied armaments. Even further afield, yet more militiamen practiced at the range, their single allowed box of bullets sitting on a flat bench between the firing stations. With dismay, the farmer noticed that no two militiamen were using the correct posture, nor doing a particularly good job of basic marksmanship.\n\nHe scrawled that down in his weathered leather journal, and looked about to take more notes on readiness and general discipline.\n\nOf course, the farmer was not a farmer at all, but rather a disguised Orenburg City staff officer, out in the badlands to inspect the outer communal militias, who were notoriously prideful and unwilling to accept the guidance of actually qualified individuals. After several scathing remarks in flowing blue ink, he shut the book in disgust.\n\nThis was just more evidence. They were almost suicidal, in a way - viewing the duty of protecting their homeland from the most horrific groups in Russia the same way a sportsman would view going hunting intoxicated with his friends. He wouldn't doubt if some of the sorry lot had showed up to this training intoxicated - it was certainly ill-regimented enough for that to be a possibility, after all.\n\nHe gazed once more at the chaos on the field, spun on his heel, and walked inside. No, this was not good. Not at all. But it was up to the Council to decide their fate. And who was anyone to predict their course of action?"
 ORE.19.a: "This is a disgrace! Order them to accept trainers!"
 ORE.19.b: "What can we possibly do?"

 ORE.20.t: "Malenkov Inaugurated as Chairman!"
 ORE.20.d: "It is not uncommon for the news from Orenburg to reach even the nearest villages with a delay, as communes usually have a little regard about the internal politics of the main city, but this time, the news about the most recent change in leadership became widespread across every village with a speed of thunder in the clear sky. Georgy Malenkov, an ambitious and hardline politician, was elected as the Chairman of the Workers' Council of Orenburg.\n\nOnce a rising star of the now-defunct All-Union Communist Party whose governmental career abruptly ended after the German invasion, Georgy Maksimillianovich quickly adapted to the politics of his birth city and rallied around himself all the city strata who were deeply dissatisfied with the neverending political mess of Orenburg and the inability of the Council to adequately respond to the most pressing issues. Appealing to the old Soviet principles of democratic centralism and political consolidation, Malenkov declared the imminent end to the dysfunctional pseudo-Anarchist system that plagued Orenburg with indecisiveness and stagnation. In his inauguration speech, comrade Malenkov gave his word to elevate Orenburg to the level of advanced countries in the shortest possible terms and embark upon a rapid industrialization program, while sparing the exact details of how his promised prosperity will be achieved.\n\nTo say that the election of Malenkov turned out to be very controversial would be a dire understatement. Many people expressed their support of the newly-elected Chairman in hopes that a Communist strongman will put an end to pervasive anarchy and endless feuds, but even more people, especially the peasantry, reasonably fear that the reign of Malenkov will mark the decline of their autonomy and will make their well-being dependent on the whims of the main city. Whatever one thinks of the new Chairman, there is no doubt that Orenburg under the helmsmanship of Malenkov will face a grand transformation, for better or worse."
 ORE.20.a: "My fellow Orenburg citizens, nobody will ever dare to hurt you again!"

 ORE.21.t: "The Bandit and the Scientist"
 ORE.21.d: "It sadly seems like we were not the only ones searching for allies. Our scouts have come back to report to us that both the mysterious Lysenko and dastardly Dirlewanger have been meeting regularly. We currently do not know what these meetings have entailed, but it would be entirely reasonable to assume that if it involves them, it cannot possibly be good news for us. We should begin developing a series of plans for anything and everything those two could be planning; I don't know about you, but I'd rather die than be a test subject for Lysenko or a bag of meat for the Germans."
 ORE.21.a: "These mountains are cursed, I tell you."

 ORE.22.t: "Reassuring the Communes"
 ORE.22.d: "Another wave of hysteria seems to have swept the outlying communes, this time over the latest proposal to increase recruitment for the Orenburg militia. Many within Orenburg have become exasperated at the outright hostility coming from the peripheries; attempt to exert even the slightest hint of central coordinations for the good of the communes as a whole, and they all swear that you're the second coming of the Tsar and want to piss on Marx's grave. And it seems that this time has resulted in an even larger wave of angry letters and fuming ambassadors than usual. It's always amusing to see just how many synonyms for "fascist" they can fit in a single sentence.\n\nNevertheless, the effect that this can have on commune-wide morale cannot be understated, and this fearmongering cannot be allowed to propagate with impunity.\n\nBurba and Malenkov have taken it upon themselves to try and rein in the damage as much as possible by meeting with as many communal ambassadors as possible, pouring out endless praise for the freedom of their institutions and swearing that they would never try and unjustly infringe upon the fundamental rights of the proletariat. They had no intent to step on anybody's toes, but they perfectly understand why the proposal would seem like that, and they will do their utmost in the future to try and make sure that such counter-revolutionary thought never besmirches the people's meeting halls ever again.\n\nThankfully, it seems that their effort has paid off; the number of protests has dropped sharply in recent days, and Burba has gone a full week without being compared to Hitler. Progress if there ever was any."
 ORE.22.a: "A true testament to the power of brown-nosing."

 ORE.23.t: "Identifying Our Fundamental Problems"
 ORE.23.d: "A simple, communal lifestyle suits many of the peasants and workers who had been happy to first throw off the chains of autocratic tsarist life, then later those placed on them by the corrupt socialists. "Live by the fruits of one's own labour, worry only about the food and drink on your family's table" was their maxim to live by. Yet this newfound freedom has spawned its own set of catastrophic problems. Absolutely free citizens cannot be coerced in any way; they cannot be forced to put aside differences and sacrifice something which may not directly impact their lives.\n\nThe most glaring example of how this attitude became an issue was the communal levy fiasco, a simple tax to patch over some of the communes' worst issues such as the inability to rally an effective defence against outside raids. Both the major factions vying for their leader to assume centralized control of the political infrastructure of Orenburg have vowed to end the paralysing effects of keeping decision making power at an extreme localised level. Their supporters have begun fervent campaigns not just to promote their own cause over each other, but also to smear the autonomist argument against both them. The distaste so clearly present in the street violence and public debates between the men of Burba and Malenkov could not match the intense fear and hatred of the autonomists. Would the currently marginal, yet still profoundly influential, anti-centralization factions gain power then the communes may not survive much longer. All it would take is one of their aggressive neighbours to divide and conquer the various cities and settlements that without top down control would not be able to effectively defend their own lands. There are nefarious and powerful forces outside of this small paradise carved out in the Southern Urals.\n\nThey would not even think twice as their boots squash the anarchist legacy of Orenburg."
 ORE.23.a: "Just let us organize, damnit!"

 ORE.24.t: "Burba's Plan"
 ORE.24.d: "With the quite frankly disgraceful revelations brought up in a recent meeting of the Workers' Council regarding the dire situation with the outlying settlements, a new meeting was scheduled to try to at least consider some strategies in how to deal with this rather unpleasant issue. Some began to speak about socialist centralization, saying that as long as management was in place for the workers and farmers to be assigned correctly to their duty. Then in this case, freedom would not have to be comprised. The men and women of the communes could still live using the fruits of their labour. Sniggering, eye-rolling and general disagreement was palpable in the room. No vote was even seemingly necessary. Next stood Burba, the man who had transformed Orenburg into a hub of commerce and industrialization. His plans for helping to democratically organize the communes into administrative groups seems far more plausible. The Council however will have to decide."
 ORE.24.a: "We need a solution."

 ORE.25.t: "The Agenda of the Fifty-Eighth Congress"
 ORE.25.d: "Talk by talk, deal by deal, compromise by bitter compromise, the 58th Workers' Council Congress is at last coming together. It is difficult to get two Orenburgians to agree on the price of bread, as a saying in the city goes, so none on the Council are surprised that bickering at the highest levels of government has stalled discussion on important areas in need of reform. Factionalism and fundamental disagreements within the Council still threaten to neuter the latest in a long line of failed Congresses, fomenting doubt on its ability to address high priority issues such as economic development and defense. Regardless, plans are being drawn up by councilors hunched over their desks at night, praying that theirs, unlike the others, will become enacted legislation - and that the Commune might hence still be salvageable.\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is the unanimous conviction that a Chairman must be appointed as soon as possible. The Congress acknowledges that the Council's inability to act in concord is perhaps the greatest of its problems, although this means selecting a Chairman among the Council's ranks - no small task to overcome, given Orenburg's gridlocked politics - will be at the forefront of its agendas. Should the Council decisively settle on one, however, Orenburg and the Communes might soon have strong, effective leadership for the first time since the tyrannical Union fell... and it might just save them from their greatest enemy: themselves.\n\nDelegates bicker and brawl, convoys load themselves full, reporters conduct opposition research from rumors and hearsay, and councilors take one last night of full sleep. There will not be many more rested nights in the future. The Congress draws near."
 ORE.25.a: "To the success of the Council!"

 ORE.26.t: "The Congress Begins"
 ORE.26.d: "With polite applause, proceedings open for the Congress. Delegates flip open notebooks, gathering in clusters and pairs, separated into there factions. Speeches begin, long and onerous, and the seasoned delegates begin to slip away to secluded areas to gossip. And plot.\n\nThis year's top issues are those which will define the Commune's viability as a political entity; for the country is unlikely to develop unless it succeeds in centralization and governance, and these issues have been agreed on as the main topics of debate and eventual voting. Much talk is expended on picking candidates "worthy of the mantle of Socialism" and "of ideological purity", but everyone knows who the real candidates are: Burba, the reformer and industrialist who plans to save the Communes the same way he saved Orenburg from collapse. Malenkov, the hardliner who believes deviation was the ruin of the old Union and wants an iron grip to ensure the preservation of this one. And some Councilors believe that they, and only they, can manage the Communes, not some upstart Chairman with all the blood in his head and no ground beneath his feet.\n\nCentralization is similarly divisive, as Orenburg's superiority has long been an uncomfortable guest at the wedding table, and centralization will sharpen the grievances long held by the rural Communes against the cityfolk. No one can agree on how far the centralization plan ought to go, and it appears that Burba and Malenkov both disagree on this issue as well. And this means that debate stalls and grinds as definitions change with each passing speech, and alliances or feuds shift with every speaker. As the Council simmers in debate, one thing is clear; the road to decisive leadership is longer than expected."
 ORE.26.a: "Oh dear."

 ORE.27.t: "The Chairman's Controversy"
 ORE.27.d: ""Like every good socialist of the Orenburg Commune, I have despised hierarchy in all its forms; the latter is dangerous not because of its power, but because of the invisible fears it creates. I hereby warn the Council and all gathered here today in particular that the election of a Chairman, our greatest exercise in liberty as a Councillor, might also prove to be our last."\n\n"We know, friends, that the abusive and terrible Union was a false prophet, preaching Marx while tossing his word aside whenever it was convenient for the regime. We founded the Communes in the hopes that we could erase that history, and start again without the wounds inflicted by those who claimed to be socialists in name, but are predators by nature. But the imperatives which power a Chairman, the need for agreement and order, will lead us onto the dark and bitter road of totalitarianism - all with the best of intentions."\n\n"So I beseech this Council, look outside at the freedom we have before we vote! Is the poverty of the soul really worth the material advancement? Can you trade liberty for gold, friends? And would you want to even if you could?""
 ORE.27.a: "Impassioned, but unrealistic."

 ORE.28.t: "Compromising on Powers"
 ORE.28.d: ""We have reached a point in debate, ladies and gentlemen, where it is clear where the Council's loyalties lie in the debate of the Council's future Chairman. A few dedicate themselves to the extreme of individual freedom, where no hierarchy or despotism can be allowed to threaten the autonomy that the Communes prize so dearly. A few others dedicate themselves to the extremes of communal security, where many give themselves over to the service and protection of all. The rest of us away in the reeds, liking both but embracing neither, as a farmer looks between two prize pigs. (Laughter)"\n\n"I therefore propose that we craft a proposal that navigates these two extremes, working not for ideology or out of cynical self-aggrandizing, but out of a love of the common good and a desire to protect the home we love. The Chairman will be equipped with necessary powers to break stalemates on domestic issues, and emergency powers to ensure the common good is guided by a steady and wrathful hand. The Council will ensure that the Chairman does not step out of line, while also allowing itself to be led when the circumstances demand it."\n\n"This is what the way forward looks like, friends. This is the solution that works. Wisdom to the Council, power to the Chairman... and most importantly of all, freedom to the Urals!""
 ORE.28.a: "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be..."

 ORE.29.t: "The Council Votes"
 ORE.29.d: "As the Council struggles forward in proceedings, the issue of the day appears at last. Cliques gather around the candidates and jostle for power on the debate floor. The time is drawing near for the Council to decide its fate.\n\nBurba, the reformer and industrialist, or Malenkov, the socialist hardliner, have been ridiculed at times, but they are the two strongest independent candidates at present, and their directions will both lead the Communes down the path of unity and strength. Many also point out that Malenkov has a habit of dissociating with former allies and is a bitter dogmatic hardliner. Others point out the opposite, that Burba is too flexible and is willing to make deals with anyone, even former enemies. But if there's one thing the Orenburgian loves more than arguments, it's sticking to his guns, and Malenkov sticks to his guns so hard that they have to peel them off his arsecheeks. That's how the joke goes, in any case.\n\nOf course, many feel that the current status quo never did anyone any harm, and that Orenburg deserves peace and stability rather than the great blank of any potential Chairman. The Communes are already a fractious mess, of course, but they're working as intended, and anyone saying otherwise is an enemy of the Revolution! For those people a faction claiming complete autonomy for the Council has been formed, and their talk has proved surprisingly appealing.\n\nThe ballots are opened, and voting begins. Orenburg and the Communes wait, breath bated, as the future comes to roost above their heads."
 ORE.29.a: "Now all we can do is wait."

 ORE.30.t: "The Counter-Proposal"
 ORE.30.d: "The need for a chairman is by this point agreed upon, but the question of who that chairman would be proved to be impossible to answer decisively. Every candidate had their backers, and were unwilling to back down to their rivals. A solution has been found in the proposal to implement a rotating chairperson, so that all candidates would have a chance to act. While no one is entirely pleased by this compromise, it seems to have stuck, and the position of chairman will no longer be a stable seat to sit in."
 ORE.30.a: "A good compromise..."

 ORE.31.t: "Securing the Outer Communes"
 ORE.31.d: "A councilman stands at the podium, holding no page in his hands. The situation does not require practiced words. He inhaled, knowing that this might cost him his seat. But it would all be worth it. Hopefully.\n\n"People of this council. I come to you with a situation. It appears that, the outer communes of Orenburg have declared secession. To this end, I hope that you will come together to agree with me, that we must act! I propose that we send soldiers to the areas that have declared secession. We will help them calm down, help them realize that together, we are all stronger united. That, despite their anger with the Council, they mustn't simply decide to flee and risk getting picked off by the tyrants in the Brigade, or abducted by that man in the Mountain, or perhaps even being taken by those militarists in the Ural League."\n\n"Please, I beg of you. This beautiful society, this living, breathing thing that we have created, we cannot allow it to go to waste! We must send these soldiers, these soldiers who are true to our ways. I assure you, all of you, people of this council, we will prevail!""
 ORE.31.a: "Perhaps we should..."

 ORE.32.t: "A Future for Orenburg"
 ORE.32.d: "As Malenkov's hold on Orenburg continues to grow, he makes the steps required to cushion the criticism. Today in front of the Orenburgian Council Building, Malenkov proclaimed his plans for "A New Orenburg".\n\nIn his proclamation he addressed to the crowd:\n\n"Today is a new day, we have abandoned what was believed yesterday and have started taking steps towards tomorrow."\n\nMalenkov went on to state that though Orenburg is in a dire situation, with his masterful plans, there will be no need to worry. Malenkov addressed many issues in the speech repeating his acclaimed plans for centralization of industry, the military, and Orenburg itself.\n\nThis speech was clearly well acclaimed as the surrounding crowds roared for more of their beloved leader as he took his leave into the Council for another day of hard work."
 ORE.32.a: "He spoke with confidence, so what's the worry?"
 
 ORE.33.t: "Establishing the Heavy Industrial Commissariat"
 ORE.33.d: "As demand increases, supply must increase in unison. That's the foundation of all economic theories. Our communes have developed plans for new larger manufacturing plants, producing anything from tin cans and utensils to bicycles and shovels. These glorious new plants will bring prosperity and new found growth for our communes, not to mention improve the supply for our military by making new locally manufactured weapons readily available, with reliable new munitions and parts to spare."
 ORE.33.a: "Turn, wheels of progress."

 ORE.34.t: "Tractors for the Farmers"
 ORE.34.d: "The factories have proven their worth time and time again, and as such, so have the factory workers. Just like their fathers, mothers, grandmothers and grandfathers, they're proving to be the backbone of our society. As a result, they must be given favor over the peasants, whose work, although important, isn't as instrumental to our future. By doing this, peasants and farmers will flock to the factories in search of an improved life with some new amenities. With the influx of new workers, the factories themselves will grow in productivity, size, and efficiency."
 ORE.34.a: "A gear doesn't turn itself."

 ORE.35.t: "A Republic of Workers"
 ORE.35.d: "The factories have proven their worth time and time again, and as such, so have the factory workers. Just like their fathers, mothers, grandmothers and grandfathers, they're proving to be the backbone of our society. As a result, they must be given favor over the peasants, whose work, although important, isn't as instrumental to our future. By doing this, peasants and farmers will flock to the factories in search of an improved life with some new amenities. With the influx of new workers, the factories themselves will grow in productivity, size, and efficiency."
 ORE.35.a: "A gear doesn't turn itself."

 ORE.36.t: "Deploying Commissar Units"
 ORE.36.d: "The new commissar system has been generating some interesting reactions from the soldiers. Perhaps it's just fear or the lack of trust, but having someone watch what comes out of one's mouth is likely uncomfortable for soldiers who previously could speak whatever was on their mind. These undisciplined habits cannot continue, and as such, that is why the commissars exist. Loyalty to the communes is essential, and dissent among other things is only detrimental to the life of our people. Dissent leads to disunity, and disunity leads to death. We've experienced as much twenty something years ago. Either way, they'll simply have to get used to it, or face punishment."
 ORE.36.a: "Whatever you say."

 ORE.37.t: "A Loyal Officer Corps"
 ORE.37.d: "The army, as with all things in Orenburg, has prospered and grown under Malenkov's guidance. This however is a double-edged sword, as the very men who now fight to protect the people may one day turn against them. Was the old Soviet Union not destroyed by treacherous generals betraying her in a moment of weakness? Even the armed men themselves had not all submitted to their new authority. Trust, loyalty, and fraternity, were his generals true, or were daggers in their hands? We can never be sure."
 ORE.37.a: "Dead or lie, dead or alive."

 ORE.38.t: "Guardians of the People"
 ORE.38.d: "The people cried out for someone, anyone to save them from tyrants and fascists. In their darkest day as bombs killed them and bandits raped them, the people called out.\n\nAnd the Heroes of the People answered their call! in the face of great danger these brave men and women leapt to their fellow citizens defense and bluntly stopped the blows of the enemy. Having braved cold, lead and steel it is thanks to these heroes that you now live freely and happily!"
 ORE.38.a: "You! Have you signed up with the volunteers?"

 ORE.39.t: "A Growing Power"
 ORE.39.d: "Malenkov looked out and into Orenburg which had for so long been cratered and primitive. He remembered how he had found it: weak, poor, cowardly, and divided, the economic potential of the great city had been squandered by German bombs and institutional anarchy in equal measure.\n\nToday that changed. Before his eyes and on his orders smoke stacks grew upon the city, her residents herded into cramped and suffocating workspaces to produce many times greater than they had ever before. New quotas and standards had been enforced upon the working class, and beyond the ear shot of the commissars Malenkov was sure more than a few complained of the long and dangerous work thrust upon them. But they were building the Orenburg of tomorrow at blinding speed and in this not one could afford to step out of the production line."
 ORE.39.a: "We must all sacrifice today for tomorrow."

 ORE.40.t: "Judicial Guidelines for the Communes"
 ORE.40.d: "The court system of Orenburg has for years been virtually nonexistent. If an accused man is even brought into a building to meet justice, he may consider himself lucky. Once there even the barest of hearsay can and will be held against him, as village rumors and past infractions with no relation to the case are held against him. Without any defense or procedure, the court may quickly descend into a popularity contest as both accused and accuser fling insults at each other. This cannot go on, and a true, ordered, justice must be restored to the communes so that true freedom can breathe again."
 ORE.40.a: "The people deserve no less."
 ORE.40.b: "We will change only slightly."
 ORE.40.c: "No need to waste time on something as small as this."

 ORE.41.t: "A Fair People's Tribunal"
 ORE.41.d: "Meant to mete out revolutionary, popular justice to criminals and despots, it has become clear that the anarchic system of justice has itself become the greatest despot in Orenburg, terrorizing the people with inaccuracy and inconstancy. In light of this lamentable situation Malenkov has given new orders for the Reorganization of Popular Tribunals. State assigned professionals will ensure the discipline and good order of tribunals, so that justice may become standardized and dignified. Before any decisions are made by a tribunal it must from now on consult with those sent to watch over them."
 ORE.41.a: "Justice will be evaded no longer."
 ORE.41.b: "We're already at a lack of men, too bad."

 ORE.42.t: "Orenburg's Unjust Burden"
 ORE.42.d: "The Orenburg commune is currently responsible for a ludicrously large amount of contributions to the communes, and her representatives have finally managed to bring it to attention. Some would say such is the price of being the principal commune of the area, into which political and cultural talents flow. Being the first among equals does little to address the ultimate problem however: the people of Orenburg time and time again see their hard-earned wealth flow into the common fund, and have rarely ever seen any benefit in return. It is only natural for people to dislike taxes in the best of times, and the unequal benefit of the fund is lost on no one."
 ORE.42.a: "This was going to happen eventually."
 ORE.42.b: "We'll grin and bare it."

 ORE.43.t: "A Common Investment Fund"
 ORE.43.d: "The most basic and obvious proof of cooperation between the communes is the establishment of a common fund into which all will contribute, and which will be used to develop and sustain the communes as a whole. All pitch in, and all benefit as a community is built around Orenburg. Rather than being paranoid and lonely hamlets frightened for their own survival, we reap the harvests as one.."
 ORE.43.a: "All for one and one for all!"
 ORE.43.b: "Maybe just a little."
 ORE.43.c: "We're dry right now, we can't send anymore."

 ORE.44.t: "Equal Representation for the Communes"
 ORE.44.d: "While the communes have agreed in principal to the idea of cooperation the deeply ingrained fear of despotism remains strong. Each commune and all her peoples are ready to defend their autonomy should they feel that their voice is not heard in the state. With this in mind we have begun constructing an acceptable solution for representing the communes, ensuring even the largest and most powerful will have to listen to the small and weak, while also ensuring that bullheaded obstruction will not bring down us all. Each and every commune is granted the right to equal representation in Orenburg, and has a duty to responsibly wield the power granted to them."
 ORE.44.a: "We will hear each and every voice, no matter how small."
 ORE.44.b: "We will hear only the loudest complaints."
 ORE.44.c: "We will do as we need."

 ORE.45.t: "A Proposal for Consistent Scheduling"
 ORE.45.d: "During the last Congress, there were several instances of representatives arriving late, and some requiring last-minute substitutes. It's clear that the cause of these issues was the lack of long term planning of these events. We shall change how these events are prepared, taking special attention towards the dates. We must set specific dates for them, far ahead of time, so representatives can make sure their personal and communal lives and schedules do not interfere with their arrival at the Congress. We will setup a small team tasked with finding a date which shall be permanently used for the Congress. This way we can prevent more embarrassing mishaps."
 ORE.45.a: "Punctuality and cooperation are the keys to progress."
 ORE.45.b: "Maybe later."

 ORE.46.t: "Codified Powers for the Council"
 ORE.46.d: "Power: who has it, and how is it used. Beating around the bush will do no good for anyone, and without question the Council must have some power in its hands lest it become yet another debating society. But the question of just what those powers should be is not an easy one to answer. A united army, under civilian command? The right to build roads, and defensive planning? The right to overrule local councils' decisions, or to print its own newspaper? This is the central issue, and it is finally here that the communes must face what they had hoped so long to avoid, the showdown of pragmatism and idealism. Freedom after all is easily lost, and can only be regained with much difficulty."
 ORE.46.a: "A minor extension never hurt anybody."
 ORE.46.b: "We've been doing fine with how it currently is."
 ORE.46.c: "We'll shed some of our power."

 ORE.47.t: "A Constitution for the Worker"
 ORE.47.d: "While Orenburg maintains its status as a loosely defined socialist proto-state, Malenkov is attempting anything to push through meaningful reforms that will actually make an effect on the state of the country. After discussing possible popular ideas that the Council would likely support. One issue brought up would be the possibility of creating a constitution. While the constitution would do little in truly changing the country, it will symbolically link the numerous communes and villages under one document and one set of ideals. As well, the constitution would guarantee workers rights and protections both inside Orenburg and the settlements outside. For once, the people of Orenburg would unite under one paper and one destiny."
 ORE.47.a: "Approved!"
 ORE.47.b: "We'll adapt some aspects."
 ORE.47.c: "Denied."

 ORE.48.t: "Developing the Rural Regions"
 ORE.48.d: "The peasant communes of Orenburg are in a desperate state. Every day, thousands of poor farmers wake up early in the morning to toil, only to finally rest deep into the night. Then, they must transport the meager food they gather dozens of miles to the nearest sign of civilization, where it can be processed and sold. Worse yet, it seems that this destitute situation will not stop anytime soon; with relative political deadlock in the city and lack of any change in the settlements itself, villagers will continue to whittle away the hours of their life in hard labor and suffering. The spirit of medievalism that plagues these ancient lands will never stop persisting. For that, we are cursed.\n\nTherefore, to survive in these times, nobody must sit idle. None will slouch while our men and women die in the fields. We will all do our part for the survival of the communes. Then, and only then, can we throw off the chains and the curse that binds us. Then, and only then, can the workers triumph!"
 ORE.48.a: "No more chains!"
 ORE.48.b: "Some handling is required."
 ORE.48.c: "This is too extreme for now."

 ORE.49.t: "Bringing True Justice"
 ORE.49.d: "The old ways sting Orenburg with a ferocity not seen anywhere else.\n\nThese old traditions are seen in many ways. They are seen in the peasantry, still condemned to their millennia-old fate; in the free-thinkers burned on the stake for daring to speak their mind; in the prejudice shown to any outsiders; and in the oligarchy of the rich and powerful.\n\nBut the most egregious stain of the vicious medievalism of Orenburg is lynching. At least once a week, someone is killed by the mob. The reasons vary; perhaps a refugee was accused of assaulting a local woman or someone confessed their hatred of socialism. Death, however, is always the same. They are tortured and then hung for the sin they supposedly committed. Some villages are even particularly infamous for the mob mentality they encourage. After all, if one can control the mob like cattle, then they control the whole of society.\n\nOrenburg is not a principality of princes and kings. It is a land of freedom and of individualism. Mob justice was never justice; it was murder of the most heinous kind. It was not just a murder of a man, but a murder of a whole set of ideals.\n\nThe government will not let lynching go on any longer. Too many innocents have died at the hand of the noose while the real criminals go free without the hand of the gavel. The rule of justice must once again sweep across the land."
 ORE.49.a: "For what is justice in the face of the mob?"
 ORE.49.b: "This isn't even that big of a problem."
 ORE.49.c: "If we loosen some thing up, we won't have to worry."

 ORE.50.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - Purpose and Aims"
 ORE.50.d: "The time to decide the future of Orenburg is upon us. Even with the Council remaining in power, the march of progress must continue as does time. The 59th Congress of the Workers' Communes of Orenburg is upon us.\n\nThe pressing matter of importance is the issue of centralization. Most of the Council, while vehemently opposing the idea, realize the necessity of centralization. None of them can sit by as Orenburg's very government collapses upon its ineffective and rotting foundation.\n\nSocial and judicial reforms will also be a focus of the Congress; some settlements have seen fit to remove civil liberties supported by the rest of the Council. These villages will no longer be allowed to trample on our shared values. As well as this, the recent lynching sprees that have engulfed the communes must be cracked down upon. Non-partial judges will be employed to introduce the rule of law to the mob mentality. "
 ORE.50.a: "We will stabilize our current system."
 ORE.50.b: "It'll be more of the same."
 ORE.50.c: "We will protect the freedom of individuals."

 ORE.51.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - Voluntary Association"
 ORE.51.d: "The Orenburg Communes cannot and will not be kept in union by fear. It is the great freedom and self confidence of the communes which is our strength. We are not the militarists or the fascists which plague our world. Instead, we have dared to be different, forming a union not by force but by common agreement and cooperation. We do not fear each other any more than one would fear their own brother, for we are as a family. All may choose to leave, to brave the world alone, but instead each and every one has chosen without compulsion to join together for the greater good and freedom of all. Let us continue to lovingly cooperate as we hold each other in equal value, and greater value because of it."
 ORE.51.a: "Back on track please."
 ORE.51.b: "I've heard worse speeches I suppose"

 ORE.52.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - Malenkov's Speech"
 ORE.52.d: "Councilman of the communes. I speak to you on a matter dear to my heart. It is a matter of the survival of our collective identity. Orenburg is a nation of the down and under. A nation of those who have suffered through countless horrors. Through the Russian winter. Through the heat of the summer sun. Through the fascist invasion. Yet through all of this, we have prevailed. Still, we stand on the verge of collapse. Not because of external threats, but ourselves. Selfishness and greed have led to each commune hoarding resources that should be shared among us for the common good. This is the result of the decentralization that plagues us. Decentralization does not lead to individual good or communistic success. It only leads to disappointment and suffering.\n\nOnly through centralizing the state under one, strong, socialist government can we bring peace, liberty, and stability to the communes. Centralization does not lie as selfish decentralization does. It produces the hard-working man. It rewards servants of the people's state. It is the truest path of liberty and the truest path that Orenburg can follow. So I implore you, fellow councilman, to join me on this path forward. The path to centralization."
 ORE.52.a: "We could benefit from this."
 ORE.52.b: "Thanks for the offer."

 ORE.53.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - Moments"
 ORE.53.d: "The congress has sat in session for several days, and in that time much of substance has been discussed. Everything from the interior and exterior threats facing the communes, to the influence on Orenburg by the Guard, to the personality of Malenkov himself has been brought to the table. Virtually every aspect of Orenburg society has been touched on, if not criticized, and the result is fast arriving. There is little left to do now but wait to vote on Malenkov's proposed centralizing measures. Whatever the result is, none fail to be impressed that soon Orenburg will reach a fork in the road from which there will be no turning back, and the gravity of such a moment weighs heavily on the room."
 ORE.53.a: "A night to remember."

 ORE.54.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - The Verdict"
 ORE.54.d: "Today is a monumental day in the short history of Orenburg. The heavily decentralized economic system of our communes has been the cornerstone of our society since its inception, and remains a source of great pride. However, certain events outside of our control may force us to compromise on this treasured value. With external threats ever increasing, the sheer benefits in productivity that a centralized economy affords can no longer be ignored. How will the communes vote?"
 ORE.54.a: "We'll soon find out."

 ORE.55.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - Triumph!"
 ORE.55.d: "The votes have been tallied, and the communes have agreed to centralize our economy. Changes to production will begin immediately."
 ORE.55.a: "Noted."

 ORE.56.t: "The Fifty-Ninth Congress - The Communes Resist!"
 ORE.56.d: "The votes have been tallied, and the communes have struck down any attempt at centralizing the economy. Production methods and planning will remain unchanged."
 ORE.56.a: "Unfortunate."

 ORE.57.t: "Orenburg Requests Trainers"
 ORE.57.d: "It seems that our neighbors have acknowledged our vastly superior military expertise, and now beg for our help in establishing their Armed Forces as powerful and fearsome defensive entities.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, the Foreign Office received a telegram from our south-western neighbor Orenburg, the subject of the telegram was seemingly a request for 'help'. It appears that the government of Orenburg has requested "trainers" from our Armed Forces in exchange for a large sum of money. Presumably the peasantry of the region have forgotten how to use their guns! A little training will help with that, and our military assures us it will get the job done.\n\nHowever, is it honestly in our best interest to help Orenburg? By assisting in the development of their Armed Forces, we could potentially strengthen their 'nation' which could ultimately backfire and weaken us as a result. After all, the Communes have never considered us an ally, no matter how much they may smile at us while using our services. However, they are offering us a significant sum of money in return for our services, and money shouts where words whisper.\n\nThe government faces a choice. Aid or no aid? The Communes wait with bated breath for the response."
 ORE.57.a: "Yes, send the trainers."
 ORE.57.b: "No, we shouldn't send anyone."

 ORE.58.t: "The League Approves Our Request"
 ORE.58.d: "In a fortunate turn of events, the Ural League happily agreed to accept our request to provide military assistance for our militia forces. A selected group of combat trainers, who were hardened in the constant battles of West and Southern Russia or even been through Soviet schooling themselves, will arrive in the nearest time to Orenburg and organize training courses for our militia squads, helping them to overcome their lack of training and prepare them for the forthcoming battles against the forces of Dirlewanger and Lysenko.\n\nThe generous efforts of the Ural League towards the aid for our land are greatly appreciated by workers and peasants of Orenburg. The steps undertaken by the League not only indicate our better relations with them."
 ORE.58.a: "We will put their talents to good use."

 ORE.59.t: "The League Denies Our Request"
 ORE.59.d: "Unfortunate news has come from the East. Our envoys to the Ural League, who were tasked to ask their leaders for military assistance and increased cooperation between our nations, returned empty-handed. Citing the apparent lack of numbers to spare for our forces, the Ural League declined our request to send their military professionals to provide combat training our undertrained militia force.\n\nSuch an outrageous refusal turned many of council's representatives against the League, with many questioning the hypocrisy of pressing our freedoms in the name of "security" while continuing to treat us like children and not even trying to help us to stand for themselves. Though the League's refusal will complicate our efforts to reorganize our armed forces, some of the most desperate council's representatives are trying to deny the necessity of major changes to our military at all and take solace in the romanticization of the peasant guerilla wars of the past. After all, it were the untrained, peace-loving peasants who bravely resisted the invasions of Poles and Napoleon and expelled them from our Motherland centuries ago, all while professional soldiers only left cities at disposal of our enemies. If the cudgel of the people's war saved Russia so many times, why can't we trust it to smash the monsters of Dirlewanger and Lysenko?"
 ORE.59.a: "We will go our way, without a glance on the League."

 ORE.60.t: "Anarchy in Orenburg!"
 ORE.60.d: "Once, a thin structure of order ruled Orenburg. Now, all that stands is anarchy. The peasant communes are but islands in the midst of a lack of civilization. Banditry rates have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, and the refined economy we maintained before is now a medieval-style barter economy. While the Workers' Council holds some control over Orenburg, it is clear our greatest days, if they could ever be called that, are over.\n\nThe reforms pushed by the government didn't lead to centralization and statehood; they lead to disorganization and crisis as local village elders opposed the switch to a centralized economy. No more can we project power or even defend our own borders. Anarchy is not the blessing we were promised but it is what have dawned upon us."
 ORE.60.a: "It seems that greed has destroyed unity."

 ORE.70.t: "Burba Stands Firm"
 ORE.70.d: "The headquarters of the Council of Orenburg is afire, not with literal flame, but with rumor, skulduggery and thoughts that hide in the shadows. Few delegates look happy these days when returning from the complex to their villages or towns, and one can hardly blame them. The Chairman's decision to go ahead with the reorganization of the economy, Council be damned, is a tough decision to sell to villages already enraged at the excesses of centralization. It is likely that the next batch of provincial elections will bring further chaos, but until then...\n\nA memo is issued, and a Chairman's speech declared. Observers will later describe it as a "come-to-Jesus" meeting, and the fury with which the normally genial Burba sets upon his opponents is almost prophetic in its intensity. In no uncertain terms he makes clear that the main purpose of the Council is to achieve what the individual cannot; in that sense, Burba's election has been perhaps the only good decision the Council has ever made. He goes on to excoriate his opponents, declaring them bandits and reactionaries and fools and idiots to boot, and ends by emphasizing that the reforms will continue, no matter what. Several Councilors faint from shock. The rest growl and whine, but they are cowed. The Council relents, and dissent dies down.\n\nOrenburg trembles, but it continues on its plodding way to a future hidden in the smog, but bright in the Chairman's heart."
 ORE.70.a: "Good council members follow their orders."

 ORE.71.t: "A New Renaissance"
 ORE.71.d: "Orenburg is a new city. Where it was once just another city in the Russian, and then Soviet realm, it has now become the jewel of all Eurasia. Unlike so much of the world, Orenburg is comfortable, prosperous, and most importantly, secure. We are a shining city on a hill, a beacon of stability in the shattered wastes of the old Soviet Union. At the time of our independence, we have crafted not only a unique system of governance, but also a unique culture.\n\nCars made in local factory drive on our streets. There is clean water, electricity, and a telephone connection to every house. Artists proudly present their works in galleries, and intellectuals discuss philosophy in street cafes. A film studio has reportedly been set up, and will even begin writing and producing movies within the year.\n\nAll of this is thanks to the changes pushed through by Comrade Burba, and his dedicated team of skilled experts. Without him and his wise stewardship, it is unlikely we would have ever achieved this level of cultural and economic success. We give thanks to their valiant efforts, and are grateful for the prosperity afforded to us.\n\nOrenburg is undergoing a Renaissance, and things for us have never been better."
 ORE.71.a: "We stand on our own two feet."

 ORE.72.t: "Chairman Burba's Military Reforms"
 ORE.72.d: "A leader of any nation must have an army to free his people within from threats without. This sagacious advice has lasted time's trevails since the birth of recorded history - and like any reformer worth mentioning, Chairman Burba knows better than to disregard its millenia-old lessons. Sound advice is sound advice, especially after the Union's collapse.\n\nIt is no secret that Orenburg's manyfold militia are poorly trained and dismally equipped. Moreover, the militiamen themselves have no greater loyalty and responsibility beyond their village, hamlet or city and its defense. What resistance will farmtool-armed villagemen offer against juggernauts intent on taking all of Orenburg, and not merely their own homes? Something has to change before they find themselves wanting; for the Chairman, change begins by forging new swords from old, weathered chains.\n\nIn hindsight, the first step was simple enough that only a hamstrung government won't have implemented it at earliest convenience. Orenburg has no shortage of veterans from the Great Patriotic War, experienced in war but purposeless in times of peace. Bringing these crippled, drunken veterans diffused throughout the Communes into one abandoned building in Orenburg city took some time and effort. Hesitance and confusion soon gave way to the unwritten brotherhood all soldiers shared, and laughter, stories and ribald jokes flowed out from the building like torrents of spilled vodka.\n\nAs their cheer subsided they began exchanging gripes and ideas. The dismal state of Orenburg's "military". Guns no better than muskets from the age of Tsars. Inter-commune training activities. Pleas to the Chairman for rifles, officers, uniforms, banners and divisions. Detail by detail, the now-christened "Veterans' Committee", drawing from decades of proud service to the Revolution, began to plan an army worth calling Orenburg's own: Disciplined, organized, and, most importantly, ready to fight as one for the Commune's sake.\n\nSo it was that the veterans later left the city with new guns and newer purpose, promising to return after they've whipped their boys into proper shape. A nation cannot raise a professional army overnight... but with the acumen of its happy veterans, and the Ural Guard's assistance, Orenburg might just raise an army of Orenburgers in due time."
 ORE.72.a: "The chairman never struck us as a military commander, but his ideas have merits."

 ORE.73.t: "A New Training Program"
 ORE.73.d: "The training for our militias has been quite overlooked, leading it to be mismanaged and underperforming. Soldiers often didn't know basic tactics, CQC, medical techniques or even how to shoot straight. Thanks to the Urals Training program, however, this is all going to change. Militiamen shall be trained and retrained in the techniques of modern combat, to ensure that Dirlewanger's bandits never threaten us again, and no other power will be able to stand on two feet against our might. No longer shall soldiers go into battle without having any knowledge of how to survive or fight. No longer shall the fascist scoff at the "inferior" Slav militiaman of the Urals. Instead, they shall fear our steel, and cry when they see our guns piercing their formations. Orenburg shall never be afraid ever again, with its glorious soldiers defending its borders!"
 ORE.73.a: "We shall survive, no matter what happens!"

 ORE.74.t: "Burba's Standardization Program"
 ORE.74.d: "One of the many problems with the decentralized militia system is a lack of standardized weapons. militias will use whatever they can find, understandably, but this tends to leave us with a lack of spare parts and ammo, and as such we are often under-equipped and outgunned. Burba has recognized this, and under his administration, standard issue weapons will now be produced and used en masse. Standard rifles, standard machine guns, standard everything. Every soldier should have quality firearms and equipment, to ensure that they can stand firmly against the hordes which threaten us. "
 ORE.74.a: "No longer shall our soldiers suffer from shoddy pipe guns!"

 ORE.75.t: "The Militia Reforms Continue"
 ORE.75.d: "We are eternally grateful for the assistance from the Ural League in our continued efforts to unite our militias. The training regimen has now added classes on squad tactics, something we desperately needed. Now, soldiers will be taught about covering fire, usage of grenades, marching formations, mortar and artillery fire, and general strategies on how to adapt to the different weapons and tactics the fascist bandits will use to kill us. Now, our brave comrades shall fight with courage and brains. Let's see how Dirlewanger likes us now!"
 ORE.75.a: "Nothing shall stop us. We are stronger now than ever before."

 ORE.76.t: "The Art of Defense "
 ORE.76.d: "Bandits usually put quite the damper on prosperity and happiness, with their unfortunate habit of redistributing resources in the most inefficient manner. As it stands, Orenburg's relative prosperity has lured Dirlewanger's Brigade to the region, hungry for blood. Smaller groups of bandits have followed, no doubt hoping to exploit our lack of preparation to take what they can before the Black Bandit finishes us up.\n\nAt some point in Chairman Burba's myriad of reform and reorganization our leader authorized the creation of a traveling military academy. This group of men from the Veterans' Committee, aided by a few of our first professional soldiers, tour the communes of our eastern frontier to give classes on fortification and defensive positions. By helping the militias that have not yet been integrated into our professional army to prepare well thought out trenches, watch posts, and kill zones, we increase the locals' capacity to repel roving groups of bandits, and neutralize them with force if needed. Particularly important communes situated along our supply lines are taught to build several layers of fortifications and trenches to extract time and extra casualties from any invader, and hopefully repel any attacks.\n\nOur newly installed commanders believe that these types of preparation will prevent many bandits from reaching Orenburg's interior on simple raiding expeditions. When the time comes to face a true invasion force, the capture of each commune will bog down any invading army and give time to our reserves to reach weakened areas of the front."
 ORE.76.a: "If a soldier's best friend is his rifle, then his shovel is a close second. "

 ORE.77.t: "Militias for Orenburg"
 ORE.77.d: "For too long, the militias of Orenburg have represented only the local communes. The decentralized nature of our administration has made things nightmarish, be it our "government" or our military. Under Burba, however, this is going to change. The militias have to represent and defend all of Orenburg, not just their localities. They should be united under a central command structure with well-trained officers and soldiers ready to fight for the people. Without this, we will fall to the bandit forces. Only through unity will we survive."
 ORE.77.a: "For Orenburg!"

 ORE.78.t: "The Planning Commission"
 ORE.78.d: "This morning, Burba announced to the Workers' Council of Orenburg that he would be establishing a formal Economic Planning Commission, in order to supplement his role as Chairman. Despite the protests of the more libertine and populist members of the Council, Burba had come prepared, with the relevant articles that allowed the Chairman to do such things ready to be cited. Discouraged by this maneuver, the Council fell back, and allowed Burba to make his move, and make his move he did.\n\nThe Chairman has stated that the Commission will further accelerate his development programs, which are already seeing great advancement in his chosen fields. In his grand vision, the Commission shall organize the industrialization of his society in a grand ballet of requisitions, direct orders, and economic incentives. As the Metallurgical Board orders alloys to be smithed, the Logistics Board shall transport them to their destination, and the Zoning Board shall ensure that they are used precisely where they are needed to.\n\nWith a list of subdirectors directly mirroring the registry of Orenburg's true best and brightest, it seems that the Commission shall work according to any of Burba's dreams - efficient, clean, and out of the hands of those who could disturb progress."
 ORE.78.a: "This will serve us well."

 ORE.79.t: "On the State of the Economy"
 ORE.79.d: "Elected to lead the Councils on the promise of economic reform, Aleksander Burba and his league of technocratic advisors have brought a proposal to the greater council: allocate all matters related to centralized economic planning to the Council head. At first, many council members were wary; the proposition of giving direct, unchallengeable power to a clique of technocrats did not seem to fit with the decentralized governing style so common prior to Burba's assumption of power. In his address to the Council, Burba described the economy of Orenburg as "strands of hair floating from floor to roof, so fragile and without any real strength. But when laid side-by-side and weaved together, even hair wrapped thick could hoist a man to the tops of mountains." Consternation flooded the room as council members fell silent. On one hand, to cause such drastic change in such short time does require a powerful hand. But who is to know that that hand has the interests of each commune at heart? Before long the pro-autonomists and the Burbanites re-engaged in serious discussion on the Council floor, before the real bickering began. Before long Burba himself had to disrupt the aggressive name-calling and political grandstanding within the Council, and calls a vote on the matter.\n\nAs white slips are handed out, the weight of the situation falls onto those attending: betray the values of communal autonomy for the sake of a stronger economy or face the ever-changing world with a stagnant hodge-podge industrial base? Angry glances are exchanged across tabletops before the votes are retrieved and counted."
 ORE.79.a: "The technocrats have the nation's best at heart."

 ORE.80.t: "A Voice for Every Person"
 ORE.80.d: "Whatever its flaws - of which there are many - the Orenburg Commune, is, at its heart, a state of the people. The Workers' Council is nothing less than the living testament of its uncompromising commitment to the ideals of democratic governance, and the citizens under its aegis have given no inclination towards changing this state of affairs despite Chairman Burba's upheavals and newfangled reforms.\n\nBut this does not mean the Commune's direct democracy is flawless. Its newest Chairman himself has first-hand experience with its greatest flaw, as the bickering and infighting that has persisted even after the 58th Congress can attest. The glut of Councilors, each unique and passionate in their stances, has prevented consensus within Orenburg's government from forming except under exceptional occasions. For a body that holds consensus as sacrosanct? Paralysis on every level of governance.\n\nEconomic progress must not and should not be tied to the state of a paralyzed body - but would that not, some say, entail disregarding the people's say over their own economy? Chairman Burba gave his answer in the form of a message to every village, hamlet, and city across the Commune. Carried by the best couriers the Council can muster, this short message was written in plainspeak even the most illiterate grandfather can understand. On old leaves of vellum paper it read:\n\n"Bring your brightest men and women to Orenburg in seven days. The people need their skills.""
 ORE.80.a: "Everyone has a voice. Use it."

 ORE.81.t: "The Economy is a Science"
 ORE.81.d: "Chairman Aleksander Burba is painfully aware of one fact; That economy is a science, and one that must be highly refined to avoid the ruining of thousands of people's lives. To achieve the great economic renaissance the Burba is aiming for, he must look at the economy as a scientific problem to be solved, and the people and money as just another variable in this equation. With his band of economists, his cabal has been planning every aspect of the future economy; even one single fault or miscalculation in the equation will set the whole house of cards falling down to Burba's knees. Burba will not let this experiment fail like Lysenko's terrible state, however. It will flourish and truly turn Orenburg into the ruby of the Urals. Orenburg will triumph against all odds, against all enemies!"
 ORE.81.a: "The Ruby of the Urals will not fail us."

 ORE.82.t: "Old Maps, New Needs"
 ORE.82.d: "The men eyed the horizon with a gleam in their eyes. From their vantage point, they could see miles and miles of empty, virgin land, just waiting to be exploited for their own capitalistic needs. There had to be oil under all that land, there was no doubt about it. The old prospectors could practically smell it, the smell of riches. Besides, the priest had said it was hiding under the dust, and the church doesn't lie. The only issue was that nobody, not the men or the prospectors or the church, knew where that shining, slick, black gold actually lay. As they sat in their offices, frustrated and confounded by the fact that there must be oil, but they had no way of finding it, a knock came on the door. Standing outside was a short, bespectacled librarian. Perhaps the worst person to ask when looking for oil. In his hands was a collection of rolled up papers, and he introduced himself as an archivist at the national archives of Orenburg. Expecting just another bum trying to swindle himself out of his money, the capitalist was skeptical. His skepticism quickly vanished when the archivist rolled out the papers, to reveal highly detailed Soviet-era surveys of the area they were looking at. How had this not occurred to them already? Soviet surveys were widely renowned for the meticulous accuracy, and the ones presented to him showed oil fields.\n\nWithin a couple weeks, the lunar landscape had been dotted with oil wells chugging away. Progress came and went quickly in Orenburg. The future shines bright for us."
 ORE.82.a: "If the Soviets did something right, it was their maps!"

 ORE.83.t: "The Issue of the Land"
 ORE.83.d: "Current land management among the communes is utterly atrocious. Massive tracts of land are dedicated to food that is in low demand and barely touched, efficient farming methods are not known among a single man in some communes, and management of land is given to men who do not have an ounce of experience on the topic. Properly irrigated farms are unheard of and running water is a rarity for only the select few, and when it does exist, it's used in the wrong places at the wrong times for the wrong people. It is of paramount importance to the survival of our agrarian economy that we reorganize land management and ownership so the people that run the majority of our economy at least know a scrap about it. Already, overseers appointed by Aleksander Burba are taking the roles of these men. If we do effectively reorganize land management under competent leadership, the economic performance of Orenburg would largely be turned around and the state would be much more prepared for greater reforms. If we don't effectively reorganize land management, our economy could entirely collapse."
 ORE.83.a: "This is why the Workers' Council didn't work."

 ORE.84.t: "More Industrial Equipment"
 ORE.84.d: "The Ural League was once a cautious acquaintance to us. Now, we are the closest of allies. Recent 'lend lease' programs to ourselves and our comrades in the Ural League have led to a great deal of equipment, both civilian and industrial, being sent abroad, and a great deal coming in. Because of our close partnerships with our friends out east, they've generously offered to assist us in our industrialization efforts by sending us machines, cars, and blueprints produced by them. We have already sent a gift out of our own goodwill of a very large sum of cash back to them and a signed letter from Burba. In a time when we are so short of the necessary equipment we need to thrive and grow our economy, this will be of invaluable use and great assistance. Obviously, they aren't just sending us gifts out of the kindness of their own hearts; we will be great assets in their crusade against Dirlewanger and Lysenko. Nevertheless, we greatly appreciate it."
 ORE.84.a: "One hurrah for our comrades in the Urals!"

 ORE.85.t: "No More Empty Factories"
 ORE.85.d: "As the generous benefits bestowed on to us by Chairman Burba continue to come, more and more questions arise.\n\nThe empty husk of the Soviet Union has provided multiple factories for our citizens to work in, why not use them?\n\nThis morning Burba answered that question, declaring that there would be no more empty factories. The morality of this has been called into question as most citizens in Orenburg are new to the idea of industry, let alone heavy machinery. Supporters of this policy argue that the necessity of this program outweighs the possible downsides.\n\nAs more and more farmers drop their plow and head to the factory, trading there spade for a wrench, the Orenburgian economy grows. Whether these reforms will benefit Orenburg in the long run is unknown, all that is known to the average civilian is that it's time to get to work."
 ORE.85.a: "Any progress is good progress."

 ORE.86.t: "Organized Politics"
 ORE.86.d: "Politics is a messy game. It is important that caution is taken when playing said game, and that we use our turns to there maximum potential. The Council is in a mess, meetings are scheduled and never followed up upon, deadlines often get ignored until the last second, and there is little liveliness from within.\n\nBurba sees this issue and has made multiple addresses to change it, making sure it is noticed. From now on meetings will be scheduled days in advanced, and the rules will be loosened. Life will enter the Council as those in it fight for what they believe in under the roof of debate, as the Congress was made to be.\n\nThanks to the changes of Burba, the Council now has reason to clock in, to debate. Reformed for the better, the Council enters a new day once more."
 ORE.86.a: "A community bound by distaste."

 ORE.87.t: "Professionals on the Scene"
 ORE.87.d: "Dozens of councilors woke up this morning to perhaps the rudest awakening possible. On their desks were letters, all identical in text, size, and ink, imploring them to resign as quickly as possible. Burba's new council planning may not accommodate the jobs of every councilman and woman, but it sure got the job done.\n\nAnyone deemed unfit by Burba's special committee was given the letter as part of Burba's new ideal of a true, technocratic council. No longer will council members occupy positions or jobs they are neither prepared nor have the competency for.\n\nIf all goes to plan, the result of this policy will provide better relations between those in the Council and those who act in a supporting role to the Council. Unfortunately, the only thing the policy has achieved is leaving those fired considering what to do next. Not all of Aleksander Burba's grand, sweeping reforms work as they were intended."
 ORE.87.a: "At least close the door on your way out."

 ORE.88.t: "Shaken Up, Once Again"
 ORE.88.d: "Based on recent data that have flooded in from the statistics office of the Council, the gracious Chairman Burba has announced his next plan to reform The Workers' Council to greater heights. To the dread of some, these reforms will entirely change how the Council functions. Burba plans to reform the Council into an efficient political machine that will get work done correctly, and on the off chance it fails, easily correct itself and keep on marching along. However, these reforms are expensive and time-consuming. Many will be left behind in the dust. in the end, all of it will be worth the grand reformation of our aging council.\n\nAfter these changes are complete, the people will still have their traditional say, and Orenburg will still be the great state that it always had the potential to be. The only major difference will be that the Council responding to them will be far more efficient and significantly faster."
 ORE.88.a: "This man just won't stop."

 ORE.89.t: "Friends in the League"
 ORE.89.d: "The leaders of the Ural League are an odd sort. Certainly, the oddest are those who claim to represent what seems to be little more than a special forces unit with some houses.\n\nThere are those you'd expect. A variety of grizzled soldiers. Old Soviet men who had fought in this war and that, or had guarded the gulags until the Union's dying days. Slightly odder there are those who hardly age older than twenty to thirty, those who the Guard collected later on this god-forsaken trip, but soon proved themselves more than capable to lead a battalion or two. Despite their young age, these men look almost as old as their comrades, years of hiking the Urals from battle to horrifying battle having left them aging faster than any man had any right to. Any resemblance of the jovial sprightliness of the youth is totally and utterly obliterated.\n\nOdder, however, is their civilian staff. They are wizened old men, political activists, priests, and any other who had somehow earned the ire of Bukharin or his successors so long ago. They argue amongst themselves constantly, about religion and the lack thereof, about the benefits and downsides of the communal system of Orenburg, over how much they dislike the brusqueness of soldiers and the ignorance of civilians.\n\nYet the oddest part is not one certain individual It is the group. Despite these differences, these arguments, the men work in near perfect tandem. While one would think Communist soldiers, Catholic priests, and political pariahs being shoved in a prison cell would be a recipe for a quick and fatal blood match, it is clear that these men could not live without the company of their other comrades. They speak for one another as if looking into their minds, and while they bicker and fight, they fiercely defend their comrades when an outsider dares question this group.\n\nMost importantly, we are going to bring them back.\n\nEvery meeting is fascinating, every point agreed by seemingly the best minds and muscle that a cold, damned prison could offer. Not all of their suggestions are of mettle, but all warrant at least an argument. We have so much to discuss with these people, about how to improve our nations, and how to further expand our relations. Soon, we will have the largest meeting yet. We can only fear the madness that this group will bring and the insight that can only be brought by it."
 ORE.89.a: "Madness and genius are two sides of the same coin."

 ORE.90.t: "The Crucible"
 ORE.90.d: ""Run, you fucking dog!" screams one instructor.\n\n"You little cunt! If you look at me in the eyes I will break you over my damn knee! Do you know what I've seen!? Where I've been!?" another screams in the face of a young boy, no older than sixteen, who struggles to hold back tears as three other Ural Guardsmen gang up on him. Off to one side of the training field a woman is being treated for wounds from where she fell off of the obstacle course the Guardsmen had constructed, off to another, a man receives fresh ones as a Ural Guardsman slams a clipboard over his head repeatedly for failing to arrive at the field on time.\n\nThe Ural Guard have always seemed to be a truly noble sort. They laugh and joke, or sit quietly and stare off as they remember long over battles. They save lives, and move from town to town giving whatever aid they can. But this side of the Guard is a new one for all. While many volunteered to join them, or agreed to this training, expecting to be transformed into mirrors of Russia's finest overnight, they are quickly realizing that such things require far more blood and sweat than they may have expected.\n\nBut as the recruits of Anna Company, the first to begin this new hellish training regime by the Guard, begin their tenth lap on their ten kilometer run, the results are clear. Already the men and, to the chagrin of many, women of this company run with newfound surety. They breath easier, they stumble less often, and on their faces are the eyes of those ready to kill for their country."
 ORE.90.a: "Hard training for a hard battle!"

 ORE.91.t: "The Slow Alliance"
 ORE.91.d: "They're calling it the Miracle in the Urals; the bitter detente of the League-Communes relationship has now officially thawed. The election of Burba as chairman preceded a definitive break in policy regarding the League, and slowly but surely the borders along the old mountain roads to Beloretsk have become well-trodden from our sides and theirs. Joint military patrols, trade convoys and diplomatic missions have made our friendship with the Ural League an open secret, and now there is even talk in the air of establishing a permanent alliance, securing our special relationship.\n\nOf course, few on the Council dare to even joke about such things; the Communes remain beholden to socialist doctrine and to betray that would risk the collapse of popular support. It need not be mentioned that many rural Communes have voiced their displeasure, if only in spaces untraceable by internal security agents, that so much of this new diplomatic relationship is being focused on Orenburg itself.\n\nNevertheless, encouraging such thoughts through hints and comments could further improve our stance with the League and strengthen us against internal opposition. The League makes a strong support and a loyal friend, and the best kind of friends know they need never be mentioned by name to be present."
 ORE.91.a: "Perhaps miracles are real after all."

 ORE.92.t: "Orenburg's Hidden Potential"
 ORE.92.d: "When the Germans had set out to break the Russian nation, they tore apart her cities methodically. Anything of value east of the AA line had been bombed to rubble by the Luftwaffe's bombers, rendered useless. Big cities, industrial centers, military bases; almost everything that could ever help the Russian people out of its thousand year abyss had been smashed apart by the Luftwaffe.\n\nOf course, even the resources of an entire industrial nation could not produce enough bombs to flatten all of Russia. A few areas had survived the apocalypse, if not unscathed, then in not too bad a shape to still operate.\n\nAleksander Burba had ended up in Orenburg during the early stages of the Great Patriotic War. Something about the region had helped save him from the apathy that afflicted so many survivors of the former Soviet Union. Around him was a regional capital that had lived through the end of the world and the start of the new one. Its people had adapted, starved from the industrial supply chain of the Soviets. The city was big enough to maintain secondary and even tertiary education, but nothing more.\n\nAnd so Aleksander Burba had begun dreaming. Some part of him suspected it might be just be a coping mechanism. But the dream kept him going through the though times of the 40s and 50s. He had helped men of the region maintain as many factories as possible. Helped finance other ambitious men's expedition to nearby regions. Encouraged the youth of Orenburg to become traders, engineers, politicians, and scientists, to help him keep his dream of wealth and progress alive.\n\nBurba knew all too well that his vision of a prosperous Orenburg could only succeed in the future. Too many institutions needed rebuilding. Crude tools were needed to build slightly better tools, and so on until Orenburg's industrial base could once again create modernity. His dream was a gradual one, unlike Georgy Malenkov's disastrous idea of a great leap forward. Order and progress could be restored in time, the scientist knew. He only needed patience, and a little bit of luck. "
 ORE.92.a: "Let the German destroy. We Russians will build a future of glass and steel."

 ORE.93.t: "Backed by Force"
 ORE.93.d: "After weeks of training, the newly reformed Orenburg Defense Force took their fist real duty of protecting the trade routes our convoys pass by to deliver goods to the numerous communes the road leads to. Ever since the war those roads have been dangerous, with bandits taking goods off every merchant and traveler without any fear of being caught, for the militias that used to guard Orenburg were nothing more than a band of good-for-nothing teenagers and old men wanting to relieve their glory days. With poor human material and an inefficient command structure, the militias would run scared at the first sound of gunfire. But this time there was a surprise prepared for the bandits, for they attacked not the old and ineffective militias, but the reformed and efficient Orenburg Defense Force, trained on the model of the powerful Ural Guard and capable of dealing with any threat they encounter, and repelling it with ease.\n\nA party of bandits were on the prowl on near Orenburg, and after seeing a trading caravan stopped on the side of the road for a rest, the bandits were sure they would soon gain some easy loot. Little did they know it was a trap laid down by Anna Company. It was all over less than five minutes after the start of the ambush, after a brutal firefight all the bandits were left dead, and no militiaman suffered even a scratch. The next raiding party will think twice before attacking Orenburg."
 ORE.93.a: "Orenburg is defenseless no more."

 ORE.94.t: "United Together"
 ORE.94.d: "The portents are grim, and the mad hordes of Dirlewanger and Lysenko are gathering on the horizon, ready to feast. Or, that is the impression gained from studying the preparations of the Ural League and the militias of Orenburg. Guardsmen and Militiamen coordinate flawlessly in their exercises, finally starting to work together as a unified power against the forces of darkness to the East. However, this arrangement needs to be formalized, so that the bonds the two societies share shall be cast in ink, as well as blood and steel.\n\nThe Southern Ural United Defense League, a formal pact that shall cement our commitment to mutual defense in the immutable bonds of bureaucracy. Finally, as our soldiers have been united, our politicians and diplomats shall be as well. Let them come, let the dogs of war crash against our fortifications like waves in the ocean! They will find us unbroken, standing hand-in-hand against both the icy soullessness of Magnitogorsk and the warm, bloody viciousness of Dirlewanger."
 ORE.94.a: "It needs wait only for the word of the Council."
 ORE.94.b: "Unfortunately, we must decline."

 ORE.95.t: "The Crown with the Jewel"
 ORE.95.d: "While the city of Orenburg has become the shining jewel of the Urals, and while all know by now of the great advances that the city has seen, a lesser celebrated but equally great change has come to the peasant communes surrounding it. The great renaissance of the city has required much from the surrounding land. Dozens of new farms have been built and even more, have been completely rebuilt and modernized. Complexes of factories and mines now fill the landscape. These, of course, all require the infrastructure necessary to get in and out. And all roads lead to Orenburg.\n\nWith roads come security. A road is useless if a bandit can simply raid whoever travel along it, so outposts now dot the landscape to ensure that those traveling down them can do so without the ever-present fear of attack. These posts require money to run, so the poor now find work alongside the soldiers, collecting tolls for the state from those who pass by. Of course, these workers and these soldiers need places to stay, so smaller villages and settlements have grown around them. And with this security and with so many dotting the landscape, numerous messenger posts, courier businesses and hostels for travelers have appeared as well.\n\nFor these businesses to open, they require those who can work them. Not only is the state now developing the land, but the various businesses have begun sponsoring schools for both adults and children, causing literacy rates to near pre-war levels. As the growing class of writers expands, they too require cafes to meet at, newspapers to flip through, and books to put in little libraries.\n\nBut what if writing is not enough? This singular thought led to the construction of a radio station at Sol-Iletsk, one of the less than a dozen to be constructed in Russia in the last twenty years. Already they talk of finding a way to trade with the outside world. To get televisions! Televisions!\n\nThe city of Orenburg may be the shining jewel, but can anyone say that the Oblast is not becoming a fitting crown? Thank Comrade Burba, for the future is here!"
 ORE.95.a: "...and the stock-market report?"

 ORE.96.t: "Accepting the League's Offer"
 ORE.96.d: "The Ural League has extended an offer to form an alliance with our humble communes. We are, of course, eager to accept! After several hours of debate, a near-unanimous conclusion was reached determining that an alliance with the League was clearly in our best interests. The Ural League has proven themselves as effective protectors of the weak and defenseless in the region, and they would make excellent allies against both the madmen in Magnitogorsk and Dirlewanger's band of brigands. For what reason do we have to say no?\n\nAlready, the militias of Orenburg and the Ural League's finest are meeting to discuss strategies and plan for the inevitable invasions from both Magnitogorsk and Dirlewanger's men."
 ORE.96.a: "Together we ride!"

 ORE.97.t: "Orenburg Stands Alone!"
 ORE.97.d: "The League's offer has been weighed, the commune's council sought, the votes and Die cast. It has taken many hours of furious and intense debate, but the answer to the League has been returned: "No."\n\nOrenburg must stand apart from the Ural League. It is better that Orenburg lives, or dies on it's own two feet, on the strength of our communes and their democracy and morals, than it is to be subsumed into the mass of the Ural League, and lose it's frail independence. This is a difficult decision to make, as it means spurning the League's implicit defense pacts against Magnitogorsk and Dirlewanger, the Black Mountain and the Black Band. For better or for worse, Orenburg stands alone. For what reason would we have said yes anyway, we can stand alone! We will need to rally the militias, and plan for a future without the League's backing. It is the hope for many of the commune leaders that our relationship will not be unduly affected by this termination of the League's kind offer."
 ORE.97.a: "We'll forge our own destiny."

 ORE.98.t: "Malenkov's Triumph!"
 ORE.98.d: "After years of anarchy and degeneration, it seems that now, with the wise and benevolent reforms of our beloved Chairman, Orenburg is finally blazing its way to progress at a pace never before seen. However, this pace has come fraught with dangers - instability, famine, and death due to our rapid progress.\n\nThe Chairman has, thus, ordered the programs relaxed, the quotas dropped, and declared a People's Holiday for all of Orenburg to celebrate. Let the dead be honored, for their sacrifice has brought us into the iridescent red dawn! Let their children be cared for, and informed that their parents gave their all for the greater good! For if not the greater good, what must we as a society stand for? The reactionaries in the Urals may accuse us of shedding innocent blood in the name of progress, but we must reply with a statement of plain and simple truth - Orenburg has been elevated, and the losses are acceptable. They will be honored forever as heroes, and march along with their comrades evermore in spirit.\n\nLet the red glow of progress sweep the nation, let the clouds of soot above us serve as a reminder of our glory! Let the Chairman stand in front of his teeming masses, ecstatic in the glory that he has brought upon Orenburg! For we are all his children, to be treated with kindness and fairness, liberated from the black womb of anarchism. Under his benevolent guidance, we may fly too close to the Sun, and willingly sacrifice ourselves for the greater good of the commune, but surely it will be all worth it in the end."
 ORE.98.a: "Glory to the Commune! Glory to the Chairman!"

 ORE.101.t: "A Communal Dispute Turns to Violence"
 ORE.101.d: "The Workers' Council in Orenburg city emerged from the long standing tradition of seeking mediation to inter-communal disputes. However this tradition of mediation and subsequent arbitration has not completely squashed the other tradition of open violence between feuding communes that refuse to seek peaceful compromise.\n\nThis morning forces belonging to one commune's militia opened fire on militiamen of a neighboring commune. Early reports from the violent confrontation tell of a conflict over access to disputed grazing land. With blood spilled by one faction, it is almost certain that retaliations in kind are being prepared by the friends and families of the dead.\n\nMany on the Council argue that in these times of crisis, open warfare between nominally allied communes cannot be allowed to continue. They insist on trying to broker some sort of ceasefire while the Council works on a peaceful solution to the dispute. Other, more radically inclined councilmen argue to ask the neighboring Ural League to send in peacekeepers to separate the two northern communes.\n\nNeither of the two options are free in terms of resources or political capital. Help from the league would probably strengthen the rumours of an imminent take over by our northern neighbors. An equally vocal faction of the Council simply argues for us to do nothing about the problem and let the violent idiots fight it out. The people of Orenburg could not possibly be further disappointed by Council inaction at this point..."
 ORE.101.a: "Move some of our agenda to another date and call a special council session to negotiate a ceasefire."
 ORE.101.b: "Ask the League to misplace some of their frontier troops in the contested land."
 ORE.101.c: "Let them fight it out. This will at least train our troops a little..."

 ORE.102.t: "A New Type of Secessionist"
 ORE.102.d: "The Council is used to communes announcing their departure from the Workers' Council. These secession are inevitably the result of villagers deciding they'd rather try to make it on their own instead of remaining shackled to the dying corpse of our workers' democracy. Concerns over the economy, security or democratic representation usually figure in the reason for their departure.\n\nToday a representative from a northern commune has begun a familiar type of speech lambasting the Council as incapable and corrupt. To this was added a common theme of failure to provide security against bandits and outsiders. Our men on the Council patiently waited for the representative to announce his commune's withdrawal from the Workers' Council when the bombshell dropped: the commune would leave Orenburg and apply for the Ural League's protection!\n\nIgnoring the roar of indignation, the representative summed up his speech with the observation that without an effective military the communes of Orenburg were doomed to annihilation. Why not instead join a sensible government and abandon the democratic anarchy for safety?\n\nWhile many of our faction agree with the representative's arguments, this secession has sparked a firestorm of protest. Many on the Council argue that we must convince this commune to change their plans, lest the Workers' Council lose even more credibility. The doves propose increased investments in the departing commune, while the hawks hint that the secessionist's security might be threatened by their betrayal of Orenburg."
 ORE.102.a: "Our hands are tied."
 ORE.102.b: "Those blasted traitors!"

 ORE.103.t: "Reformer Factions Brawl in the Market Square"
 ORE.103.d: "While the dominant political coalition in the city of Orenburg is a union of factions that desires to see reform and industrialization, this does not mean that the city is free from the endless infighting that affects every political grouping in the Workers' Council.\n\nYesterday a violent incident occurred in the bustling market square between proponent of Comrade Malenkov's socialist centralism and the traders and engineers that follow Comrade Burba's technocratic, yet democratically influenced ideas. No one can agree on who lit the fuse of this explosive barrel; Malenkov's men argue that they were merely protesting Burba's anti-socialist ideas while Burba's people accuse the Malenkovite of sending thugs to intimidate them.\n\nWhile we certainly wish that our politics were above such vulgarities as "who has more burly men on the street", it's difficult to argue that a little violence doesn't sharpen a faction's street cred. As both sides spend today recuperating and mending broken bones, it turns out that the victors of the brawl were..."
 ORE.103.a: "Burba's men. Who knew these fat cats could throw punches? "
 ORE.103.b: "Malenkov's group. They certainly planned their ambush of the market very well."

 ORE.104.t: "Ural Blossoms"
 ORE.104.d: ""A thousand years, you said, as our hearts melted. I look at the hands that once held mine, and my heart still aches." - Lady Heguri\n\nShe is beautiful, standing there in the swaying pines. I know this moment will be lost if I say a single word, so I hold my tongue, and it passes. Every day, for a moment, I will take it out of my heart, dust it off and for a single shining second I will find her again.\n\n"I hate and I love." We were always arguing, always at odds; the son of a landlord, the daughter of a trade unionist. Class warfare in action, as some called it. How surprised they were to see us exchange blows for kisses, fury for passion. Guns for roses.\n\nIt became clear to us that our love, borne in fire, would quickly perish in flame were we to stay. In both families was the mutual hatred that destroys all sense, and we foundered against it. Crying, she fled to our secret place hidden outside the city. And together we planned our escape.\n\n"Beyond the notions of right and wrong, there is a field. I will meet you there." - Rumi\n\nThe day has come. We sneak out in giant baskets, like Moses hidden in the bulrushes, on a convoy bound for distant Kazakhstan, where they say the Poles have taken root. Lotuses blossom in the mud, and perhaps we could too. Now she poses for a picture, smiling, laughing, her hair a golden banner in the wild air.\n\nMy beloved one spoke to me, saying: Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. And so I did."
 ORE.104.a: "Love shines bright in the darkness."

 ORE.105.t: "Trial of a Famous Criminal"
 ORE.105.d: "While Dirlewanger's Black Brigade has diligently maintained its reputation as the most vicious pack of bandits across Russia these past few years, the competition has been tough. This time a famous criminal from the Kazakh steppes has been caught after his men tried to retreat from looting a commune at the Orenburg-Kazakh border. The common criminals were gunned down, while the bandit leader was captured and dragged to Orenburg for a trial.\n\nThe population has not been impressed with this idea of a public trial when the mountain of evidence for the bandit's misdeeds would make any defense lawyer blush. "Turn him over to the people for some real justice!" the crowd outside the trial chants. This has not swayed the jury too much, as they continue discussing his fate. Many suggest humiliating the bandit before leaving him to die, naked in the Kazakh steppes. Making the man rot in public would show the power of Orenburg's legal system, and reassure the crowd of the bandit's demise. Others have brought a more radical idea forward: why not use the arrest of this famed bandit to inaugurate a new penal system? This first prisoner can be joined by any future bandit we capture to spend the rest of their life toiling in a penal colony outside of Orenburg city. This power play would strengthen the idea of Orenburg's government as a source of justice and order, and help us centralize the region further as our government amasses more power and legitimacy.\n\nThe plan's critics criticize the idea of keeping the man alive when he denied his victims any mercy. Giving him a life sentence is likely to trigger riots in the streets. On the other hand, many among the jury agree that just letting the mob have its way would make us popular in the short time, but hurt our long term efforts to centralize justice on our courts."
 ORE.105.a: "The people rule in Orenburg and any that doubt this rule are free to face the people's wrath."
 ORE.105.b: "Humiliation will end his bandit career. The steppes shall do likewise for his life."
 ORE.105.c: "He will pay for his crimes by living out a life of tedium and hard work in our new penal system."

 ORE.106.t: "Crisis in the Communes"
 ORE.106.d: "Across the communes, an angry mob assembled demanding justice against an extremely controversial councilor. The mob has declared that the Councilor has actively tried to undermine their rights and needs to face swift and immediate justice. Although the anger against the counselor is very much real, we do not know for sure if it is warranted. From the time he has served he has been an adequate member of the communes.\n\nHowever, even with a lack of evidence, his means are well-known. Whenever he needs to get something passed in the Council; He would visit the other legislators to pressure them and make sure they support his decision. He would appoint some of his close friends to commune positions, whether they deserve it or not. There are rumors that in private he has expressed some reactionary opinions, although we are unsure if this is true. Whether the case we will have to take action.\n\nSome people in the committee believe we should give him a slap on the wrist and let him walk. Others believe that there should be a due process and a proper investigation. Some have even advocated for mob justice. But ultimately the common consensus is..."
 ORE.106.a: "He should be given a second chance."
 ORE.106.b: "The committee shall decide your fate."
 ORE.106.c: "Let them at him!"

 ORE.107.t: "Soldiers without Borders"
 ORE.107.d: "A small column marched into Orenburg, waving white flags, but still carrying a small arsenal of rifles, machine guns and grenades, all relics of the old Soviet Union. The Orenburg soldiers who escorted them into the city were at first puzzled to see that many of them spoke Russian with a strange, heavy accent - many of them barely spoke it at all. These men were clearly veterans however, and as it became clear that they meant no harm, it was revealed that they were actually the 1st Czechoslovak Army Battalion, or at least what was left of it. These soldiers hail from one of the lands the Nazis first sunk their fangs into, Czechoslovakia. As their nation was doomed to fall, they chose to continue on the struggle from the Soviet Union, retreating into Russia. Once again, fortune did not favor them, for they were once again forced into disarray and retreat when the Union fell apart under the blows of the Wehrmacht.\n\nThe 1st Czechoslovak Battalion refused to surrender, however - they wore their colors with pride as anarchy overtook Russia, eventually retreating into the Urals and becoming a wandering band of mercenaries. Now, after years of wandering and fighting, they have finally reached Orenburg, where they ask for nothing but shelter and a permanent accommodation. In exchange, they will offer their military expertise in defense of the city against anyone who would threaten it. Many have expressed their desire to welcome them with open arms, as comrades in the struggles against bandits and other menaces. However some feel that these additional mouths to feel might be a bit too much for the already struggling economy of Orenburg, and that the Ural League would be a more fitting place for them in any case. Finally, a few dissenting voices have emerged, insinuating that Orenburg simply can't trust these people, who might be nothing more than bandits in disguise."
 ORE.107.a: "They are welcome to join our ranks!"
 ORE.107.b: "Let them join the League instead"
 ORE.107.c: "These people cannot be trusted"

 ORE.108.t: "Servant to the Black Mountain?"
 ORE.108.d: "Disturbing whispers have recently begun to circle around the Commander of the Orenburg City Militia, Alexander Rodimtsev. From seemingly nowhere, a grip of paranoia has clutched the citizenry of Orenburg, claiming that they have irrefutable evidence that Commander Rodimtsev is working under the shadow of the Black Mountain, under the cruel gaze of Magnitogorsk. When asked for evidence on those claims, one is always directed to another who warned the former of Rodimtsev's treachery. While passive investigation makes these claims look completely foolish, it does concern some on how such a rumor would begin in the first place. Perhaps somebody has seen something, and perhaps the Commander is truly a double agent. It wouldn't be totally absurd to begin a small, quiet investigation to look into Commander Rodimtsev's dealings, but it may just turn out to be gossip in poor taste."
 ORE.108.a: "This is ludicrous! Pay no heed."
 ORE.108.b: "Perhaps we should investigate."

 ORE.109.t: "The Mysterious Travelers"
 ORE.109.d: "The sun was rising above the fields of the Urals and Orenburg just started its rich and crowded life when a large group people surrounded by the Kazakh steppe horses dragging huge loads of foreign wealth arrived before the gates of the city. Even though they were of the same nationality, they did not resemble each other. Some of them were dressed like if they were Germans or Balts, other, in spite of their Slavic appearance, wore turbans and kaftans, and some of them even combined the elements of the Western and Eastern clothing together in their attire. They spoke a familiar, yet still incomprehensible language, with only several of them speaking very basic Russian with a very hissing accent. As it became clear that those people did not want to bring any harm, they were allowed to enter Orenburg.\n\nThe exotic gifts were shared among the locals in a matter of hours, but this wasn't what interested the residents of Orenburg about the guests. They wanted to learn about who were those people and what country they came from. As it turned out, the travelers came to Orenburg from the lands of Western Kazakhstan, but they themselves were of the Polish blood. Like Russia, Poland was butchered by the German invaders a long ago and many of the Polish sons and daughters were sent to meet their death in the frozen wastes of Siberia and desert steppes of Kazakhstan. But Poland survived. The proud Polish people did not succumb to their fate and settled beyond the reach of Germany, building a new hope for their kin.\n\nStaying for some time in the city, the Polish caravan left the city after the second night and went to an unknown direction. No matter where they went, the foreign travelers left the best impression on the locals, who sympathized with their sorrowful fate of losing the home to a foreign bloodthirsty occupant."
 ORE.109.a: "Good luck, travelers..."

 ORE.110.t: "Harvest Feast"
 ORE.110.d: "Yet another year has passed, and it's time to celebrate. for the great Harvest Feast is upon Orenburg! Every autumn, following the completion of the annual harvest, the citizenry of the city and the communes join together in exultant celebration, indulging in the fruits of their labour. It's seemingly the one day our 'nation' is fully united, the one day we forget our problems and hatred. There's a beauty in the present, and today we find it anew. This year, the Harvest Feast is predicted to be especially grand thanks to good harvests. Furthermore, the Orenburg City Council has agreed to provide funding and assist in organization. As a result, the upcoming Harvest Feast will be the largest ever, in both sheer attendance and food on offer. It's very clear the people are excited, with many leaving villages months in advance for Orenburg city in preparation for the celebration. As the sun sets, the ceremonial trumpets sound; following a short and optimistic speech by an Orenburg City Councillor, the gates to the feast are opened. Mere seconds pass till the tsunami of starving peasants rushes into the venue, with cheers being heard for miles as the festivities began. The people eat well, many dance well into the night, and many stumble around the event after imbibing liquor too strong for them. The collective at large is nevertheless massively impressed by the event, seeing it as a thoughtful display by the Orenburg City Council, and they've already begun reaping the benefits of this success as their popularity increases among the populace. The nation is united, if only for a day and night."
 ORE.110.a: "Can't wait for next year!"

 ORE.111.t: "Malenkov Demands Action after the Villages Secede"
 ORE.111.d: "Malenkov's shock was massive when the villages seceded from Orenburg. To him, it was the biggest betrayal to him when he saw the secession from those villages. All those years that he worked to build the commune with his comrades that he sometimes disagreed with. All those years, he made an effort to reform it with the allies that clamored to him. And in all those years he dreamed that he can bring communism back to the motherland, under a stronger central ruler. This betrayal made him furious and with his rage, he went to the halls of Orenburg and told the rest of his comrades that it was time to centralize in order to face the larger Nazi threat."
 ORE.111.a: "Orenburg needs central leadership and and it needs it now"

 ORE.112.t: "Provoked Secession"
 ORE.112.d: "In Aleksander Burba's eyes, the mere idea of villages attempting to secede from Orenburg and merge with the Ural League is but a symptom of the failure of Orenburg's current model. Burba believes that the only way to convince these secessionist villages to stay with Orenburg, and even further prevent it from ever happening again, is through an aggressive campaign of reform. Orenburg itself cannot exist forever, not in its current state, and the only way for any of them to have a future is to pursue industrial progress and proper organization of the state.\n\nNo longer can Orenburg exist as a set of decentralized communes, ones that cannot protect themselves as a state, much less as a group of individual communes. Burba's beliefs are why he is one of the major figures in the reformists of Orenburg, and it is his ideas that very well may just lead Orenburg into a future that can withstand the trials and tribulations that all of the shattered Russian landscape faces. It is a shame to lose these villages now, it will be a travesty to lose the entire nation."
 ORE.112.a: "Burba, guide us into the future!"

 ORE.113.t: "The Party Splits"
 ORE.113.d: "The old joke goes that if you gather two Orenburgians, you will find three doctrines; gather three, and you will find four traitors to the cause; gather four and the party will split. It turns out this joke was better left to the taverns and the pubs of Orenburg, for it has now been proven explosively true in its Council. Left unity has collapsed in the city as the two cliques formed by Burba and Malenkov renounce all ties with each other, calling each other deviationists and destroyers of party unity and Marxist orthopraxy.\n\nIt is a sad irony that the party faction they had initially rallied around had wished for nothing more than reform; but as the two grew increasingly disillusioned with each other, the definitions of that reform diverged to the point that they became irreconcilable. Burba's market socialism and free-flow industrial development plans became intolerable to the authoritarian Marxist hardliner Malenkov, and vice versa.\n\nNow the two are in open competition for the place of Chairman, and the Communes watch with a mix of horror and fascination. And in the quiet, the cliques talk to grey eminences and power-brokers, and prepare themselves. The final struggle for the purity of the Revolution is here, and each are determined they will win. for the other there is only the dustbin of history."
 ORE.113.a: "Let us try to avoid the expected jokes, Comrades."

 ORE.114.t: "Malenkov's Offer"
 ORE.114.d: "Recently, Malenkov has been traveling around the edges of Orenburg's sphere of influence, talking with local leaders and speaking to the commune councils. This little commune tour is very clear in its purpose: uniting the fringe communities under Malenkov so that he can gain more power. He has done little to mask his ambition, but that hasn't stopped many from seriously considering his offers.\n\nMalenkov speaks of how the union is designed to foster cooperation between communes. His definition of cooperation is two entities helping each other, not one exploiting the other. Thus, if these villages put their support behind Malenkov, he'll just as quickly put his support behind them. No longer will they be exploited by Orenburg, no, Orenburg will serve them! The resources and administration of the Jewel of the Urals will be theirs, and all because they simply put their support behind the best candidate. Not too shabby, eh?\n\nWhile many have been enticed, it remains to be seen how effective Malenkov's efforts will prove to be."
 ORE.114.a: "He's quite the charmer, it seems."
 ORE.114.b: "We appreciate but don't need his help."

 ORE.115.t: "Token Support"
 ORE.115.d: "Burba's next strategy for building support in Orenburg is to venture outside of Orenburg itself and to attempt to connect with those who live in the border regions of Orenburg. Burba believes that if he can manage to get the support of the borders, his victory will be indisputable by those like Malenkov. However, Malenkov begins to stir as Burba leaves Orenburg to begin talks with those in the outskirts of the country. Again trying to subvert any action Burba makes, Malenkov tries to rally his own support behind him in a new smear campaign against the newly christened hypocrite Burba.\n\nMalenkov claims that Burba actually doesn't care at all about any of the border communes, or in fact any of the people at all who remain outside of the cities. He goes on to say that Burba only represents the cities, by promising to make their lives easier and provide more for them, while he goes on to the border regions to promise them sweet nothings in exchange for helping him take control. He advises the border regions to ignore any attempts from Burba to serenade them to his cause, and instead pledges to the outskirts that he is the one that will keep them safe and protected in the face of the harshness of Russia. A sizable amount of support for both of them lies outside of the cities, and time will only tell if they buy into either's words."
 ORE.115.a: "Burba bribes Malenkov's secretary."
 ORE.115.b: "Burba sweet talks the border regions."
 ORE.115.c: "Burba stays silent."

 ORE.116.t: "A Bribe"
 ORE.116.d: "It wasn't too much money slipped under the table, at least in terms of government. Maybe only a few ten thousand. Enough to get the job done. Enough to satisfy the old secretary. And it would certainly be worth it.\n\nThe next day, it was in every newspaper and every man's mouth. Collectivization. Centralization. A return to the tyranny of communism and the scourge of the USSR. Nobody would stand for this. Nobody would stand for yet another Bukharin or Yagoda. Yet, Malenkov had done it. Even if the conversation was in private, and only in consideration of the idea, he had said those terrifying words. The words that made anybody over the age of 30 quivers with the fear of by-gone times. A regression decades back was not a grand march forward to the future. There was no progress in communism. Only derelict buildings and lies. Malenkov's facade of socialism for the people had been torn down, and all that remained was a broken and rotting foundation. The aging old communist was done for good. "
 ORE.116.a: "The bribes showed the people the truth, nothing more."

 ORE.117.t: "Shit."
 ORE.117.d: "Our noble, thankless job of teaching the people the faults of that devil, Malenkov, have been exposed. The secretary that we may have slipped a little sum to, has publicly announced our secret deal. The people could not be more furious. The government leader they entrusted with power has broken that trust and only shown the people more of what they despise. Even with Burba's denial (and apology) of the bribes, protesters rock the city and capital of Orenburg. They demand democracy and anti-corruption measures. We will show them democracy, just as once as they burn Malenkov. Worse yet, the actually important news about Malenkov's obsession with radical collectivization have gone ignored and even celebrated!"
 ORE.117.a: "It wasn't even that much cash!"

 ORE.118.t: "Burba's Blunders"
 ORE.118.d: "As of late, Burba has been working hard to bring the border communes to his side, hoping to gain another base of support and avoid tensions with the hardy villagers. He has sent envoys to many communes and even tried to visit a few himself. Unfortunately for him, it seems that a desire to cooperate for any reason is not mutual, as he has been rejected by the towns he attempts to court at every turn.\n\nBurba was denied a meeting from the start, with the leaders of a tiny village straightforwardly rejecting him. That set the tone of his attempts from then on, as every single one of the border communities he has tried to speak with has rejected a meeting with him. No matter how hard he tries or what he offers, it seems as though they are set on working against him. They will never do business with him, and it looks as though he will have to find supporters and allies elsewhere in the union."
 ORE.118.a: "Better luck next time, Burba."

 ORE.119.t: "A Third Option"
 ORE.119.d: "The infinite series of blows and counterblows from Aleksander Burba and Georgy Malenkov has caused quite a few of the reformists to reject both and attempt to find their own way to modernize Orenburg into what it was meant to be. Believing the idea of a single chairman has already shown its faults from the cutthroat competition from the two reformists, the new group of reformers have already started to form major support in the villages surrounding Orenburg.\n\nThey have begun to arm themselves with the old Western belief of actually cycling through different Chairmen, electing new ones at different intervals of time. This belief has mostly come out of nowhere, having seen no precedent or support in the reformists up until now, and is quite worrying to both Burba and Malenkov. It would be a great embarrassment to both to be defeated by a faction formed by their own competition, and now both have a third, growing faction breathing down their necks.\n\nThis situation is only made more critical by Burba using his economic influence to order a trade embargo of the villages - without drastic action, many fear that they will begin to starve."
 ORE.119.a: "Intensify the embargo."
 ORE.119.b: "Gerrymander the secessionists' borders."
 
 ORE.120.t: "The Towns are Cut Off"
 ORE.120.d: "Those rebellious towns that decided they would not follow the orders from Orenburg have received funding from the communist devil, Malenkov. His attempts to woo the towns have totally failed, however. An agent of Malenkov was found smuggling himself out of Orenburg and heading towards one of the towns with a bag full of cash in his hand. After being caught by a passing loyalist militia, the man bit into a cyanide pill and collapsed. But the bag of cash and the letter he carried did not vanish with him, and they were released to the public last morning. Detailing Malenkov's overtures to the secessionist communes, they were full of hints of corruption from prominent councilors, even insinuating Burba himself in a scandal. The sack of cash certainly didn't help his case either. Now, the public is in uproar at Malenkov. At least we've got one good thing out of this whole diplomatic fiasco."
 ORE.120.a: "Where the fuck did he get cyanide!?"

 ORE.121.t: "Relief from Malenkov"
 ORE.121.d: "As per Burba's fears, the cunning Georgy Malenkov has managed to subvert his blockade of the opposing cities. Hoping to use this against Burba and present himself as the better choice, Malenkov has seen fit to personally divert funds into those towns. Done so in a subversive way as to not be caught, Malenkov has brought relief to the towns being crippled by Burba's siege. While their ideology opposing both Malenkov and Burba has brought them into this situation in the first place, those in the towns that supported Malenkov in the first place have begun to use this as an opportunity to sway the third faction that have taken control of the towns.\n\nMalenkov, in this regard, has found success subverting Burba, and his hopes to draw support into his bloc after this may turn out to be successful. Barring any ideology, Malenkov has greatly helped the denizens of Orenburg's hinterlands, and Burba's plot may be working against him. Malenkov is pleased with his own success, drawing in the third group with help rather than schemes."
 ORE.121.a: "Communist funding, huh?"

 ORE.122.t: "A Successful Siege"
 ORE.122.d: "Burba's plot to force the villages to support him was successful. His trade embargo to the villages surrounding Orenburg caused those wanting neither Burba nor Malenkov to either stick to their ideals...or go without basic necessities. As the siege began, their ideas were reinforced by the fact that both Burba and Malenkov attempted to plot against them instead of reconcile with them, but as time went on and supplies ran low, ideology seemed to not matter as much. Those in the villages that supported Burba began to grow louder and louder as they pleaded with village heads to end the trade embargo by accepting Burba.\n\nFinally, those villages caved in. Burba's complete shutout of those hinterland villages grew too much for most of the people within them to handle. Burba was pleased that his plot had worked, without giving Malenkov any time to find a way to turn it in his favor. Now, in exchange for loyalty and support to his name, Burba will once again allow those villages to trade with Orenburg. It seems that the cause of reform is willing to leave no compromise."
 ORE.122.a: "Burba's claim pushes further."

 ORE.123.t: "Without Food, Without Supplies"
 ORE.123.d: "Burba's complete embargo of Orenburg to the villages that surround it grows worse by the day, but Malenkov's latest scheme to get them on his side has worsened their problems to the point where they have surrendered to him. Malenkov, in response to a drawn out embargo and the villages weakening, saw it prudent to suddenly redraw the borders of the communes. Of course, when the communes were redrawn, the villages suddenly lost all of their farmlands.\n\nMalenkov's ploy was a devastating one, removing the farmlands from a series of farmer villages meant that they were completely crippled. Anything Burba could've done bar killing them would've suddenly looked paltry compared to Malenkov taking away all that they live for. The stress in the villages rose rapidly, those that support neither growing loudest in their righteousness but quietest in their plans of action. Those that support Malenkov suddenly began to beg with a new ferocity for the village leaders to support Malenkov and end their self-inflicted punishment.\n\nAnd so it was that the village leaders pledged support to Malenkov, who suddenly saw some grievous errors with his redrawn borders. In exchange for support for his claims, Malenkov would go through the arduous effort of restoring their farmlands to them. Burba could only curse to himself as the entire series of villages began to pledge their support for Malenkov."
 ORE.123.a: "Malenkov creeps closer to Orenburg."

 ORE.124.t: "Burba's Speech"
 ORE.124.d: ""Comrades! Citizens! I speak to you today to address the many woes which the recent times have brought us, as uncertainty and indecisiveness on our part has caused much strife and division among our people. I do not know the names of each of you - I do not know about your daily work, about your families and your lives. But there is one thing I know - the people of Orenburg and of the communes deserve better than this! Their hardships must not be squandered in a poorly functioning government, barely capable to provide for the people! In these trying times, it may be tempting to listen to the promises of demagogues, who by evoking the spectres of old ideologies, do nothing but foment more violence. I say that we should not build our state on ideologies, empty promises and vague ideals - we should build for the people, through the labour of the people!"\n\nBurba briefly pauses, upon receiving much applause. He breathes in, and continues his oration.\n\n"Our great city is home to many men who can guide the people to prosperity and peace. We are home to engineers, technicians, industrialists and scientists who have worked all their lives with nothing in mind but the good of Orenburg and her citizens. If so, why should we let our government be run by cliques of politicians, or through endless meetings in which nothing is achieved? To create a stable, prosperous future, we must put our faith in the best and brightest among us, who shall lead us into the new age. The light of our city shall shine ever brighter, and we shall soon be the envy of all Russia!""
 ORE.124.a: "He shall lead us to glory, let us coup the government!"
 ORE.124.b: "He does seem convincing."

 ORE.125.t: "Burba Arrested!"
 ORE.125.d: "Tragic news! Burba's last speech caused disorders and clashes within the city, eventually escalating into a full scale riot. As Burba's supporters clashed with Malenkov's communists, as well as whole crowds of civilians who opposed both politicians, the whole situation degenerated into a massive three way brawl that raged across the streets of all Orenburg. Attempting to use the confusion to his advantage, it seems that Aleksandr Burba attempted to assume full control of the government, ordering his most trusted supporters to storm the palace where the Workers' Council holds its meetings.\n\nIn the ensuing melee, the local communal militias and city watch managed to capture Burba and his men off guard, and trap them in an alley, where they were arrested en masse. Although many of them were released the next day due to overcrowding in Orenburg's single jail, Burba's reputation is in tatters, and it seems that his career as a politician is over. Meanwhile, on his left, Malenkov claims victory for his side, claiming that he had prior knowledge of Burba's coup, and was acting in the interests of the people of Orenburg to put an end to his 'reactionary, fascist madness.'\n\nWhile some distrust the radical Marxist, many of the Council seem to believe that this is an accurate description of the events that occurred, and even the rural peasantry has voiced support to Malenkov for stopping the right wing's bid for power in its tracks."
 ORE.125.a: "Who would have seen it coming?"

 ORE.126.t: "Opposition for a Price"
 ORE.126.d: "Georgy Malenkov has seen fit to counter Burba's growing influence by handsomely rewarding a few key men to ignite a raging riot right in the center of Orenburg. Malenkov picked one certain man, a passionate orator and a keen firebrand, to march and collect all of those who oppose Burba's way of thinking. Instructed to make their grievances known for all to see, Malenkov has made sure to let them know that they are free to do as they please, as long as it cuts down support for the hated Aleksander Burba.\n\nThe strike leader did as he was paid for, and rallied a pleasing crowd to kick and scream their way into the center of Orenburg. Already, they throw bricks and shout Burba's name with spite on their tongues. This riot will be, if it manages to rage on, a sore embarrassment for the industrial magnate. As it concludes, Malenkov will surely be able to insinuate that no such riot has broken out in his name. With that, he waits for news about the riot in Orenburg, hoping it will suit his claim well."
 ORE.126.a: "Send in the Militia!"
 ORE.126.b: "Wait it out!"

 ORE.127.t: "Riot Crashers"
 ORE.127.d: "Malenkov's futile attempt to counter Aleksander Burba's growing influence has been quashed. Burba utilized his growing influence in Orenburg, and ordered local militia leaders to put an end to the riot. The militia leaders complied, and quickly militia units began to deploy to put a halt to the riot. The ill-fated protest could not stand up to a sudden military presence, and quickly began to disperse. in the chaos, the one paid off by Malenkov to ignite tensions and start a riot was chased down and apprehended by militiamen.\n\nWith the riot leader in tow, Burba is given the interesting decision as to what he wants to do with the riot leader. Burba sees two, equally reasonable options. He can either pardon this riot leader, which might be seen as a gesture of solidarity and cooperation amongst the people. On the other hand, the riot leader might move on to continue raising tensions. Alternatively, Burba could order this riot leader and his crew banned from political action, removing a firebrand from his list of threats and feeding into his own popularity. Of course, such an action might be viewed as tyrannical and be unpopular. Burba is left to think about such a problem, and eventually decides..."
 ORE.127.a: "Pardon the riot leader."
 ORE.127.b: "Bar this goon from politics."

 ORE.128.t: "Kind to Friends, Kinder to Enemies"
 ORE.128.d: "After contemplating the situation of the shattered riot and its leader, Burba decided that it would be best to make a show of good faith and pardon the riot leader, of course, for all to see. Burba made sure to address all present, talking about how he would not prosecute those that see fit to protest, and that his opposition has nothing to fear if- nay- when he comes to power. The riot leader, more apathetic than anything, profusely thanked Burba for not having him imprisoned for what was, to him, simply a high paying job. Burba's greatest fear in pardoning the man turned out to be completely irrelevant, as the riot leader was motivated to riot by money, not by actual political values.\n\nOn the other hand, Burba's intention for pardoning the man has proceeded just as planned. Support for Burba has notably risen, as many realize they have nothing to fear under his leadership, while also buying into his promises of centralization and modernization for Orenburg. The people of Orenburg will learn to cooperate and work together under Alexsander Burba, a true uniter of the people and one who wields a gentle but firm hand."
 ORE.128.a: "A fair leadership."

 ORE.129.t: "Douse the Firebrand"
 ORE.129.d: "Burba has decided that the fate of the Orenburg riot leader should be a firm, decisive one. Burba appeared in Orenburg before the detained riot leader to punish his tantrum, ordering the captured man to be present in the open for a sentence to be delivered. Burba made the announcement before all of Orenburg that he who leads the strike, and those associated with the strike, shall be indefinitely banned from the face of politics. They will no longer be allowed to have a voice or say in deciding the future of the nation, and will from then on be completely barred from council meetings.\n\nThe strike leader was simply happy to not be punished further, still holding on to his payment from Malenkov. He accepted his sentence without fuss, and Burba was content to have removed a potential tool from the hands of those would oppose him in election. With so many people rallied against him suddenly removed from political life, the support for Burba's policies of centralization and industrialization began to see an increase. It was hard to tell if it was simply because of less opposition existing, or if Burba's strength began to win over the people of Orenburg. Regardless, it was a victory for Burba."
 ORE.129.a: "A tantrum should be punished."

 ORE.130.t: "The Council Burns"
 ORE.130.d: "Malenkov's paid riot has taken a drastic turn for the worse! While the riot was born of a desire to embarrass Burba, the embarrassment has become a national one as the rioters have burned down the Council building! Malenkov rests his head in his hands, shocked at the terrible news, as Burba curses his inability to stop the riot as it began. The riot leaders had apparently done their jobs too well, gathering a crowd that was too rowdy to even attempt to control. As they marched down the street, protesting Burba's industrial ideas and beliefs in centralization, one crowd member began to insinuate that it was the Council that was the ultimate symbol of centralization. Those that stood against centralization began to shout in that man's favor, and it ended in a roaring fire consuming the building.\n\nNow, dumbfounded, the city of Orenburg watches on in horror and shame. The riot quickly began to disperse after the igniting of the building, not wanting to be prosecuted brutally for destroying a key government building. The citizens are left without any idea on who to blame for such events, given that the protest was against Burba...but Malenkov's influence got them there in the first place. Orenburg's shock and terror is about to turn against one of the two competing candidates."
 ORE.130.a: "Burba's ideas started this!"
 ORE.130.b: "Malenkov ordained this!"

 ORE.131.t: "Malenkov on the March!"
 ORE.131.d: "At the break of day, many communes across Orenburg seceded and have begun talks with League representatives. In response to this Malenkov decided to take action. He has declared that the current Orenburg administration is unable to deal with this crisis, and because of this, he has decided to take direct control of the militias. Already Malenkov has begun to assemble militias still loyal to the Workers' Council. The council has been unable to do anything besides grumble at Malenkov's growing influence. Many in the communes have decried this action, comparing Malenkov's march to Napoleon's path of wanton destruction. However, there are those who agree with Malenkov, believing that it is necessary in order to protect Orenburg from outside influence. Whatever stance is taken, Orenburg is at a crossroads."
 ORE.131.a: "Let us crush these traitors!"

 ORE.132.t: "An Instant Takeover"
 ORE.132.d: "Malenkov knew that in order to unify Orenburg, he needed to make towns more dependent on him, more reliant on him, and more willing to accept that they need to unify under a central leader. So he brought all the towns under his payroll, and soon after he declared to ... of his plans to being Chairman. The towns that were getting support from him all surrendered their autonomous leaderships to him. The surrender of those towns ended up showcasing Malenkov as a clear frontrunner to win the position of Chairman in ... and lead the commune into a new future ahead."
 ORE.132.a: "This is definitely scary"

 ORE.151.t: "The Flight"
 ORE.151.d: "It began on a spring's day. Long ago, perhaps, in the mind of a young woman. As the bombers flew above, she had sheltered in the old storm cellar, cowering in the corner while rain and explosives fell from above.\n\nIt was there that she met her Svetlana, hiding from the wrath of the Luftwaffe. She remembered the warmth they had shared, in that old cellar, first as an emergency measure. The hushed, tearful conversations they tried to keep going as Hell itself visited the surface above them.\n\nAs the weeks came by, and time blurred as the bombings touched the farmland, she made it a routine. To hide herself away with her new friend, away from the world. To embrace her while the soil was touched with fire, and tainted with explosive casings.\n\nEventually, she realized, it had become more. Instead of a last resort, that old cellar, and the woman she had considered her friend, had become something that she would seek out. On those nights, they would lie on the steppe's grass, her head on Svetlana's chest, watching the untainted stars above.\n\nThe first kiss they shared, below the soft moonlight, was something she would remember forever. Something that made her feel complete, as she watched the stars above sparkle in the eyes of the woman who was now her lover.\n\nAnd then it came. The shouting, the sight of her own father reaching for a cross, calling down the wrath of God upon her. As she ran, hand in hand with her Svetlana, her eyes never looked back."
 ORE.151.a: "Orenburg is ahead. Behind... A memory."

 ORE.152.t: "Irregular Refugees"
 ORE.152.d: "A most interesting case of asylum-seeking occured in Orenburg city in the small hours of the morning, as a pair of young women entered the city, bearing only a small bag of possessions. As is procedure, they were detained as refugees for integration and settlement. However, following behind them, two hours later, was three communal militiamen, demanding the arrest of the couple.\n\nAfter a tense standoff where Orenburg city militiamen demanded that the peasants justify their arrest, the truth came out. The two women are to be arrested and put to justice for crimes against nature - that is, being romantically involved with each other.\n\nThe situation has raised an interesting conundrum with the Council, as the ideals of freedom we claim to uphold clash with the traditional morality of the peasantry. The issue has already been raised to the Council, and it seems split. The rural communes are raising holy hell about this "violation of the natural order", while the reform faction seems to view the issue as a matter of personal freedom.\n\nAs the two fugitives sit on the witness stand, holding each other's hands to stay strong, it seems that their fate shall come down to the word of the Workers' Council."
 ORE.152.a: "We'll change henceforth the old tradition..."
 ORE.152.b: "Hand them over. This is a waste of time."

 ORE.153.t: "Life and Love"
 ORE.153.d: "And so she walked free, far from the wrath of the peasantry.\n\nThe city was an unfamiliar place, a clashing mix of modern flats and ancient sloped-roof shops and homes. They were careful to not hold hands while on the way to their own dwelling on the outskirts of the burgeoning city - while the hearing had ended in their favor, the attitudes of the city dwellers were still unknown.\n\nIt was only past the threshold, when the door had shut, that she could turn and gaze into the eyes of her Svetlana, those beautiful blue eyes that had endured the Council's judgement together with her without flinching. The sheen of triumph seemed to glow around her lover, and she was certain that Svetlana would see the same aura around her.\n\nThey collapsed onto the single couch in the dusty living room, and she felt Svetlana's hand running through her hair, doing a better job than any of the city's medications to calm her nerves.\n\nThe communally-provided apartment was small and it was cramped, with a single bedroom and a living room that was stuffed to the brim with a threadbare couch and an empty bookshelf. Dust choked the tabletop. But so long as she was here, together with her lover, it was all she needed.\n\nFinally, they were free, and together.\n\nAnd in her heart, she knew that was all that mattered."
 ORE.153.a: "And so, life shall begin."

 ORE.154.t: "Together to the End"
 ORE.154.d: "They huddled together, in the corner of a hayloft in an abandoned farmhouse. Outside, they could hear the shouts of the men the village had sent after her and her lover, militiamen invoking the name of God against her 'devilry'.\n\nOn a more primal level, they sought shelter, to find solace in the idea that perhaps if they couldn't see the militiamen, they wouldn't be able to hunt them down after she had escaped from their grasp.\n\nBut on the rational level, she knew that wasn't the case. One way or another, her love would be taken away from her, be it through death or forcible separation. And so she just lay there, her chin resting atop Svetlana's head as her lover shed tears into her chest.\n\nThey came closer. The tread of their boots was on the porch, now, and she knew she did not have long, but she could not bring herself to move. As the door began to swing open, she held the woman she loved closer, and shut her eyes.\n\nVisions of the life that had been stolen from them fluttered by - their first clandestine meeting, the first kiss they shared, the thrill of fleeing to the city in hopes of finding freedom. It reminded her of the first night... the bombs and the storm. That life was gone, now... like tears in the rain.\n\nThe shot echoed through the farmhouse.\n\nAnd then there was nothing."
 ORE.154.a: "Dona eis requiem."

 ORE.155.t: "A Newer Orenburg"
 ORE.155.d: "An interesting report has reached the desks of the Workers' Council. According to our rudimentary census, there has been an uptick of immigration, not from the Urals, but rather from the rural communes. A query into this matter has revealed the root of it - apparently, the news of the outcome of the conflict between Svetlana Orlov, Annushka Sokolov, and several members of their village's communal militia had spread outward, through the grapevine that always springs to life when peasants fill a space.\n\nEver since the news of this ruling spread outwards, those that are unwelcome in the traditionalist rural communes have tended to gravitate in the direction of Orenburg City.\n\nNaturally, as things like this go, this has not helped our reputation with the peasant villages, some of whom are now referring to us as a 'pit of bourgeois morality', 'decadent hive', and other lovely epithets. Several delegations have already been sent to the Council, in order to persuade them to change their mind on the issue. Several of them have already come before us, denouncing the Council for 'dragging the entire Commune down' with our 'degenerate values'. While this is not yet a true concern, as this is more or less standard operating procedure, we should keep an eye on the peasants' ire, lest it begin to spread to other topics."
 ORE.155.a: "A beacon in the wastes. For now."

 ORE.156.t: "The Confrontation"
 ORE.156.d: "At long last, it has come. The inevitable confrontation between the City and the Communes on the issue of Orenburg City as a safe haven for those considered undesirable in the rural areas.\n\nThe issue was raised this morning in an almost universal vote of the western communes, declaring that Orenburg is proving itself a burden on the idyllic agrarian morals of the Commune, and should be forced to repeal the measure passed nearly six months ago, in the dispute of Svetlana Orlov and Annushka Sokolov vs. the Ambramovka Communal Militia.\n\nImmediately, there was heated debate, as the legislature argued about the likelihood of outright lynchings, intervention within other communes' borders, the overreach of the city, 'bourgeois morality', and a laundry list of grievances. The general meaning, however, was clear. The peasant communes were not willing to tolerate Orenburg City providing a safe haven for those who they regarded as degenerates and criminals.\n\nThe reform faction has raised a fuss on this issue, stating that Orenburg has as much a right to do what it wants within its borders as any of the peasants do, but so far, the future looks uncertain. A large group has been assembled against us, and the cost of the political capital required to keep the rights of Orenburg City's newest protected minority safe may be more than we are able to pay..."
 ORE.156.a: "Never! What happens in our borders is our business alone!"
 ORE.156.b: "We must abdicate."

 ORE.1561.t: "Love Enduring"
 ORE.1561.d: "As the news of the Council's ruling came in from afar, by means of newspaper and public radio, she breathed a sigh of relief, and wiped a tear out of her eye.\n\nSvetlana lay next to her, with her head tucked under her chin. She could feel tears flowing from her lover's eyes and pooling on her skin, tears of relief and joy. Their attempt had been defeated, once more, and Orenburg had fulfilled the hopes that they had set out to realize in the first place.\n\nThey would not need to fear anymore, she hoped, now that the peasantry's attempt to bring her back to their stagnant village had failed once more. She wouldn't need to fear arrests on the street from unmarked militiamen, or worry coming home to her Svetlana missing. No, she could finally breathe easily.\n\nThat she did, releasing a sigh as the tension that had wracked her body began to dissipate. Perhaps now the embrace she shared could once more become an expression of closeness and intimacy, rather than a protective grasp.\n\nSafety at last. As she felt the warmth of her lover flowing through her, she whispered something only she would hear.\n\n"Thank you.""
 ORE.1561.a: "And it shall live on forevermore."

 ORE.1562.t: "A Grey Horizon"
 ORE.1562.d: "As she looked back on it, from her empty bed, she had almost known to the second when the city had betrayed her.\n\nIt was almost as if their attitudes had changed in an instant, turning from blissful ignorance or uncaring blank looks to suspicion and fear. She swore she could see it whenever she walked in public, swiveling her head as a wanted criminal does looking for police.\n\nThat was, after all, what she was now. At any moment, they could come for her, to arrest her for the crime she had committed, back in her hometown of Ambramovka. Any of the wool-clad passers-by could be a trader or militiaman from that blighted place, come to drag her back, and put her on their blasted 'people's tribunal'.\n\nThe omnipresent fear extended over Svetlana, as well - she could barely stand to see her love go out of her sight, knowing that the only thing protecting her was gone. Was this her future? To become a recluse, hiding from the people that should have protected her, betrayed by those who had given her so much hope in the past?\n\nShe didn't know. With so much uncertainty and fear surrounding her, all there was left to do was cherish her lover and hope.\n\nFor hope was all that she had left, anymore."
 ORE.1562.a: "Under siege once again."

 ORE.1563.t: "Fading Away"
 ORE.1563.d: "The moment Svetlana arrived back at the apartment she shared with her beloved, she knew that something was horribly wrong.\n\nThe cupboards were opened, a paper had been knocked onto the floor, and there was a divot in the wall, where an elbow or knee had impacted it. Muddy boots, the sort that Annushka would never have worn, had scarred the threadbare rug she had purchased to decorate the small sitting room.\n\nThe horror took a moment to sink in, as she frantically called out her partner's name, looking around wildly.\n\nNo. It couldn't be.\n\nThey had taken her away, the men from the village. There was no other explanation. They had dragged the woman she had loved off, to their festering village, to put her on trial for the crime of daring to love her. Annushka... was gone. She would never get closure, no last goodbye or final parting kiss. There was just a hole in the wall to mark her certain passing.\n\nDays passed, as she robotically left to work in the shops, returned to eat, and slept alone in a bed that was never meant for only one.\n\nThen, it hit her. Another stage of grief, the next step in the horror that she found herself immersed in. There was nothing left for her here, but perhaps she could leave a mark elsewhere.\n\nShe gripped the little pistol she had purchased for self defense. This would be for Annushka."
 ORE.1563.a: "Hell hath no fury..."
 ORE.1563.b: "Find a better place."

 ORE.1564.t: "Murder in Ambramovka!"
 ORE.1564.d: "News has come into Orenburg City about the murder of a communal militia member in the small town of Ambramovka, a commune located close to Orenburg. Precisely what happened is unknown, but current reports state that the militiaman, Sergey Ivanov, was ambushed by an armed bandit while en route from the militia armory to his home in the town center.\n\nTwo shots were fired, from a low-caliber civilian pistol, one into his chest and another into his shoulder. After being unable to subdue his attacker, he died several minutes later, of bleeding out. His family has called for justice against the 'crazed bandit' that shot him, and a manhunt in the village is underway.\n\nWitness reports are mixed - some describe the attacker as a woman in peasant's clothing, while others swear they were anything from a bandit of the Dirlewanger Brigade to an off-duty Ural Guardsman. As always, it seems, the rumours will greatly overshadow the truth."
 ORE.1564.a: "Unfortunate."

 ORE.1565.t: "Northwards"
 ORE.1565.d: "And so, she fled the scene, bearing naught but the clothes on her back, a small bag, and the pistol.\n\nThe road was harsh, and the air was cold around her, as she fled the city that she had once considered a refuge. She steeled herself, however, as she knew that the land she sought would be even harsher.\n\nAs hours turned into days, she marched through innumerable peasant villages, and past endless fields of grain. The pastures stretched into the distance as she once more passed through the agrarian wasteland she had fled so long ago.\n\nAnnushka, the name echoed in her mind, driving her on to the harsh north. She was gone, and she desired in every bone in her body to go back west and get revenge on the murdering bastards who took her lover away. But she knew that wasn't the path meant for her. Her path was something greater, something outside of Orenburg all together. There was nothing left in this flat, squalid wilderness, slathered with greenery and hate. No, her future lay elsewhere.\n\nAfter more than a week of travel, as plains turned to hills and the road turned to a cliffside path, she found it. The walls of the gulag stretched into the sky ahead of her, the searchlights shining like the Sun in the sky. Grasping the gun she brought with her, she stepped up to the uniformed man guarding the gate.\n\n'Comrade Guardsman, I have come to join you.'"
 ORE.1565.a: "The League awaits."

 ORE.1566.t: "Paranoia"
 ORE.1566.d: "Weeks had passed, and both of them had begun to feel the burden of the people's eyes on them. She had learned to take the short route back home from her job in the shops, rather than the scenic one, to avoid the risk of being taken off the street. Svetlana had begun putting colored fabric in the one window if the coast was clear.\n\nOrenburg, once a refuge, had become an almost surreal nightmare, a repetition of the secrecy that they had been forced to back in Ambramovka. No more could they feel safe walking on the street as wanted criminals - no more could they trust that their neighbors wouldn't sell them out for a ruble or a loaf of bread.\n\nThe fear and the stress was beginning to wear down on both of them - Svetlana came to her bed later and later at night, and the comfort she had found in her lover's arms was more and more fleeting. She could no longer hide with her - she feared that the woman she loved so much was becoming a symbol of the fate that awaited her if she put a foot out of line.\n\nThey spoke of this, once, under the fading candle-light in the living room. The words were bitter, and the room seemed to grow colder as they spoke through the evening. The cold fear could be felt wrapping around the bonds that kept them together, and she could no longer be certain that they wouldn't shatter."
 ORE.1566.a: "Is the end nigh?"

 ORE.157.t: "A Bitter Stream"
 ORE.157.d: "Worrying reports are coming in from a southern commune where Comrade Burba's group has helped launch a new factory recently. The people of the commune make a living from their rocky soil by raising herds of cattle, and they accuse the new factory of sending toxic sludge downstream. Without another good drinking spot for their beasts, the village fears the spread of more and more diseases to the animal population.\n\nAt this stage little is known about the extent of the problem. This is a bad sign for the efforts of our industrialist allies in the centralization faction. If their efforts to get new industrial production centers up and running outside of Orenburg city began to be stone walled by local peasants the consequences could be disastrous.\n\nAn emergency session of the Council is being prepared as soon as the villagers and industrialists can send their representatives. A few ecological technicians form Orenburg city have been dispatched to assess the extent of the damages. There's naught we can do until all the information comes back to us for the special session."

 ORE.158.t: "Commune Critically Threatened by New Factory"
 ORE.158.d: "The data is in, and the situation looks dire. Without shutting down the new factory, the small commune of ranchers is likely to see its entire animal population killed off.\n\nThe commune's representative, a sharply dressed young man, has come to the Workers' Council and made a passionate speech about keeping his village alive. " How can the Workers' Council claim to represent Orenburg's citizens if it lets the need of industrialists poison entire communities?" the young man has asked the audience in a passionate speech.\n\nNext in line to speak was comrade Burba. The engineer's cool and collected oration was no less eloquent in its defense of the industrial plant. Several impoverished villagers and refugees from Orenburg city have been given the opportunity to work and feed their community through working at the factory. The agricultural material produced by the industrial site can be spread throughout Orenburg to help small farmers maintain their land. Yes, the village's plight is unfortunate, and its citizens should be helped through these though times. But the march of progress cannot be stopped.\n\nLeft unsaid in Burba's speech were the political implication of caving to the small commune on our efforts to centralize Orenburg. The centralization faction's agents have spread the word to sympathetic councilors, in the hope of helping them make the 'correct' decision."

 ORE.159.d: "The boy had spent the day hiking back to the old village to look for forgotten trinkets. The sound of wind and water were his only companions on the trek, yet the youth had little use for either. The cold wind bit at his exposed flesh, while the poisonous water of the river taunted him on his long walk.\n\nThe village stood silent, all of its inhabitants relocated upstream closer to comrade Burba's accursed factory. The industrialist had not let the villagers starve; men had been offered good jobs in the burgeoning industrial town while women tended to new plot of lands to feed their families. The youth now had access to a school, where they learned about a wide variety of subjects. But for the lone boy nothing about this had been worth it. He longed for the old days when the wind kept him company on the plains with his animals, and when the river had sated the beasts' thirst.\n\nThe village's houses were all abandoned. Remants of a disappeared community. And out on the plains laid the bones of the beasts, poisoned by Orenburg's new future."
 ORE.159.a: "Progress, but at what price?"

 ORE.1600.t: "Making a Deal with the Ranchers"
 ORE.1600.d: "Aleksander Burba, for all his flaws, is a pragmatic man. Seeing the Workers' Council refuse to let his factory destroy a commune, the reformer sprang into action. Soon a new, more palatable deal was presented to the rancher's representative and to the Council. By reducing the factory's output during the spring and summer where cattle is sent out to the field the river's pollution level can be brought under dangerous levels. The industrialist's experts are now hard at work analyzing the exposed commune's water needs and looking for places where new wells can be dug into the aquifer.\n\nThis has helped secure Burba's reputation as a man capable of compromise and empathy, but it has not done much to crush the idea that future industrialization plans need to account every commune's needs. Many industrial projects led by the centralizing factions are now being put on hold until environmental impact studies are complete.\n\nOut on the plain, the commune's beasts have begun recovering their health. The villagers can only hope that the new water sources are built swiftly."
 ORE.1600.a: "Politics is the art of the possible."

 ORE.161.t: "A Brighter Future through Electrical Lighting?"
 ORE.161.d: "The mix of old men and inexperienced young technicians maintaining Orenburg city's ramshackle electrical system carefully maintain a collection of electrical plants, power lines and converter stations. Without factories there are few new components that can be manufactured. As a result, the system's custodian can do little but manage a steady decline in power generation.\n\nToday, however, the unexpected as occurred: a surge of power throughout the system! Startled engineers quickly rerouted the extra power to preserve the fragile infrastructure, and a technician was sent out to inform the city's industrial experts. The information quickly spread up the ladder to Burba, Malenkov and other members of the Council's centralization and industrialization faction. When it was confirmed that there really was more power than usual, a few riders were sent into the countryside to investigate.\n\nUntil the source of this new power is known, the city's technical experts can only wait and speculate. Perhaps the old GRES power plant had been brought back to life by ambitious peasants? Or had higher than usual rainfall caused an increase in a western hydro-electrical plant? Perhaps a power line somewhere had been cut, sending more juice flowing to Orenburg city? Only time would tell. for the time being at least, our citizens can enjoy the novelty of reading in the evening using electrical lighting. "
 ORE.161.a: "Get the engineers to stop betting on this and send them back to work."

 ORE.162.t: "New Life for an Old Plant?"
 ORE.162.d: "The reports are in! A small thermal plant to Orenburg city's north west has been partially fixed up by a bunch of enterprising peasants from a nearby commune. All of this began when a local kid exploring the decrepit facility fell in a pool of stagnant water. After beating his progeny for wandering into such a dangerous location, the kid's father investigated the building himself. The man remembered some vague explanation by a cousin about the plant's working when it had been initially built before the war. The most problematic thing about the plant, our man deduced, was that all that water was supposed to still be in the pipes instead of on the floor. After patching up the water piping, he and his fellow villagers turned the furnace back on and fed it some biomass.\n\nThe capital's electrical engineers were both entertained by the story and horrified by the implication of a bunch of peasants left to manage a crucial piece of pre-war technology. However, the men we sent to investigate are categorical that the proud peasants insist that they can manage the plant perfectly well. They also pointed out to our men that we hadn't give the tiny power plant any attention until it had been fixed. Our pleas that we had simply forgotten it even existed went on deaf ears.\n\nSome more... hot headed members of the Orenburg City Council have suggested simply shoving the peasants to the side and getting the adults involved running the place. But this would not be a popular move on the Workers' Council. It would certainly not help Orenburg City's reputation as greedy jerks."
 ORE.162.a: "Take over the plant."
 ORE.162.b: "Let them have their fun."

 ORE.410.t: "Urban Food Shortages!"
 ORE.410.d: "The ration queues are long this week. Not that queues aren't an annual problem in a society governed by socialist dictats and unresponsive production chains, but the food queues are abnormally long for the season; a few tradesmen and laborers notice the anomaly and quickly dismiss it, assuming it is simply a breakdown in the Farmer's Guild or a transport issue. Few Councillors notice, and even fewer care about something that is not in their direct jurisdiction and does not lead to money filling their pockets. Half-hearted measures are brought up, politely listened to and tabled.\n\nFirst in one queue, then another, waiting times stretch wildly out of proportion; half an hour, then two hours, six hours, a day, two days. Crowds grow restless, demand answers from sweating bureaucrats; the latter have none to give. Eventually one queue breaks down completely and rushes the unprepared militiamen guarding a local food depot, overwhelming them, and there they find the truth.\n\nTo be more precise, they find nothing. Nothing at all. The depot is cleaned out, and not a sheaf of barley remains.\n\nBefore the end of the week, this scene will be repeated multiple times in a city starting to notice the scars on its face, the trauma it has endured. And in the rural Communes, the clocks tick on farmers watching their livelihood collapse, their families, and on the Commune as a whole.\n\nDeath readies its scythe. The harvest is coming soon."
 ORE.410.a: "We have to do something – anything!"
 
 ORE.420.t: "The Famine Picks Up!"
 ORE.420.d: "Like a constricting rope, food shortage wraps itself around the throat of the Communes.\n\nIn the absence of effective policymaking, the famine festered in the dark puddles and quiet streets of Orenburg. It festers no longer; instead it is here, in taverns and houses and halls all the way up to the Council itself. Hunger, want, pain, fear. There is talk of rioting, looting, taking what can be taken before the weakness makes it impossible to move. Councillors gather their families and prepare for an impromptu exodus to the rural Communes. Perhaps it will be safer amongst the fields; for Orenburg, the gilded lily of the Urals, is beginning to wither, and the insects are about to swarm in. Perhaps there will be a safer life outside.\n\nIn the absence of agricultural reforms, the collapse germinated in rural farmholdings and villages. Now the anger in farmers' eyes explodes into violence as a system built on their back slides off and crumbles in the dirt. Rioting, countermeasures, insurrection. The Communes are breaking off the dying hive of the City, but now find themselves equally powerless to confront the catastrophe that awaits them. Some prepare an emergency move to the cities; there is little food there, but perhaps people will keep each other safe, for the breadbaskets of the Commune are baskets no longer, but jagged-edge traps. Perhaps there will be better things outside.\n\nAnd day by day the Communes weaken a little more, and struggle a little less, and the rope tightens just a bit more. And the horror theatre of the Orenburg Communes continues."
 ORE.420.a: "Oh God, help us. Somebody help us -"

 ORE.430.t: "Famine in Rural Areas!"
 ORE.430.d: "The results of the industrialization plan seem to be reaping a new toll among the populace, this time in rural areas as well. The famine, which started as a comparatively minor urban food shortage, has spiralled into an epidemic of hunger among rural farmers.\n\nAlready, Malenkov's 'reformed' Workers' Council is attempting to act against this famine, by handing back land and increasing quotas in the collective farms. With the watchful eyes of Orenburg's Guard over the farmers, some say, the crisis will soon come to an end."
 ORE.430.a: "I can't remember who's alive and who isn't!"
 
 ORE.440.t: "Increases in the Food Supply"
 ORE.440.d: "The amount of stomachs grumbling has noticeably decreased. Each day, farmers working overtime bring tons of staple crops into the city to be processed and distributed. Parents that once had to sacrifice their own food for their children now happily share a hearty meal with their boys and girls each night. While some poor men and women still may be worried about the security of the situation, it seems that we will soon rise out of the famine and achieve new heights! More importantly, the high command of our humble state is no longer scrambling to try to alleviate the crisis. The swift reaction to the struggle may be the boost we needed in the eyes of the public; locally owned newspapers herald the effectiveness of the Workers' Council and the streamlined light welfare foundation built as a result of the famine. Even now, an expansion of the welfare provided to more countrymen and farmers is in progress. What was once an invention of the city is spreading its wings. Our comrades outside of the urban sprawl will be alleviated in one of the greatest renewals Orenburg has seen yet!"
 ORE.440.a: "Onwards!"

 ORE.450.t: "The Famine Winds Down"
 ORE.450.d: "As the sun rises over the snow-capped Ural Mountains, and the day dawns on the rushed and hurried city center of Orenburg, thousands line up for meager food. The grizzled veterans that beg on the streets have compared the state-issued rations to the food they were given when Voroshilovgrad starved, the bread old and the soup cold. Unfortunately, the bread cannot go stale. Its composition of bits of wheat and sawdust means that it stays dry and tasteless.\n\nLuckily, as our country progresses out of the dank bowels of famine, the heaps of wood ash and other inedible waste that usually taints our food is being replaced with flour and yeast. The lines at soup kitchens and government disaster relief facilities that snake across blocks are getting noticeably shorter. Government efforts to cheapen the price of the food by flooding the markets with stockpiles prepared in a case like this, as well as lowering tariffs with the Ural League, mean that farmers and urbanites alike aren't as stressed when forced to find food to put on the dinner table. The homeless beggars that flood the streets of Orenburg proper, who have been hit the hardest with the famine, have benefitted greatly from expanded government welfare programs and unions have fought for better wages in the face of a famine. The food shortage that has gripped our stomachs, wallets, and industries is finally being put to a stop."
 ORE.450.a: "Life goes on."

 ORE.460.t: "The End of the Famine"
 ORE.460.d: "In every newspaper, radio, public announcement system, and poster, the Workers' Council blared its greatest victory to date; the famine was over. Officially, of course. Barely anyone struggles to find decent food to eat, and some meat is even being reintroduced to the diet of those not as fortunate as the richest. With demand the highest it has ever been, agriculture is booming and food processing facilities are taking on more workers. Chairman Georgy Malenkov has seen to it that both the Workers' Council and himself receive ample credit for the reversing of the crisis. The fact that it was partially the Council's mismanagement of resources that caused the crisis in the first place has been swept under the rug. Just as the sun shines bright on the fields of Orenburg, so does the future."
 ORE.460.a: "Our stomachs are full!"

 ORE.100.t: "The Orenburg Workers' State in 1962"
 ORE.100.d: "The region surrounding the city of Orenburg was thankfully spared by the anarchy brought on by the Soviet Union's death throes. Lacking any major industrial centers or natural resources, the villages of the region were left free to return to a primeval way of life centered around land, family, church and village.\n\nOver time the city of Orenburg began to emerge as a neutral ground where peasants and workers of the region could settle issues peacefully. The city itself, mostly spared from the Luftwaffe terror bombings was free to develop a robust pre-industrial economy of craftsmen and traders. Peasants making their way to the city to negotiate with neighboring villages began exchanging surplus crops for tools and supplies, strengthening the relationship between Orenburg and the neighboring towns and villages. Soon rumor began to spread of an oasis south of the Urals, free from the chaos of the Russian states.\n\nHowever, all is not well in the fledgling Worker's state. The communes of the region never desired greater ties with the Orenburg City Council, yet their increased economic and diplomatic ties led to the creation of a regional Workers' Council where regional issues could be discussed according to democratic principles. This bottom up organisation choice has crushed any hope of a strong unified regional government emerging, as any project or proposal must receive near universal assent from the fiercely independent village communes.\n\nNow activity from beyond Orenburg's border is stressing the fragile political system to the breaking point. The ever increasing flood of refugees from the Urals and the Kazakh plains is dragging Orenburg city to the brink of famine. And the causes of this chaos will soon reach the worker's state itself, as armies of the outside world lurk beyond the frontiers... Unable to even organize a regional military from the constellation of militias and communes, the Workers' Council fear that one of the last safe and prosperous regions of Russia is on the brink of the abyss."
 ORE.100.a: "For the Communes! And for Orenburg!"
 
 ## CORRUPTION CHAIN ##
 
 ORE.900.t: "Rumors of Corruption Within the Council"
 ORE.900.d: "Rumors are part and parcel of Orenburg's politics. Almost every new law resembles an iceberg; most of any new bill's actual political mass is hidden in backroom negotiations at various parties, and communes are brought on to the bill through compromise and personal friendship, or rivalries between the various representatives. Leaks concerning these types of deals are often used to absolve a representative from an unpopular decision, or to promote another council member's interests.\n\nThis week a particularly damaging rumor of corruption in the selection of members for a new committee on agricultural policies has been making the rounds in Orenburg and the neighboring communes. A position on such an important council can do much to boost a man's career. No doubt leaked by someone angry about having failed to buy their way in, this nasty little bit of news has roused up a mob of angry protesters that barged into the Workers' Council yesterday. The ensuing chaos derailed the day's proceeding, and has delayed the agricultural committee's work.\n\nToday's meeting saw a flurry of accusations and counter-accusations as various political parties in the Workers' Council blamed the corruption on one another. More time was wasted as a motion to verify every account has been met with accusations of wasting time on pointless rumors instead of on agricultural subsidies. This has in turn prompted counter-accusations of being part of those that bought their positions.\n\nMembers of our political faction have been discussing the corruption rumor after the session's end. By investigating the maze of relationships and interests within the Workers' Council and communes a pretty good case has been made for the identity of those responsible for this whole mess. While knowing the culprits is a helpful step, debate now rages within our party as to how best to react to this corruption controversy for damaging our government."
 ORE.900.a: "This isn't good."
 ORE.900.b: "Absolutely unacceptable!"
 ORE.900.c: "Counterproductive."
 
 #Mal#
 ORE.901.t: "A Stay of Execution?"
 ORE.901.d: "Chairman Malenkov is a generous man, and has been known to overlook a little corruption now and then among his underlings, as long as it goes through the appropriate channels and does not detract too much from the Workers' Council's efficiency in implementing his reform projects. The political instability brought by the corruption rumor however has created annoying delays in his projects.\n\nIn a private meeting with his advisers today he has ranted about the time lost listening to crooked councilmen trying to pin the blame on one another even as his team has figured out the representatives most likely to be the true culprits. Now the Chairman is planning a few regrettable accidents for the suspected councilmen.\n\nOne of the private meeting's attendee risked the ire of his boss by suggesting clemency for the Councilors. Corrupt local representatives serve an important part of the Council's ecosystem as they provide easily buy-able votes on a variety of topics. By letting the suspects live and hinting that their continued good health is dependent on following the Chairman's lead in the future we can strengthen our grip of the Council.\n\nOf course, if the boss really wishes to see them removed then we can ring up the usual goons for the job, another adviser insists. Letting the rest of the Council know that corruption is a death sentence that will scare them straight and let the population know that the Chairman is looking out for them. The other men on the Council, of course, will be reminded that as long as they pay their dues to Comrade Malenkov then their side-earnings can still proceed as usual."
 ORE.901.a: "Corruption (mostly) can't be tolerated. Kill them."
 ORE.901.b: "A little mercy has never hurt anyone. We'll spare them."

 ORE.902.t: "Vanishing Corruption"
 ORE.902.d: "Life is dangerous in modern Russia. Men and women are often killed for the most basic of reasons: a week's salary, a good pair of shoes, a loaf of bread... To this unfortunate criminality must be added simple accidents as the population lives and works in ramshackle Soviet buildings that have seen little maintenance since the fall of Moscow. Even a peaceful region like Orenburg is not spared in these difficult times.\n\nNews came recently of a councilor ambushed by bandits as he was making his way back to his commune. The death of a popular politician by bandits this far into Orenburg's interior sparked new debates about the need for military and security reforms.\n\nThe death of this servant of the people has added to a list of unfortunate passings. A few of the more famous men of the Council met grisly ends these past few weeks. One died in a freak accident involving a tea kettle and a bottle of industrial lubricant. Another passed peacefully in his sleep.\n\nOf course, not all men end their days in the public limelight. Many on the Workers' Council simply return to their far off communes and are never heard from again. Communication is difficult even in the best of times, and now with the threat posed by the outside world many villages simply do not send any new representatives to Orenburg city.\n\nThese departures on the Council were filled by a new round of regional elections. The old candidates in time dissipated from the public attention. Just another set of names on the Council's revolving door. Had they ever been on the Council in fact? Council archivists can be truly negligent at times.\n\nThe rate of attrition was especially high among the members of the new agricultural committee. Many of the newly elected councilors had to replace the vacancies left on the once controversial Committee. This thankfully brought an end to the corruption scandal, as the new candidates were elected fair and square to their position. In this way, fortune has turned a source of discord on the Council into another well organized cog of Chairman Malenkov's new government."
 ORE.902.a: "Who was accused of corruption again? I don't keep up with politics."
 
 ORE.905.t: "Waking up from a bad dream"
 ORE.905.d: "The bad memories of the corruption scandal are fading away. It is as though Orenburg and its people are waking from a bad dream in which deceitful man twisted the Worker's Democracy into an engine for personal enrichment.\n\nChairman Malenkov's strong base of support on the Council has seen many new members recently. Friends and associates of the initial agricultural commission's departed members have in particular become enthusiastic members of the Chairman's coalition. It is truly awe-inspiring to see the loyalty inspired by the wise father of Orenburg, as his new supporters cheer on him in the Workers' Council.\n\nBut just as the awful rumor of corruption faded away, a new rumor of fear and intimidation on the Council began to spread. Tales of a few former Councilmen dissolved in acid, or beaten to death in front of their family by thugs began to surface. But this rumor, too, disappeared. The workers' democracy rotting from the inside by threats and violence? All this arranged by Chairman Malenkov? No sane citizen would believe such a tale, let alone spread it to others.\n\nNo, just as the morning's light chases away bad dreams, so too has Malenkov's chairmanship brought forth a new type of politics in Orenburg. With so little to bicker about, the men of the Workers' Council no longer resort to sketchy backroom politics to get laws passed. They simply bring their ideas to Chairman Malenkov for approval. No chance of new corruption rumors leaking out that way."
 ORE.905.a: "A new type of politics."

 #Scare
 ORE.903.t: "Chairman Malenkov's Ethic Policy"
 ORE.903.d: "Chairman Malenkov brought an end to the corruption debates today with his usual precision and political acumen. A new ethic policy has been read to the men of the Council. Citizens in the audience nodded with approval as Chairman Malenkov implored the men of the Council to maintain their vigilance against corruption in Orenburg's politics. A new team on the reformed committee for public decency will be empowered to hunt for corruption and root out shady dealings amongst the representatives.\n\nThe men of the Council sat without objection as a new set of rules was imposed on them. For once no one tried to rise up and object the clear overreach of the Chairman into the rights of his fellow councilmen. The speech's content had already been explained to them through unofficial channels. The consequences for failing a corruption investigation had been, too.\n\nThe wise Chairman knows that Orenburg's worker democracy must never be soiled by corruption. Nor must the citizen know the dirty tricks used to keep politics clean. One of the suspects in the corruption case was conspicuously absent from the room, having fallen down a set of stairs the previous day. Chairman Malenkov had of course taken the time to visit the man in hospital and wish him a swift recovery. When our leader's speech to the Council finally ended, quite a few councilmen rose up to applaud him. The applause went on a bit too long, especially among the friends of the unfortunate injured councilman."
 ORE.903.a: "The chairman is the enemy of the corrupt!"
 
 ORE.904.t: "Tearful Resignations"
 ORE.904.d: "It was with a heavy heart that Chairman Malenkov read to the people of Orenburg and to the Council the letters of those that had resigned from the Workers' Council because of past misdeeds.\n\nThe letters' content varied from person to person, but all detailed the shame and sorrow they felt for having taken tainted money. How could they have participated in the base defilement of the great Workers' State of Orenburg? Several men told of hoping for forgiveness, yet deserving nothing but scorn for stabbing the back of each of Orenburg's citizens.\n\nWhispers rolled under the Chairman's powerful voice as the crowd's anger and disquiet rose and crashed in great waves. Several councilors' faces blanched in horror upon being named conspirators. Every now and then guards dragged away suspects to cheers from the crowd. A few of the guilty councilors were given a chance to defend themselves at the podium between letters. Most used this opportunity to tearfully confess to their crimes.\n\nAt the end of the day once all was said and done, after the Council adjourned for the day, the men and women of Orenburg city filtered out into the streets. The tearful day was discussed in houses big and small as the city's inhabitants voiced their outrage about the corruption to friends and family. But mixed with the anger was a kind of emotional catharsis. A satisfaction brought on by the sight of pitiful crooks begging Chairman Malenkov for forgiveness. No, the great apostle of Worker's Democracy had proven his worth once again!"

 ORE.906.t: "Technical Difficulties"
 ORE.906.d: "Burba's plan to drag the Communes into modernity has been accepted by the Congress. The real challenge is getting the Council to agree; and this is where he has run into the first solid opposition encountered so far, especially in the wake of our controversial announcement to remove all Council members caught up in the recent corruption allegations.\n\nBurba is, despite the rumors about him, dedicated to the welfare of the people. But some are calling his agenda and his desire to reform the Council to something resembling legislative stability an assault on the Communes themselves, and many imply that the talent and legislative experience we will lose by clearing the spiderwebs from the closet is simply not worth the cost. And they make compelling, even good arguments. This programme, if undertaken, will be a big risk, and the people we are intending to remove from the Council for corruption also play understated roles in our own local systems. Can we lose talent of that magnitude and survive? Only time will tell. At the same time, it will be difficult to review allegations, suddenly dismiss them and expect our people to be happy with our work.\n\nWe have two options: quietly remove the cases we are building against the corrupt in our halls of power, and step back for the sake of the people, or continue with the reforms. After all, the Chairman, by definition, knows what is best for the people of the Communes, even when the latter don't know what they need. And with knowledge comes power."

 ORE.907.t: "Troubles in the New Election"
 ORE.907.d: "This corruption scandal was seen by many in our faction, Chairman Burba included, as a good opportunity to flex our growing political muscle and get rid of politicians suspected of graft. These old geezers are giving their spots to up and coming politicians that would be more favorable to our projects.\n\nHowever, this time Chairman Burba's well laid out plan for the elections has not amounted to much. Our data on the popularity of our candidates has turned to be unreliable in many communes, and frustratingly many candidates that did win are people from the old Malenkovite faction. Even worse, a lot of the obstructionist representatives that wish nothing more than for Orenburg to return to the anarchy of the Worker's Congress have gotten back on board.\n\nChairman Burba is disappointed at this outcome, but he and his political analyst team are already looking into the reason that their predictions were wrong, and building new statistical models of support across the region. in the meantime our men on the Council are laying down the law on both newcomers and returning councilmen and making it very clear that a return to the pre-Burba status quo isn't happening. All in all, not much has changed in the political situation as dodgy representatives have been replace by unreliable representatives in the partial elections. Not a major reversal for us, but not a step forward either."
 ORE.907.a: "We can't win 'em all. At least the people will see the that the corrupt men are out of the Council."
 
 ORE.908.t: "The end of the Agricultural Committee affair."
 ORE.908.d: "Eventually people tired of discussing the rumors of corruption in the selection of members for the Agricultural Committee. Many moved onto discussing the strength and weaknesses of Chairman Burba's new alphabetization policy. Others simply let go of politic, having had their fill of unsubstantiated stories and fringe conspiracy theories for the year. After all, since politic is in the same eternal category as tax and death, ignoring it for a few months wouldn't do anyone any harm, right?\n\nIn the Council proper the ascendancy of Chairman Burba's new order went on. Every week a few more powers were taken from useless politicians and given to some committee staffed by experts. The chairman continued promoting the men on the Council that knew how to hold a pencil the proper way just as he carried on cramming the idiots onto obscure sub-sub-committees. Regional leaders bickered over priority funding as analysts from the Chairman's faction compared the projected returns on investments in various project. Yes, things went on as usual in the new Workers' Council.\n\nThe replacement of those involved in the rumored corruption scandal satisfied the population that the alleged misdeeds had been taken seriously. Chairman Burba routed some resources to communes angry about losing their old representative (if the investment was worth it) and ignored the others. The good thing about running a still developing confederation of communes was, after all, that the bad infrastructure and communication lines kept angry citizens at a few days' travel at least."
 ORE.908.a: "All's well that ends well for once?"

 #New Work
 ORE.909.t: "Councilors Scared Straight"
 ORE.909.d: "In the end Chairman Burba decided to listen to those of his advisors that recommended prudence. Many potentially crooked members of the Council remain popular at home, and removing them too quickly could upset the careful balance that our government relies upon to exact reforms. There is also the unfortunate matter that we do not have much more than circumstantial evidence on the current corruption scandal and its suspects.\n\nThe threat of mass ejections from the Council has had some positive consequences, however. Many suspect members have had the fear of God put into them by Chairman Burba. After letting them loudly announce their innocence and swear to show their political reliability to the reform factions they were let go without incidents. On the other hand, unrepentant grifters such as councilor Zakhaev have been brought to the negotiating table by a combination of honey and vinegar. The old bastard has not survived on the turbulent Council for so long without a very good nose for where the political winds are blowing, and he rightly suspects that the ascendance of Chairman Burba cannot be stopped. Better for him and his ilk to cut back on the corruption if if can improve their chances of keeping real political power instead of being shunted off to the cultural committee.\n\nWith all of the suspects in the corruption scandal now on their best behavior, a few productive Council sessions have unfolded without incident. The sight of old man Zakhaev backing Chairman Burba's proposals has certainly raised a few eyebrows, but the chaotic nature of Orenburg's politics has seen stranger bedfellows."
 ORE.909.a: "We've managed to wrangle the men of the Council for another day..."
 
 ORE.910.t: "Approval of our handling of corruption is going up!"
 ORE.910.d: "For a time the rumors of corruption in the selection of the Agricultural Committee was the talk of the town. Speculating about who was involved was one of Orenburg's favorite topics. Some tried to pin the blame on the pro-trader faction trying to siphon money out of the Agricultural Committee once their men had been elected. Others suggested that remnants of Malenkov's faction were trying to seize back some power to bargain with Chairman Burba's factions.\n\nOur negotiations with shifty councilmen have managed to prevent the rumor of corruption from again coming up in the Council. Some members of the Agricultural Committee were transferred to other parts of the Council, and a few men renowned for their incorruptibility replaced them. This gave some meat to the crowds that suspected foul play, but most of the population accepted the shift in the committee's make-up as enough to prove that the rumors of corruption were taken seriously.\n\nThis whole debacle has actually turned in our favor as the population was impressed by Chairman Burba's handling of the problem. Instead of jumping in the arena and accusing rival factions of being crooked, the Chairman and his associates have instead refocused the Council on proper topics and have dealt with the situation in the background. Members of the Council that feared an end of their political career in the hysteria are grateful to us and support the government more than ever."

So too the delegates who say that this is no solution at all, simply a means of claiming innocence while blocking those who know the truth from further allegation-making.\n\nIt is settled, and Justice has been Done.

 ORE.912.t: "The New Announcement"
 ORE.912.d: "Although the announcement of a new election to cleanse any trace of corruption from the Orenburg Council was met with some praise, few had hope for something better to come. Although a few new hopeful candidates had stepped up, claiming to want to 'challenge the status-quo', they were a tiny segment among the usual lot. The new group were younger, and perhaps more populist in their agenda but hardly radical enough to actually make a difference. Weary were the people of Orenburg, although they might have been granted some faint hopes with this new election, many felt that they would have had more of an impact hade they simply stayed at home. It was as if the voting had become a tradition and not a chance for change. The participants may have sometimes changed but the rules would not, the process of ruling Orenburg having hardened like cement over the years. Even those who eagerly backed the new, young and hopeful candidates had their doubts that they could last long against the status-quo. Some small progress, that was all they hoped for, and even then they were nervous. Slowly, the votes began to pile up. It quickly became apparent that many had indeed decided to stay home, turnout was dismal. The results were eventually calculated however and...."

 ORE.913.d: "The expected did indeed happen. The majority of the old Council was re-elected. Although pleased to be back in power, they had won without much support. It was clear that Orenburg was tired. Still, this was not a concern for the Council Members who were keen to get back to work on their usual political projects. Some of them did make a token effort to at least pretend that they were keen on making changes for the better. If making change consisted of making a short speech and shaking hands with some farmers, then they might have succeeded. However, little did actually change. Some reforms were made to prevent bribery and general corruption, but seemed to have no effect at all from the perspective of the general populace of the Communes. Business went on as usual, with the Council churning through their endless number of issues and debates at the speed and enthusiasm of a dried-up slug. Some did think of what might have happened should a new council have been elected. 'Perhaps something would have become better' they thought\n\nSome did try to reform the system. A group of workers from the city bundled a list of several key reforms to improve the lives of everyone in Orenburg. Their attempt at progress was lost amongst the numerous other suggestions and complaints that were sent in. Each time they enquired about it, they were told that it would be brought up eventually. It was of course, never found..."

 ORE.914.t: "Nothing to Show, Nothing to Hide"
 ORE.914.d: "The Council was keen to keep the status quo. The same officials from before would stay. The official excuse was that "There is no corruption in the Council" and that if there was any sort of corruption, it would have been exposed by now. Naturally, for those that did vehemently believe that corruption was still afoot, the statement from the Council did little more than to aggravate there fears and have them biting there nails, waiting for the Council's next move. In response to their supposed lack of action, the Council now had to deal with a fairly sizable group of protestors gathering outside their chamber in the heart of Orenburg. Among the expected banners proclaiming that "The Council must go!" and the expected amount of colourful language, it was a rather provoking depiction of a farmer's crops being harvested, and stolen, while a councilman looked the other way, his hands filled with riches given to him by the crop-thief. Although numerous and loud, the protesters had initially little impact on the Council, who confidently announced that business would carry on as usual.\n\nEach day the protests would go on while the Council was in session and then disband as the Councilmembers went home. Not ones to be perturbed by this, the protesters began trying other ways to get their way. Some gathered at the homes of certain officials and shouted their demands loud enough to keep them and their neighbours awake at night. Others resorted to various form of vandalism and other petty crimes, ranging from painting the word "liars" on the Council building, to throwing a dead rooster at one councilman on his way to work. After that particular incident, the Council agreed to meet with some of the protesters and see if a solution could be reached. It would prove pointless for both sides, with the protesters insisting that the Council resign, and the Council insisting that nothing could be done about the corruption. The following day, the banners were once again up around the Council building, and another day started and stopped business as usual..."

 ORE.915.d: "Now that the chaos has died down, a few in Orenburg's political class are left free to ponder where the rumor of corruption could have sprang from. With every political faction keeping some informal network of informants and spies, everyone secretly expected evidence to materialize concerning the true culprits. Once the corrupt politicians in question tried to cash out their chips, proof of their guilt would follow and the whole network of people trying to buy into the Agricultural Committee would be found out.\n\nAs time went on and the disappeared money failed to reappear the topic threatened to bubble up again. This morning a young secretary sprinted into our faction's office breathlessly as we prepared for the day, demanding to speak to the most prestigious politician available.\n\nOur bemused members listened to her tale. As it turned out, her superiors on the Council's financial committee had misplaced some documents approving a routine transfer of money to pay staff. This had created a hole in the accounts that some bureaucrats tried to conceal by shifting money around. Soon the knock-on effect had money entering and leaving through weird regional accounts, giving rise to the idea that regional associations of communes were forking over large sums of money to Orenburg. From there the rumor began spreading that something was wrong about the accounts of the Agricultural Committee and that its members were somehow buying their positions!\n\nWhen the secretary's boss found the misplaced papers the missing money "re-entered" the system, making every account check out. The man thought nothing of his error, and had only recently mentioned the mistake to his secretary. The young woman had immediately seen the consequences of this clerical error and ran to report it to us. As it turns out, there had never been any corruption around the Agricultural Committee."

 ORE.500.d: "Deniska Sopov was new to his position as commander of one of the Ural League's many elite units. He took his role very seriously, and had jumped at the chance to lead a defensive patrol of nearby Orenburg, believing it to surely be a simple but effective task to demonstrate his capability.\n\nAnd yet, within a matter of hours, he and his men found themselves hopelessly lost far from their planned patrol route. Spying a nearby village commune and a group of peasants working the fields outside it, Sopov approached and asked the peasants to point him to their mayor so that he might find his way. To his surprise, having little experience with the region, the peasants bluntly told him that they had no mayor. Curious, Sopov asked them to explain how their village ran.\n\nThey told him how the citizens of their anarcho-syndicalist commune took it in turns to act as an executive officer for a time, with all the decisions of that officer requiring ratification by at least half of the commune for internal affairs and a two-thirds majority for external matters. Sopov found their system rather quaint, and told them of how the League organized itself under a strict and effective hierarchy of commanders and militia units. The peasants were unimpressed, telling him that a gaggle of men sitting in fortresses handing out fancy titles was no basis for a system of government.\n\nAs they droned on, Sopov tried to interject but failed to get through to them. Growing increasingly impatient, he demanded they simply point him to whoever was in charge. His aggressive tone drew the ire of the peasants, who claimed this was 'typical behaviour' from the Guard. Finally fed up and looking increasingly foolish in front of his men, Sopov stormed off to find someone who could give him the information he needed, leaving the peasants to complain about his intrusion."

 ORE.501.d: "Her family had denounced her. Her village had shunned her. The people had called her a whore and a traitor. But it did not matter to Varya. For today she was marrying her knight in shining armor.\n\nRuslan was a young man from Orsk who, after fleeing the city following the arrival of the dreaded Brigade, had eventually taken up arms in the Guard's forces. Having risen through the ranks he had led numerous expeditions to Orenburg to help the people, in spite of their general hostility. He had loved Varya from the first day they met. He had brought her flowers from the mountains, visited her on every patrol and made her feel safe in a world of horrors. When the time came for him to return to the Guard to prepare for the coming struggle, she begged him to take her with him, and so they agreed to wed.\n\nThose she loved had turned on her. To them, this was a man who wanted to destroy their way of life. A man who would likely be dead in a week, his skull used for a tankard and his innards devoured by the nightmarish bandits. A man who was taking her away from her rightful place. But as the lone sympathetic priest led them in their vows in the quiet hollow beneath the mountains, the only thing that mattered in the world was each other.\n\nWithin a day, the newlyweds departed for Beloretsk. Varya hoped dearly that she would see her family again, in a time when the world was free from bandits and mad scientists and all the horrors of the 20th century. She hoped too that Ruslan would live to return beside her, and that in time her people would accept him for the great man he was. But for now, she was content to walk beside her husband in peace."

It was for this reason that he had been one of those assigned to guard the tiny, nameless village on the outskirts of the Orenburg communes.\n\nHe and his fellow soldiers arrived, eager and ready to assist these poor, helpless people. The feeling was not at all mutual. Upon his arrival, they were denied lodging or shelter from any of the locals, and the Guard had to set up their own camp on the edge of town. The villagers generally were hostile to Ivan and his friends, and they would never sell or trade them food or supplies.\n\nOne day, however, the day finally came that Ivan and the guards were there for. A small detachment of bandits was riding from the south. The guards gathered their guns and took their positions, ready to serve...and were yelled and jeered at by the village troops. The makeshift soldiers, using inferior weapons and with no training, said they would handle themselves. This was the last straw for Ivan. He would protect these people whether they liked it or not. By the time the bandits arrived, Ivan had been restrained and dragged away for assaulting a villager. The rest of the peasants reluctantly fought with the guard, but Ivan was tied up and fuming. He served nobody that day."

The seats aren't warm or cozy, the interior is uncolored, and there are few bells and whistles overall.\n\nAnd yet, it is the most beautiful thing many have laid eyes on.\n\nIt is Orenburg's first independently designed car, a symbol of freedom and personal autonomy the likes of which have never been seen in the Russian warlord states. It is cheap to manufacture, easy to maintain, and gets mileage that can compete with even American vehicles. in the coming years, as the car becomes more widespread within Orenburg, and even begins limited export to other countries, the KO-1 will become a symbol of national pride. Decades from now, long after the factories will have ceased the car's production, operational models will still be relatively easy to find."

They came from Black Mountain, sneaking and dodging through the patrols of Magnitogorsk, and it took them another two days on foot to arrive in Orenburg, but they had made it at last.\n\nWhen they were taken in by a patrolling militia on the outskirts, given food and water and assurances they would be safe, only then did they start to talk. of the horrors they'd seen inside the Black Mountain. Tales that they told in hushed tones and behind sobs of the experiments they had performed because they had no choice in the matter, or initially believed in a "greater good". They murmured about kidnappings, forced breedings, vivisections.\n\nSome refused to talk at all.\n\nBurba's men promised them sanctuary. The scientists would be given a place to stay, but only as long as they worked for Orenburg and its research divisions.

It pools around the boots of freshly trained riot officers.\n\nModernization has shaken Orenburg to its core in many ways, and in many ways, this has been good! The people work. The people eat. The people enjoy prosperity unimagined just a scant few years prior. Orenburg has become a shining beacon in the darkness of Russia.\n\nBut it is not a perfect transition, for the people know something is lost. They can feel its conspicuous absence when they sleep, they feel scared without it under the watchful eyes of Burba's growing army of policemen, and they can feel it slowly slip from their bodies and disappear as they toil endlessly in factories without say and often pay.\n\nThe people of Orenburg have lost their freedom.\n\nThe protests were to be expected. At least so it seems, for the police were more than ready when they began. Brave and proud students were marching down Pobedy Avenue when dozens of officers carrying newly crafted riot shields and belts with freshly brewed tear gas swarmed them.\n\nClubs were swung and shots were fired, and by the end of the day, almost a dozen of Orenburg's best and brightest lay gasping their last in the street, over a hundred others stumbling away and nursing wounds from the mundane to the life threatening.\n\nIs this the price of progress?"

 ORE.507.d: "Work! Work for your family! Work for your comrades! Work for industry and for Orenburg and for Comrade Burba!\n\nAs part of Burba's newest set of reforms, only one of several dozen that have already been instituted in the last month, workers have been queueing up for employment at wages unseen in Russia for decades, in return for working at one of the numerous new factories and farms across Orenburg. Already, hundreds have found work at these new places of industry, and the streets are not lined with the desperate and the starving but with eager workers lining up for their daily pay or ration. Surely one can walk down the street and feel pride in their city, and while it may now be a bit harder to breath in the soot choked air, this is a fine price to pay when the citizenry of Orenburg can now find easy work and reap the rewards of their labor. Where once, windows sat dark from lack of light, or waste was thrown into streets from improper plumbing systems, there is now luxury!\n\nTo meet this growing class of workers is a growing class of clerks, middle managers, and bureaucrats to support them. The middle class has already sectioned themselves off into many of the newly built neighborhoods where they may enjoy more luxuriant quarters to their blue-collar counterparts. And that is not saying anything of those above them! As the factories chug to life, so too do the wheels of industry, and riding the cars that sit on those wheels are the rich and wealthy. Those who have had the skill, cunning, and ruthlessness to become the leaders of our fair city.\n\nYes, the skies may be black. Yes, the hospitals may be filled with workers missing fingers and arms from accidents in the factories. Yes, valuable space in the city may now be taken up by massive manors and other homes for the upper crust. But this is a price the people of Orenburg shall gladly pay, for they now live in the future! Or at least the present."

As such, most assumed the construction of the new concrete building was merely another apartment for the decadent and the wealthy. But when the doors finally opened, many residents were shocked to find them open for anyone who needed a warm shelter from the cold or a meal when personal supplies have run dry. Those former peasants who aimlessly wandered for years, searching for a menial job or a place to stay can now finally rest.\n\nAleksander Burba's reform of Orenburg did not only come with promises of democratization but the goal of establishing welfare for the huddled masses of the Urals. With the opening of the first homeless shelters in Russia in the central city, the fulfillment of this lofty objective is now proven to be underway. In a speech given at the opening of the facility, Burba spoke of how in a sense all Russians are homeless in their disunity and constant uncertainty, framing the opening of the shelter as the first step towards not just curbing homelessness but establishing the motherland as a whole again. We can only hope for the best to come for the wayward vagabonds in this great exile."

Their faces lifted in exhausted smiles when they saw Alexander.\n\nHis mother knelt down and gave him a hug. "We brought you something from work today." She pulled out something from her trousers and handed it to Alexander. It was a small toy car, with spinning wheels and everything. He squealed in delight; he had not gotten a new toy in years. "Thank you mama!" He ran off to play with the car, his parents both smiling.\n\nThe next day, Alexander was at home alone once again, his parents busy at work. As he played with his toy, he noticed that the paint was cracking a little. Just then, one of the wheels came off as well. He knelt down and tried to reattach it, but it was to no avail. He sat down, defeated and miserable. He put the wheel in his pocket; maybe his parents could fix it. Was this why they worked all day? To bring him cheap, broken toys and never see him?

 ORE.510.d: "Dasha closed the door of her small hut and shuffled out into the empty streets. She was the last one living on her end of the village, everyone else had left for Orenburg to go and work in Comrade Malenkov's new factories. Her next door neighbour Artur had sworn he would never leave, but she had not seen him leave the house in many days. Perhaps he had finally drank himself to death.\n\nShe walked onwards, through the slowly overgrowing paths and past the dilapidated old party headquarters. A few transient souls still lingered, neither willing to wither away nor move on. When at last she reached the market square, only one stall was still open - good old Vassiliy still hawking his fresh produce. She took the old broom out of the community shed and got to work sweeping the square. It was a fruitless task, the winds constantly blew in more dust and in any case there were few people to appreciate her handiwork, but it was one of the only jobs left going in the village.\n\nEventually, Vassily grew bored of the chronic lack of customers and wandered over. They shared a few wistful remarks about the state of the village and reminisced about times gone by. Sheepishly, Vassily admitted that he too had finally decided to take up work in Orenburg, and that he would be leaving the next morning. Dasha was sad, he had always been a friendly face she looked for and she would miss him dearly. He brought over a sack of vegetables from his stall and handed them to her, telling her to enjoy a hearty meal on him. With nothing more to say, he bid her farewell, packed up his stall and went home.\n\nNow alone in the square, Dasha glumly considered if it was time for her to leave too. For now though, she swept the streets in silence, hoping to make the dying village look just a little more presentable."

"Sir, the reports on the output of the factory are in." That got Malenkov to look up, eagerness in his eyes. He snatched the report out of the assistant's hands and began reading the summary. His eyes quickly went from eagerness to confusion, and then to anger. "These numbers are abysmal. They are far, far below the reasonable quotas that were established. They must be incorrect. Get me the proper report." The assistant was now visibly trembling in fear. "S-sir, those are the correct numbers." Malenkov slammed his fist on the table. "Just because they are factually accurate does not make them correct! I set the correct numbers, and they were not reached!" His face was now filled with rage. "Security! Have this man imprisoned!"\n\nThe assistant's worst fears had come true. He was dragged out of the room, defeated, and tossed into a prison cell. He would be in there for quite a while."

Tonight was not such a night, Instead of sleeping, his thoughts kept him twisting and turning in his bed. Doubt beset him. He had tried to remind himself that he had succeeded, he was Chairman of Orenburg. Yet it was not enough. Orenburg was expanding and progressing as Malenkov had planned that it would, but still there were so many problems that plagued his thoughts. Only two days ago had he seen an old woman pushed to the ground and robbed, the thief had then scurried off into a back alley before the police could even arrive at the scene. Malenkov was horrified to see this, that one of his citizens had be brutalised and robbed in broad daylight. He had inquired about the case just before retiring for the night and received the answer that the police were still investigating. He knew what that meant, the thief would never be caught. The Chairman had indeed helped expand security measures in the city, but it felt like it was never enough. Orenburg had many poor still, and they often had little choice but resort to petty crime. More police, he thought, that would solve it.\n\nStill he could not sleep, more worries troubled him. Perhaps it was the visit to the farms. Although quotas had been met on paper, the amounts of produce he saw being delivered during his official visit seemed more like half the expected amount. Were the farmers lying to him? "Why would they do that?" he thought. Had there been a mistake? Was there someone stealing from the farms? Malenkov then had a thought that upset him. Where the farmers scared of him? That he might punish them for not meeting the quotas in time? He realised that such was likely the case. He had been harsh on those that had failed before. Malenkov was sure that he could do better, that he could end the fear of crime and of himself. Orenburg would be prosperous and peaceful under his control. He would make sure of that.

He was checking over the reports of the current industrialization plan when he spotted a familiar picture on his desk. The photo was of a simpler time, taken on the final days of the 57th Congress.\n\nMalenkov grinned, remembering how Astankov always poked fun at some of the more ridiculous aspects of communal politics. It's a shame he was later found to be mocking Malenkov as well.\n\nThere's Gavrilov. He was an optimist, but he truly cared for Orenburg's wellbeing. He incessantly talked about the leap to communism and how things were bound to get better. Even when Malenkov was accused of fascism, Gavrilov remained hopeful of his reforms. All of that was until the famine. His hands were tied when he discovered Gavrilov's opposition; the dissent would have led to factionalism in the party. But even still Malenkov couldn't help but shed a few tears.\n\nThen there's Korovin in the center. He was a fat old cynic known for his inflammatory accusations of fascism, but without him, the communes would've fallen into anarchy years ago. Thankfully he died before the 59th. He's probably rolling in his grave at what Malenkov did to Orenburg. Malenkov couldn't help but weep as he realized that he was the last man in that picture to live through the purges. "Why couldn't they just listen?" he said to himself, "Industrialization was necessary, the Brigade was at our doorstep, waiting to prey on our weak!" No matter what justification Malenkov fabricated, he wasn't able to dispel the immense sense of guilt weighing on him.\n\nA week later a new image emerged in Orenburg records.

Orenburg always seems the most alive in the early hours, pulsing with military activity, troop transports to and from the front, diplomatic envoys and officials scrambling to deliver reports long overdue. But even its leaders can not deny that its movement has been anemic as of late. The shadows at their eyes tell a story of - not defeat, but certainly something other than victory.\n\nAnd so too do the veterans missing an arm, a leg, blown off in the struggle against the Black Brigade; the farms emptied of brothers and fathers and sons. Orenburg struggles on, but there is a faint tremor to its voice, and in the sprawling spaces of the public mind doubt, not hope, dominates. And the Brigade is always watching, and learning, and who knows when they will overcome the Revolution by force?\n\nThe Council gnaws at itself like a trapped rodent in the night, and spirals into endless debate. in the wee hours of the morning, however, a miracle happens. The Council reaches unanimous agreement on the issue, and propose a solution: call in the Ural Guard, their shadowy benefactors. Nobody in the Council fully trusts them, but the crude calculus of flesh and blood is obvious and appealing. Better their sons, fathers, brothers perish than ours.\n\nAnd behind that thought, a weariness that is more disturbing still: that the Communes can no longer win this war alone, and that Socialism must lean on others to be preserved."

The diplomatic comings and goings of Orenburg and the League change from day to day, but the routine is a reassuring constant, at least for the Diplomat from the League. Recently, however, that has changed.\n\nA formal request from the Communes, couched in the usual passive-aggressive, "it's not like the Revolution needs you to fight for us, i-idiot!" rhetoric, has been received. The moral grandstanding and assumptions of superiority remain unchanged. What has changed is the certainty: the latter is gone. Not a trace of the old confidence in the Victory of Socialism over Bandit Capital remains, only vulnerability and a growing admission of "unexpected developments". And behind the lacquered words the League diplomat senses - pain. Bottomless pain.\n\nAs he pens his report, he is reminded, unaccountably, of an uncle who lost all his sons in a hunting accident off in the East. The ache in his eyes is suddenly familiar - and the Diplomat realises that every meeting he has had with the Orenburg Council has been a procession of aching eyes, hidden sorrow. Even guilt.\n\nHe winces, and finishes the report. The final decision is left to Menviks and his clique, but he knows what he must recommend. The League cannot stand by as the souls of innocents float into the darkness; for that is the definition of martyrdom, and their blood, once spilled, will cry for justice."

 ORE.1050.t: "The NKVD's Proposal"
 ORE.1050.d: "The NKVD of Magnitogorsk has sent a proposal to the Workers' Council today. Stating that since they are the pre-eminent power of the Russian Urals they have decided that our position in their sphere needs to change and in their "benevolent wisdom" they have decided to offer us autonomy within their state. The communes would retain their independence and the Workers' Council would still exist. However we would fall sway under the NKVD and be forced to send them taxes and soldiers for their armies, funding the NKVD war machine. The NKVD would be allowed to send commisars and NKVD officials to "protect the state from counter-revoloutionary threats". However, this is clearly a thinly veiled use of secret police to supress our peoples. It is very likely that the NKVD would not take too kindly to a denial of their proposal. They have just fought a war with the bandits and they would be all too happy to send their troops west if we decline. We face a choice, autonomy under the NKVD and loss of a few freedoms or retain our independence and face the possible wrath of the NKVD war-machine. A vote has a been called in the Workers' Council."

 ORE.1051.t: "The NKVD's Demand"
 ORE.1051.d: "In a stunning act of brazen war-mongering and bullying the NKVD has sent a demand to the Workers' Council calling for the annexation of the communes of Orenburg into the NKVDs new, dictatorial, state. Citing that russians must stand together in this perilous wrld and now that Dirlwanger and his ilk are dead the Workers' Council has nothing to fear in the Urals. They state that the communes would be protected by the NKVD and that the villagers are better off under the caring and guiding hand of themselves, and not that of the Workers' Council. If the communes accept this proposal then all the rights and freedoms they have fought for will be under the mercy of the NKVD who are not known for being nice to those who think different. The vote was called, every commune was ordered to come as this vote required all the communes voices on the matter. Will they pick annexation under the boot of the NKVD, or will they fight for their freedom?"

 ORE.1052.t: "An Offer of Friendship"
 ORE.1052.desc: "The NKVD envoy, with the usual brazen pride and self-assurance of the intelligence services that many still remembered from the Soviet days, sat before the Workers' Council and began to make the case for improving relations between our two tribes in this hellish landscape. Together we had overcome the insanity of Dirlewanger, proving Russian solidarity could defeat German antagonism. Yet our victory had not been a simple one, bleeding the communes heavily. In such a state could we even hope to trust such former oppressors to stick to their words and truly not influence our autonomy? With the expert ability to read humans, the Magnitogorsk delegate began to recount other problems that face the area, threats that could still annihilate both parties if they were not to unite as fellow socialist countrymen. Yet the socialism of the NKVD was a little different to the socialism many in the communes preferred, just like with the Guards before, how could a centralized regime deal with our democratic system in an effective way? The council held the vote anyhow."

Some survived the sacking of the Ural League, and are coming to our aid. It is a good reminder that we do not stand alone against the vile Dirlewanger Brigade, and it appears that we will receive the survivors' immediate assistance. Rugged and baptized by fire, these men will stand strong in solidarity with the people of Orenburg as they prepare to give their lives for the defense of our homeland. Their indomitable will to fight should be a common stance with our soldiers as well. The men of the Ural League are some of the bravest to ever serve, so we must be thankful even in these hard times that they still choose to continue the struggle. Their commanders have integrated into our structure, and they are clearly ready for the ultimate sacrifice if it means freedom and liberty for Russia. We must not let them die in vain!\n\nNonetheless, the situation is critical, and the chance of our downfall is at an all-time high. Reports stream in from the east of the Brigade's misdeeds, and the few refugees remaining tell haunting stories of his rapes and sacks. It is clear that Dirlewanger is no toy to play with, and our defeat will mean chaos and suffering for all of Orenburg, let alone Russia! Every man and woman must fight this scourge of God, at all costs, if it means our children shall live in a free land!"

 ORE.163.d: "The Ural League has... rejected the Council's entreaties for an alliance.\n\nIt wasn't too long ago when they first arrived at our farthest kolkhozy. Our villagers reported small groups of men and women wearing battle fatigues and fatigued faces - and deadly rifles slung on their backs. Hindsight tells us they were mere scouts meeting civilization for the first time since their supposed exodus.\n\nWe saw things differently of course. Beset on all sides by bandits, murderers and Germans, weak and bare against even the harsh winter snow... we saw saviors. Brothers in arms against the greedy, the rapacious, the bloodthirsty: All those who covet Orenburg's riches with wanton lust. For once, we thought, Orenburg's future seems a sliver brighter.\n\nNow its Council is dumbfounded to a sudden halt. But before the familiar shouting and finger-pointing resumes; before Orenburg's government leaves its people helpless against the oncoming slaughter; and before the Commune's bright sliver fades away to die, every councilor thought as one:"

 ORE.140.t: "Setting the Record Straight"
 ORE.140.d: "Before, Orenburg's history was polluted with false narratives and claims about its founders and leaders. Under Comrade Malenkov, this has begun to change. Pictures of the commune leaders and their crimes are now everywhere, showing the people how they attempted to keep us weak. Burba, and his insane delusions, has been wiped from the books; his plans are now either to be forgotten, or remembered for its true creater, Comrade Malenkov! History is written by the victors, and seeing that we are the victors, it is our chance to set the record straight, so that future generations are not directed in false, counter-revolutionary directions."
 ORE.140.a: "One step closer to a better Orenburg!"

 ORE.141.t: "A New Youth for a New Day!"
 ORE.141.d: "The youth of Orenburg have been, much like the rest of the region, un-organized and un-educated in the virtues neccessary to survive. Under Comrade Malenkov, however, this is starting to change. The formation of the Komosol, or All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, has been apart of a new initiative to keep children away from religious dogmas, and instead promote atheist thought. Under the direction of older party members, Komosol members will work to shut down churches and other bourgeois institutions and instead promote proper socialist values.\n\nWe have gotten some pushback, however. For one thing, young people don't like feeling as though they are being told what to do, so hooligan gangs and groupings have been formed. A bigger worry comes in the forms of their parents; many have accused us of being "intruders", and disrupting the family unit. Our response to these claims are simply; yes, that is what we are doing. Children should develop to assist the collective good of Orenburg and of Russia, and not be held back by their parents. After all, didn't the Christ they love so much say that one should abandon their families if it meant following the good path? Counter-revolutionary dogma in the family must be fought against no matter what."
 ORE.141.a: "They say this is a bad idea, but what do they know?"

 ORE.142.t: "The Conversion"
 ORE.142.d: "A letter was found on old man Markov's desk. The contents were:\n\n"I believed in freedom, I really did. When the Commune asked for my trust, my food, I withheld nothing. When I was asked to shelter the Ural soldiers, I gave them my own room. I loved my freedom, and I would give myself away in its service.\n\nI was given a privileged position within the Commune, and I believed my own works would be sufficient to vouchsafe for my credentials. And I never abused that position. I loved the Commune and I still love my village. Service in the protection of our freedom is no burden to me.\n\nBut when Svetlana the light of my life fell with the shakes and fever, I was denied, denied, denied. The Chairman and his family need it, I was told. The Esteemed Visitors need it. Councillors I'd never heard of were more valuable to the Commune than my Daughter choking in her bed, the life slipping from her with every breath.\n\nAnd when it came time to hold the funeral, when Maria could not stand with grief - the Commune did nothing. This was the reward for my service freely given - nothing.\n\nMalenkov is ruthless and brutal, I know this. But he will be better than the blank faces who watched my daughter slip away, and waved their arms, and smiled from the corners of their lips. At least his punishment will be fair, and hard.\n\nFreedom is worth nothing at all without justice. And Malenkov is justice."\n\nOld man Markov was killed in a police action suppressing Malenkovite riots the following February."

 ORE.143.t: "A Farmer's Complaints"
 ORE.143.d: "The small, isolated farm was in ill disrepair despite being situated on the edge of a great wood, but what good could an old farmer, harvesting from the last pastures nature had not taken from him, do to fix the small building complex all on his own? He had heard fantastical stories of Orenburg and the surprising bloom it had experienced, becoming a shining beacon of hope in these swirling, death-filled tides of darkness. In his quiet contemplation, facing the shimmering, setting sun as he was giving his dying muscles a minor, yet much needed rest, he considered what it would have been like to have lived in the city, a place where reform and industrialisation had created such standard of life not possibly imaginable for those in the outer communes. He almost caught himself wishing his life could have been different but shook away from such a selfish thought. Sighing deeply, he whispered the name of the love of his life, taken from him so unceremoniously and abruptly, and he wondered whether she would be as proud as he was of their children. Living in that great city, making something of their lives, carrying on the hope that had been birthed alongside them. A single tear rolled down his creased, sunburnt cheeks as he thought about them. But work had to resume."
 ORE.143.a: "What we sacrifice for those we love."

 ORE.144.t: "Hypocrisy Manifest"
 ORE.144.d: "Utter turmoil in the grand chamber of the Workers' Council, not an unusual occurrence but this case of pandemonium carried with it a rather more affronted and scandalous air of disturbance. All seemed to be originating from a lone representative of an outer commune, still standing straight with dignity despite the rabid abuse shouted at him from all corners of the room. His speech had been little less than a full-blown critique of the current economic system that the settlements outside of Orenburg had to endure and the terrible effects on living standards it had. Apparently, any sort of criticism of the anarchist form of socialism the communes pursued, even if entirely valid like it was in his case, was a cause of fundamental concern and existential angst for the Council. Like a punch in the gut or a smack to the face, words like traitor or fascist scum were thrown around. All he had suggested was for there to be some level of investment from the profits of Orenburg into the rural settlements it should have some level of concern for, after all they provided most of its food source. Now, a huffing, rather fat man rose from his seat and slammed the desk in front of him, slightly diminishing the din of the room. He requested for there to be a vote on the limits of freedom of speech in the Council meetings when it came to the foundational traditions of the communes, instead of the initial proposal. With utter chagrin and distaste for the clearly pleased buffoon that had just stood and the many that cheered his proposal, the original delegate sat down in utter disappointment. Nothing would change again."
 ORE.144.a: "The court of madness."

 ORE.145.t: "Scientists Arrive at Orenburg"
 ORE.145.d: "It was early in the morning when they arrived. A haggard group of men and women, some in lab coats, others simply with civilian clothes, but all of them were some of the best and brightest in their respective fields. They came from Black Mountain, sneaking and dodging through the patrols of Magnitogorsk, and it took them another two days on foot to arrive in Orenburg, but they had made it at last.\n\nWhen they were taken in by a patrolling militia on the outskirts, given food and water and assurances they would be safe, only then did they start to talk. of the horrors they'd seen inside the Black Mountain. Tales that they told in hushed tones and behind sobs of the experiments they had performed because they had no choice in the matter, or initially believed in a "greater good". They murmured about kidnappings, forced breedings, vivisections.\n\nSome refused to talk at all.\n\nBurba's men promised them sanctuary. The scientists would be given a place to stay, but only as long as they worked for Orenburg and its research divisions. This was a matter that took some convincing, and a demonstration of an actual code of ethics, but eventually, all of the scientists joined the city in its endeavours."
 ORE.145.a: "That mountain worries me..."

 ORE.146.t: "The Hand that Feeds"
 ORE.146.d: "Chaos has taken Pobedy Avenue.\n\nThe blood of the children of Orenburg now drips down the side of newly manufactured cars. It trickles into newly dug drains. It pools around the boots of freshly trained riot officers.\n\nModernization has shaken Orenburg to its core in many ways, and in many ways, this has been good! The people work. The people eat. The people enjoy prosperity unimagined just a scant few years prior. Orenburg has become a shining beacon in the darkness of Russia.\n\nBut it is not a perfect transition, for the people know something is lost. They can feel its conspicuous absence when they sleep, they feel scared without it under the watchful eyes of Burba's growing army of policemen, and they can feel it slowly slip from their bodies and disappear as they toil endlessly in factories without say and often pay.\n\nThe people of Orenburg have lost their freedom.\n\nThe protests were to be expected. At least so it seems, for the police were more than ready when they began. Brave and proud students were marching down Pobedy Avenue when dozens of officers carrying newly crafted riot shields and belts with freshly brewed tear gas swarmed them.\n\nClubs were swung and shots were fired, and by the end of the day, almost a dozen of Orenburg's best and brightest lay gasping their last in the street, over a hundred others stumbling away and nursing wounds from the mundane to the life threatening.\n\nIs this the price of progress?"
 ORE.146.a: "What else must we sacrifice for this future?"

 ORE.147.t: "A Home for the Impoverished?"
 ORE.147.d: "Those fortunate enough to have a place to reside and rest every night in this war-torn nation seldom come to pity those who have fallen upon hard times. As such, most assumed the construction of the new concrete building was merely another apartment for the decadent and the wealthy. But when the doors finally opened, many residents were shocked to find them open for anyone who needed a warm shelter from the cold or a meal when personal supplies have run dry. Those former peasants who aimlessly wandered for years, searching for a menial job or a place to stay can now finally rest.\n\nAleksander Burba's reform of Orenburg did not only come with promises of democratization but the goal of establishing welfare for the huddled masses of the Urals. With the opening of the first homeless shelters in Russia in the central city, the fulfillment of this lofty objective is now proven to be underway. In a speech given at the opening of the facility, Burba spoke of how in a sense all Russians are homeless in their disunity and constant uncertainty, framing the opening of the shelter as the first step towards not just curbing homelessness but establishing the motherland as a whole again. We can only hope for the best to come for the wayward vagabonds in this great exile."
 ORE.147.a: "A society is judged by how it treats its poorest."

 ORE.148.t: "The Burba Deal"
 ORE.148.d: "Work! Work for your family! Work for your comrades! Work for industry and for Orenburg and for Comrade Burba!\n\nAs part of Burba's newest set of reforms, only one of several dozen that have already been instituted in the last month, workers have been queueing up for employment at wages unseen in Russia for decades, in return for working at one of the numerous new factories and farms across Orenburg. Already, hundreds have found work at these new places of industry, and the streets are not lined with the desperate and the starving but with eager workers lining up for their daily pay or ration. Surely one can walk down the street and feel pride in their city, and while it may now be a bit harder to breath in the soot-choked air, this is a fine price to pay when the citizenry of Orenburg can now find easy work and reap the rewards of their labor. Where once windows sat dark from lack of light, or waste was thrown into streets from improper plumbing systems, there is now luxury!\n\nTo meet this growing class of workers is a growing class of clerks, middle managers, and bureaucrats to support them. The middle class has already sectioned themselves off into many of the newly built neighborhoods where they may enjoy more luxuriant quarters to their blue-collar counterparts. And that is not saying anything of those above them! As the factories chug to life, so too do the wheels of industry, and riding the cars that sit on those wheels are the rich and wealthy. Those who have had the skill, cunning, and ruthlessness to become the leaders of our fair city.\n\nYes, the skies may be black. Yes, the hospitals may be filled with workers missing fingers and arms from accidents in the factories. Yes, valuable space in the city may now be taken up by massive manors and other homes for the upper crust. But this is a price the people of Orenburg shall gladly pay, for they now live in the future! Or at least the present."
 ORE.148.a: "We have hit the bottom and are on the upswing."

 ORE.149.t: "The Coup Attempt"
 ORE.149.d: "The meeting was a normal one, long and boring but necessary all the same. Council members droned on and debated about everything on the agenda from the major to the minute. Several people were yawning, but they were doing important work. Burba sat at the head of the table, looking intensely interested in the current talk about a five percent boost in crop yields from a small village on the eastern fringe.\n\nAs the speaker continued to monologue about this topic of world-changing importance, soldiers began to file in on doors from either side. They arranged themselves in a circle and surrounded the table that the Council was meeting at. The people there all looked either terrified or grim with the exception of Burba, who continued to look fascinated at the bland talk of the oblivious councilman, who continued to spew his talk of distributing new grain and replicating successes. The speaker finally noticed the soldiers around him and stopped suddenly, giving a nervous gulp.\n\nThe grim-looking council members stood up and, with a dark tone of voice, the leader among them told Burba that he needed to go with these soldiers. His control had been a disaster and needed to end. Burba gave a slight nod, but then said "Oh, that won't be necessary." The councillors looked confused, then collectively their faces fell into terror as they realized the soldiers were aiming at them, not Burba. They were taken away, and Burba called for the meeting to resume. "I had a quick talk with the guards beforehand. Call it a hunch. Let's get back to business.""
 ORE.149.a: "Sly as a fox."

 ORE.150.t: "A New Democracy?"
 ORE.150.d: "One of the few constants in the organization of Orenburg's various communes is that elections always take place during the long winter, where the fields are empty and the village's population is huddled indoors. The year's events are discussed in the long evenings and the performance of the village's representative to Orenburg city is assessed. Before spring returns to the fields and the villagers, a new set of leaders is elected to lead the commune throughout the year and represent them in the Workers' Council and Congresses.\n\nThe idea of party politics took time to spread throughout Orenburg, since every commune was a master of its own affairs, and local citizens voted for men they knew personally. But the arcane workings of the Workers' Council began creating groups of friends and enemies, united or separated by common ideas about Orenburg's future. Based on Orenburg city's interests and the necessity of uniting to deal with regional problems, our predecessors in the reformist faction began building a coalition of representatives that believed in centralization. In reaction to this, a large autonomist bloc began forming to defend communal rights. Various other informal parties began appearing and disappearing as shifts in the workers' democracy broke alliances or brought new people together.\n\nThis year, however, our agents say things have changed. Our efforts to elect Chairman Burba and give him a mandate to shake things up in Orenburg has had a profound impact on the upcoming elections. A great number of factions have been subsumed into our new Progress and Development Party, while the previously almighty Autonomist Party is falling apart.\n\nAided by strategic bribing and by drafting the best and brightest minds of communes that could oppose us, we've managed to narrow down the list of candidates across the region to men of our party and a few independents. A new type of party politics is rising in Orenburg as ambitious men realize the only way to get a seat at the table is by helping us. The days where obstructionists were a force in Council politics are finally over."

 ORE.600.t: "The Black Brigade Finally Defeated!"
 ORE.600.desc: "At dawn this morning a final set of bandits from the Black Brigade was brought to the killing fields. The mix of German, Russian and Kazakh was dragged from the strip of land where they had been chained, and brought up the hill to their final resting place. If any of the defeated bandit had shown any aptitude for philosophy, perhaps they'd find grim humor in the fact that the rifles that would soon end their life had been forged in the worker communes they had once thought easy prey.\n\nThe threat of invasion by Dirlewanger's Brigade had changed Orenburg forever. Some would perhaps forever curse the new government brought on by the bandit crisis; others were grateful their fellow countrymen had pulled together in this darkest of times to stave off the apocalypse.\n\nThe bandits were not given trials, or any chance to defend themselves and their actions. Ever since escaping his death at the hands of Hans Speidel in the 50s, Dirlewanger and his men have pillaged and massacred their way through Russia. In so adding to the Russian people's misery, the bandit king has forged his own black legend. Now anyone caught ever associating with him is rightfully marked for death.\n\nThe final battle of the war saw Orenburg's troops break through the weakened Brigade and assault its final holding. Dirlewanger tried to die as he'd lived, fighting and killing with his men. But in a final act of karmic justice he was knocked out by one of his men that hoped to trade the bandit king for clemency. The old German was dragged back to Orenburg, where crowds of deliriously happy citizens gathered to see his execution.\n\nThe traitorous bandit joined his comrade on the killing fields on this final day. The criminals' corpse would help feed the soil of Mother Russia. A fitting coda to lives spent burning down the lands of innocent men and women."
 ORE.600.a: "Justice has prevailed!"

 ORE.601.t: "The Black Mountain's Madness Dispelled!"
 ORE.601.desc: "Orenburg's men began their final push against the Black Mountain this morning. Magnitogorsk's tired and demoralized NKVD soldiers lost defensive position after defensive positions. These were no longer the scared and isolated peasants that the head scientist had once sent them kidnap; the flames of war had hardened the men of Orenburg. Little by little the communal army had cut through Magnitogorsk's defenses. Miners had been brought up to the front to dig new path ways into the mountain, crumbling vast sections of tunnels on hapless NKVD troopers. How could the red army remnant send parties to repel the miners? Their manpower and ammunition was already at a critical level.\n\nThe final blow did not come from Orenburg's heavy weapon teams relentless pounding against the main tunnels. Nor did it come from above as daring raiders climbed down mineshafts into the heart of the Black Mountain. No, the final blow came from within the laboratories. Horrified NKVD officers heard over the radio of an uprising by the ragged prisoners, somehow freed from their cells. Positions fortified against the outside world were quickly overrun by the Black Mountain's victims.\n\nBy early afternoon several NKVD divisions raised a white flag, desperate to escape from the tide of escaped experimentation victims. Orenburg's officers refused any quarter for the accomplices of the Black Mountain's experiments. Soon the final pockets of NKVD resistance were surrounded and eliminated.\n\nThe men of Orenburg listened to the freed prisoners' mad rantings about the nightmare of steel and glass hidden in the depths of the mountain. A small task force of veteran soldier made its way to the laboratory area. One by one the men came back, faces white with horror. Finally their officer returned from the depths with Lysenko's final experimental diary. Later that day he read the journal, pages lit by the fire purging the Black Mountain's depths -\n\n'Diary entry 1428-F - Unplanned technical difficulty arising from group 'Orenburg' – See local factions document 13 gamma – Specimens of project -REDACTED- must see early field test. Orders to intern Anatoly to fetch me the keys to the holding cells.""

 ORE.602.t: "The NKVD's Surrender"
 ORE.602.desc: "Today the surviving commanders of the NKVD lifted a white flag above their final fortifications. The fighting men of Orenburg counted their blessings that they had not been fighting the insane Lysenko. The mad scientist would likely have held out until the bitter end.\n\nThe officers of the NKVD came forward and gave their weapons to their counterparts in Orenburg's security forces. The remnants of the Red Army were melancholy at their defeat. They had dreamed of restoring the Soviet Union, of imposing order on the lawless expanse of the Russian anarchy. Some of the more ambitious had held dream of once again seeing the red banner of communism stand with its eagles across the planet. A proof that the dream of the worker's revolution had not been a failed experiment, squashed by the German boot.\n\nBut perhaps they had not been the right men for the jobs. They had cowered in the shadow of the Black Mountain, wasting time and good men on Lysenko's depraved assignments. The rest of Russia had moved on without them. Perhaps the true standard bearers of the worker's will would be Orenburg, reforged as it was in conflict.\n\nThis conclusion was not reached by all of the NKVD's officers, of course. Some blamed their men, or other officers, or random circumstances beyond their control. Sometimes order simply can't triumph over chaos. And to these men, with the NKVD snuffed out so the last hope for an orderly and modern Russia was now gone. Better surrender to those rabble and drink themselves to death as the Russian anarchy continued."

 ORE.517.t: "Orenburg Begins to Arm"
 ORE.517.d: "There was an underlying tension almost palpable to the hurried citizens of Orenburg as they rushed through the crowded city streets. The commune, usually a place of unrelenting indecision with its various committees and political infighting, finally had been pushed together to reach a decisive goal. Metal clanging and other work noises mingled with the stress hovering over the city. A din representative of a united body gearing up to become ready to face the outside forces which threatened its mere existence.\n\nEach workshop, each home with tools, all working to create variants of small arms and ammunition for themselves and the militias who would need to be raised to mount an organised defence. Despite a lack of central organisation and control, productivity was and remained exceptional, ensuring that even if quality was lacking, quantity would easily make up for it."

 ORE.518.t: "Alekseevka Begins to Arm"
 ORE.518.d: "The news of rapid armament from Orenburg had reached the small communes town council only a few hours after the makeshift workshops had begun their production in the bustling regional capital. Realising that Orenburg will likely need all the militias it can arm, it fell upon the decision makers of Alexeyevka to organise the towns defences in order to protect the river commune.\n\nThere was nowhere near the same amount of industrial capacity, nor resources, to convert the workshops and factories to small arm production. Neither were there as many willing volunteers to join the makeshift militias as a sizable number of Alexeyevka's residents had already migrated to Orenburg. This however did not deter those committed enough who had remained and within half a day a similar din of productivity could be heard going late into the night. No matter how many guns the town could produce, they would at least contribute to the defence of the anarchist project of the Southern Urals."
