 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KAZEMBEK_DESC: "In 1917, many Russian nobles saw their dreams crushed in a single moment. Their belongings were taken away and their Motherland was stolen by the Bolshevik beasts, dooming them to a beggarly existence abroad. Suffering from longing for the Motherland, many emigrants and their children sought for a new ideology to follow instead of the failed reactionary ideals and many saw the future in the most consistent and radical anti-Communist ideology of the time - fascism. For Alexander Lvovich Kazembek, a son of a Russian noble of Azeri descent, the Russian model of Fascism was the only way forward to bridge the gap between the Tsar and the commoners and establish a Russian national power, based on class collaboration and Tsarist ideocracy. Kazembek and his fellow-minded peers united into the Union of Mladorossi, which, despite its eclecticism and youthful vigor, attracted many prominent Russian exiles.\n\nBut even Kazembek's admiration for Mussolini couldn't be nearly as controversial as his fascination - if not to say, sympathy - with the Soviet system. Recognizing the inherent rottenness of the Marxist ideology, he claimed that the Russian people digested the Bolshevik brutality and overcame it from the inside, with the Soviet government, for all its flaws, becoming a true representative of the national interests. Most expected was his stance against the Nazi invaders to the Soviet Union, although as his reputation among the emigrant circles faded and he had to leave for the United States, he could little to do to resist them.\n\nA faithful and loyal monarchist, Kazembek accompanied Emperor Vladimir III in his war against the WRRF, putting aside his reservations. After the war, he became the crown's representative in Berezniki, managing the daily affairs of the reclaimed Tsarist province and organizing the industrial work for the needs of the Empire. Despite his nominal allegiance to the Tsar, there is little doubt in his ambitions, as Kazembek has never abandoned his desire to see the triumph of people's monarchy."

 MAR_Miklay_Kazakov: "Miklay Kazakov"
 POLITICS_MIKLAY_KAZAKOV_DESC: "The Mari people had long been denied their nationhood by every Russian state and its successors who ruled over them. Whether they bore the red banner of socialism or the tricolor, it was all the same, but Miklay Ivanovich Kazakov made it his life's goal to change that. As the victory of the Anti-Communist Guard in West Russia became almost an inevitability, he rallied ethnic Mari across the region to join a Mari Regiment which fought alongside the Guard.\n\nLabelled the "warrior poet" by his compatriots, as he always kept a passion for poetry and literature, Kazakov was the obvious choice to be placed as the leader of the first ethnic Mari state and so he became.\n\nThe Republic has been another success story for North Russia, as Kazakov has stabilized it and looks to other states of the Idel-Ural as well as Arkhangelsk for cooperation and solidarity."
