 POLITICS_FERDINAND_SCHORNER_DESC:0 "Many called Schörner a failure. He failed to achieve the glory he truly desired in the World War, he failed to stomp the Russians and fill the power vacuum left by the SS in West Russia, and he failed to take control of the Wehrmacht after years of planning when the damnable Speidel betrayed him and destroyed his career. Schörner, however, is a man with a plan. Having followed Göring for as long as was necessary to once find himself with a significant amount of power, Schörner now fights for nobody but himself.\n\nTearing down the infrastructure Göring had so desperately built to form his militant faction, Schörner has now declared that the Civil War will only end when every 'Volksverräter', or 'people's traitor', is dead.\n\nMany, however, have taken issue with this statement. Not only at the insinuation that so many must die, but at the vagueness of the words. To Schörner, the Reich is a sterling white canvas, and the man only has one large brush and ever increasing bucket of blood."
