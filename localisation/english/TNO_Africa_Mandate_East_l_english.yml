While on paper, it should be made up of military representatives from all around the OFN, it is basically an American-ruled military protectorate. This new administration, reluctantly led by the American general William Westmoreland, will have to compromise and do its best to clean up the mess left behind by the old Reichskommissariat. The corruption from the Hüttig regime runs deep, and if America is to capitalize on this East African puppet, much work will have to be done."

 OFN_MZB_a_mismanaged_territory_desc:0 "One of the great things about the Hüttig regime was that it was very efficient. Armies and resource extraction were clearly sorted and filed, concentration camps and major bases were marked clearly on maps and had access to electricity and other amenities, and every last bureaucratic detail had been neatly organized for the American occupation to find. Unfortunately, this administrative beauty ran only skin deep- that is to say, it only applied to official outposts and property of the Reichskommissariat. Deep in the jungles of Mozambique and Tanzania, on the plains of Zambia, or the Kenyan Savannah, one would be hard-pressed to find any evidence that Hüttig and his butchers had ever been here at all.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the German administration had very little true control over its territory. When a new labor camp or mine needed to be built, it would be, while the rest of the "Dark Continent" went unexplored and unexploited. In reality, while there were a few bases and mines inland, almost all of the Reichskommissariat's infrastructure was a few miles in from the coast. If America is to capitalize on this military government, the riches of East Africa must be found and used... without slavery, this time."

There is too little infrastructure, too little capital, and too little time. If this East African venture is not only to be a successful government, but also a successful economic venture for the United States, this problem must be rectified. So, General Westmoreland and his senior military staff have devised a plan: invite American and OFN corporations to invest in and develop the East Africa on their own. Similar to how the American West was tamed by corporations and the growing desire for more land and resources, so too might East Africa be tamed by corporations from all around the OFN. By doing this, it will not only develop the land, but also create a steady, reliable source of income for both the Interim Government and the United States."

Dozens of large, industrial-scale chemical production facilities were constructed on the coast during the German occupation, ostensibly to produce water purification tablets, pesticides, and malaria medication. There is, of course, no way to verify this claim, as most of the actual production lines were destroyed. Regardless of what these chemical plants were used for originally, there is still quite a lot of machinery intact.

Smaller towns and villages find themselves often host to bandits or local warlords. These groups take what the want and move on, leaving destruction in their wake. As such, isolated industrial complexes that handle volatile materiel, and thus must be away from civilization, make ideal targets. Chemical plants and other such important industries have seen many factories raided or destroyed by roving bands of marauders, and while this problem persists, it will be much harder to convince American corporations to invest here. Thus, it becomes necessary to protect these factories as if they were military outposts. Every factory shall have at least a platoon of American soldiers to oversee and protect it from outside harm such that a raid, or worse, a takeover, is rendered almost impossible."

With much of the chemical industry going to Dow Chemical, the weapons and arms sector lies relatively clear of private interests. Thus, we can create the Eastern Arms Company- a new corporation that would produce weapons and supplies for soldiers not just in East Africa, but across the OFN. We could easily invite some savvy American business magnates and entrepreneurs to chair the board, and we already have the factories to produce the equipment, so the operation should be relatively low risk, with the potential for high reward."

The longer the people of East Africa see American troops enforcing law, collecting taxes, and harvesting resources, the more discontent will grow, and the more that people will see the mandates as no better than the Kommissariats. By allowing much more regional autonomy and giving the people a method of letting their voices and concerns be heard, the stability and longevity of the Interim Government can be greatly improved."

Villages were burned to the ground for the smallest of failures and tens of thousands toiled in horrific mines and labor camps where the life expectancy was measured in weeks. If the new OFN Interim Government is to maintain a semblance of peace and stability, it must show the population that it is different than the old Nazi regime. Workers shall be paid wages, Africans shall have a say in governance, and the deliberate mistreatment of the land and its people shall be put to an end. While these may seem obvious solutions to native unrest, the people of East Africa have been seeing white Westerners exploit and rape their homeland for more than a century.

Many local populations have asked for the camps to be fully destroyed, not only to ensure that they never re-open, but also to remove a dark memory that continues to pollute the land. Recognizing the opportunity for good publicity, Westmoreland and his staff have decided to quite literally blow up the remaining labor camps on live television. Not only would it be a spectacular show of OFN might, it would improve the image of the OFN government both at home and abroad."

According to many, often contradictory witness statements, these old SS officers are low on almost every resource but sheer brutality. Many villages in more isolated territories report attacks from well armed white men, still flying the colors of Hüttig's Reichskommissariat. If these reports and rumors are true, these remnants present a clear and imminent danger to the stability and security of the OFN Interim Government, for if they can continue operations, they will drastically lower the confidence of the native population in the OFN's military capabilities. In light of such danger, Westmoreland and the general staff plan to launch a massive, heavily-publicized campaign to find the remaining SS units hiding in the jungle and destroy them."

Lack of interest in Africa, the collapse of the Reich's economy, and more ample and fertile land to be found in Europe left little reason to invest into East Africa. However, many traces of German rule can still be found lingering in each and every corner of the old colony. Roadsigns and rail line markers are written almost exclusively in German, many thousands of white Nazi settlers live in cities and towns dotting the coast, and some old German infrastructure still remains intact. In order to erase these traces of Nazi taint, the signs will be rewritten in both the local language and English; the German infrastructure base will be torn down or repurposed; and the Nazi settlers will be investigated. In their place, American companies and industrial conglomerates will be invited in once more to fill the economic hole left by the tumor of Nazism."

While most of them are low-ranking officials and their families, they still participated in and allowed vicious crimes against humanity to go on. In addition, their continued presence in East Africa has drawn much ire and caused quite a bit of friction with the natives. Thus, as they are partially criminal and detrimental to the stability of the Interim Government, General Westmoreland and the military staff have elected to deport the Germans.

The call is especially loud amongst the Africans, who, after years of desolation at the hands of these men, wish to see them get their just dues. To improve relations with the native Africans, as well as appease the doves back home, Westmoreland has decided not to sit upon the drumhead and outright sentence the remaining war criminals to death. Rather, the Nazis of the East African regime will be put on trial for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other charges. This will give the Interim government very good PR back home, as well as please the native Africans."

As much as the Germans of Hüttig's regime were brutal war criminals, they were unusually efficient in organizing and running the vast, disparate territories of East Africa. Now that these low-level bureaucrats and administrators have been imprisoned, executed, or deported, there are now many holes in the administrative goings-on of the Interim government. To remedy this issue, non-essential OFN officers of rank captain or higher will be officially assigned administrative duties for the betterment of the Interim government.

Now, however, with the government's rule firmly established, Westmoreland and the general staff believe the time has come to begin the long process of transitioning to a civilian government.

In addition, the Nazis... methods had a way of radicalizing and riling up the people to support these warlords. With the support of small villages and entire swathes of countryside to hide in, they can wage an endless war against whatever powers they believe has it out for them. The success of the OFN's African governments rests on the knife's edge with this issue, for if mishandled, the entire house of cards might just come tumbling down."

It will remain an issue for at least a few years, at best. Thus, it becomes necessary to adopt more long term strategies in dealing with it. For this task, Westmoreland and his staff favor the age-old strategy of pure, unadulterated attrition. Hit the warlords fast, frequently, and where it hurts. Bombing runs on supply depots, securing sources of food and water, and annihilating any military targets that dare to expose themselves. In a few months, when most of the warlords are starving, perhaps they'll reconsider their life choices, and make sure the few they have left are more thought through."

As there is no good reason not to, Westmoreland and officials from the government will meet with these amiable groups to pursue potential alliances.

In the current East African situation, that means American blood; blood that will no doubt draw ire from back home. To avoid this problem somewhat, General Westmoreland has proposed a plan: hiring native East African tribesmen and recruiting them into ragtag militia groups to fight the remaining Nazis and warlords. These natives bear no great love for either of the latter groups, as they have been responsible for the destruction and poverty now seen across much of the countryside. While these native militias would be somewhat poorly equipped, trained, and disciplined, they could open up a massive manpower pool that will be necessary in restoring law and order to a region utterly bereft of either."

They can hold their own against a small scale raid or two, but as soon as a warlord takes notice of them and their positions, they may as well be throwing rocks for all the good it will do them. They are deeply motivated and eager to fight, they just aren't that good at it. To remedy this problem, Westmoreland and the general staff will begin training regimens for these newly-created units of militia. At the moment, they may be disorganized, undisciplined, and under-supplied, with a bit of assistance from American drill sergeants, they might just be whipped into a fighting force capable of pushing back the warlords."

There are too many places to hide, too many unmarked paths to travel, and too much terrain to cover. However, warlords often raid villages around their headquarters for supplies, making it rather easy to find their hiding holes in the jungle. While we often lack the troops to take these bases in a ground assault, they can still be weakened or destroyed through superior firepower. By organizing bombing raids on known warlord strongholds, we can deal a serious blow to their ability to collect supplies and fight effectively without putting any of our precious manpower at risk.

Now, however, the OFN is ready to bring down the nuisance of the warlords. We have enough men, we have enough supplies, and we have enough will to finally begin to crush this problem before it gets any worse. American troops and local militias will now begin the long, arduous fight of pushing the warlords back, rather than just slowing them down.

By doing the same, the OFN Interim Government could achieve something similar. Of course, given their prior cooperation with the Hüttig regime, the move will be controversial, so Westmoreland will arrange suitable punishment for the harshest of collaborators.

The rest will receive prison time accordingly.\n\nThose warlords and rebel leaders still not in government custody, with few forces left under their command, are basically irrelevant. Still, they are criminals and agitators and must be treated as such.

The transition from a military government to a civilian one will not be simple or easy, however, and it will require a great deal of effort on the part of everyone involved.

A very large portion of the population believe in socialism of a kind, which will inevitably form part of the backbone of whatever new nation or nations East Africa becomes. Thus, General Westmoreland will begin to negotiate with socialist territories and rebel groups, giving many of them much more power in native affairs and government.

The Komissariat of East Africa had some of the most advanced chemical tech on Earth before it and its technology fell into the hands of the OFN. By digging through all the research they had collected over the years, the OFN could gain very valuable insights into German combat and medical capabilities, as well as gaining and edge on them in terms of chemical weaponry.

As such, the nerve agent VX, discovered by the Hüttig regime, has come to General Westmoreland's attention. It is extremely fast acting and far more potent than similar chemicals like sarin, taking less than ten milligrams to kill a man.

Now, they have set their sights on Tanganyika, one of the most populous and important provinces in the entire region. With much more concentrated and organized forces, the warlords are causing absolute mayhem. The American garrisons aren't strong enough to mount an effective defense of every remote town, and the native militias and socialist allies are either deserting or retreating in the face of this onslaught.\n\nGeneral Westmoreland knows that if this situation is allowed to continue, it could spiral out of control, possibly leading to the complete destruction of the OFN presence here.

 OFN_MZB.1.desc:0 "The situation in East Africa is multifaceted and complex, but in summary there are two regions in the country. The first is the coastal region, which was well-developed by the Germans and serves as a convenient port of call for our vessels and can be held against attacks from the interior. This is where the majority of East Africa's industry is located, well-secured against attacks and sabotage, and we can use their same defenses to keep it secured for the United States.\n\nThe other region of note is the interior, a wilderness of jungle where very little has changed under our occupation. It is occupied primarily by rebels who originally sought to avoid the depredations of the Nazis, but do not seem interested in cooperating with the United States government either. The situation in the interior will likely continue to cause problems throughout the course of our mission.\n\nAs for the available resources, the primary one of note is the chemical industry that Hüttig was building up before his overthrow and disappearance. It is currently geared to the production of chemical weapons, which could be retooled and retasked to the benefit to OFN investors from the chemical industry, or used to bolster the military capabilities of the OFN.\n\nIn conclusion, while the occupation is likely to be short, we can provide significant boons to American business while we figure out a way to bring relative stability to the region."

What was taking them so long?\n\nAt last, the door opened and Peers walked out, giving him a salute. "They're all ready for you, sir."\n\n"Took them long enough." Westmoreland grumbled, as he followed Peers into the room and let the door shut behind him.\n\nBefore them were gathered representatives of Dow Chemical; these were men of unknowable economic influence and importance, all seated at a long table and facing him. Westmoreland was not one to be easily intimidated, however. "Welcome, gentlemen, to East Africa. I'm sure you're all aware why I asked you all to meet with me, because there's really only one good reason: I'm offering to make the chemical industry of East Africa available for the use of Dow Chemical."\n\nA few murmurs came from the representatives, but most regarded this with quiet interest. "General Westmoreland, if I may?" One of them asked. At Westmoreland's nod, the man continued. "How much do you expect to charge us for the use of this industry? Surely you aren't doing this out of the kindness of your heart."\n\nThat got a smile from Westmoreland. "This is my favorite part! We aren't charging you any money; there's no initial investment necessary on your part." After pausing for a moment, Westmoreland continued. "But! Full cooperation with the OFN is expected, so if we need your help with anything, you'd best be prepared to do so, or we're both in trouble."

More Africans would be brought into the administration and involved in the plans for the new government, and therefore the Mandate would be made more legitimate, hopefully reducing the level of unrest.\n\nOf course, that didn't mean Westmoreland was giving up actual control.\n\nThe military regime would be transferred into this transitional administration, to keep the peace and further develop the plans of the OFN for East Africa. This would be a temporary measure, of course; the Mandate wouldn't last forever after all. However, as Westmoreland went over the latest version of the plans for the new government, he thought that for now, only the military could be trusted to prevent conflict."

 OFN_MZB.4.desc:0 ""What is this place, anyway? Any idea, Chuck?" Two American soldiers, closely followed by the rest of their squad, made their way into the facility before them, which had a strangely ominous appearance, with its high towers and sharp wire fences. Something in the back of PFC Charles Bird's mind wanted to run away, just throw away everything and run from this place, but he ignored it. It was just a bunch of creepy buildings, nothing more.\n\n"They said something about it being a 'concentration camp', that we had to check it out to make sure it was safe to dismantle. I dunno what that means, but if I'm being honest, Bill, it doesn't sound too friendly." Charles jerked his head in one direction, trying to get Private William Jones to head that way. "Let's try to wrap this up quickly so we can get the hell out of here."\n\nBarely a minute had passed before a yelp rang out, and Charles rolled his eyes; Private William probably got spooked by his own shadow or something like that. As he marched over to William, he noticed the Private was struck with genuine terror while looking at the open door before him. "Bill, what is the damn meaning of this?" Charles asked, his tone half furious and half concerned.\n\nBacking away from the door slowly, William pointed a shaking finger towards it, his words coming out like the ravings of a madman. "Chuck, they- they're all- Oh, God. God, please, help them!"\n\nPushing William aside, Charles looked into the dark building for himself. Greeting him was the sight of an indeterminable number of people who looked like the essence of death. To the last, they were Africans, but every single one looked so frail, so starved, that they might shatter in the wind. Charles felt the horror of it all creep into every inch of his body. Behind him, he heard William puking up his guts, and could only quietly whisper his next words.\n\n"God help them all.""

 OFN_MZB.5.desc:0 ""Gentlemen of the jury, we are gathered here today for the trial of Franz Hössler and those of his Schutzstaffel associates here with him today."\n\nThis was the beginning of the Quelimane Trials, in which numerous captured SS officers would be tried by a jury consisting entirely of reliable junior American military officers, so there was little doubt in the minds of anyone in the room of how the trial would play out. Presiding over the court was U.S. Army General William R. Peers, who had ensured that the trials would be held in total secrecy so as to prevent a diplomatic crisis with the Reich. Turning to the accused, he continued. "Mr Hössler, please rise to hear the charges."\n\nHössler did so, and the clerk began reading off his crimes. "Mr. Hössler, you are charged that throughout the course of the South African conflict, you committed war crimes and crimes against the African people." Looking directly at Hössler himself, the clerk said the next part slowly. "How do you plead?"\n\nRather than fear, or regret, or anything of the sort, the only emotion that SS-Obersturmbannführer Franz Hössler showed was delight. "Guilty, not guilty, what does it matter in this court of yours?" He replied, an amused grin across his face. "Since you asked, though, I am guilty! I have overseen the extermination of countless mongrels and subhumans, and were I a free man, I would gladly see to that of countless more. Yes, I am guilty, and I could not be more proud of it, you filthy dogs!"\n\nAs General Peers only shook his head in response, military police restrained Hössler for his remarks. "So be it. Franz Hössler, you are hereby sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for your crimes. May God grant you mercy one day, because you'll never find it again on Earth." As the MPs dragged Hössler out of the courtroom, he looked up at Peers with utter contempt. Without sparing him a single glance, Peers turned to the clerk of the court. "Who's next?""

 OFN_MZB.6.desc:0 "With the trials concluded and the accused convicted to a man, General William R. Peers now sat at his desk with a summary of the proceedings. Looking it over, he felt fairly satisfied with the result. Most, like Hössler, had been proud of their genocidal work, monsters without even the pretense of regret. Others had at least seemed to be apologetic, but which were faking it, Peers never could tell. Either way, they needed to pay to the fullest for what they had done, and from now on they would, spending the rest of their days in secret prison cells and forced to give the United States information about the SS to lessen their suffering in the slightest. It was the least they deserved.\n\nNevertheless, the thought that the public might learn about the trials, and thereby the Reich, worried Peers. He had prohibited civilians from attending and sworn all officers present to secrecy, yet doubt still plagued his mind. There might be much intelligence to be gained and propaganda to be made from this, but he had to wonder if that outweighed the potential diplomatic crisis that might come about if the source were ever discovered. There was no such thing as winning a nuclear war.\n\nPutting the summary inside of a box labeled 'Top Secret', he swiftly closed and locked it to hinder prying eyes. "It's all set, come on in." He commanded, and the door to his office swung open to reveal a young officer who served as his aide, quickly giving him a crisp salute. "I want you to take this directly to the Pentagon. There's a flight ready for you, take it and no matter what don't take your eyes off this box. If you lose it, or open it, there will be severe consequences for you. Am I clear?" At the young man's yes, sir, Peers handed the locked box over to him and watched as he carried it off into the distance, out of sight. Then, he leaned back in his chair and sighed. There was no easy cure for his concerns, but now it was out of his hands and he had done what he could to serve his country and all of humanity. If nothing else, he could be proud of that."

The warehouse itself had been utterly decimated, and the supplies contained within even more so. It had not been a great loss or anything. The warehouse had been one that only contained clothing, and John figured he could order the men to reuse their own sweaty clothes until more arrived. It would not be too great a bother.\n\nThe fire did not seem natural. Nothing this close to the docks could have caused it, unless there had been a thunderstorm John had completely missed. The question remained: had it been negligence by some lazy worker, or had it been sabotage? As he tried to puzzle it out, John began to pace up and down the pier, his feet carefully dodging those spots marked by char. He turned back towards the warehouse and, out of the corner of his eye, spotted something shimmering beneath the waves.\n\nJohn crouched down, somewhat precariously leaning over the edge of the pier to get a better look. He squinted, trying to make out the shape through the black depths. As the murkiness cleared, a sudden realization struck him. Someone had dropped a gasoline barrel down there.\n\nQuickly, he turned, and began to shout towards his idle patrol. "Woods! Johnson! Help me get this out of the water." A sense of dread slowly began to seep into the American officer as his men rushed over."

Only a yellow son of a bitch would think the US army could be beaten back by some natives calling themselves the Freedom Military Force. Even if they had begun to make very worrisome gains in the past few months.\n\nWhen they began to seize control of land from the army in Zanzibar, attacking Harkins' patrols in the process, these bellyachers got even louder, exclaiming that the effort in Africa was doomed. They could not see what Harkins saw. An opportunity. With rebels and enemies right out in the open, the General knew that, in firm effort, they could smash through them, defeating the enemies of the United States once and for all.

Someone had to.\n\nPeers did not know what had been done by the Freedom Military Force, and what had been done by the United States Military. Their orders were to only fire at the FMF men, but to the green boys who made up his regiment, every black man with a rifle was an insurgent. What Peers knew for certain was that only one side would be celebrating this massacre, and only one side had survived to take the blame.\n\nThere would be consequences for this, ripple effects throughout the Mandate. If there were still natives who believed the US was looking out for the Africans first and foremost, Peers damn well hoped they didn't hear about this. Before, there had been skirmishes and rebellions. The Military Force may well have started another war.
