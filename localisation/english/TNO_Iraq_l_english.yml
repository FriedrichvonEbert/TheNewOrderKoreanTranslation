 #Leader Descriptions
 #POLITICS_Abd_al_Karim_Qasim_DESC:0 "압둘 카림 카심은 이라크의 총리로 재임하는 동안 알-자임, 지도자라는 칭호를 얻었고, 그의 수많은 적들도 그가 충분히 자격이 있다는걸 인식합니다. 수니파와 시아파 혼혈로 태어난 카심은 영국-이라크 전쟁 당시 반란군 장교로 복무하며 빠르게 진급했습니다. 전쟁동안 리더로서의 카리스마와 교활함으로 유명세를 얻은 카심은 곧 이라크군의 유력 인사로 떠올라 범아랍 세력들 사이에 동맹 연결망을 형성했습니다. 동시에 그는 이탈리아 점령군과 좋은 관계를 유지했고, 조심스레 양 진영과 함께 일했지만 실제로는 둘 다 속하지 않았습니다.\n\n인기 없는 골든 스퀘어 괴뢰정권은 마침내 1958년 7얼 14일 혁명으로 무너졌습니다. 카심은 자신이 혁명의 "중도"이자 "합리적인" 목소리라고 자처했고, 이탈리아와의 접촉을 계속 유지했습니다. 혁명가들은 범아랍연맹과 이탈리아 제국주의에 맞선 광범위한 반란을 일으켰습니다. 이 물결을 여러 파벌들의 내분으로 변했고, 파시스트 대군이 이라크 국경에 집결하면서 명백히 어두워졌습니다. 카심은 양측에 대한 군사 반란을 주도하고 로마와 협상을 시도했습니다. 카심은 소규모 이탈리아 주둔군을 허용하고 아랍 통합의 모든 꿈을 포기하는 대가로 독립된 이라크 공화국 총리직을 유지할 수 있었습니다. 카심은 이 협상을 기꺼이 받아들였습니다.\n\n그때부터 카심은 자신의 비전대로 이라크를 만들기 시작했습니다. 이탈리아가 지켜보는 와중에도 진보적이고 개혁적인 정책들을 추진하여 이라크를 현대적 국가로 바꾸는걸 목표로 토지 개혁, 사회 개혁, 교육 캠페인을 실시하기 시작했습니다. 그의 개혁은 대담하면서도 조심스러웠습니다. 어둠속에 존재하는 수많은 적과 가면쓴 동료들을 자극하는걸 두려워했기 때문입니다. 저들은 정말 수없이 많습니다. 카심이 한때 배신했던 바트주의자와 나세르주의자를 비롯한 많은 이들이 음흉하게 알-자임의 파멸을 모의하고 음모를 꾸미며 어둠 속에서 기다립니다."
 POLITICS_Abd_al_Karim_Qasim_DESC:0 "What is the legacy of Iraq's Sole Leader? How will he be remembered?\n\nBorn in dire poverty to a Sunni Arab father and a Shia Feyli Kurd mother, Abd al-Karim Qasim was not someone expected to amount to anything. He became a teacher, then a member of the army. His intelligence and boyish charisma helped him rise through the ranks. These qualities led, in the 1950s, to Qasim being invited into the Free Officers Movement, a disorganized group of military officers determined to destroy the Italian-backed government. Almost single-handedly, Qasim seized control of the group and used it to overthrow the Hashemite monarchy. This victory alone would have been enough to make him a national hero but his subsequent triumph over the Triumvirate's invading forces, the embodiments of colonialism, in 1959 made him revered, an icon across the region.\n\nOutwardly, little has changed since the revolution and the signing of the Italo-Iraqi Friendship Treaty that ended the invasion. Though Qasim's Iraqi nationalism runs headlong into rising pan-Arab sentiment and though his concessions to the Italians have stirred complaints, Qasim remains a towering figure. Most are willing to tolerate his idiosyncratic leadership, his purges of one-time friends, and his progressive reforms because they still believe in his conception of the revolution. They still believe in his vision of a modern Iraqi state where people of all faiths and backgrounds can unite to overcome poverty, sectarian division, and foreign exploitation.\n\n§xAt least for now...§!" 

 POLITICS_IRAQI_COMMAND_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "§x\"This Iraq and this state of tribulation\nNo regime can fix her condition\nHer sons under the rule of base tyranny\nIntruders among them rule in her name\nThe innocent are pursued by the guilty\nAnd the righteous persecuted by the wicked\nThe desire of the individual is sanctified as law\nIn spite of us, the sacrosanct communities.\"§!\n\n- Bahr  al-'Ulum, \"Diwan\""

 POLITICS_Vito_Miceli_DESC:0 "Vito Miceli, Italian consul in Baghdad, knew the Iraqis had gone too far with their so-called \"revolution\" when Qasim started talking about nationalizing the oil industry. The stupid bastard had probably expected him to twiddle his thumbs as the Arabs stole Italy's hard-earned oil, but no. Miceli was smarter than that. As chaos spread across the Middle East and the vultures started circling, Vito Miceli took matters into his own hands to protect Italian interests. He found a few dissatisfied members of the Iraqi army and some long-time friends in the Italian special services, then he used them to wipe the \"Sole Leader\" off the map. He was there when the man died, babbling incoherently about how he had been a friend to the poor and built them \"thousands of little homes.\"\n\nThe next step was supposed to be easy. Miceli would find some new \"Sole Leader,\" a simple-minded puppet that would know his place. Instead, anarchy followed Qasim's death and Miceli found himself stranded in Baghdad, propping up a \"transitional authority\" with little domestic legitimacy, transparently beholden to Italian interests.\n\nNow, Vito Miceli must fight not only for the glory of the Italian empire but for his life as well. For as complicated as Qasim's legacy might be, few will suffer the continued survival of a man who embodies the absolute worst that colonialism and imperialism has to offer."

 POLITICS_ABD_AL_RAHMAN_AL_BAZZAZ_DESC:0 "The 1941 and 1958 revolutions were a popular uprising against decades of Arab oppression, but they were co-opted by sinister forces, writes Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz. It is time to put the revolution back on track.\n\nBorn in Baghdad in 1913 to a wealthy Sunni family, al-Bazzaz's early life was one of privilege and intellectual success. He completed elementary and high school at the top of his class. He graduated from Baghdad School of Law in 1934 during a time of national chaos and uncertainty. He received a law degree from King's College in London in the final years before the German invasion. Returning a committed democrat and anti-imperialist, he joined the Golden Square government's uprising against its English overlords. He became the dean of the Baghdad Law College, using his position to advocate for a democratic Arab nationalism interwoven with Islamic ideals.\n\nBut the next few years proved to be a series of disappointments. The Golden Square government revealed itself, not as a vessel for pan-Arab liberation, but Italian imperialism. His decision to speak against it led to his arrest and torture. He enjoyed a brief period of freedom after the Revolution of 1958, only to again be arrested by Qasim for allegedly conspiring against the government. His attempts to join with pan-Arab forces on the eve of the civil war were thwarted when he was accused of being an "enemy of Arab socialism."\n\nScorned by all other factions, al-Bazzaz finds himself representing Iraq's constitutionalists, a faction composed primarily of the country's wealthy and middle class. Determined to maintain civilian control and stay true to his democratic, pan-Arab ideals, al-Bazzaz will need to use all his diplomatic, intellectual, and political skills to keep his movement- and himself- alive."

 POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "Many groups speak of oppression, of their struggle to assert their independence in a world overrun with violent imperialists. Yet, they are blind to the ways they oppress others, to the violence they inflict in the name of their so-called "revolutions."\n\nMustafa Barzani understands this fact more than most people. He was weaned inside a prison after Turkish forces imprisoned his entire family. His childhood was punctuated by executions of his grandfather, father, and brother. As a teenager, Mustafa both fought in and led rebellions against British forces and the newly established Iraqi monarchy- actions that led to his exile. When he finally returned to Kurdistan after the Golden Square's revolution, he found his entire home destroyed and his people starving. His pleas to Baghdad for aid were met with crackdowns, interrupted only by a Turkish invasion in 1959 and a second war between Iraq and Turkey a few years later. Despite it all, Mustafa Barzani never stopped fighting for his people.\n\nWhile Mustafa Barzani respected Qasim and humored his promises of a multi-ethnic republic, he never surrendered his hope for a free Kurdistan. He sees the Oil Crisis as the best opportunity to end centuries of oppression for himself and his people. While there are quiet grumblings about his leadership- mainly stemming from accusations of arbitrariness and rumors of corruption- all are willing to put aside their grievances to support him lest they be forced into the mountains and forced to fight for yet another generation."

 POLITICS_Abu_al-Qasim_al-Khoei_DESC:0 "The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) said: "When a person dies, his deeds are cut off except for three: Continuing charity, knowledge that others benefited from, and a righteous son who supplicates for him." Abu Qasim al-Khoei- scholar, jurist, and a leader of al-Hawza in Najaf- has understood this his entire life.\n\nBorn in Iran as the son of a religious scholar, al-Khoei spent his early life studying the Quran and learning from varied Shi'a leaders. This seminary education allowed him to develop a unique voice among jurists, one often sympathetic to women and non-believers. It also instilled in him a deep sense of obligation to Muslims worldwide. Between clerical duties and his studies into jurisprudence, he became a ceaseless advocate for welfare, supporting charities across Iraq. The scholar became a familiar sight wherever catastrophe appeared, using his administrative skills and religious connections to provide comfort to victims of injustice.\n\nIt was this same sense of obligation that drove al-Khoei to action during the collapse of Qasim's republic. After witnessing the growing tide of violence across Iraq and the rise of despotic, demagogic leaders, al-Khoei declared it the duty of the clergy to stand against corruption and oppression. With the quiet support of the Grand Ayatollah, al-Khoei assembled and appointed a delegation of Shi'a leaders to re-establish order across Najaf. While keeping distance between himself and the rebellion, al-Khoei serves as a powerful symbol for those who hope for a new government guided by democratic, Islamic principles."

 POLITICS_Ahmed_Hassan_al-Bakr_DESC:0 "What was 1958 but an incomplete revolution? True, the Arab people of the Iraq region cast off the most obvious symbols of Western imperialism, but they remained artificially divided from their brethren. They were prisoners in states imposed by foreigners, crushed by economic systems beholden to foreign interests. No longer, says Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. It is time for the Arab people to shatter this legacy of oppression.\n\nBorn in Tikrit while it remained under the yoke of Turkish oppression, al-Bakr's life was defined by struggle. He overcame a hard childhood and spent six years as a primary school teacher before joining the Iraqi Army. When the Golden Square launched its revolution against the British in 1941, al-Bakr, his family, and many of his fellow officers joined it, only to find themselves marginalized in its aftermath. Embittered at having been duped, at having traded British overlords for Italians, al-Bakr found himself drawn toward two camps, the Free Officers Movement- an underground officer group dedicated to overthrowing the monarchy- and a newer faction- the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party.\n\nEven after Qasim became Sole Leader and began his crackdown on the Baath, al-Bakr held firm in his conviction that the party was destined to be the revolutionary vanguards, the vehicle through which imperialism will be defeated. Standing amid the ruins of Qasim's republic, he is determined to use his power as chairman of the party's military bureau to complete 1958's unfinished revolution and see Arab unity finally achieved.\n\nBy any means necessary."
  
 #Ideas
 IRQ_july_14_legacy:0 "Legacy of July 14th"
 IRQ_july_14_legacy_desc:0 "It has been almost 5 years since the 14th July Revolution, and in many ways it remains unfinished. The revolution began as a popular and widespread uprising against Italian Influence, but rapidly devolved into anarchy, a war of all against all. Communists fought Shiites, democrats fought militarists, and everyone fought the Ba'athists. It was only the military coup of general Abd al-Karim Qasim and the forging of his government of national consensus that brought an end to the fighting. Since then, Qasim has been recognized by every party as Iraq's leader, but not a very powerful one. His rule is based on consensus, that the nation's factitious political parties are individually too weak to unite against him, and that the Italians will be forever desperate to support his regime as a bulwark against German-backed Ba'athism."

 IRQ_dawa_ascendant:0 "Dawa Ascendant"
 IRQ_dawa_ascendant_desc:0 "Much of the political scene in Iraq has been constant for decades. A weak puppet government supported by a foreign power. Pan-Arabists, numerous in their support but opposed by all others. Old men doddering about democracy, young men preaching communism. Opportunists and corruption in the army (and everywhere else). However, inspired by Iraq's economic stagnation and the oppression (both real and perceived) of their faith across the Middle East, Iraq's Shiites are flocking in ever greater numbers to join the Islamist Dawa Party, founded to represent them and their greivances. While the party itself is far from united, its star continues to rise even as Iraq's stability remains questionable, and few can doubt it's not a force to be reckoned with."

While politicians of every stripe decry their nation's persistent servility, too many of them benefit too much from Italalian patronage and corruption to do much about it."

Although Iraq's deserts are home to towering oil fields and its cities stuffed with refineries for th eblack gold, its actual production remains under par. What oil is produced is often stolen and sold on the black market, or lost somewhere in Iraq's maze of bureaucracy, cronyism, and pollution. If, against all odds, a barral actually makes it to shipment, the money will mostly go to the Italians who ship it. Should a spare coin or two find its way back into the nation of its inception, then it will quickly go to line the pockets of the political or economic elite rather than into the hands of anyone who actually found the oil, extracted it, or worked to purify it."

This is nothing new, and these feelings have been unleashed before, in the July 14th revolution (which drew its inspiration from the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere). However, the revolution's failure did not defeat Iraqi Pan-Arabism, but instead made it clandestine, efficient, and highly organized through the Ba'ath party. While one might not be able to see the Ba'aths they are there nonetheless. Their posters appear at night despite the government's and garrison's dual efforts to remove them; their slogans are shouted at ever more common protests; and the desert seems to have an inexhaustible supply of these dedicated, angry men, hungry for the power they're sure will inevitably come their way."
