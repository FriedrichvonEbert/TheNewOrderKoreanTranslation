 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_VLADA_ZECEVIC_DESC:0 "Vladimir Zečević, better known as Father Vlada, is a man who has been many things. After joining the clergy, he served as a parish priest in a small town among the hills and woodlands of western Serbia, living a simple and pious life. It was only when the winds of war swept over the Balkans that Zečević left his church and flock to join the Chetnik resistance against the Germans. Despite rapidly rising through the ranks of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, he quickly grew outraged with Mihailović's policy of collaborating with the Nazi invader against Tito's communists, defecting to the partisans with five hundred of his men in 1942.\n\nHis newfound communist loyalty not at odds with his faith, Vlada simply pinned a red star under the cross on his cap, and continued to fight. Despite increasingly desperate odds, the partisans resisted in face of the invaders long after the end of the war, striking at the Nazis and their collaborators before disappearing again into the forests and mountains of the Serbian heartland. And throughout all those years, Vlada was always there, in the midst of the action, inspiring his comrades with his sermons and his deeds.\n\nAs tensions rose between Rome and Germania, the Serbian-Croatian border became heavily militarized on both sides, de facto cutting off Serbia's partisans from Tito's headquarters. Rapidly, ASNOS descended into political squabbling, and soon enough Vlada ended up in command of the armed wing of the liberation movement, as he was largely detached from such political struggles. Now, after so many years, the NOV has decided to launch its final, all out assault - but it is yet to be seen if Serbia will finally be liberated, and if Father Vlada will be allowed to return to his parish for one last time, resuming the simple life of a pious priest he was forced to abandon so long ago."
 
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDAR_RANKOVIC_DESC:0 "Sometimes known by his nom de guerre, Leka, Aleksandar Ranković is the foremost member of the partisan old guard in Serbia, and for many, one of the few remaining symbols of the Yugoslav dream. Born into a poor family in the outskirts of Belgrade, Ranković joined the Serbian workers' movement at the age of 15, soon entering the Serbian Communist Party. A dedicated and indefatigable organizer, Ranković was arrested and imprisoned for six years by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and upon being released immediately resumed his political activity, playing a vital role in the early strengthening of the Party in Serbia.\n\nNot even the war was able to stop him - immediately joining the partisan movement as Serbia was invaded by Germany, he was again arrested in 1941, but this time by the Gestapo. Surviving torture at the hands of the Nazi criminals, he was rescued by a daring partisan raid. In retaliation, Gestapo agents executed his wife and his mother. Ever more determined to fight on, Ranković would later go on to become a major leader in the communist leadership, founding and directing OZNA, the partisans' secret police and intelligence bureau.\n\nIn his role as president of ASNOS, Ranković was entrusted with keeping the flame of Yugoslav communism alive. An entire generation of Serbians grew up barely remembering Tito and his comrades, but Ranković was there to remind them - to remind them that through the people's struggle, a new Yugoslavia would be reborn from its ashes. As the red star has once more risen in the skies of Belgrade, a new light shines in the Balkans - destined to either lead the Serbs to the liberation of all Yugoslav peoples, or to be once more stamped out by the vile servants of fascism."
 
 #POLITICS_BORISAV_JOVIC_DESC:0 "In many ways, the life and rise to power of Borisav Jović is a mystery even to his supporters. Born in a small village in central Serbia to unknown parents, the details of his early life are barely known - however, young Jović studied economics in the University of Belgrade before joining the partisan movement. Distinguishing himself as a silent yet talented and ambitious organizer, Jović quietly and swiftly climbed the ranks of the liberation movement, managing the unofficial contact channels between the Serbian partisans and Italian agents in the Balkans, exchanging intel, and, according to some rumours, obtaining covert support from Rome.\n\nOrganizing the economic structure of ASNOS, Jović had already established a solid network of friends and supporters in the movement when he made his first public power plays. His outspoken Serbian patriotism and criticism of the partisan leadership quickly gained him sympathies among younger partisans, increasingly disaffected with their elders' Titoist and pan-Yugoslav rhetoric. After staying in the sidelines during the uprising that finally liberated Serbia, Jović only needed to give an order - without needing to lift a finger, he had almost the entire leadership of ASNOS arrested by his loyalists.\n\nRallying his supporters under the newly formed Socialist Party of Serbia, Jović won the first elections of free Serbia with barely any competition to oppose his widespread popularity. Using vaguely leftist and heavily nationalistic rhetoric, Jović paints the image of a reborn Serbia, one once again ready to become the lynchpin of the Balkans. While his detractors call him a populist quasi-dictator, his many supporters proudly rally around the red-blue-white flag that now waves free over Serbia - but many wonder if Jović's new Serbia is destined to be truly free."
 
 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KAVAJA_DESC:0 "애국자이자 범죄자, 자유투사이자 도적, 반란군이며 테러리스트. 니콜라 카바야는 세르비아의 모두, 자신의 동맹, 적, 희생자들에게 공포로 그 이름을 널리 떨친 사내입니다. 1932년생의 카바야는 어린 시절 침략해온 나치의 손에 가족이 추방하는 모습을 목격했으며, 부상당한 독일 병사를 우물에 밀어넣으며 처음으로 살인을 저질렀습니다. As he grew up, his hatred for the occupiers grew with him, as did his fierce nationalism - and soon enough, Kavaja gathered around himself a disparate group of Chetnik remnants, disgraced collaborators, and common criminals, founding the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement, or SOPO.\n\nAssassinations, kidnappings, sabotages, hijackings, bank robberies and bombings - with every action, SOPO grew more feared. Modeled after the Black Hand, SOPO compensated its relatively small numbers by mastering the arts of terror and brutality, striking Nazis when and where they least expected it. Even the partisans soon learned to fear Kavaja and his ferociously anti-communist gang - and yet, even when the two groups agreed to a truce before the offensive against the German garrison, nobody could expect what would come next.\n\nAfter quickly and brutally seizing power in Belgrade, Kavaja and SOPO took control of the whole of Serbia, violently crushing any form of resistance. Proclaiming the restoration of the Serbian kingdom, Kavaja and his men are now de facto in control of a new Serbia, their virulently nationalist propaganda being welcomed by the long downtrodden Serbs. And yet, the struggle for Serbian liberation is not yet over - and Kavaja is ready to ensure that no communist nor German invader dares ever again to try and usurp the throne of Nemanja, whatever the costs."

 POLITICS_DIMITRIJE_LJOTIC_DESC:0 "Of all the Serbs, only Dimitrije Ljotić and his clerical-fascist party ZBOR - the Yugoslav National Movement - are trusted enough to run the Serbian puppet régime. This makes sense given that he and his party were the only willing bootlickers of Germany in a country that was awash with anti-German sentiment even before the Second World War and the fall of Yugoslavia to the national socialist empire.\n\nBorn in 1891, he fought in the Serbian army during the First World War; afterwards, he entered politics. In 1931, he was appointed justice minister for all of six months, being forced out after proposing a political system that was too autocratic for even the notoriously authoritarian Alexander I. Afterwards, he founded the pro-German ZBOR only to be met with rejection in 1935 and 1938, forced into a lunatic asylum under not entirely false allegations of 'religious mania', and at last driven into hiding until 1941, when the Axis conquered the Balkans.\n\nWhen the Axis looked for collaborators, only Ljotić met the bill; very few were as enthusiastic, insane or sycophantic enough. A staunch anti-Semite, he proudly advocated the extermination of Jews before even many Nazis did. This combined with his crazed love of Germany, as well as an insane hatred of freemasons, communists, and capitalists, made him the perfect fit for control over the rump portion of Serbia left to native rule... too bad for him, then, that it does not work, and never could have.\n\nThe Serbian regime ruled by ZBOR is universally hated; not even the Church - who liked him for freeing their Patriarch from Dachau - tolerates him anymore. The country is a failed state that makes most basket cases look like Thomas More's Utopia. There is a refugee crisis, caused by Serbs that fled or were expelled by the Ustaše during their rule over Croatia. Various partisan groups - communists and nationalists alike - litter the countryside. Defections occur en masse every day.\n\nYet Ljotić, far from coming up with a solution, keeps ranting on and on just like his German idol. Why self-reflect, after all, when he can just blame the Jews, the liberals, the masons, the communists, and at times even the Pope, the Turks, or the Tsar of Bulgaria for his problems? The only solution to the Ljotić régime is putting it out of its misery. But at this point, it is not a matter of if that will happen but when."
 
 POLITICS_SEPP_JANKO_DESC: "Born in Ernsthausen in 1905, Josef "Sepp" Janko has been in Serbia all his life, and yet he has never lost his connection to his German Fatherland. The son of a Roman Catholic Banat German family, Janko studied law in Graz, and became a dedicated disciple of Pan-German nationalism and racialism. In 1939, he was elected President of the Swabian-German Cultural Association in Yugoslavia, and actively began to promote national socialism within Yugoslavia. When the Wehrmacht crushed Yugoslavia into dust in 1941, he was given command of the Deutsche Volksgruppe in Serbien und Banat, and was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer in Banat simultaneously. Janko set about to complete the Nazification and Germanization in his beloved Banat with a fiery dedication. To his dismay, however, many Danube Swabians in Banat were uninterested in fighting for the pride of Deutschland. In response, Janko, along with Heinrich Himmler himself, conscripted 3,000 Danubian Swabians into the newly-formed 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen.\n\nAfter the war was over in favor of Germany, Janko's fortunes began to wane. He was forced to abandon his SS ties after Himmler went rogue, and despite Janko's services to the Fatherland during the war, his role in the Serbian government was gradually phased out in favor of Serbian collaborators and the Wehrmacht. Janko, while still a major influence in Banat, was left bitter about his lack of direct control of the direction of Serbia. He became even more disheartened when reports of partisans in Serbia past the Danube became ever more common, and was devastated to learn that the entire south had fallen to partisans. When Janko thought it couldn't get worse, his beloved Fatherland collapsed, and the untermenschen of the south revolted against the German order. However, both Germany and the German order in Serbia held strong, and each learned to rebuild themselves quickly.\n\nNow that Germany has recovered, Janko has been chosen to lead the new Reichsprotektorat Prinz-Eugen-Land from his throne in Prinz-Eugen-Stadt. Janko's new task was simple: to cleanse the land of subhuman scum, and make way for permanent German annexation, to make Serbia a shining beacon of German superiority in a region awash with degenerates. It is a task that Janko has been awaiting for a long time, and he could not be prouder to lead the way to German dominance of the Balkans and the expansion of German power. With the forces of the German garrison and the RHSA at his beck and call, Janko stands ready to purify a land long contaminated, and bring about a national socialist rebirth to the rogue Serbian state."

 SRB_German_Controlled_Economy:0 "독일 통제 경제"
 SRB_German_Controlled_Economy_desc:0 "Serbia's economy is entirely build around extracting every single speck of wealth from the nation and exporting it to Germany. The German Garrison maintain complete control over the infrastructure in Serbia, and german firms control all significant mining, industrial and financial enterprises in the nation. This state of affairs has left precious little economic wealth for the Serbs, and Germany seems to be in no hurry to alleviate our burdens."
 SRB_German_Garrison:0 "독일 주군둔"
 SRB_German_Garrison_desc:0 "The Germans maintain an extensive Garrison within Serbia, one that is ready to put us down if we show any signs of defying our germanic overlord. The Garrison forbids us from expanding or properly training our military, to ensure that resisting their might will never be an option. Additionally, we are forced to pay for every single of the Garrisons expenses, as thanks for them "protecting" our borders."
 SRB_Partisan_problem:0 "유격대 문제"
 SRB_Partisan_problem_desc: "There are two large partisan groups within Serbia, and both present a large danger to the government. Firstly there are the Yugoslavian communist partisans which, despite our best efforts,  have continued to resist our rule for decades. Lead by their commander Aleksandar Ranković, hey seem to strike with impunity, attacking our patrols and garrisons, awaiting their next chance for a large scale uprising. If Serbia is ever to be a peaceful nation, theses bandits must be dealt with.\n\nNext, there are The Chetniks, which are a Serbian royalist group that ostensibly aims to topple our government and reinstate the monarchy. In practice, the Chetniks are a disorganized and decentralized group, and large sections of their ranks are content with tacitly cooperating with our government. But they do still present a looming threat, and were they ever to strike they could most likely cause a large amount of damage before being stopped."

 SER_Refugee_Crisis:0 "난민 위기"
 SER_Refugee_Crisis_desc:0 "During World War II, the victorious Axis powers redrew the map of the Balkans, leaving large Serb communities outside of the newly drawn borders of Serbia. Violently persecuted by the genocidal Ustaše or driven out by the Albanization programs in Italian-occupied Kosovo, massive waves of Serbs moved into the country as refugees - often still living in makeshift camps or in impoverished slums, they're a constant drain on our economy, and a source of recruits for partisan armies."
 SER_The_Occupation_Regime:0 "점령정권"
 SER_The_Occupation_Regime_desc:0 "Created by the Nazi occupational authorities in the middle of World War II, the Government of National Salvation or VNS is a mere facade for German control of Serbia. Its ministers appointed by the German military administration, the VNS only has extremely limited powers, and only managed to obtain relatively minor concessions from Germania's watchdogs. Of course, this does very little to give the government legitimacy in the eyes of the Serbian people."
 SER_Widespread_Insurrection:0 "광범위한 반란"
 SER_Widespread_Insurrection_desc:0 "The mountainous and forested Serbian heartland was not an easy place for the German military to keep control of. As the Wehrmacht was forced to concentrate its limited resources in the strategically important Banat and in Belgrade, much of the country's interior, as soon as one steps away from major roads and cities, is controlled by partisans. Recently, anti-German groups have even begun to strike into Belgrade, using terror tactics and sabotages to strike fear into the heart of the Nazi occupiers and their lapdogs."

 SER_National_Liberation_Army:0 "민족해방군"
 SER_National_Liberation_Army_desc:0 "After decades of low level insurgency, the Serbian partisans have seized their chance to deal a final blow to the German invaders who plagued their homeland since World War Two. Organized in the ranks of the National Liberation Army or NOV, the partisans are numerous, well motivated, and an effective guerrilla force, but are sorely lacking in modern equipment and training."
 SER_SOPO_Terrorism:0 "SOPO 테러리즘"
 SER_SOPO_Terrorism_desc:0 "A shadowy terrorist organization, SOPO is made up of hardline Serbian nationalists, monarchists and former Chetniks, united by their hatred of the Nazis. While also opposed to the leftist NOV, SOPO have agreed to a truce with the partisans for the duration of the uprising - their terror tactics have proved very useful against the German troops, but their rising influence and power might prove dangerous down the line."
 SER_Generational_Divide:0 "세대분열"
 SER_Generational_Divide_desc:0 "Under the banners of the NOV, two generations fight together. One is the partisan old guard, loyal to Tito's pan-Yugoslav and communist vision for Serbia - the other is the younger wave of Serb recruits, who grew up during the war and barely remember a unified Yugoslavia. The younger partisans often don't share their elders' commitment to Tito or to Yugoslavia, instead espousing Serbian national sentiment and shunning communist doctrine - as their influence in the movement rapidly rises, it's hard to predict what the future of the partisan movement will be."
 SER_Refugee_Question:0 "난민 문제"
 SER_Refugee_Question_desc:0 "The numerous Serb refugees from neighboring regions in the Balkans are a vital source of manpower for the National Liberation Army - however, many of them wish to return to their homelands, and our country lacks the economic resources to provide adequate housing and jobs for them all. In the future, it will be necessary to either make arrangements for their repatriation, or integrate them into the Serbian economy."

 SER_Reactionary_Remnants:0 "반동 잔존파"
 SER_Reactionary_Remnants_desc:0 "Despite the establishment of our socialist republic, there are a few elements in our country that cling on to reactionary sentiments. These dangerous terrorists must be eradicated for the sake of our socialist Yugoslav fatherland!"
 SER_Yugoslav_Rebirth:0 "유고슬라비아 부활"
 SER_Yugoslav_Rebirth_desc:0 "With our country liberated from the fascist occupier, we are ready to set ourselves on the path of reunification with Croatia and Bosnia, and perhaps even more territories of the former Yugoslavia, to create our new socialist federation. However, the problems posed by the clash between pan-Yugoslav ideals and local identities might prove difficult to solve, especially considering all the ethnic violence that took place in collaborator regimes during and after WWII."

 SER_Resurgent_Nationalism:0 "되살아난 민족주의"
 SER_Resurgent_Nationalism_desc:0 "Our victory against the Germans was won also thanks to the contribution of hardline nationalist groups such as SOPO, their fierce nationalist rhetoric now inflaming crowds across the country. While the nationalists aren't outright opposed to our government, they might prove a source of serious trouble if not dealt with appropriately."
 SER_SPS_Dominance:0 "SPS의 우세"
 SER_SPS_Dominance_desc:0 "The first elections in our young republic have resulted in an overwhelming victory of the Socialist Party of Serbia, most likely because there was basically no serious electoral opposition. As long as we are able to maintain the SPS's dominant status in Serbian politics, things will no doubt go smoothly."

 SER_The_Return_of_the_Kingdom:0 "왕국의 귀환"
 SER_The_Return_of_the_Kingdom_desc:0 "As a result of the SOPO coup in the country, King Peter II, former ruler of Yugoslavia, has been invited back to retake the crown of Serbia. While the royal restoration was symbolically important to the long oppressed nation, the king is still largely powerless, with SOPO de facto having near total control of the state."

 SER_Reichsfestung_Belgrad_desc:0 "Due to its key strategic importance as a stronghold on the river Danube and as a vital railway junction, the city has been since World War II one of the most fortified strongholds of the Wehrmacht. The German quarters of the city especially are a proper fortress, guarded by the best troops of the garrison against both the Slavic rabble that inhabit the suburbs and the partisan bandits in the countryside. The proud Germanic fortress of Belgrade must not and will not fall, whatever the costs!"
 SER_Serbian_Collaborators:0 "세르비아인 협력자들"
 SER_Serbian_Collaborators_desc:0 "As much as any proper German despises working with Slavic untermenschen, it is sadly necessary for us to rely on Serbian collaborators to keep the country under control, as neither the Wehrmacht garrison nor the German population has the sufficient numbers to do the job. Organizations such as the Serbian Volunteer Corps and the 1st Belgrade Special Combat Detachment have proven to be reliable and loyal lapdogs, and what they lack in finesse they make up in brutality and devotion to National Socialist ideals."
