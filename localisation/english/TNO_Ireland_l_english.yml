 POLITICS_Sean_McKeown_desc:0 "Ireland: divided once more. The fault of this national humiliation lies with the incompetent administrations that used the Defense Forces as the repository for the unemployed and gave away its wealth to Germany. A situation this dire called for a man who could stand above politics and save the country from civil war, that man was Seán McKeown.\n\nFor McKeown, the dismal performance of his beloved armed forces in the Northern Campaign proved too much to take. Knowing that the loss of Ulster was bound to push Ireland deeper into the arms of foreign powers, McKeown decided to put a stop to the never-ending subjugation of Eire to foreign powers by launching a coup with the remnants of the IDF. Now that he controls Ireland - or what is left of it - all that McKeown intends to do is restore the professionalism of the armed forces, before he can turn over the country to an elected authority, sometime in the future."
 POLITICS_James_Kelly_desc:0 "Brigadier James Kelly joined the Irish Defense Forces shortly after the end of the Second World War, right as the influence of German military advisors began to take root. Owing to his brilliant performance, he was sent to Germany for further studies, before returning to Ireland and being assigned to Military Intelligence in the tumultuous Northern Counties. The posting put him in close contact with the Fianna Fáil political establishment, and after the German withdrawal a few years later, with Neil Blaney.\n\nWhile the Irish army became increasingly bloated as a consequence of German advisorship, a desire to maintain unemployment low, and the need to keep order in the Northern Counties, Kelly climbed the ranks with record speed. By 1960, he had become deputy chief of staff for Military Intelligence in the Northern Counties. Although initially identified as one of the officers who supported Blaney's use of paramilitary groups under the belief he was acting on the orders of Lemass, he rapidly developed misgivings about the Citizen Guard. At first, he protested against their counterproductive methods, but soon began to suspect that something was off with the organization at large.\n\nWhile Blaney attempted to put a stop to his investigation, Kelly and his connections in the Abwehr uncovered the truth about the Citizen Guard on their own. Released shortly after his arrest when it was revealed that he believed himself to be following orders from the government, he hurried to restore his reputation by presenting a plan to decapitate all terrorist organizations and restore order on behalf of his fellow officers.\n\nNow that his plan has been successful, Kelly can start to deconstruct Blaney's byzantine administration and replace it with something more conducive to stability. That, in any case, is what he told Seán Lemass. For while he would have liked to keep his promises, Lemass's stated intentions to reveal secret documents which could well implicate him in the initial contact between the IRA and Blaney. The undesirable prospect of his military career unfairly ending in disgrace has led to him making arrangements with fellow officers, which could well end badly for Ireland..."
 POLITICS_Sean_Lemass_1_desc:0 "숀 프란시스 레마스가 아일랜드를 사랑한다는 것은 절제된 표현입니다. 1916년 영국에 대항하며 일어난 이래, he has been present ensuring a safe and prosperous future for the country. The ultimate recognition for his services was Éamon de Valera's endorsement for Taoiseach upon his retirement from the post. Thus, Lemass was thrust into the forefront of Irish politics, only to discover the dreadful state of the country.\n\nShortly after taking office, he was faced with economic meltdown, rebellion in the Northern Counties, and the shaky nature of his position. The legacy of his role in convincing de Valera to join the Germans during the attack on Northern Ireland haunts him as he watches Eire become more dependent on Berlin by the day. Every hour he spends as Taoiseach, Lemass grows more convinced he can do little more than slow the impending collapse of his own administration. In spite of this general pessimism Lemass has held on, and has, to his credit, managed to maintain Ireland's territorial integrity secured and its political system unchanged.\n\nUltimately however, Lemass's silent achievements will count for little if he cannot save the country for itself. While the difficulty of this job increases in proportion to the power of the opposition Fine Gael, and to the number of terror attacks in the Northern Counties, it is not an impossible task. If Lemass proves able to carry it out, Lemass will stand on the pantheon of Ireland's founding fathers. Should he fail, he shall be its undertaker."
 POLITICS_Sean_Lemass_2_desc:0 "With his re-election, Seán Lemass has achieved all that he has ever wanted. The Blaney-Haughtey cabal and their allies lay defeated, while in the Northern Counties, there is peace. As the American puppets of Fine Gael languish in eternal opposition, Lemass looks out from his seat of power, and sees only victory.\n\nFor all of this winning, however, Lemass has found no happiness. As his health rapidly declines, Lemass must hurry to find a successor, or else risk his life's work being undone by those unworthy of leading Eire. The hard truth for Seán Lemass is that he cannot live forever, not in physical form, at least. With what little time he has left, the politician must now secure his legacy, so that the myth of Seán Lemass will stand for as long as Ireland exists."
 POLITICS_Charles_Haughey_desc:0 "It has been a long road for Charles Haughey.\n\nIt took him years of painful backbench crawling, of a careful alliance with Neil Blaney, of slowly convincing De Valera that Lemass's incompetence was handing the country over to Fine Gael. In the end, it was worth it.\n\nWhile he must share power with Neil Blaney to avoid repeating the fate of his last two predecessors, his position as Taoiseach is secured. What If it took selling parts of the economy to Josef Abs and his friends? Politics was about compromise, and he has done what was necessary. Ireland's destiny may now be inseparable from that of Germany, that is true, but Haughey believes - nay, knows - that it will serve Eire best.\n\nOf course, there are those who would disagree. Fine Gael, the IRA, the Labour Party. These, however, are no longer a concern. With the passage of the National Stability Bill, Ireland has ceased to be weakened by things such as \"the opposition\". Haughey didn't like that either, but it was also a cost he is willing to pay, in order to ensure that his vision of Ireland in the New Order can be achieved."
 POLITICS_Terence_ONeill_desc:0 "London born Terrence O'Neill, son of Arthur O'Neil, who had the dubious honor of being the first member of parliament to be killed in the First World War, has always been a man advocating peace and cooperation. As a young man he advocated respect towards the local Catholic Irishmen from the government, and later, when Ulster became the Northern Counties, he spoke often and at length of the cruelties that had been inflicted upon the Protestants after the annexation, all while still refusing to condone a violent solution to the special situation. To some he was seen as a 'collaborator' as he worked for years within the Irish political system, but he never compromised on his ethics while he did so.\n\nWith his conciliatory attitude, and credibility among both the Catholics and the Protestants - it seems likely that Terence O'Neill is the perfect man to heal the wounds of the Northern Counties."
 POLITICS_THOMAS_MCKENNA_DESC:0 "§wBorn:§! 1908, in Cork, Republic of Ireland\n\n§wMilitary Career: §!Vice Admiral Thomas McKenna of the Irish Naval Service began his career in the civilian sector, serving on an English owned shipping line. In 1942, McKenna studied at Camp Curragh in Kildare, where he quickly completed competency courses in anti-submarine warfare, land-air warfare, and indoctrination. After, he underwent a formal study of the highest levels of competency for officers of the Irish Defense Forces, the command and staff courses.\n\nCiting the need for homegrown officers, the newly established Naval Service in 1946 recruited McKenna to the Vice Admiralship, an office he has served faithfully. Though Ireland may hold one of the most humble navies in Europe, barely more than a glorified coast guard, some might say, McKenna dispenses his duties with pride, honor, and dignity."
 POLITICS_Seamus_Twomey_IRE_desc:0 "True to himself, Seamus Twomey didn't rush to be named President of the Republic after the revolution, nor Taoiseach, for that matter. No, he is no careerist politician. Nevertheless, Twomey knows he must retain power until, \"all necessary social and economic reform to make Ireland truly free\" have been carried out. Thus, Twomey deemed it necessary to remain in power by being named chief of staff for the Defense Forces, while retaining the same position within the IRA's paramilitary wing. Soon, both shall be one and the same, cleansed of all elements loyal to the Free State and its inherited Britishness. From their symbiosis will return the one institution which throughout the struggle for national freedom remained legitimate: The Irish Republican Army.\n\nWhat is more, with vestiges of the Free State deeply entrenched into the country's institutions, it is clear that transforming a state tainted by the original sin of the Anglo-Irish Treaty is both impossible and undesirable: The civil service, the constitution, the phoney democracy which has made Ireland unfree. All of these must be cast into the ash-heap of history. In their place, a whole new structure must be erected, on which the principles of the Republican Movement reign supreme.\n\nFor all the vagueness of his proclamations, Twomey and his closest advisors know exactly what this new state will look like: A true working democracy, like that under which the IRA's command structure operates. A grassroots democracy. A democracy that can only take the form of the reconstituted Republican Army itself. The new IRA will become not just the Irish armed forces, but Ireland itself.\n\nOnce he has completed the monumental task ahead of him, Twomey intends to retire at the earliest possible opportunity, and return in his words, \"to watching football matches.\" Before he can do this, however, he's bound to face much opposition, likely including that from Ireland's ancestral foe, itself eying developments in the Emerald Isle with increasing concern..."

There is no middle ground on the man in the mohair suit.\n\nDespite his short Dáil tenure, Haughey was selected to become Sean Lemass' Minister of Justice at the record-setting age of 36 (his marriage to Lemass' daughter couldn't have hurt), giving him control over Ireland's internal security forces. Since his appointment, Haughey has used his newfound power to put down protests and IRA campaigns alike. However, Haughey is an ambitious man, and his ambitions do not stop at his current office. One day, he envisions riding his populist oratory to the top of Fianna Fáil, and then the Taoiseach's seat itself.

After his sporting career came to a close, his political career blossomed, and he soon joined the Dáil, rising swiftly to become the youngest Government minister in Irish history at the time, being only 39.\n\nNow in his 40's, Lynch's meteoric rise shows no signs of stopping. His promotion to Minister of Industry and Commerce has given him wide control over the economic direction of Ireland, which he plans to take in a free-trade direction, working well with the left-wing Labour party to achieve his goals. His outspokenness and unusually high activity has earned him a reputation as an honest politician - perhaps the highest honor one can truly hold in such a business - and rumors already swirl of him as a future successor to Lemass.

It would prove to be a fateful choice.\n\nAiken's insistence on Ireland's militarization at the outset of the Second World War left it prepared for when Germany came knocking, and made sweeping into Ulster a breeze when faced against the meager British garrison left behind.

During World War Two, the then Taoiseach accepted a deal with the devil to make his dream come true; should the Republic of Ireland collaborate with the Nazi regime, the Germans would support them in an invasion of Ulster, which was just barely accomplished through the sheer amount of German manpower thrown at the Emerald Isle.\n\nLike all Faustian bargains, however, the price is rarely one worth paying. German megacorporations control vast sectors of the Irish economy, and countless paramilitaries in Ulster threaten total revolt against Dublin. Fianna Fáil only holds on to power only through ruthless political suppression, press censorship, and imprisoning those who speak out too loudly against the regime.\n\nFaced with an increasing lack of confidence in De Valera's ability to govern, and Fianna Fáil's supermajority in the Dáil starting to crumble, Seán Lemass, De Valera's chosen successor, kicked the old man upstairs, to the largely ceremonial Presidency. Lemass has since tried to steer Ireland out of the nightmare that is De Valera's twisted dream. However, should Lemass prove inadequate to the task at hand, those around him can convince De Valera to use the one real power available to his office: The ability to appoint a new Taoiseach."

Lynch has done about as well as could be expected with his proposal, now it's time for the Taoiseach to get to work and push the proposal through the Dáil."

Life goes on, however, and Fianna Fáil continues to govern for the good of the people of Ireland. On the docket now: the issue of pollution. The TDanna, members of the Irish Dáil, have found that the enormous amount of pollution created by the factories of the German megacorporations is a large problem to their constituents. The solution: a bill has been proposed that would impose regulations on these factories, forcing them to at least put a token effort into cleaning up after themselves instead of simply dumping their refuse into our rivers and skies. This will likely annoy the megacorporations, but this is what the people want, and it's high time we remind them that this is Ireland, not the Reich."

Along with the increase in public transportation for children to get to school. While many of us disagree with the issues that the Liberals are fighting for, we cannot risk our coalition. We should send this Welfare Bill through the Parliament to see if we can maintain our coalition, hopefully it will hold."

Our current budget for the year is limited, but we can see if we can stretch it. If it is possible to stretch the budget, we should try as much as possible. The more money we can acquire from projects that aren't needed can be funneled into public works and infrastructure.\n\nThis bill, if passed will give us more funds that we have allocated to our budget. Using this money we can begin to invest wholly into Ireland. We will direct a large chunk of the funds into the railway line that runs across Ireland, making our shipping more efficient. This should, in turn, help our economy. We can also give the leftover funds to investors and entrepreneurs to build Irish businesses."

These laundries have been quite the stain on Ireland as the Archbishop of Dublin attempts to cover it up. We must figure out a way to shut down these establishments and to help these women. If we can do this, this will surely help our cause. Once we do follow through with this, we should see a reduction in the power that McQuaid has over the government. This should usher in new liberals to help us."

If we can rally enough of them, we can begin to take back the Fianna Fáil. However, there is one thing that stands in front of us. The issue of women's rights in Ireland is a subject that is hotly contested. Brendan Corish and his followers have begun to campaign against the Magdalene Laundries that are in Ireland.\n\nThese Asylums had been created to make \"Fallen Woman\" pure again and closer to God. While the idea is seen as a thing of the past, it brings in large amounts of money for the hardliner cause. It is in our best interests that these Laundries stay open for the future. "

After a series of deaths caused by an industrial accident at a factory owned by IG Farben, workers have begun to strike and are demanding safer working conditions.\n\nWe will oblige them.\n\nWe will propose a bill that will impose safety regulations in these factories, mandating break times and regular safety inspections to keep accidents to a minimum.

Instead, the German's nudge our economy and government to shift their way. One of the consequences that have come along with the German's is the megacorporations that have tens of thousands of slaves working in Germany.\n\nNeil Blaney, the boot-licker, has submitted a bill to the Oireachtas. He calls it the \"Irish Economic Cooperation Council\". We need to figure out how we will deal with the bill. If we accept it, it will bring us closer to Germany.

Now, riding on the success of his last bill, Blaney has submitted a new one called the \"State Corporations Bill.\" This bill seems to alleviate some of the issues that we would have with an increased German presence. It calls for the creation of state-owned cartels that will control the energy and shipyards of Ireland to make sure the German's can't get their hands on them.\n\nFrom what we've heard coming out of Germany, it seems that the whole country is in turmoil.

He has become a local celebrity of sorts within Dublin. Many know him as the man who runs the Northern Counties and the man who is attempting to save Ireland from economic doom. While this may not be totally true, let us make him believe that.\n\nBlaney has recently asked for a new shipment of weapons to get delivered to the Northern Counties for the Irish soldiers based there.

In the meanwhile, we will also print more money in an effort to try to fill the hole left by the departure of the German investors.

These corporations are simply too big to fail. We will bail out these large corporations so that they can make it through the crisis without falling completely apart.

Lemass wants us joined at the hip to the Americans, heedless of what the Germans would say. Corish is practically a socialist, with all the political problems implied, and MacEntee wants to all but cut us off from the global markets and re-institute austerity, heedless of the human cost.

Given our relations with the former Commonwealth in general and the English in particular this is asking a lot. But the question is can we trust Germany to act rationally any more?

 IRE_the_first_chapter_desc:0 "The first chapter of MacEntee's plan involves outlining the base, and to set out what reforms and overhauls we need in our economy to enact this plan. In these hard times, great measures must be taken to bring our economy back in the right direction. The strong, hardworking should receive more benefits and rights, as our strong industrial base will be built on their backs. As well, we must take a look at the economic policies still in place from the fifties, and work to weed out policies that would work against our re-imagining of the Irish economy. Loopholes that allowed German corporations to grow so influential that their loss would crash our economy must be closed. If we are to bring the Irish economy into a new age, bring our workers new rights and better benefits, and sever ourselves from the German web, we must succeed in all of these goals."
 IRE_a_strong_and_stable_base_desc:0 "For MacEntee's re-imagining of our economy to succeed, we must bring ourselves out of this economic crisis. To achieve this, we need to create a strong foundation for our economy. We must address the elephants in the room; those large German corporations that have been allowed to dominate our economy for too long. Eire must no longer allow her economy to be at the whim of foreign interests, be they German or American. However, chasing every foreign company out of Ireland isn't what we need either. In fact, we should make Ireland more enticing for foreign corporations to set up headquarters, but we should always remember to put Irish needs first. For now, at least, our efforts should be focused on our recovery, or none of these goals will be achieved."
 IRE_eyes_to_the_future_desc:0 "Though we must learn from our mistakes in the past, we must not dwell too long on our history. Though we enjoyed some prosperity under the Pakt, swapping German masters for Americans in a vain attempt to bring back the fifties will not bring Ireland prosperity. We have to look to the future, where Ireland will be free from foreign economic control, where Ireland is a hub for foreign companies, but only as long as it brings more profit than foreign control. MacEntee's plan brings sets out a new path for Ireland, rather than trying to achieve past glories, we set our eyes on an independent, prosperous Ireland."
 IRE_mergers_takeovers_monopolies_bill_desc:0 "A new bill that will address those German investment companies that remain in Ireland has been introduced by our party into the Dáil, the Mergers, Takeovers, and Monopolies Bill. This bill will finally tackle the issue of the remaining German corporations. If this bill passes, we will spin off the German companies into new, Irish based investment companies. This will allow us to preserve the economic value of these companies, but ensure that this value will go to Ireland instead. This will also open up many new employment opportunities for Irish workers. We expect the remaining German businessmen to firmly oppose this measure, but what can they do but complain to their dying fatherland?"
 IRE_system_of_the_past_desc:0 "In olden days, smaller countries could punch above their weight in the global economic ring through protectionism. Small nations would put their economic interests first, limiting imports and imposing tariffs, and engaging in free trade only if our internal economy could support it. We abandoned this policy with the rise of the Pakt, and we hedged our bets and let German corporations run our economy. We thought this era of prosperity with the German sphere would never end. Never again will Ireland tie her economy to a foreign power, for economic empires rise and fall, but Ireland always survives. Through protectionism, we will always put Ireland first, but make space for foreign investment, if and only if it benefits us more than them."
 IRE_hospitals_federation_amalgamation_bill_desc:0 "The Irish hospital system needs addressing. As it currently stands, the healthcare system consumes a large amount of our budget while not satisfactorily addressing the needs of the Irish people. We have two choices: either we cut our losses and reduce the budget, or try and improve the system at the cost of an increased budget. Reducing the healthcare budget would reintroduce money into our system that we could invest in building our industrial base, but it would greatly anger Labour. Trying to fix the system could lead us to pump more money into something that might not be able to be saved, or it could perhaps bring world-class healthcare to our people."
 IRE_the_irish_hub_desc:0 "Though we wish to make the Irish economy self-sufficient, we can't ignore our special position in the global economy. With the collapse of the Einheitspakt, Ireland can take the position as a neutral, stable haven in Europe. Companies, from American fast food, to Japanese electronics could find Ireland a suitable European hub, free from conflict or international entanglements. Taxes on foreign corporations that want to base themselves in Ireland should be lowered, and our government will begin an international outreach campaign that will paint Ireland as a great place to headquarter any company's European operations. Attracting foreign corporations will bring great amounts of wealth to our economy, bringing money we can invest into strengthening our economic base."
 IRE_protectionism_reborn_desc:0 "Protectionism was once thought to be a dead economic policy; something that would be forgotten as the world became more connected and prosperous. Yet such a world has not come to pass and with the bitter distrust that exists between the nations of this world, there is no better option for Ireland than to shut itself off. We will not need the intrusive intervention to help our economy grow. Ireland will make itself strong."
 IRE_more_rights_for_the_worker_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive worker, and in recent times our labourers have been outright miserable. They have suffered immensely from the exploitation enforced by their employers, whilst the government has done little to help. The confidence of workers will have to be restored so that their morale is raised and their faith in our economy is strengthened.\n\nRights, that were previously withheld, will be introduced so that the people know the government is on their side. We must hope that when the people are satisfied, so is the market."
 IRE_germans_still_rule_desc:0 "Despite the recent turn to protectionism, there is an unsettling reality that will need to be addressed. This reality is the vast German presence that exists in our economy. They control a lot of power over our industry and without them, the economic outlook for our country will be bleak.\n\nRemoving all foreign interference from Ireland will prove much harder than first anticipated, but, given time, we can still hope that there will be a chance for us to pull away from the Pakt."
 IRE_industrial_grants_amendment_bill_desc:0 "After our efforts to limit foreign competition are enforced, we will need to ensure that our industry makes the strongest expansion possible. Funds will therefore need to be provided to our local industries to help them grow and hopefully go on to enrich our people. We will ensure these enterprises are successful, so we can weaken our reliance on foreign imports; so that Ireland can become a truly economically independent nation."
 IRE_tariff_commission_amendment_bill_desc:0 "A new committee is to be introduced in order to oversee the changes to our tariff policy, which the government has deemed necessary. They will introduce a new era of increased trade between the countries of Ireland, Scotland and Wales; binding our economies closer together - as well as distancing us from the German economic hegemon, which has done little short of pillaging our country over the course of our cooperation.\n\nThe Tariff Commission will set our economy free and finally give it a chance to grow the wealth Ireland will need to be strong in the coming years."
 IRE_third_amendment_to_constitution_bill_desc:0 "For the last twenty years, Ireland has been a client state of Germany in all but name. While we were technically an equal partner, de Valera's government signed numerous military treaties and agreements with the Einheitspakt that left us firmly tied to the ship of German policy, even after the last German troops themselves left Ireland. The proposed Irish Independent Partner Bill will cancel all such military agreements and treaties and enshrine Ireland's neutrality on paper. We should bear in mind, however, that even should the bill pass, these bold words will not have as big an impact on our politics as it might seem. Materially, the Germans will retain much influence over us, and we will need to consider further measures."
 IRE_future_of_technology_desc:0 "While the rest of the world surges forward into the future, Ireland remains stuck in the past. Centuries of British rule left us with industrial underdevelopment as the norm, and even since independence our industry and agriculture have lagged behind, lacking the necessary investment to bring them up to modern standards. Other countries are making great strides in computing, robotics, and increased mechanization. If our Republic is to keep pace with her rivals, not only technologically but economically, we need to focus on improving our own capabilities in such matters."
 IRE_made_in_ireland_desc:0 "Our people's confidence in the quality of our products needs a boost, and what better way to do that than to proudly advertise their origins instead of hiding our light under a bushel? Every sticker, label, and packaging of everything that leaves a factory in Ireland will now bear a little marker with a tricolor flag on it: Made In Ireland. Not only will this serve as a guarantor of quality for our own population, who will be happy to realise just how much we produce ourselves, but it will mean that people all over the world will come to associate Ireland with superior goods and bring more export profits our way."
 IRE_emerald_shines_bright_desc:0 "Ireland's vibrant green fields have given it the sobriquet 'Emerald Isle', but for the last twenty years the sparkle on the emerald was dimmer than we'd like. Smeared and dirty under German economic domination, and lacking the reforms necessary to bring transform our economy from pre-mechanization agrarianism to the powerhouse we knew it could be, the poetic name for our nation had never seemed less apt. No more. Our economic reforms are beginning to tell, and the Irish economy is a powerful rising force. The emerald's shimmering brilliance will be known all over the world!"
 IRE_corish_new_republic_desc:0 "Seemingly endless compromise talks and under the table threats to break the coalition if Labour's economic proposals are not entertained have won out. The shaky coalition has agreed to commit to Brendan Corish's 'New Republic' plan for economic regeneration. After all these years of domination by the right, Corish has declared that the seventies will be socialist, and this plan is how Ireland will get there. The Party of Connolly is in the driving seat!"
 IRE_equal_growth_plan_desc:0 "The primary objective of the Equal Growth Plan is to ensure that economic recovery comes to everyone in Ireland, not just the rich and the corporate interests. It is ludicrous to think that a man with wealth is the equal of a man without, and so the wealthy of Ireland will bear the biggest burden in pulling the country out of depression. The rich will help the poor, and all will benefit. Corish is confident that this plan will meet with wide approval; all that is necessary now is to unveil it to the public."
 IRE_bread_and_roses_desc:0 "Social democrats the world over sing out 'Bread and Roses!' as their rallying cry: that the populace deserves to have not only the necessities of life, but also the things that make life worth living. The time has come for our government to make this slogan a reality for our people. We shall ensure peace, stability, and happiness throughout Ireland: yes, it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses too!"
 IRE_state_of_the_worker_desc:0 "No country can thrive in the long term if the working class is not thriving. The workers are the bedrock of the economy and any problems they have will reverberate throughout society as a whole, sending fault lines upwards. We must ensure that our workers are happy and secure, but we cannot do that if we lack a clear understanding of their problems. A commission will be established to assess the condition of the workers of Ireland, and enable us to identify and deal with issues facing them today."
 IRE_wider_middle_class_desc:0 "Social mobility is an important concern for the Republic. Our middle class is small, but economically potent, and we can strengthen the economy of the nation by making sure that this section of society continues to grow. The government shall make it easier for workers to better themselves and their situations by providing help in such areas as home-buying, access to education, and poverty relief initiatives. This will pay huge dividends in taxes and greater economic power in the future."
 IRE_pensions_bill_desc:0 "We will introduce a bill in the Dáil to reform state pensions for our workforce along the lines of social insurance. The state will pay out a pension based on contributions given throughout workers' lives, meaning that the more workers put in, the more they get back in their pensions after retiring. We hope this will encourage people to work more and contribute more to the economy during their careers, while also providing them with a secure standard of living in their old age."
 IRE_trade_union_year_bill_desc:0 "The trade unions up to now have not played the role they should have in Irish society. This is not the fault of the unions; they have struggled to organize due to lack of rights for unions and their members. Corish's proposed Trade Union Bill will enshrine some of these rights, such as collective bargaining without fear of reprisal from employers, and preventing discrimination of any kind against union members."
 IRE_economic_development_bill_desc:0 "Ireland is a chronically under-developed country which has freely allowed its capital to be exported to the biggest money market in the world. This is a policy entirely unfavourable to home industries struggling to establish themselves, and especially difficult to deal with at a local level. The Economic Development Bill will establish temporary planning committees in county council areas, using local expertise and knowledge to direct government investment at grassroots level. The government will invest its capital at home instead of letting it be siphoned off abroad."
 IRE_mother_child_service_bill_desc:0 "To date, Ireland's women and children have suffered under antiquated social sensibilities and a disregard for the special healthcare needs they have. The Mother and Child Service Bill, if it passes, will allow all Irish women and under-16s to receive medical care free at the point of use, subsidised by the government. This will be a huge improvement for the circumstances of some of the most vulnerable in our society!"
 IRE_promises_in_the_dail_desc:0 "To deal with the backlash to the Mother and Child Service Bill, we need to tackle each disgruntled group head-on. The representatives from FG and FF in the Dáil can probably be appeased if we promise to implement some economic reforms along the lines of what they've been clamouring for previously. Their 'principled moral and theological opposition' to birth control will undoubtedly disappear if we dangle a free trade carrot in front of them."
 IRE_dublin_protests_of_year_desc:0 "Conservatism is a huge force in Irish society, and we might have underestimated just how fiercely people believe in keeping things the way they are. The Mother and Child Service Bill has caused uproar after it was understood that free birth control comes under 'healthcare' for the women of our country, and every priest and pub loudmouth in the country has been mouthing off about the immorality of this. Protests have filled the streets of Dublin, led by church groups and TDs from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and are blocking the bridges over the Liffey. We have to find ways to deal with this unrest, or the country could grind to a halt over something as simple as contraceptives!"
 IRE_promises_to_the_church_desc:0 "The Catholic Church is an immensely powerful institution in Ireland, and of all the opponents to the Mother and Child Service Bill they are the fiercest. Every priest rules like an autocrat in his own parish, with the full backing of the bishops and cardinals, and most will not hesitate to interfere in the personal lives of their parishioners. In this context, they see this bill as a direct insult and attack by the government on the legitimacy of their social control. But no matter how we feel about the Church's dominance in Irish society, we cannot afford to upset them too much. We must engage the Church leadership in dialogue and reassure them that we are not enemies, and that Christian principles of charity and care take precedence over their concerns about the bill. If we can get the cardinals and bishops to calm down, the priests and their congregations will follow."
 IRE_tariff_commission_amendment_bill_2_desc:0 "The original Tariff Commission was abolished in 1939, but reinstated after the German victory in the Second World War as part of the requirement for joining the Einheitspakt and restricting trade outside of that bloc. We will introduce a bill that alters the Tariff Commission's responsibilities, allowing trade with Scotland and Wales and slight increases on trade with OFN members. Fianna Fáil's members will greatly appreciate this, as they have been advocating such changes for a while, and this will be an easy way to shore up the government's support while also giving the economy a shot in the arm."
 IRE_fighting_poverty_desc:0 "The best way to get the support of the man in the street is to improve his material conditions. Poverty is still rife in Ireland, as the country struggles with the impact of centuries of deliberate underdevelopment. As a government that has the interests of its people at the forefront of our minds, we will establish anti-poverty measures at the local level to ease the burden on the poorest in our society and make them productive members of the nation and the economy. Subsidised childcare and vaccination initiatives, for example, would have a huge effect on the health and economic wellbeing of our people in a very short time."
 IRE_state_of_education_desc:0 "Irish education is stuck in the past like so many other things in this country. Most schools are controlled by the Catholic Church and comparatively few children go through secondary schooling when compared with other countries. We need to modernize the education system, providing free secondary schooling for all children and ensuring that the curriculum is decided by teachers rather than priests. In particular, we will introduce Economics classes for older children, teaching principles of social democratic economic regulation so that catastrophes like this depression can be avoided in the future."
 IRE_promote_christian_socialism_desc:0 "While orthodox Leninists and Bukharinists might claim that religion is incompatible with socialist principles, Brendan Corish disagrees, and indeed has described the Labour Party as a Christian socialist party. Didn't the Apostles themselves share their property between them and devote their lives to helping the vulnerable? Didn't our Lord? There is nothing to say that Christianity - Catholicism, even - must be the preserve of the conservatives. The scriptures say otherwise, and so does man's conscience! Ireland is a deeply religious country - our best chance to promote socialist values is to make the obvious connection with Christian principles, and promote a Christian Socialism that will advance the cause of Ireland and of Christ."
 IRE_green_lines_in_stocks_desc:0 "At long last, the depression is showing signs of ending. The Dublin Stock Exchange is no longer the gloomy place it has been in recent times, and the traders and businessmen strolling along Dame Street have a spring in their step once again. It would be foolish to count our chickens before they've all hatched, but it seems like our policies have paid off: the economy is in the green again, and Corish's New Republic is being vindicated day by day."
 IRE_farewell_to_depression_desc:0 "The New Republic has proven its worth! Detractors said it was pie-in-the-sky idealism, but Brendan Corish and the Labour Party have shown that it was pragmatism instead, and that economic realism need not be synonymous with callousness and austerity. The worst effects of the depression have disappeared and even the less ruinous effects have been mitigated and effectively combated. A new Ireland is ahead of us, with foundations laid for a strong and prosperous nation following principles of Christian socialism. The seventies will be socialist, just as Corish said!"
 IRE_restoring_public_trust_desc:0 "Thousands are out of work, lining the streets in search of jobs, relief, or even a warm meal. Factories are closed, and stores are shuttered. Everywhere, people wonder if tomorrow they'll get a pink slip, or if their kids will go hungry. How can anyone feel pride in being from Ireland? And how can anyone even think of voting for Fianna Fáil, the ones who messed up in the first place?\n\nRegardless of how much blame is put on us versus outside factors, we have to confront the fact that people do not like us head on. We're the party that saw the people of Ireland through terrible situations like this. We're the party you put your trust in. And we're going to be the ones to fix this.\n\nOur economic relief policies will take care of fiscal matters. Now, it's time for Ireland's mental relief as well."
 IRE_rte_history_broadcasts_desc:0 "The one advantage we have in this fight against the national malaise is that we can get everyone's attention. Sure, we could put up posters or billboards to ignore, or blast slogans from vans for people to not listen to, but we have something better. Because everyone in Ireland has at least a radio, if not a television set. And we have Raidió Teilifís Éireann, our national broadcaster.\n\nSoon, a new programming schedule will be put in place. One which will put an emphasis on historical dramas, documentaries, and programs with more of an emphasis on our triumphs and challenges. Viewers and listeners will tune in, and get the subtle hints about Ireland being a great country, with achievements of every sort. And that idea is going to lift them up from the gutters they find themselves in."
 IRE_ulster_goodwill_tours_desc:0 "Stop thinking about the economy for a second, will you? Have you noticed the progress we have made in Ulster?\n\nWe have finally got the Protestants and Catholics talking. Things are clamped down tight. And we are closer to peace than ever. Just look at all the high-profile visits we can make without us getting ambushed! Peace is closer than ever, so regardless of what you think about the economy, at least the years of violence are finally coming to a close. And isn't that what really matters?"
 IRE_the_presidents_visit_desc:0 "What the people need is something that can take their mind off of this disaster for a moment. Something that can take up time on the news. Something that can bring people out on the streets aside from the offer of soup or unemployment subsidies. And something truly momentous in the history of our young nation.\n\nWe will send a notice to Washington. Their President is humbly invited to visit Ireland for a historic tour of the nation, with visits to many points of interest. Some aid from America will also be requested. And at the end will be a hint that this might be good for improving his prospects amongst the sizable Irish diaspora in the United States. And if he accepts, we can have a week of grand occasions and celebrations that will make us more patriotic."
 IRE_late_late_show_appearances_desc:0 "Of course, just broadcasting dramas set in the 1800's isn't going to get the people listening to our message. They want to stay informed, to know the people making the decisions. And we cannot just ignore that and rely on subtle and inferred messaging to get our point across. So why not take a direct approach?\n\nPoliticians will be encouraged to go on these new talk shows and even have televised debates. We will take our case directly to the people, and defend our policies on their merits. Mass media is here, and it won't be leaving anytime soon. Now, we will use it for our full advantage."
 IRE_celtic_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Irish, the Bretons, the Welsh, and the Scottish. All nations descended from that legendary group of tribes so long ago. All nations that have recently been granted their liberty. And all nations left adrift by the recent turmoil on the continent. What if we started working together to plot our future course?\n\nOf course, any grand Celtic alliance would be impossible at this point, given our unique governments, leanings, and domestic politics. But that doesn't mean we can't get a few diplomats from these countries in a room in Dublin and have them talk to each other in general terms. We don't have to come up with any firm commitments or specific plans for the future. The mere idea of a coordinated Celtic future will make the people of these nations happy for this event."
 IRE_meet_with_the_jews_desc:0 "With all this talk of sectarian fighting and violence between the faiths, it's easy to see Ireland as a case of Catholics against Protestants. But that isn't the case, and Ireland isn't so religiously binary as one may expect. We have a sizable Jewish community that has been mostly ignored and forgotten these past few years. And we should begin to remedy that.\n\nWe will start with a series of high-profile visits to Jewish synagogues and community centers. By highlighting them, we can begin to court their support. And if we show Ireland is home to faiths that can coexist with the rest, we may be able to begin an interfaith dialogue, and encourage some form of ecumenism in Ireland."
 IRE_look_to_the_past_desc:0 "And we have one great and grand opportunity to accomplish all of our aims at once. To remind people of our history. To capture their attention away from the economic crash. And to bring a grand, unifying event to remind everyone of our shared Irish heritage. And events like these may truly be once in a lifetime.\n\nThe 50-year anniversary of the Easter Rising is coming up. The week that the armed insurrection against the British colonizers began, leading to our eventual independence and liberation. We must assemble a committee to begin planning for it. This will be the biggest event of the year, and we want to do it right."

While even the Bulgarian monarch - his only independent counterpart at Einheitspakt meetings - could boast of a palace, he was stuck in his Dublin apartment.\n\nThere was at least one advantage to the housing situation: his son Noel. The poor bugger actually lived in the building, and carried out much the same tasks as Tsar Boris's servants. Whenever Lemass came home, he could find his dinner served and plates clean. Today, the meal wouldn't be just for him, but for Charles Haughey, too.\n\nWhile Lemass hoped that the night's discussion would not stray far away from Noel's soup, he had defeated his own expectations by veering into the Northern Counties situation while explaining the differences between stews in both parts of the country.\n\n\"Blaneyyy...\" Lemass's English had acquired a brewery accent. \"If not for him and his... uh, what do you call them, Blaneyboys, yes.\" Another sip of beer graced the Taoiseach's throat. \"Everything would have been fine after 61, but he had to insist on that fucking cabinet post. The liberals, too, you know, they helped ruin everything as well.\" Lemass's accusatory finger pointed vaguely in the direction of his son. \"Noel, don't ever forget, giving into your enemies is a mistake. I allowed those pain-in-the-ass cosmopolites - Lynch and Corish - to cook up a deal with the Liberals, and look where it's got me! Now I have to bend over backwards every time I want to pass a goddamn bill.\"\n\nHaughey was in the process of interjecting with a deprecatory remark about the state of Fine Gael, but he didn't get far before Lemass started up again. \"You know Charles, you are like a son to me. Apart from this boy here, you... you are the only man I can trust! I rely on you to save this party, no, this country!\" While his thirty four year old son made a muttered protest against his description as a \"boy,\" Charles Haughey quietly cringed.

As she put it down on table, Aiken's eyes widened with indignation.\n\n\"What the fuck is this? The young woman jumped back as Aiken examined the food. \"Roggenbrot? What does this mean? Look at this crap, I could hit you over the head with this, it's like a goddamn brick!\" He turned towards the woman, \"Lady, can you bring us some decent bread.\" As the former cabinet minister screamed at her, the waitress tried to explain to him that there was no other type available, until Lynch intervened to calm Aiken down. While the girl managed to get away, Aiken didn't stop. \"Those jerries, they are everywhere Jack. Even in food, why can't they leave us alone?\"\n\n\"Because Lemass won't stand up to them, and anyone who does ends up in a jail cell. You'd think that after how many votes the liberals and us got in the last election, he'd lay it off a bit, but since last year he's jailed 800 more. For fuck's sake, this man will drive Fianna Fáil to ruin.\"\n\n\"Him and his buddy-in-need.\" Frank's euphemism for Neil Blaney got a hearty laugh out of Lynch. \"I mean, it's incredible Jack! Lemass puts the trade unionists in prison and damn-near sieg heils whenever Hitler dumps all of this crap into our economy, but those stupid bastards at the Labour Party keep propping up the government. We can't get rid of him either, not when the liberals keep saying they'll only support the coalition if he's still there.\"\n\n\"The world is a mess... and we need to do something about it, Frank.\" Lynch sighed, if someone was going to lead liberalism back to the forefront, it was him, Frank was too old.

James packed up his things into his briefcase before shutting off the lights and making his way to the main lobby.\n\nTo his surprise, Liam Cosgrave and John Costello had pulled some chairs out and had been in the middle of a conversation before they saw James and waved him over. The men had been discussing mostly personal things, such as their families. The point of the Fianna Fáil had come up. Mostly the current issue with \"liberals\" as Liam and Costello talked, James listened. Once the two men had finished, James spoke.\n\n\"Well to be fair, I agree with both of you. Our time is coming. However, this is not the time to discuss this. Anyways, do you lot want to go to the pub?\" asked James. The two men nodded and they walked out of the headquarters.

Blaney's extra-official meetings with other members of the cabinet, far away from the Lemassite halls of power in Dublin, were a secret to no one.\n\nCharles Haughey, for his part, rather hoped their regular encounters would be more secret. Why exactly Lemass kept trusting him as he did when it was so well known he'd go up to the NCSZ every weekend was a mystery to him, and one that unsettled him more every day.\n\nAs soon as he got off his ministerial car, Haughey was quick to spot the grey-clad figure storming out the building, \"Lieutenant Colonel Kelly, good afternoon.\" The IDF man opposite to him gave back a courteous remark, but ultimately continued on his way, Haughey knew it couldn't be good. He proceeded up the stairs of the Georgian construction, until he got to Blaney's office.\n\nThe Donegal TD, working at his desk, looked the same as always, albeit his hair seemed to have receded a bit more than Haughey remembered.

Provided, you uh got those signed defense ministry orders, don't you?\" Haughey nodded. \"By the way Charles, I am doing more than fine, as are the counties.\" He let out a burst of laughter. \"Now, what's our boss in Dublin up to, Charly?\""

The pain of a friend turning on him with the whole Fianna Fáil following. Their bastardly coalition with Labour, it all was going to ruin Ireland.\n\nDe Valera then decided to call Seán MacEntee to meet him in the office. While MacEntee's official abilities had been to serve the Taoiseach, he didn't interact that much with Lemass. So he was a perfect candidate for de Valera to talk to.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense Seán, how Lemass would just turn his back to me and take the whole party with it. I've become a ghost in politics, nothing more than a figurehead for the government. All of the power of the Taoiseach gone like that.\" Seán nodded along. \"I sold the country to the Germans, thinking they would respect our boundaries. Instead, we got forced to be policed by them and forced into the so-called 'Einheitspakt'. Unity my arse.\" MacEntee tried to comfort de Valera after hearing him rant.\n\n\"I don't think Ireland would forget you Éamon, your contributions to Ireland are eternal.\" Before Seán could continue, he checked the time and had to leave to meet Lemass.

 IRE_intro.6.desc:0 "It had been a quiet night at O'Flaherty's Pub. Sales were low, as always, and there were very few new faces. Adam O'Flaherty, the owner, made enough to get by, but it was a struggle day in and day out. The church bells of Dublin tolled out the time: midnight. \"Time to close up, Tom,\" Adam told the one remaining patron still seated at the bar, \"go home to your lovely wife and kids, I'm sure they miss you with all the time you spend here.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'll get out of your hair,\" Tom chuckled. \"I'll tell Sarah you said hi, see you tomorrow.\"\n\nAdam shepherded Tom out into the cool night air. Tom was a decent fellow, all told. Kind hearted, hard working, went to church on Sundays. Not too well off, Adam supposed, but that was a lot of Ireland these days.\n\nThings weren't supposed to have been like this. His pa had fought in the war against the English when Adam was just a boy, and would always tell stories of how great Ireland would be when she reunited with her brothers in the north. That's all the televisions seemed to talk about: how great having the isle back together was for everybody, even if the Protestants in the north hadn't seemed to get the memo.\n\nLocking up for the night, Adam caught sight of a VW car puttering down the otherwise quiet street. Now if that wasn't a metaphor for Ireland's ills, Adam thought to himself. The damn Germans had swept into Ireland with their fancy promises and offers of assistance, but everybody but the damned Taoiseach knew that they were sucking the lifeblood out of the Irish people. Half the businesses in Dublin seemed to be German run these days, and people had even had the gall to ask if he stocked any of the piss the Germans had the audacity to call beer at his pub.\n\nAdam sighed as he walked down the street towards his home. He'd always loved his home, as any true Irishman would, but though he would never admit it, it grew harder and harder everyday to feel proud to call himself an Irishman."

Ireland was finally starting to get back on her feet it seemed, and the people were feeling the benefits. More and more people could afford to eat out or get a drink, and Adam himself was even able to afford to hire a proper cook so he could focus on the bar.\n\nTom and a few of his buddies were sitting at one end of the bar, chatting loudly among themselves. Tom was now considered a bit of a local hero after he organized a strike outside of one of those factories owned by that German bastard Josef Abs, and managed to get the whole damn country talking about worker safety. \"How's about another round, Tom?\" Adam shouted over the din. Tom raised his mug in acknowledgement, setting off a round of cheers among his fellows, all clamoring to pick up his tab. He hadn't paid for a beer in weeks.\n\nYes, Adam thought, things really were starting to look up for Ireland. Even the paramilitaries in the north had quieted down some after their terrorist attack, though Adam knew better than to think that was anything more than the calm before the storm. Really, the only problem Ireland was left facing was the damn Germans.\n\nAdam frowned. Sure, the Taoiseach liked to talk about how the Irish were independent from the Reich, and had even introduced some legislation to back Irish businesses over German ones, but the big corporations in Germania still had their slimy tentacles all over Ireland. Factories owned by giant German companies still dotted the landscape, and Germany was the primary importer of Irish made goods. Too much of Ireland's economy was tied up in German hands, Adam reckoned.\n\nAdam was drawn from his reverie by a call for another round of drinks. Worrying about the Germans could come later; perhaps for now, they could enjoy a bit of peace and prosperity."

You could have chosen to stay in Dublin, have an easy career... but you weren't interested. You are here to fight the good fight - solve cases, right wrongs - very well then, but Ulster isn't pretty. There's no sitting on a fence. You have to choose sides. Take a brown paper envelope to look over all of the corrupt filth that goes on in Blaney's backyard, or look behind your back every five minutes in fear of a prot or a provo trying to murder you.\"\n\nInspector Eamon Doherty pondered on the words which the Chief Superintendent of the Garda's Northern Counties department had left him with two months earlier. Truth be told, he'd transferred to Belfast for the pay raise: His daughter was getting married soon, and paying for weddings wasn't cheap. Perhaps, he thought, there was an element of careerism to it as well: Yes, success in cases here would make him friends back in Dublin, there was nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhatever his motivations, Doherty had come to the conclusion they weren't worth it. The counties which Doherty once helped unify as a volunteer during the war were a mess. The North Irish Constabulatory, themselves supposedly part of the Garda, were unreliable as all hell and each day came with a new terrorist attack from some deranged faction or the other. Today was no exception, either. Dawn had barely broken when his presence was requested by radio: Another car bombing.\n\nParking his German-made patrol car alongside the much older models of the North Irish Constabulatory, Doherty got out of the Daimler, and headed to see the crisp remains of a Morris Oxford, cordoned off by a dozen policemen. \"Who was it?\" The inspector glanced at the NIC patrolman closest to the vehicle.\n\n\"Ruairi O Bradaigh, an IRA bigshot.\" By the scorn in his voice, Doherty could tell the man was a protestant. \"Where do you want to start? There's a few witnesses to talk to, but you could also take a look at the car registration first, or try searching for something meaningful in the rubble.\""

He tried to find anything that would tell him why it was done. However all he saw were destroyed seats and a steering wheel stuck in a tree. 	It was the work of terrorists, he could tell as the bottom of the car had been blown up. Across the road, a few officers had been in the process of trying to clean off and decipher the license plate.\n\n\"Car bomb\" he muttered to himself as he walked around. Something kept nagging him in the back of his head. He knew that the IRA was basically gone, and the Ulsterite groups weren't that bold to bomb a car in broad daylight. However it if it was Ulsterites it made sense. They didn't even know who the poor sap was. Didn't matter now anyway, they had a job to do. He knew it was going to be hard to find something with evidence. So far they had found a half shoe, with the other half being destroyed. As Eamon did another lap around the car, something caught his eye. On the ground, reflecting off the sun was a pair of glasses. Eamon stopped in his tracks and put on gloves, picking up the glasses and putting them in a small bag. As he walked back to his car, he noticed witnesses being asked questions by police officers. They had been assembled a little way down the road.\n\nAs he got into his car, he gave himself a dilemma. He could either phone the station to try and find a connection to the car using the license plate. It was an older model but should still check out. Eamon could also help with the interrogation, however, he could be seen as unwanted due to his presence. Either way, he was going to find out why the bombing occurred. "

A product of the past he thought to himself. He waited for a few moments to be connected. Luckily for him, he had enough change that was given to him from the station to keep the line alive for the next half hour.\n\n\"Eamon? Aren't you in the middle of an investigation?\" asked the officer on the line.\n\n\"I am, Luke. However, I found some evidence that could possibly solve this bombing faster. A pair of glasses and the license plate number. It had been blown half down the street, but it was thankfully in one piece. I want to see if you can find the car in the national registry. The number is I5I-KY-1568,\" Eamon requested. The line was silent for about 10 minutes, he heard papers flip periodically before Luke responded.\n\n\"I got the name of the bloke, an older car it seems. Belonged to a dead member of the IRA, it says he died two years ago. Seemed to be quite the leader. We definitely have information here at headquarters on him if you wanna drop by,\" said Luke, trying to be helpful.\n\n\"If I think of it I will. Thanks.\" Said Eamon as he hung up.

Next thing I knew, a car had gone up in flames, and poor Bradigah was dead,\" said McCarran, sounding nervous as sweat dripped down his face.\n\n\"Do you know who this plate belongs to?\" Eamon placed the plate from the car onto the table. Immediately McCarran began to look around. Before looking at the plate and shugging, saying he's never seen the car before. Eamon thought in his head, time to play the mean cop.\n\n\"You sure about that? I assume you know what happens if we find out that you had lied to an officer?\" said Eamon, trying to intimidate McCarran who looked around one more time before leaning in close.\n\n\"Please, look behind you. I'm being forced to do this, I beg you,\" McCarran said this as his eyes darted around the street. Eamon turned and immediately saw figures watching them, as soon as he met his eyes with the one in the front, they broke off and got into a car.\n\n\"Bastards!\" Yelled Eamon as he barked orders at another officer to continue the questioning as he raced to his car and radioed into headquarters.

He was forced to duck a couple times when one of the escaping suspects fired a pistol at his car, but their aim thankfully proved to be piss-poor.\n\nThe chase ended suddenly when the front of the fleeing car wrapped itself around a light pole. Both escapees staggered out of the wrecked automobile, one bleeding heavily from a cut on the head, and found shelter in the back room of a bookstore. As for Eamon, he knew that it would be suicide to go in there alone, so he waited outside the alley with his service pistol drawn and called for reinforcements.\n\nIn a matter of minutes, half a dozen Garda officers arrived, cordoning off the area and pointing weapons at the door. The shooters were silent to demands shouted by the Garda over the megaphone, and they made no demands of their own. Just while the officers considered sending someone in, the door flew open and out barreled one of the shooters, armed and bellowing wildly. He managed to hit one officer in the arm before being felled by the hail of bullets. As for the other, it appeared he bled out from his injuries.\n\nTwo days later, a file appeared on Eamon's desk: the autopsies of the two dead shooters. They had no IDs on them, but prison dental records proved illuminating: both men were Catholic and had ties to the Irish Republican Army, not the UDF."

Kelly seemed to notice them and walked over.\n\n\"Is that Neil Blaney over there?\" asked Flanagan.\n\nDoherty examined the group again. It was hard to make out much of the group, as they were quite a distance away, but it certainly did look like the head of the Hardliners in Dublin was hanging around shady alleyways at the Belfast docks. Kelly snapped into a sharp salute that Blaney somewhat lazily returned. One of the men in the group that Doherty couldn't quite make out jerked his head in the direction of one of the warehouses, which the group went into.\n\n\"What do we do now inspector? Do we go in after them?\" Flanagan asked.\n\nDoherty thought for a moment. Something was wrong with the attack. Parliament was bombed in broad daylight and no one was able to report an attacker. In addition, there was gunfire from an unknown assailant that had not reported until he personally found out. Soldiers or Garda that may have been tasked with defending the building were seemingly absent during the attack, as none had been seriously injured or reported anything out of place.

Another note is the shrapnel found at the scene. We believe that it's the same type of bomb that was responsible for the death of Ruairí Ó Bradaigh; it's likely the two attacks were linked. We can also safely assume that it was not the IRA; they've been active in the countryside and don't have the resources necessary to commit to such a large attack in Belfast.\"\n\nDoherty thought for a moment.

In the driveway of their Belfast home, they open the doors to their new Rover, and get in. Like many times before, they get inside, with Reginald in the driver's seat, and Faye riding in the shotgun position. Reginald fumbles with his keys for a bit, before finding the correct one and inserting it into the ignition, turning it to ignite the engine.\n\nUnbeknownst to either Faye or Reginald, it also ignites a block of plastic explosive hidden in the engine compartment.\n\nThe deaths of the Protestant couple on Emerald Street would ordinarily be a week-long story. But now, it hardly leads the day's news. Every day, more and more attacks on Protestants happen. Every day, the IRA grows more powerful, and more active. Every day brings retaliatory acts on Catholics as well. And every day, the government seems impotent in this rising tide of violence.\n\nIt's clear the government is losing control of the situation. And this is not a temporary wave in violence. Something is going on behind the scenes here. A reason why the government is ineffective. A reason why the IRA is more active. And a reason that people like the Moss family are being killed off in droves."

Lemass was at the opposite end of the table. Haughey, the head of the Garda, Inspector Doherty, and various other government officials lined the sides. And all paid close attention to his words.\n\n\"I'm not going to mince words, gentlemen,\" he continued. \"Over the past few months, the ICG has experienced a dramatic upswing in its power and size. And we have seen the results. A massive increase in violence in Northern Ireland that has been uncontrollable. Massive numbers of people joining the organization. And the ICG now stands roughly parallel to the Irish government, in terms of arms and power.\"\n\n\"There's more. Our intelligence indicates a large number of officials in the government are openly friendly with the ICG, and sympathize with their aims. These people are pro-German, and rabid right-wing ultranationalists. Through them, the ICG might have avoided our efforts to detect and arrest them. And through them, they intend to launch a coup against this government.\"\n\n\"The darkest moment in our Republic's history has come. What we do now will determine if we remain a free republic or be taken over by the extremists. So, gentlemen, what's our next step? How are we going to solve this?\""

Hefferton asked \"what?\"\n\n\"You know, the ICG warehouse down at the docks? The one with all the firearms? All the decommissioned British weapons? The old IDF guns? The rocket launcher, remember? The car that attacked my house? We found a bunch of plans for the ICG to seize Dublin in there.

It would have made the top of any newspaper if it got publicly released. And it must have been at the top of the briefing sheet for the Irish government. So how could it be that nobody had heard of this?\n\nNo, this wasn't a mistake. He had the paperwork and evidence to prove it back at his office. He knew what he saw, and had the officers to prove it. This couldn't be an accident, and there had to be an explanation for why nobody here had heard of it.\n\nAnd it only took a moment for him to realize the prime suspect."

He struggled, but it was hard to fight against a man holding down each of his limbs. As he looked around to see what was going on, he noticed a group of uniformed Garda officers marching into his house, and two plainclothes inspectors flashing their badges at him. One of them seemed incredibly familiar.\n\n\"You're under arrest, James Kelly,\" said Inspector Doherty. \"You are being booked on charges of treason, terrorism, conspiracy to defraud the government, and conduct unbecoming of an officer. Legally, I have to say that anything you say will be used against you, though you've done enough already.\"\n\n\"What the fuck is this, inspector?\" he asked. \"I was under strict orders from the Ministry of Defense at all times-\"\n\n\"Save your breath,\" said Brigadier Heferson. \"You have been pinpointed talking to Blaney at the docks.

Go through my house, you'll get the evidence. The Defence Ministry told me to do all those things.

 IRE_investigations.43.desc:0 "Something about the four officers murdered by the IRA hadn't sat right with Doherty. The case by itself was open and shut, with eyewitness testimony firmly placing blame on the organization. Nothing about it was irregular or unusual, except for their tasks and the reason they were recalled to Dublin. Ordinarily, he would shrug it off as just unrelated military business that he had no right to know. Doherty had been in the army, he knew that they only told anyone as much as they thought you needed. But now, it seemed suspicious. . .\n\nAt first, the barrier of classification had been so high he couldn't get over it, but now with a coup imminent and the full force of the Garda behind him, it was much less so. They simply marched in and took the records related to the officers with them. Everything was there, classified or not, and Doherty dove into them, looking to find the hidden key to this case.\n\nAs expected, most of the documents were bunk. Things that the police already knew, or were not relevant to the case. Their most recent posting, however, was. They were tasked with guarding the warehouse where the ICG weapons were meant to be stored. And that suddenly made all the pieces fall into place for Doherty.\n\nThe officers were guarding the warehouse with the firearms. As part of an army plot, they were letting the ICG come in and take what they needed. However, the government had gotten suspicious over the irregularities that inevitably developed, and they were recalled to Dublin. But they never made it. Thus, the weapons cache, and the plot, had been kept secret until Doherty had stumbled onto it.\n\nBut the attackers were IRA, not ICG. What was their part in this? Why did their name pop up in this unrelated investigation?"

Alright, but you come to me and say you know who did it.\"\n\n\"The army thinks they know who did it,\" said Doherty. \"They have several members of the IRA picked out, and have tracked them down to a safehouse in Limerick. So we could go in there and take them into custody. It will be a quick operation.\"\n\n\"But the problem is that we lack the evidence to go after them, correct?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it was already determined that we lack the evidence to arrest the people in the case. But this was before it took on outsized importance. So I'm asking for special permission to detain them without charge in order to investigate the attack.\"\n\nLemass sat back in his chair. \"Inspector,\" he said, \"you know the ability to deprive Irish citizens of their freedom is something that isn't exercised regularly. It's done in the most exceptional of cases.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, nothing about this is ordinary. That's why I came to you. This case could be the key to unraveling the whole ICG conspiracy against the government. If we get these guys, we can find out just what IRA's role in this is, and break into the ICG's organization.\"\n\nLemass thought it over. \"Brigadier Heferson, your thoughts?\"\n\n\"I trust Doherty,\" said Heferson. \"He's a good inspector, and he hasn't made a mistake so far on this. If he says this is necessary, it probably is.\"\n\nThat was all Lemass needed."

 IRE_investigations.45.t:0 "The Bash"
 IRE_investigations.45.desc:0 "Raids on terrorists weren't the usual task of the Garda, but Doherty had been with enough to understand they were treated with a bit more care than the average no-knock raid on a narcotics dealer. Heavy weapons were the norm, and the discovery of the warehouse full of ex-military weapons had given them more cause to take extra precautions. But it all came down to the actual raid on the safehouse, which began as a Garda officer broke the lock with a blast from a shotgun.\n\nThe door flew open, and the rest of the officers began storming inside the building. Two suspects on the bottom floor were taken into custody without incident. On the top of the stairs, however, one saw the police breaking in and began running. A blast from a shotgun loaded with riot rounds did nothing to stop him. As the police stormed onto the second floor, an IRA member popped out into the hallway brandishing a pistol. He was hit square in the chest with a rubber bullet, knocking him to the floor as the bullet went up into the ceiling. Before he could get up, the pistol was kicked out of his hand and he was handcuffed.\n\nA few moments later, Doherty got the all clear from the inside and he was allowed to enter. The first signs showed extreme promise. Several weapons were recovered, and Doherty knew at an instant the guns were unusual. Lee-Enfield rifles manufactured in the UK in 1942. Pistols using .38 S&W. Obviously the IRA had gotten their hands on some British war surplus of their own.\n\nBut that didn't shock Doherty so much as the suspect the police hauled down the stairs. The commotion and shouting between the Garda and their detainee caught the inspector's attention. And what he saw made Doherty's normally stone face fall open agape.\n\nIt was Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, alive and well."

 IRE_investigations.46.desc:0 "Doherty still pieced together in his mind how Ó Brádaigh could have done it. Certainly, he had the car blown up anyway, with a few pieces of personal belongings inside to make it look like he was taken out in the blast. Then, he had that witness set up to tell him the UVF did it. That much was certain, and as long as he lay low, the Garda would have never suspected him of being alive. But that didn't explain what his game was.\n\nThe inspector still found it hard to concentrate, but he tried to go on with searching the house anyway, opening cabinets and drawers to find something of interest. Then, a soldier who had been searching upstairs shoved a book into his hands, with a remark that he would find it interesting. Doherty started looking, and he found that assessment to be accurate.\n\nA record of finances for the IRA. Payments, bank account transfers, all was in here. Doherty stopped what he was doing and sat down at the kitchen table to read deeply. This was the key to the entire operation that Ó Brádaigh was doing. Soon, he took out his pocket notebook and started noting items of interest.\n\nThere was one item he found very interesting. The IRA, like any decent criminal organization, had taken pains to prevent their finances from being uncovered. Thus, they relied on a complex series of fund transfers between bank accounts to disguise payments and income. Like for instance, this payment would be routed through several accounts, and then made out to. . .\"Pol ICG.\" And this similar payment would go out to. . .\"Pol ICG.\"\n\nWait, why was Ó Brádaigh funding the ICG's political wing?"

And a bunch of them keep going into the same accounts. Those accounts, combined with the records at the safehouse, have been identified as belonging to the IRA. So this man was repeatedly sending. . .\"\n\n\"What the inspector is saying is there is no 'Citizen Guard,'\" Jefferson interrupted. \"Ó Brádaigh's been intentionally funding a front this entire time, and it's no stretch to think the IRA was behind the whole scheme.\"\n\nIt took a moment for Flanagan to understand what he had just heard. Upon realization, he immediately turned back to Ó Brádaigh and asked \"what the hell?\"\n\nÓ Brádaigh gave off a slow chuckle. \"I have to be honest, it took you a lot longer to figure the scheme out than I thought it would,\" he said. \"I never thought it would be this successful, though I suppose the Garda is a bit smarter than the army. Willful ignorance I suppose. Blaney so badly wanted an unofficial organization who could fight the Protestants.\"\n\n\"That was his plan all along,\" Doherty said. \"Trick Blaney into providing you guns, organize a coup, then turn on his unwitting accomplices. And it's lucky we figured out what he was up to before he could pull it off.\"\n\n\"You're wrong about one part, inspector,\" said Ó Brádaigh, \"we never intended to march on Dublin at all.\""

Doherty sighed, and finally drew out a small flask from his coat pocket, pouring a more than generous splash into his sixth cup of coffee.\n\n\"I doubt any of you have forgotten that the Brigadier described an ICG coup in a certain way,\" Doherty said. \"What was the word you used, Brigadier?\"\n\n\"Imminent, inspector.

At least for now."
 IRE_FT_or_not_desc:0 "The Ulster Volunteer Force have completely denied our request for them to come to the table, it turns out Paisley is not a man who can be negotiated with.

We hope that these bombs will sufficiently disorganize and demoralize the troops of the Ulster Volunteer Force, thus paving the way for us to recapture what is rightfully ours."
 IRE_FT_blockade_ulster_desc:0 "We hold very few advantages over our enemy to the north. The sheer extent of the size, armanaments and fanaticism of their force makes them an incredibly dangerous foe. However, there is one trick that we have that no amount of soldiers and weapons can counter; that edge comes in the form of our navy. More specifically, its ability to cut off access into Ulster's main ports.\n\nThe future repercussions of such a maneuver remain unknown, but we are certain that, nevertheless, the time is now right to deploy the navy."
 IRE_FT_operation_casemate_desc:0 "All the preparations have been made, the stage is now set.

The plan takes notes from the tactics and plans of German tactics that will certainly repress this rebellion. "
 IRE_FT_new_emergency_desc:0 "The first part of the General Staff plan is to announce a new Emergency from our government detailing our actions and upcoming motives in the Ulster Crisis. We plan to release this memo as soon as possible to alert the IDF and agents we have ingrained inside the many paramilitary groups that inhabit Ulster.\n\nOnce we announce this, we should begin to move the IDF soldiers that had been ordered to garrison the border to move into Ulster and begin to enforce martial law against the county. While we shall certainly catch fire from some of our more liberal members in the Oireachtas and Army due to personal liberty infringements, we must ignore them and continue. "
 IRE_FT_dismantle_the_nic_desc:0 "The North Irish Constabulatory has long stood as the government-mandated police force for Ulster and the surrounding county. While they have served well, it has become apparent of late that they are not trustworthy. Rumors have been flying out of the N.I.C. reportedly saying that protestant sympathizers have been working from within to bring down the Constabulary and bring down Ulster with it.\n\nAlong with this, we have seen a rise in communist sympathies in these ranks, with members proudly supporting communist regimes. It has become time to officially dismantle the gentle hand of the N.I.C. and replace it with the much more well-meaning hand of the IDF. "
 IRE_FT_purge_the_infiltrators_desc:0 "We have begun to receive more tips that there are even more fifth-columnists that have infiltrated the army. We have begun to systematically eradicate this disease that has infiltrated the army.

However, the vetting process has revealed time and time again that many of them are attempting to strike us down from the inside. "
 IRE_FT_german_methods_desc:0 "As we now have control over Ulster and the zone, we can begin to use our own police force that we have in Ireland. Around forty-seven percent of the officers who signed onto the plan and the mission to bring peace to Ulster had been trained in Germany by Wehrmacht and Ordnungspolizei instructors as apart of a Einheitspakt exercise. After they had come back, the methods they had learned had made the Garda quite the force to be reckoned with. However, it was not adopted by the whole Garda. Now that we are in control, we can begin to train the other fifty-three percent who didn't receive training to be trained. If these methods work as well as they did in Germany then we will be all set. "
 IRE_FT_irish_gestapo_desc:0 "We have begun to receive reports from the Garda units who have been operating within Ulster. For the most part, the Garda's methods have worked quite well. Crime has dropped quite a bit, the margin being certainly larger than it was when the N.I.C. had been the police force for Ulster.\n\nNow that we have seen the true results of these methods, we can begin to take some of the more veteran officers and bring them to military intelligence to train them. It will certainly take some time to train our agents, but the results will certainly be worth it in the end. "
 IRE_FT_armageddon_desc:0 "In the new testament, the day of Armageddon is a war of biblical proportions. It can also refer to the \"end times\".\n\nWhile we may not be starting another World War or the end of days, this will be the culmination of all of our plans coming to fruition. Codenamed Exercise Armageddon, this is one of our largest operations. So far the Garda has done great work in Ulster, with their new training methods and interrogation techniques. Since we have implemented the new tactics, terror attacks have dropped massively. Now that we have prepared enough, we can give Colonel James Kelly full control of the NCSZ. "
 IRE_FT_put_blaney_on_trial_desc:0 "Exercise Armageddon worked like a charm, the zone seems to be fully pacified, especially after the Arms Crisis. However, there are still many loose ends. Many of them all coming back to one man, the whole ringleader of this utter disaster. Neil Blaney. Over the past months, we had been preparing to fully remove him from power. A few weeks ago we finally completed this, by arresting him on charges of treason. As we dragged him out of the building, James Kelly arrived to fill the void. This move has certainly angered brass within the IDF, but they need to remember something.\n\nThis is still a democracy..."
 IRE_FT_regime_of_the_brigadiers_desc:0 "Now that we have exercised control of Ulster and given Blaney more power, we can use him as our puppet. In the past our government was a bureaucratic mess that had caused more issues than it had solved due to a piss poor leader in Seán Lemass. Kelly has begun to take more power away from the government and directing it towards us. Now that we can exert our control by using McKeown, we can begin to run the country our way. One that is much more continental, one that is much more willing to work with the wider Einheitspakt.\n\nThe people of Ireland may worry, that the end of days is coming and that the Germans are invading. However, they will not fear what comes next if they follow our orders..."
 IRE_FT_puppetmaster_desc:0 "The madman has actually done it! Twomey and IRA militants have seized control of the northern zone. We've lost contact with the North Irish Constabulary, and going by their last reports they won't be in any shape to resist the IRA. Additionally, Seamus Twomey has made a bold declaration across Irish airwaves from the captured Stormont, declaring the final return of Irish rule to the north, and the end of protestant terror in Ulster. He also proclaimed this was the first step in the end of German domination in Ireland.\n\nThis crisis has paralyzed our government; many TDs call for an immediate mobilization of the military to put down these radicals. Several other TDs, however, believe Seamus Twomey can be negotiated with, and we should hear his demands. Whatever course we decide, we have to choose quickly as the situation seems to be rapidly spiraling out of control..."
 IRE_FT_revolution_desc:0 "While all eyes are on Ulster and the IRA uprising, we can't afford to overlook the rest of Ireland. There are rumours of Twomey's men causing agitation across the nation, being the cause of riots and mass demonstrations that have broken out in Dublin and many other cities in support of the IRA's takeover of Ulster.\n\nAnd still, Twomey defiantly broadcasts from Stormont, and now he's turned his attention against the government itself. He demands our government acquiesce to his demands, or the IRA will \"turn the righteous fury of the Irish towards those who stand in their way\". The situation is dire, and we have no good options. Suppressing the revolt by force would certainly embolden the IRA, and could even lead to civil war. Negotiation would make us look weak and force us to submit to some unagreeable demands, but might be the only peaceful resolution to this conflict."
 IRE_FT_negotiations_desc:0 "After much deliberation in the government, we have chosen to agree to negotiations with Twomey and the IRA. This was the only real choice, after all. If we put down Twomey and IRA, they would become martyrs for their cause, and many would take arms to avenge him. Additionally, many in the military sympathise with the IRA already, and at best they would refuse to carry out our orders, and at worst, would join Twomey.\n\nUnfortunately, negotiation is our only option. Preparations are already being made for negotiations between our government and the IRA. We'll hear out their demands, unreasonable or not, and work towards an outcome that doesn't bring us civil war."
 IRE_FT_expel_german_advisors_desc:0 "One of Twomey's hard demands is that we immediately sever ties with the Einheitspakt. While some TDs and advisors are saying this demand is unreasonable, and Ireland would suffer some economic fallout from this move, if we don't give in to Twomey, he'll walk out and the IRA will revolt across Ireland.\n\nThe first step in severing ties will be expelling all German economic and military advisors. Polite letters will be sent to German officers embedded in our military, thanking them for their help, but insisting their service is no longer needed. German business advisors will receive the same treatment. Though Twomey's fiery rhetoric demands the Germans be sent packing with their tails behind their legs, there's no need to be rude about it."
 IRE_FT_withdraw_from_the_pakt_desc:0 "It's finally time to pull the plug. Withdrawing from the Pakt has been a long time coming, but we hoped it'd be on our own terms, not forced by terrorist threats. Many Pakt officials are going to have a very unpleasant morning.

Our military will move in to reoccupy territories and disarm the IRA militants, hopefully without too much conflict.

We prioritized a massive army over one we could actually outfit, and this is the problem. Hell, our only plan for anything was just to hold on and have the Heer take care of it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Lemass said. \"Admiral McKenna,\" he asked, \"could you be able to provide the army with support?\"\n\nAdmiral Thomas McKenna shook his head. \"The whole fleet's in need of repair,\" he said. \"We put off maintenance of our vessels for too long, and the only ship we can really put out to sea right now is a cruiser from World War Two. Our destroyers are breaking down, and I have to think twice before sending out our faulty submarines. We can block things from getting into Belfast, but not much else if we don't call the Kriegsmarine.\"\n\nNow that was giving Lemass something to worry about. \"But surely the Air Force can help? It's in a better position, correct?\"\n\n\"In my understanding, yes\" said General Pat Quinlan. \"The aircraft are far more modern from what I've seen, and they are maintained well enough to be effective. But, no fuel, so we can't rely on them to replace the Luftwaffe.\"\n\nLemass felt a lump in his throat. There were no two ways about it.

The Taoiseach, in all of his wisdom, had decided to show off his shiny new recruits in a grand parade through the streets of Dublin, all dressed up to the nines. The newly minted Sergeant assumed it was an attempt to show Ireland that things were all under control, though he had to wonder if the Taoiseach was simply trying to convince himself.\n\nIt seemed as if the whole of the city had turned out for the event. Civilians were crammed on either side of the street, shouting uproariously and waving the green, white, and orange of the tricolor. The air had an almost imploring tone, almost begging the procession to bring the world back to some kind of normal.\n\nWalsh tried not to fidget with the unfamiliar weight of the rifle held in his arms; he knew how to shoot, every Garda did, but he was more comfortable with a pistol than an assault rifle. The Taoiseach may have looked at the Garda and seen disciplined men ready to be molded into soldiers, but Walsh had not joined the Garda to go off to war. No, he had joined out of a love for his country and a desire to help people, though in a roundabout way, he mused, that was still what he was doing. He knew that what they were doing was going to help Ireland in the long run; like pulling out a rotten tooth, it would be painful but necessary to restore the nation's health.\n\nThe band ahead of the procession began to strike up a song as they crossed the bridge over the river Liffey, the tune sounding melancholy to the Sergeant's ears."

If Ulster is not pacified by then, the government will lose at the polls.\"\n\n[GER.GetLeader] was clearly troubled by this, as this was essentially a warning.

The hatch open, and out in single file came the passengers; German soldiers, in single file, carrying their bags of equipment.\n\nMore planes came from the Reich. One after the other, they landed, unloaded their passengers or cargo, and then left. Many were in Luftwaffe markings, but several flew under Lufthansa banners. Some opened at the front of the aircraft, some at the back. They carried men, weapons, vehicles, tanks, everything a Panzer group would need for fighting. No sooner after the men had landed, they were placed onto busses and trucks to be taken to a place nearer to the front. The equipment and weaponry stayed a bit longer, to be organized and loaded onto recently arrived Unimog trucks.\n\nThis was Germany's response to Ireland's crisis. An entire Panzer brigade, flown straight from the continent to the island. For the first time since Crete, an entire German force would be delivered and supplied via air.

It was the newly-minted Taoiseach Neil Blaney, flanked by McKeown and Kelly, announcing a new state of emergency."

No, the faces he saw now were those of yes men and sycophants, put in place by that fool Lemass to bring a swift and decisive end to the northern conflict. Yes, Operation Armageddon had been a massive success, just not in the way that the old Taoiseach had thought. The partisans had been crushed, the north secured, Blaney had been maneuvered into power, and now he could begin his ultimate goal: greater cooperation with the Reich.\n\n\"Teachtaí Dála of the Republic of Ireland,\" he began, addressing the chamber, \"I stand before you today triumphant.

And think of what happened when the Germans left! Ireland fell; Lemass brought us down. Now, I plan to bring us up, and back onto the world stage, to make Ireland once again the envy of the world!

Sheer, unadulterated chaos. Garda barracks bombed in Cork, city hall besieged by armed mob, the IRA taking credit for both. Up in Derry, IRA again, Anglican churches burnt and looted, at least two priests and five policemen killed. In Dublin, local ICG chapters formed a brief alliance with ILA cells and fought sporadic gun battles with IRA; largely contained by police, but ongoing. In Limerick, the ILA even launched a counter-coup after IRA men seized city hall and shot the mayor, proclaiming a \"Limerick Soviet\" and calling for similar movement across the country.\n\nLemass felt sick to his stomach. How could such violence and terror be happening right now in his homeland? Did nobody remember the dark days of 1921? But with a sigh, he steeled himself and picked up the telephone.

Reciting a clearly memorized speech, he began: \"On behalf of all free people of Ireland, I hereby request that the state take these two actions to defend the safety and sovereignty of the nation:\n\nFirst, that the state immediately and irrevocably sever any and all treaties and agreements with the German Reich and its puppets, for their attempts to economically and militarily subjugate our people.\n\nSecond, that all the men and women who continue to nobly fight and die for our noble cause do not see any criminal charges over the events of the previous days, for they did so in the name of Irish liberty.\n\nThese are the demands on the behalf of the people. If the state demonstrates its trust in the people by keeping with these demands in their entirety, then those fighting for our people's freedom will gladly step down.\"\n\nLemass felt conflicting emotions over Twomey's demands.

Such was life in Stormont.\n\nAbsences notwithstanding, the speech had to go on.

It is folly to think that over eight hundred years of history can be forgotten with the stroke of a pen, or to think that history can be forgotten at all.

And I believe it is the only way to bring about change on this island so that anyone, northern or southern, Catholic or Protestant, nationalist or unionist, can hope to accomplish anything.\"\n\nHe continued to talk at length, expounding on the virtues of cooperation and finding common ground, before ending with a quote from the Bible: \"He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\"\n\nThe speech was met with muted applause from most of the MPs and disdainful silence from the remainder.

Chaos had gripped the towns and cities of Ulster following the revelation; leaders of the Irish garrison had been arrested and the rank and file of the garrison itself had been purged for fears of collusion. The chaos had culminated in mass defection of the N.I.C. to the UVF, and they had brought with them crucial information: the locations of several of the IRA's weapons caches. In one fell swoop, all of Paisley's enemies had been brought low, and his allies were stronger than ever before.\n\nNever would there be a better time to strike.\n\nSounds of automatic gunfire filled the streets of Belfast as Paisley and his soldiers marched towards the garrison's headquarters.

Countless industries and factories across the nation had been ravaged and destroyed during the conflict, and indeed, fully intact buildings were becoming a rare sight in certain neighborhoods. No one was safe in their neutrality, for even after military action had been taken, the streets were awash with violent clashes between paramilitary forces that hardly seemed to mind when civilians were caught in the crossfire. Ireland was a land of instability, and perhaps that would fade in time, but these weeks would forever be remembered as the darkest days the nation had ever before faced.\n\n\"Ireland is united once more,\" Lemass sighed, knowing full well that the result was little more than a consolation prize after what had been paid to achieve it.\n\nNot one member of parliament seemed relieved, not even his partymen in the Fianna Fáil."

De Valera took the podium after all was said and done to pave the way forward.\n\n\"After a great deal of discussion in preparation for today, I'm proud, despite the solemn occasion, to announce that the honourable Charles Haughey will be taking the reigns of acting Taoiseach until an election can be called.\"\n\nLemass sighed and reluctantly clapped with the rest of Fianna Fáil. If they had chosen Haughey then it meant a considerable change in Ireland's course from Lemass' administration. There would be no more struggle for neutrality. Haughey had been insisting for years that Ireland would need German support to survive in this polarized world, and Lemass' evident failure to even handle domestic matters without foreign support had clearly swayed the parliament to Haughey's cause. Lemass expected closer ties to the Reich to come alongside crackdowns on Fianna Fáil's opposition in the coming days."

There was no more monarch, no more grand empire, just a small, troubled nation, trying to find its identity after decades of oppression. In that respect, he chuckled, he supposed that he could sympathise with Mr. Paisley. No, what he was afraid of was that Belfast's ideas of what England should be would differ greatly from London's. The Ulsterites had risen once in a difference of opinion, who was to say that they wouldn't do so again?\n\nAnd yet, he mused, there was always an \"and yet.\" There were always reasons to accept the offer lingering in the back corners of his mind, tempting him with their whispers of prestige and grandeur. Reintegration of the territory would do wonders for the popularity of the SLP, especially his faction in it. They'd be able to secure an even greater majority in the next election. And didn't the Ulsterites deserve their self-determination? If reunification with the commonwealth was what they truly desired, then who was he to stand in their way?\n\nIt was a conundrum that the Prime Minister had been grappling with for hours now.

The rest of Dublin was burning, and all the information he could get was from news reports on the radio. At the corner of the room, Éamon de Valera paced back and forth, muttering under his breath: The protestations of an old man who was watching a disaster of unmitigated proportions, and couldn't do anything about it.\n\nThe military, far away from the city, would be too late to do anything, even if it wasn't infiltrated by the IRA, just like every other organization in the country. \"Do you plan to flee, like the others?\" The ailing voice of President de Valera stung him sharply, the rest of the government had gone missing, but he wouldn't.\n\n\"No.\" He looked back at his political mentor with sadness. Then he got up, and fetched a bottle of cognac from his office's refrigerator, and poured it into a couple of glasses. For the next hour, the two men drank, laughed and cried, reminiscing over old times, about 1916, 1922, 1943... times when things looked better. With a tear running down his cheek, he embraced de Valera. \"I... I'm sorry for all of this, when you left the office I didn't mean to undermine yo...\"\n\nDe Valera looked back at him. \"You did what was best for the country, and that is what history will judge you by. As for any damage you caused to me in the process... its all forgotten now.\" With all the past put away, the two old friends readied themselves for the end. The rebels would hang them upside down like in Russia, and they knew it. Outside, the sound of a truck carrying militants was becoming louder and louder, until it was parked right outside. No shootout ensued, but the sounds of boots making their way up the stairs was unmistakable. Within a minute, they had made their way into the room.

Both he and Cathal Goulding were standing atop the seats of a repurposed Garda Kübelwagen, its bonnet painted over with the Irish tricolor, and waving at the crowds of cheering supporters who had made the Revolution possible. While he privately scoffed at the sight of some lampposts and buildings which flew red flags alongside the tricolor, he had gotten used to tolerating such imagery after twenty years of keeping up the charade to keep the fragile IRA together.\n\nGoulding, on the other hand, was fawning at all the communistic paraphernalia that polluted the streets of Ireland's capital. Admittedly, Twomey thought, the communists were a brave bunch, they had resisted the Germans from the very start, without their help, the revolution would have been impossible. And then, Goulding himself, unmistakably a good man, no doubt about that: He believed in national sovereignty, in Ireland, and for that he would be remembered fondly.\n\nA sudden thud broke through the cheerful atmosphere. The unmistakable sound of a bullet sent the crowd - already jittery from the previous month's upheaval - scattering. Twomey himself jolted: Being so close to gunfire was never easy, even when one expected it. Worse yet, the sniper's bullet had spilled President Goulding's brains all over the Kübelwagen. Combined with the driver's rapid evasive maneuvers, the new Taoiseach had trouble avoiding vomiting.\n\nNo doubt, the death of Goulding at the hands of a German infiltrator in the IDF was a national tragedy, one he was lucky to survive at all. To add insult to injury, the Garda would certainly prove unable to find the specific culprit. Alas, the whole affair might necessitate a purge of both institutions."

After the war, Ireland has been deemed subject to TWEA, as it remained a staunch ally of Nazi Germany. Today, however, after high level negotiations, Ireland has agreed to a mutual thaw of relations with the United States of America, and as such, will not be pursuant to the TWEA.\"\n\nThis was real news, more than some briefing on foreign aid. Cameras flashed as the spokesperson continued \"the Secretary of State and the State Department have concluded that Ireland is no longer a threat to the interests of America or her allies, and the strict sanctions against it are not necessary. Ireland has actively engaged with the United States, and thus the reason for sanctions is no longer applicable. Rather, from this point forward, the United States will allow more favorable deals with Ireland as a condition for further alignment with American interests.\"\n\nThe briefing caught the interest of many think tanks and policymakers, but was not noticed by many outside of Washington or Wall Street. In Ireland, however, the briefing was put on television at the top of the hour as a special report. Many in Dublin were happy, and many bottles of champagne were uncorked that night.

 IRE_recovery.2.desc:0 "To the north of Cork, cars start pulling into the lot early in the morning, with men and women getting out and filing into a massive structure at the end of the parking space. More workers join them, from the busses that arrive outside at the new transit stop. Trucks come in through the entrance as well, but go around to the back of the building and reverse so their rears are facing the loading bays. And a freight train comes alongside the structure to drop off a load of boxcars to be filled. Many vehicles and people enter this structure, and above them is the same name: Magnavox.\n\nMagnavox is a strange name to the local inhabitants, and the origins are even more unusual for Ireland. Nobody expected an American electronics manufacturer to set up shop here, not since the war. But the recent thaw has changed that. And when the excavation for the factory began, people could scarcely believe what was happening. Even when the structure began to rise, people still didn't believe that the Americans were really going to invest in the country.\n\nMagnavox simply decided to move to Ireland for the most basic of reasons. Magnavox had strong sales of televisions in Europe for years, driven by a strong market in Wales and Scotland. With Ireland opened up to American trade, they felt they could muscle in on what had previously been the exclusive ground of Siemens and offer the people there a choice as well. A European factory in Ireland could save on shipping costs and take advantage of lower labor costs. And anything not sold on the Emerald Isle could be shipped easily to other European markets.\n\nSo, Magnavox was happy with their investment. The engineers, assembly workers, electricians, janators, secretaries, and the transport companies of Cork are happy to collect a paycheck in these trying times. The families of those who work at the factory are happy for the security the factory provides. And many people around the island are happy to own an Irish-manufactured television as good as one shipped from the States."

However, there has been substantial political opposition to this, especially among the increasingly popular Fine Gael opposition party. The German Civil War has accelerated this, with German investment drying up, and a massive economic crash resulting. With its primary benefactor gone, it seems Taoiseach Seán Lemass, the Irish PM, has seen the folly of total reliance on the Reich and is looking for economical opportunities outside the Pakt.\n\nAs such, Lemass has been making maneuvers to pursue a more neutral foreign and economic policy, one which relies more on trade with the United States and other nations in the OFN as well as with Germany. He has removed restrictions on American goods from being imported into the nation and has asked that we remove restrictions on trade with Ireland and allow American companies and individuals to invest in his nation. Also, he has made overtures to us talking about a potential split from the Pakt in the future.\n\nWe shouldn't keep our hopes up, though. The nation still has many ties with Germany, and the possibility of them joining the OFN is still small and remote. However, we scarcely get the opportunity to make money while influencing a nation on the peripheries of the Pakt. I have recommended, along with the State Department, the removal of some of the more burdensome restrictions toward investment in Ireland. Many corporations in the US are already making plans to move into the nation, so I suggest we move quickly to get our foot in the door.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew McCloskey\n\nUnited States Ambassador to Ireland"

However, according to a new report by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the tourism industry in particular has seen a massive boost in income, and is now performing better than before the Recession. Experts all point to a singular reason: visitors from North America.\n\nWith the loosening of restrictions on trade and commerce with the Organization of Free Nations, many people are taking the opportunity to visit Ireland. According to the report, bookings on Aer Lingus from the United States to Ireland have more than quadrupled, and the airline has expanded the number of flights from America to accommodate. Hotels have seen a massive increase in stays, with boosts in popularity around the winter holidays and St. Patrick's Day.\n\n\"By 1970, current trends show that Ireland's hospitality sector will double in size,\" said Elena MacGeraghty, a spokeswoman from the Department's Tourism section. \"The trend will be driven almost entirely by visitors from the United States and Canada, while tourists from Germany or other nations will remain at the same level or decrease. We find visitors of Irish heritage are the biggest market for this sector, and not only do they visit more than other tourists, they stay longer, travel more, and spend more money.\"\n\nSpeaking on Trinity College's Campus, tourist Harry Stenbeck from Fort Wayne, Indiana, agreed with that assessment. \"This trip was a gift for my wife, who's from a heavily Irish-Catholic background,\" he said. \"And practically everyone else on my tour is from the States as well, with a lot of O'Sheas and MacCarthys.

A narrator tells the viewer the land of Ireland is an extremely beautiful and wondrous place. But then he rhetorically asks about the people who live there.\n\nThe show goes back in time, where a young cartoon Saint Patrick is snatched away by a group of swarthy pirates, who take him to Ireland. There, as a shepherd, he and his lamb are constantly threatened by evil snakes until he is saved by a local girl. She teaches him the Song of the Magic Isle, which is the show's main musical number. With her help, Patrick escapes the island, and then later returns and chases the snakes into the sea. This is followed by segments focusing on medieval monks writing illuminated manuscripts and a short humorous segment on Irish folk music, provided by Irish-American folk group The Clancy Brothers.\n\nNow, the program switches back to present day live action, as the animated 1800s Dublin fades into the modern, real city. The next segment takes the viewer to the factories of Ireland, as the narrator tells us that Ireland is no longer the agrarian landscape it was in the past. The last few minutes are focused on the various research activities going on in many fields in Ireland's colleges and institutes. Then, we get more shots of the landscape as a chorus sings the Song of the Magic Isle to close the program.\n\nSo concludes Disney's new mixed media short \"The Isle of Magic.\" The private screening for the higher ups in Ireland is warmly received, with a standing ovation.

Now,\" he said, pounding his fist on the podium, \"It is time for Ireland to take back what is hers!

He cupped his hands to his face in an attempt to warm them up with his breath, while it worked for a few moments, the sensation faded away quickly. He came upon the shed and he unlocked the door before entering. Once he was inside, he grabbed the nearest bag of feed and began to walk back. He could feel his back beginning to ache, fifteen years of working on a farm doesn't do the greatest wonders at times. He finally came to the corral with the animals in it. Unlike most farms in Ireland, this one had mostly pigs instead of sheep. He cut open the bag with a knife and dumped the feed into a trough. Suddenly, three little piglets came out of the sheltered part and came to the trough. Michael smiled and walked away.\n\nHe walked down to his truck, already there was his business partner Louis. Louis handed him a clipboard with a hastily written report of the products that had been loaded onto the truck. Louis had been up since the early hours of the morning loading up the truck for transit across the North Sea and the English Channel into the heart of Europe. Sometimes it would sting to see the truck leave the farm, no longer helping Ireland, but the war machine of Europe. Michael would feel this sometimes, but usually, the feeling was alleviated when he was given a nice stack of pounds."

He took his bar exam in the waning days of peace in Europe, and felt like yesterday that he was sitting in his flat preparing for it. All of that effort, all for a few years of stability. Alan had made a name for himself after taking the exam by taking a class that nearly half of the other members of the law practice he joined avoided. It was a case regarding the influence of German companies inside England and the greater British Isles. By a stroke of luck, British Intelligence had uncovered an effort by the companies to undermine Britain. Luckily, evidence had been submitted in time to help Alan win his case. By doing this, he had become some sort of local hero to the many small businesses of South England. And for a few years, he was at peace. Then, the war had broken out and Alan was drafted. He served in the desperate Battle for England, not before sending his wife and two children into Scotland with a group of soldiers defecting to Scotland, promising he would join them. However, this didn't come. The Scottish border had become locked down as they declared independence. Alan found a way off England, on a fishing boat to Ireland. When he landed he was penniless and at the bottom of society, a far cry from the life he had.\n\nHe soon snapped out of it after he realized that he had been mixing paint for nearly ten minutes, he added the finishing touches to the fence and smiled.

In this instance, he is in the press office. However, despite his job and diplomatic protection, many can guess this man's position is simply a cover for more secretive work as a member of America's Central Intelligence Agency. These suspicions are known to the Irish government, and the Abwehr, but because this man is good at his job he is able to still do it unhindered. Though his job is less the secretive assassinations and infiltrations that have caught the fancy of the population. He instead places a small envelope underneath the table, taping it to the underside. After finishing his meal and paying the check, he leaves, without anything unusual being detected.\n\nFor an hour, nothing unusual happens. Until another customer in a suit arrives and sits down at the table. He reaches down without looking, and picks the small envelope up, placing it into their pocket. This person is the recipient of the message. They are not American, nor a CIA employee, but as Irish as the rest of the customers and staff of this establishment. This envelope contains a reward for the services they have done for the CIA, and a request for more.\n\nWhat is in the envelope? Money? A plane ticket? Or some information extremely pertinent to the person? No one knows. And they could just as easily be eager to supplement their income, as they could be motivated by a hatred for the Pakt or a desire to bring their family to the prosperous new world. And these reasons make Ireland the backdoor of the Pakt for the CIA.\n\nEverything that the Irish know about gets out eventually.

Small, but liveable thought Ted. As he was in his bedroom, he opened his closet, and pulled out a wooden crate that was buried in the back behind hanging pants and jackets. Inside was a typewriter and letters, all with the same address, Sixteenth Garden Lane, Dublin. The location of German Intelligence in Ireland. No-one questioned it, it served as the regional headquarters of one of those mega-corporations.\n\nTed began to type away, as a part of his day job as a civil servant serving the Garda and the government as a whole. Due to this, he had all the access in the world to all of the papers and reports that would go into the archives. Anything that would go into the archives, or to the government itself would need to pass through Ted first. Who would suspect him anyways? He was nothing more than a paperpusher trying to climb his way in the cutthroat world of politics. It was the perfect crime.\n\nHis job was easy, writing reports to the Germans detailing the efforts of the Garda on American agents. So far, it had been extremely underwhelming. Again and again the Garda had been duped by the much better trained and supplied CIA. Each week he would write a more damning report to the Germans. Not like he would care, he was getting paid.

Indeed, it was an empty and lifeless place to be left in.\n\nDanny thought that, in some weird way, he was no different to each of these abandoned buildings. He too had been ditched by everyone around him the moment the realisation of economic chaos had set in. Though those who had already left had gone on to a far better place, at least that is what he imagined. Nevertheless, they had gone and he was left behind to rot.\n\nOne of the only comforts Danny could find in the midst of it all was the assurance that it could not possibly get any worse. The sheer amount of discontent and devastation would have to get the attention of those in power. Surely they would realise the need for change, they could not go on allowing him, and the rest of Ireland, to be beaten like this. A better country would surely form from all the insanity and confusion.\n\nYet that promise was not as comforting as he had first thought.\n\nThose who had allowed the collapse to happen appeared to be in charge of the recovery.

 IRE_eco_collapse.12.desc:0 "Seán Lemass' headache was growing. What had been a dull throb as he drove into the Dáil today had become a splitting migraine as his skull attempted to declare independence from the rest of his head. The bickering of his partymen was the clear cause of the affliction, though at this point he could hardly hear their quarrel about economic policy over the pulsing agony of his head. Finally, after two MP's shot to their feet in anger with one another, knocking their chairs out from behind them, did Lemass finally feel infuriated enough to step in.\n\n\"Does anyone remember what the word 'coalition' means?\" he said, his reddened eyes glaring across the hall at his party members. \"It means that, while we do not agree on everything - we cooperate and compromise. I have a preferred policy, MacEntee has a preferred policy, Corish has a preferred policy, and every man in here has an opinion on which bloody plan we should follow, and we all despise what the others have proposed!\"\n\nLemass paused as every member of his party stared at him in confusion, most assuming he was about to make a play to have his own economic proposal come out ahead. He shook his head at the notion. He wanted to get his own way, just as the others did, but this wasn't the time to be a partisan within his own party.\n\n\"There is such a thing as a good plan done poorly. If we step forward with a plan that you agree with - it can still be ruined by the rest of the party sabotaging it in anger that their own plan wasn't chosen instead. Likewise, there is such a thing as a bad plan done well - perhaps the plan we choose won't be the one that pleases you personally, but Ireland will be better off if we work together to see the best version of that policy implemented. Whatever is chosen, we in the Fianna Fáil-LP coalition MUST stand by it and rally around it - whether we personally agree with the policy or not.\""

That it was a big decision he would have to make, and he wanted to explore all the options. However, he now found the decision was extremely hard, as the options were limited and the party would be behind him no matter which one he picked.\n\nThe first plan in front of him was the Tanaiste's plan. Seán MacEntee wanted to take control of the rising deficit and trade gap. In his mind, Ireland had been too reliant on foreign trade, and the German stranglehold had ended up killing it when the foreign trade had gone away. Strict protectionism would be put into place to prevent such a thing from ever happening again. As for the budget shortfall, any decrease in revenue would be made up for with a decrease in spending.\n\nBrendan Corish, on the other hand, thought austerity was the exact opposite way to solve the problem. The main problem wasn't that the government did not have money to spend, it was the people of Ireland not having any either. Under his plan, a set of relief programs aimed at the lower and middle class would be put into place, with the goal of giving them what they needed to bear the brunt of the crisis and eventually start spending again.\n\nThese plans had their merits, but. . .perhaps Lemass knew better? He had done some thinking of his own, and he felt there was a more simple solution to the crisis, one that did not require large deficits or unpopular spending cuts. Now that Germany was in a series of violent death throes, who could stop Ireland from making some favorable deals with the OFN? Then they would fill the gap and never rely solely on the Germans again.\n\nIn the end, Lemass decided just before going to bed, and would inform the rest of the government in the morning."

 IRE_flavor.1.desc:0 "On Easter Sunday 1916, a group of Irish patriots under the command of Patrick Pearse and James Connolly occupied the General Post Office of Dublin and proclaimed an independent Irish Republic. Although the fledgling nation lasted only a week before being cruelly crushed by the British Army and the leaders were executed, their martyrdom inspired their compatriots and resulted in the Irish War of Independence. Some would even say that the Easter Rising was the true beginning of our war of independence.\n\nNeedless to say, the fiftieth anniversary of such an event is something that we cannot afford to ignore. The men who once fought in the Rising are not getting any younger, and President de Valera is one of the last surviving leaders. There are already plans to create a committee that would organize the festivities, for both the day of Easter 1966 and for events leading up to it. While a great deal of attention can be afforded to it, there is the question of just how much it should receive. On one hand, being vigorous with our involvement it would be an excellent way to shore up public support for the President and Fianna Fáil. But on the other, it could draw ire from those who see it as frivolous, not to mention embolden some more... vociferous patriots in the Republic and Ulster."

The committee has identified the need for an open, public memorial space that can remind the people of Dublin of their countrymen's sacrifice for freedom, as well as the need for beautification in downtown Dublin in general.\n\nA corner of Rotunda Gardens, in Parnell Square, has already been earmarked on account of its historical significance: it's where the Irish Volunteers were founded in 1913, and where several of the Easter Rising's leaders were briefly detained before being sent to Kilmainham Gaol. A design by architect Dáithí Hanly has been approved, and ground will be broken next week. However, the major question is what exactly should be commemorated: just the fallen of the 1916 rising, or earlier anti-British rebellions. The United Irishmen of 1798, Robert Emmet in 1803, Young Ireland in 1848, and the Fenian Rising of 1867 all lack similar public memorials, and it would be a boon to public relations if the cause of the Rising were presented as the fulfillment of these earlier rebellions."

Although Emmet was executed by the British more than a century before the Rising, furthering the association between such lauded heroes and the modern Republic is a boon that cannot be understated.\n\nAn area of open land known as the Bully's Acre is said to be the final resting place of Emmet, though his body has never actually been discovered. Nevertheless, it will make a good location for a memorial. However, the question still remains of what exactly to engrave as an epitaph?

Hugh Paget featuring an image of Patrick Pearse on the obverse the Cúchulainn memorial on the reverse. Ideally, two million of them would be minted and distributed for public circulation, but minting would stop in 1967 and no further coins of that denomination will be produced.\n\nWhile it has been approved by the planning committee and received warmly by many others in the government, some think that it would be folly to create a new denomination of coins only for one year in limited numbers.

It had always been a source of contention and a target of ire for Irish nationalists: during the Easter Rising, the Irish Republicans attempted to demolish the Pillar to no avail. Petitions and bills to have it dismantled or relocated have continually cropped up in the last half-century, but they continually faced opposition from the Pillar Trust, which owns the memorial, and the Dáil's unwillingness to bother drafting legislation to enforce it.\n\nAnd now, nearly fifty years after the first attempt at toppling it, some enterprising citizens have taken the matter into their own hands. The upper half of the pillar was severed and fell to the ground due to the blast, which caused surprisingly little damage to surrounding buildings and vehicles. The statue of Nelson that topped the pillar lies shattered, its surviving fragments severely damaged in the fall.

Crowds cheered, medals were issued, and President de Valera was (unsurprisingly) overseeing all the festivities from a stand set up in front of the General Post Office. Some noted the conspicuous absences of politicians like Lynch, Flanagan, and Corish, and speculated whether it was an intentional snub by the President.\n\nLater in the day, the center of the ceremonies shifted a bit outside of the city epicenter, to the former prison of Kilmainham Gaol. It was here numerous Irish nationalists, including de Valera himself, served time for opposing the British, and it was also here that sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed by firing squad. The President toured the facilities, recently rehabilitated thanks to a campaign by private citizens, announced the opening of a history museum on the grounds, and concluded ceremonies by laying a wreath for the fallen in the execution yard."

There are de Valera's critics, as always, who claim he was trying to build a cult of personality around himself, but they were in a clear minority.

It was a German brand, he shook his head as he took a breath of it, smoke flowing out his mouth. That was the one thing he missed ever since the end of the war. Not American soda or Canadian whiskey. What he truly missed had been American cigarettes. Instead all they had was cheap German ones that barely lasted in the wind. As he got closer to the pub, he stomped out the cigarette and headed inside. A meeting was occurring there between the leaders of the Monetary Reform Party.\n\nAs he walked indoors, he was greeted with the warmth of the fireplace in the middle. The bartender was talking to a few customers, not paying attention to the new arrival. Instead he walked to a booth where he had some associates sitting.\n\nHe shook their hand and sat down. At the table had been a few pints of Guinness and some scattered papers. He took a look at them, inside of them had been mostly economic plans. However, some of them had also had plans to distribute flyers under the guise of Lemass himself. They talked for a while. Different subjects ranging from the best way to spread these flyers, to how they would remove the last Jews of Ireland off the island entirely.\n\nFlanagan told the men to not get ahead of themselves, they would need to win the election first. Even then, they would need to gain support from the people of Ireland. The grip the Fianna Fáil has on the country seemed nearly unbreakable, but to Flanagan it was just another weakness to exploit. The night concluded with a toast to the party and each of the men went their separate ways."

 IRE_flavor.16.desc:0 "Lemass' fingers massaged his forehead as he forced himself to read a report full of abhorrent information. Apparently his Foreign Minister, Frank Aiken, and his Minister of Economy, Jack Lynch, had taken it upon themselves to write an excruciatingly detailed report of the effects on Ireland after fifteen years as an economic dependant on the German Reich. He took a swig of cool water from a glass on his desk, hoping to reduce the steadily growing headache.\n\nThe report was clear and more or less irrefutable in its evidence. Germany had indeed been a profitable trade partner, though it was far too jealous of one to be valuable. The shattering of the United Kingdom might have secured Ireland's political safety - but it was horrendous in its effects on the Irish economy. Not only that, but trade with America - and the trade and tourism associated with the millions of Irish-Americans had been forbidden outright by the man in Germania. Lynch had made estimates and by all accounts - dealing with Germany was a net loss compared to trading with the rest of the world.\n\nBeyond demanding unreasonable economic faithfulness, the Reich was an abusive lover too - her corporations sucked the wealth of Ireland dry and left little to nothing behind for the impoverished citizens. Lemass felt a sinking feeling in his gut, knowing full well that securing Ireland's future from its possessive lover was the best thing for her future, but also not knowing if the little nation had the strength to escape."

He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he sensed a rift between them, suggesting that there was a hard limit on how far their policies would coincide. He frowned and shifted in his bed, he'd already lost an hour's sleep to this odd feeling. What was the difference between them? He focused on the single interaction that seemed stuck in his mind. When they went our separate ways after the meeting, Lynch had shaken his hand.\n\n\"To our future with our friends in Washington!\"\n\nWhat was it that bothered Colley so much about that statement? Colley was in agreement that Ireland's future involved stronger ties with America and a withdrawal from the Pakt. A doctrine of neutrality would serve Ireland well, allowing Germany to feel safe enough in the situation to avoid a costly and pointless invasion, while also allowing Ireland the ability to trade with both economic blocs.\n\n\"-our friends in Washington.\"\n\nColley's eyes shot open wide as it dawned on him where the difference was."

Irish politics had been a bloodbath he thought as he walked down the hall. As he walked through the hall, Charles eventually turned around and walked right in front of George before sticking his hand up and ever so slightly raising his voice.\n\n\"So help me God, if you scream at me one more time George, I will walk out!\" George looked at him before nodding and the two men walked back into the main chamber. Surrounding them in the seats had been representatives, Charles chuckled before beginning his monologue to the stunned representatives.\n\nHe went on and on, talking about how if they would want to become an economic powerhouse of Europe, then they must foster closer relations with the Pakt. Many tried to look at him in disgust, but at the same time something was drawing a few to him. The idea of becoming a leader of the economic world was an idea that the country had been dreaming of since independence. George looked around, trying to make sense of the mood in the air. Had people gone mad? They really want to dance with the Germans? He said this to himself, thinking that this deal may be harder to execute than thought. This was Ireland after all, nothing would come without a fight."

We'll be a lesser partner just the same as in the pakt, and we may be strong armed into backing American embargoes.\"\n\n\"That's the thing though, we're going to be a lesser partner and forced to embargo a good number of countries either way you look at it - and you know the Americans are willing to offer exactly what we need to get out of this whole disastrous mess.

With how little work there around, two years in the Defense Forces delayed the inevitable reality of unemployment. Moreover, there had been little risk of dying, since Carl had never been deployed to the Northern Counties. Paisley's uprising had changed that of course, and with it, brought the need to actually ensure that men like Carl were in fighting condition.\n\nThe Irish government, in its eternal wisdom, had decided to bring in a few Germans to evaluate the Irish forces, and bring a sizable contingent with them. The German commander had arrived a few hours ahead of his troops via a charter flight from Germania, and was due to inspect the 63rd Artillery Battalion. Carl had heard a few rumors about him, mostly hearsay, apparently it was an SS man who'd chosen the right side after during the kraut's own civil war a few years back, had something to do with Ireland before.\n\nBy the time that the German actually got to the garrison for his impromptu inspection tour, Carl had lined up alongside the rest of the unit at the artillery park. Newsreel cameras were hastily being set up. No doubt, the arrival of German help was a great propaganda opportunity for the battered Irish government, even more so for the huns themselves. A short time later, a black staff car arrived, from which descended a grey-clad officer - pointy cap and all - flanked by a few IDF men. Presumably for the benefit of the newsreels, an exaggerated, ridiculously upbeat announcement went over the garrison's loudspeakers. \"Major Hogan accompanies the German Officer, Generalmajor Karl Fu... Generalmajor Karl Fucker, on an inspection tour to assess the Defense Forces' capabilities.\"\n\nIn an act that was unlikely to make a good impression about the state of discipline in the IDF, a good portion of the men present snickered. Surely, it could be edited out later, for the newsreels kept on filming, noting the German officer taking the salute of all the men there assembled, until he went up to O'Harlan, whose service rifle he took an interest in, most likely something scripted at the insistence of Hogan, who knew O'Harlan had never failed to have it cleaned on inspection.

Adrenaline racing through his veins, he prepared to give the sermon a coup de grâce by finishing of with a denounciation of sodomy, but he was interrupted by the sound of gunfire.\n\nQuite often, the ICG or IRA would try to interrupt his meetings, that wasn't new, UVF men surrounding the church usually took care of them after a short skirmish. Nevertheless, with the gunfire getting louder and louder, Paisley decided not to extend the sermon further: No point in risking his own people.\n\nWhen he stood down from the pulpit to oversee the safe vacation of the church, Paisley heard the faintest hint of another noise: A hum. Paying no attention to it, he encouraged all those present to return to their homes in an orderly fashion, while the hum - as well the gunfire - kept growing louder.\n\nWhile Paisley was hurrying the churchgoers along, the hum broke through the walls, revealing itself as the deafening engine noise of an armored car. Taken aback, Paisley looked in horror as it punched a hole in the church at full speed, overrunning several pews. This wasn't IRA harassment: The Dublinites had come after him again - he could even spot the grey figures of distant IDF men through the massive gap the tankette had created.\n\nHis imminent arrest, Paisley believed, would galvanize the protestant population into rebellion.
