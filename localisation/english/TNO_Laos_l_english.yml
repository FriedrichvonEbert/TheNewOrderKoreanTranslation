 LAO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Laos is a state with few friends and many enemies. With Thailand calling for the total annexation of it, the princes constantly fighting for influence, and the communists, Vietcong, and even former colonial officials fighting insurgencies in the mountains, it seems that the only friends of the small mountain Kingdom are the IJA garrison operating an inherited colonial government and the Prime Minister, Boun Oum. This instability and chaos has brought the Kingdom of Laos to be one of many holes in Japan's desire for dominance in Southeast Asia, and the garrison finds itself fighting insurgents at all times, both known as rebels and merely suspected, a policy unpopular with locals. As Laos tears apart at the seams, it will be seen if it is the hammer and sickle or the Tokyo-made jackboot that will rule the nation in the end."
 
 LAO_Souvanna_Phouma:0 "Souvanna Phouma"
 POLITICS_SOUVANNA_PHOUMA_DESC:0 "Souvanna Phouma balances upon a knife's edge, one hand to either side as he desperately attempts to hold Laos together. A mere few years ago the Laotian scion of Japan and his brother, Phetsarath Ratanavongsa, died in his sleep. Faced with a crisis of leadership, only Souvanna Phouma carried the kind of political clout needed to reunify the government of Laos and assure Japan as to the young nation's integrity.\n\nSouvanna Phouma was born in 1901 while Laos was still a French Protectorate, and as such his education was largely French as well. Phouma has learned from Hanoi to Paris, but emerges to the front of Laotian politics dominated by the Japanese instead. At the head of the Neutralist Movement, there is nothing more important to Phouma than the preservation of Laos, no matter the cost.\n\nAnd the preservation of Laos is no simple task. The nation itself is small, but it is divided along political and regional lines, and it requires a mediator, a man in the middle of it all, to hold it together with sheer guile and strength of will. Phetsarath had that, until the day he had died, and now it is up to Phouma to see if he lives up to the mantle he has inherited."
