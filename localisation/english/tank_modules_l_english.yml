 tank_nsb_armor_upgrade:0 "Armour"
 tank_nsb_engine_upgrade:0 "Engine"

 NSB_Armour_1:0 "Basic Armor Protection"
 NSB_Armour_1_desc:0 "The mechanical ravages of the first half of the 20th century provoked new developments in armor technology. Two of the crudest, and yet most effective innovations are spaced plates and slat armor. Though not immune to HEAT rounds, these early innovations certainly offer superior protection."
 NSB_Armour_2:0 "Improved Armor Protection"
 NSB_Armour_2_desc:0 "Beyond projectiles themselves, spall - small fragments broken off from struck materials - present a lethal threat to a tank's crew and internal machinery. Even if a projectile is unable to pierce armor, the spall caused by its impact can still disable a tank by shredding its interior. New, internal spall linings have aided this issue considerably, much to the relief of the Cold War's enterprising tank crews."
 NSB_Armour_3:0 "Advanced Armor Protection"
 NSB_Armour_3_desc:0 "As anti-tank and HEAT weaponry became cheaper and more widespread, the superpowers' chief tank manufacturers were tasked with developing armor that could withstand the full force of a high-velocity superplastic jet. Their solution was composite armor formed from tactically arranged layers of ceramics, fibreglass, resin, and other like materials."
 NSB_Armour_4:0 "Modern Armor Protection"
 NSB_Armour_4_desc:0 "The long-theorized apex of Cold War armor technology, reactive armor meets the energy of enemy projectiles with energy of its own. Explosive reactive armor detonates on contact with a penetrator, shifting the point of impact in real time to increase effective thickness. Non-explosive reactive armor opts for a different approach, instead using an elastic layer between two harder, metallic layers to force the tank's plates to bulge and shift the rotation of a projectile."

 NSB_Engine_1:0 "Basic Engine Improvements"
 NSB_Engine_1_desc:0 "The development of efficient and reliable tank chassis has historically been limited by the size and uneconomical fuel consumption of early tank engines. Advancements in the design of combustion engines allowed for the maneuver of machines weighing many tons, but only recently have optimizations enabling relatively consistent high-speed travel been introduced en masse."
 NSB_Engine_2:0 "Improved Engine Improvements"
 NSB_Engine_2_desc:0 "Accompanying the demand for smaller, more flexible engines was the demand for simultaneously more powerful engines. Turboshaft engines - gas turbines that converted fuel into shaft horsepower, rather than thrust - met the demand, achieving greater output at the cost of fuel efficiency."
 NSB_Engine_3:0 "Advanced Engine Improvements"
 NSB_Engine_3_desc:0 "To offset tank engines' common failure to achieve fuel-efficient operation, economizing devices such as recuperators were introduced. Recuperators work by harnessing exhaust and waste heat to preheat gases meant for combustion, thereby improving fuel efficiency and recovering energy that, otherwise, would have been needlessly expended."
 NSB_Engine_4:0 "Modern Engine Improvements"
 NSB_Engine_4_desc:0 "Modern tank warfare has precipitated innumerable innovations contributing to increased engine fuel efficiency, output, and safety. Recuperators grow ever more efficient, and reduced engine sizes allow for the introduction of more advanced firefighting and survival systems."

 modern_tank_chassis_desc:0 "A modernized chassis that borrows heavily from previous medium tanks, but puts a much bigger emphasis on speed and maneuverability, while also allowing for more armor and bigger guns than usually carried on medium tanks. The result is a vehicle that can fill a wide variety of roles."
 main_battle_tank_chassis_desc:0 "Experience has shown that the designs of light, medium, and heavy tank are converging more and more. heavy tanks have gotten more mobile, while light tanks are carrying heavier armament and armor to survive. there is therefore value in unifying all three designs into a single type, which will be a universal Main Battle Tank."
