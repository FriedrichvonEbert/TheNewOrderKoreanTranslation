Were it not for Meyer-Landrut, they might have been caught and killed before ever finding that safety. Now, however, the Abwehr informs us that many Speerite civilians and soldiers alike are still alive and kicking in Ostland, turning to a banker of all things to save them in the absence of their false Führer. While they were no doubt welcomed at the time of their arrival, the traitorous government of Ostland will soon have reason to rue their decision, as every Speerite that fled to their lands is one more traitor to rally Germany against.

Just the sort of thing needed to get people on-side, even if the genealogical records don't support it. We can worry about that later. The fact of the matter is that National Socialism found its first converts amongst the masses thanks to the blunders and scheming of the Judeo-Bolshevik bankers and capitalists. Operating from the shadows, they stabbed the Old Reich in the back, destroyed the Weimar Republic's economy and tried to bring down the entire world through the Wall Street Crash.

A myth perpetuated by the corrupt plutocracy that is the United States. Where did their version of freedom lead them? To weakness, to instability... and, ultimately, to defeat. Without the amassed capital of the United States, plundered from the masses, how does Meyer-Landrut propose to make his promises reality? His 'freedom' is a falsehood.

Perhaps the financier even intends for Ostland to serve as a staging ground for some greater hostile power... doubtless he is in talks with his hook-nosed comrades in America even as we speak!

Even abandoned by their master, they are just as willing to fight to the death as the partisans and know our inner workings far better than the Balts do. Finally, there are those few Bormannites who resist the necessity of change and the renewal of the German warrior spirit. No matter their cause, they will all die in the end.

It is not uncommon for a recruiting officer to arrive in a German town and immediately be swamped with men young and old alike clamoring for the chance to avenge the fallen. Even before our arrival, they banded together in militias and roving bands to keep their Aryan kin safe and secure from the tide of rats as it rose ever higher, threatening to engulf all they held dear. The Ostland Divisions might not turn out to be the most capable or well-equipped of our divisions, but they will certainly be fiercely loyal to their race, with high morale and a deep devotion to National Socialist principles.

Knowing this, the Führer wishes to have Dreschler removed from office by any means necessary (including force), but any direct action against him would undoubtedly rouse the ire of Schörner, a key backer of our cause.

We should work quickly to establish contact with these brave men of the Reich before the SS can begin to organise a more decisive response.

With a few good strafing runs, any aircraft available to the SS can be destroyed on the ground, giving our bombers and CAS all the room they need to flatten every single building flying the black flag.

Some have questioned the necessity of allocating naval resources to Operation Ostwind, given that we face no threats within the Baltic from either the SS or Burgundy.

The Wehrmacht is insistent that none of the officials in Ostland are above suspicion and demands the right to subject them to military justice.

Schörner is livid and almost frothing at the mouth in his insistence that the SS remains a threat to the colony and direct military action is necessary, but the recovery has been too successful and the opportunity for his measures to be enacted has passed.

This union would normally not happen so soon, but the Führer is confident that this step is necessary to ensure that Ostland recovers swiftly and enjoys the full benefits of being part of the Reich proper.

Still, he might be amenable to working with Göring despite their political differences. Indeed, secretly, Göring is relieved to be dealing with a conservative rather than a militarist, as the latter would undoubtedly have been in Field Marshal Schörner's pocket.

No amount of courage or discipline can halt sixty tons of steel or shield infantry from their mighty guns.

By using our fleet to cut off major ports and blockade the coastline, we will shatter the Norwegian economy, causing economic collapse and driving the Norwegians to poverty and starvation. If the plan succeeds, the Norwegians will be too weak to lift a finger against our forces when we land.\n\nUnfortunately, this plan does have some flaws. The Kriegsmarine is underfunded and still somewhat damaged from the chaos of the civil war, and currently is not in the best shape to conduct any large scale operations such as a blockade of the long Norwegian coastline. In addition, the fortifications we built with German sweat to hold off any western invasions, complete with naval guns, are undoubtedly now in the hands of the traitorous Norwegians, and may be used against our fleet.\n\nBoth of these problems are easily fixable, of course.

By using this fascinating new technology, we can swarm the resisting Norwegians with a cloud of steel and lead, overwhelming their defenses and seizing ports before they can mount a defense.\n\nOf course, helicopters have their drawbacks.

By building up bases in Denmark, we will be able to fire missiles of all kinds into the mountains of Norway, obliterating any bunkers and forts in a hail of rockets and bombs, without a single German man being forced to lay his life on the line.\n\nIn addition to the immediate strategic benefit of these bases, they will also be a fine addition to our defenses against any American incursion into Europe, covering the entrance into the Baltic and much of the North Sea.

This development, while unfortunate for obvious reasons, has left the Oberkommando in an even larger state of outrage than normal.

Without reinforcements being close or ready to help with the invasion, our attack has stagnated severely. It is time for a change in course.\n\nFrom here on out, we shall plan our next moves carefully, using the scalpel instead of the sledgehammer to dissect our foes. With a bit more preparation, a few more units, and perhaps some attacks on Ukraine's internal stability, we can certainly weaken the frontlines enough to push through and reclaim the breadbasket.\n\nUnfortunately for us, despite coming up with the disaster of a plan in the first place, it seems that Schörner has managed to deflect most of the blame from himself onto numerous other generals, including our Führer! While this insubordinance would not be tolerated by any other general, Schörner wields too much power for any punishment to come to him. As such, we must grit our teeth and ride the storm of anger until this mess is solved."

With the collapse of Ukraine and the restoration of German rule so close at hand, champagne bottles are popping all around at the Oberkommando.\n\nOf course, the main mastermind of the operation, Schörner, has made no small effort in letting the public know who was the first, most dedicated adherent to the aggressive nature of the attack. As grating as this is to the Führer and to those who disagree with Schörner, we are at least able to ride the coattails of his success to boost our own popularity within the army.\n\nOf course, we could slow down our attack and plan the rest of our assault out, taking precautions to defeat the rebels through more thorough, slow means. However, with how successful this plan has so far been, overriding Schörner's plan may result in an extremely angry Wehrmacht, with no tangible upside other than checking Schörner's popularity.

Of course, these two points are now being hammered furiously by a seething Schörner and his acolytes.

Natives refuse to follow orders, insolent citizens lie to our soldiers regularly, and decrees from the Reichskommissar go unheeded. This cannot stand, but the standard strategy of brutally cracking down is so clearly a mistake in this situation that even Schörner is against it.\n\nInstead, as much as it pains us to stoop so low, we must win back the people of Ukraine through a hearts and minds campaign.

Though the cost of these massive silos will undoubtedly be gigantic, surely the profit of never risking a food shortage again will be worth the high price.

Of course, such a success requires parades and celebrations all across Germany, of which both have been celebrated. Perhaps the happiest men in Germany, though, are the Führer and Schörner, who both celebrate for different reasons.\n\nSchörner celebrates because the Wehrmacht once again has a great success under its belt, and every day its standing with the people grows.\n\nGöring celebrates because, once again, the wealth of Ukraine is in his hands, and the people's adoration returns to him almost as quickly as it rains down upon the soldiers who fought for the fields of Ukraine.\n\nThe victory in Ukraine is surely one to remember, and one can only hope that such success continues to follow the Wehrmacht in its next exploits."

In the past, the Iberian Union had the Axencia Anti-Separatista to fight against the terrorists, and we will create a similar department called "Agentur zur Seperatistenbekämpfung", or ASB in short.

 GGR_fall_blau3_desc:0 "After the fall of France, there's only Iberia stands to the west of the Reich. Like the Italians, the Iberian nations were once our allies during the World War II, and quickly became our opponents after the establishment of the New Order. To ensure the secure of our western border when the war with Italy begins, Iberia must be brought knee as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, in Iberia, to prevent their inevitable falling into our hands, a desperate attempt was taken by Franco and Salazar-to merge their two nations into one Iberian Union. And after all these years of jealousies and disagreements, the Union manages to survive against all odds. But despite of how strong the fort Spanish and Portuguese have built is, they're naïve to believe that it can resist the power of the German Reich. Soon we'll be enjoying the blue ocean and golden sunshine of Atlantic on the western beach of Iberian Peninsula and cheering at the success of Fall Blau."
 GGR_securing_france_desc:0 "As our plans for securing domination of the Iberian peninsula develop, it is time we turn our attention to a secondary matter, but one that is pressing nonetheless. The French State was able to wriggle free of our grasp in the chaos of the civil war, and it just so happens that they have the only land border with the Iberian Union that we could hope to exploit. Attempting amphibious assaults across the coast of Iberia is possible but significantly more risky than storming across the Pyrenees.\n\nThe French are of course far too weak to oppose us, even if they are independent now. All we would have to do is threaten an invasion and they will no doubt fold. They won't risk another invasion after their recent losses to Burgundy and Brittany. With our old puppet restored we'll be able to much more directly apply force to Iberia, and then to Italy and even Burgundy when their times come."
 GGR_a_multi_front_invasion_desc:0 "The military power Iberian Union holds is much weaker than any great power, and it's due to the tough terrain and forts in the hills that they believe they can resist our forces. And it's clear that direct frontal assault will be a idea that only fools would have a try. To prevent the unnecessary loss of the Heer, special forces will be tasked with the vital part of this campaign.\n\nWhen the war breaks out, our specials forces will immediately set out and breakthrough the enemy's front. Our paratroops will land from the air like eagles, our marines will appear from the sea like sharks, and our mountain infantries will sneak in and destroy their forts in hill like ghosts. Those Iberians have no point what modern warfare looks like, and this time we will show them about how huge the gap between their military forces and ours is."
 GGR_the_burgundian_method_desc:0 "For decades, terrorist groups all over the world have been receiving funding from Himmler and his slaves in the shadow state, which has caught great troubles us, and all he wants is to create as much chaos as he can so that he will be able to implement his secret evil plan. Of course, the Reich and his noble guardians will never become some filthy bastards like the Burgundians, yet we have to admit that sometimes the Burgundian ways are quite useful for us.\n\nTo ensure our current war plan against the Iberian Union, the Führer and his generals have decided that we will start to fund those terrorist groups in Iberia like the Eta, hoping to cause the stir in Iberia. And when Iberia was in havoc, the Union will have to scatter their forces in the whole Peninsula. It may be seen a shame by some as we need to learn from those Burgundians, but it will be disgraceful if we cannot achieve a quick victory against the Iberian Union."
 GGR_fight_for_your_freedom_desc:0 "The first batch of founding and equipment has been sent into the terrorist organizations in Iberia, and they've started to cause more troubles to the Iberian century government. However, for now their activities are not enough to shaken the rule of the Iberian Union. Therefore, more assistance will be continuously provided to them and the flames in Iberia will burn even brighter.\n\nAnd you, my fearless freedom fighter who bravely stand up against the oppression of the Union, please allow the Reich to show our respect with our assistance. Yours is a restless life, and never shall you know peace, until you've freed your kinsmen from the iron cage made by the rulers in Madrid. Take comfort in the fact that, though you seem to be standing alone at present, the German Reich is always your faithful friend in any case."
 GGR_let_the_abwehr_run_wild_desc:0 "In recent days, more assistance has been sent to the Iberian terrorists, however their delegates are still asking for more regardless of how much they have received. Such greed has angered many officials in our government, and even the Führer himself has doubt about whether should we continue to fund those organizations, for they are planned to be eliminated as well once the conquest ends, and excessive fund may make them strong enough to fight against us.\n\nHowever, the officer of our Abwehr has persuaded the Führer to continue fund those terrorists, promising that everything is under their control, because no matter how strong they can become, they won't have any chance stand our invincible military forces. Convinced by their points, the Führer has grant the Abwehr full authority over our negotiation with those organizations. After all, some disorderly terrorists are much easier to deal with than Iberian regular army, and they are a far more distant threat to consider. For now, the Iberian Union is all we need to think about."
 GGR_thinking_ahead_desc:0 "In recent days, more assistance has been sent to the Iberian terrorists, however their delegates are still asking for more regardless of how much they have received. Some militarists, especially those in the Abwehr of the Wehrmacht, suggest that we can agree on their terms, since no matter how strong they can become, they won't bother the our military forces in the end, and for now the war against Iberian regular army is all we need to think about. However, the Führer has much cooler head than those officials, and he has made a more cautious decision.\n\nAccording to the Führer's command, we need to keep our funds to those terrorists at the minimum level instead of meet their needs. Every one need to learn that the Reich isn't their babysitter and they don't have rights to make demands on us. And more importantly, we only need them to distract the Iberian forces, and when the conquest of Iberia finish, they will be much easier for us to deal with if they have only received little help from us. Only an arrogant fool would help his potential enemies strengthen themselves, and we can never be allowed to commit such tomfoolery."
 GGR_north_african_connections_desc:0 "For thousands of years, North Africa has always been closely connected with Southern Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula. Considering this, our recent acquisition of Algeria and its neighboring land may make a great convenience for us in our planned conquest of Iberian Union. And now, the chance has been offered to the Wehrmacht.\n\nUnder the governance of Iberian Union, a lot of Portuguese who faced oppressed by the Union have expressed their willingness to help our war cause. We could use them to subvert the local government of Iberian Union, and by doing this, we shall be able to weaken the resistance we're going to face when the war breaks out. The only problem is, however, there's no free help in this world, and their price is not low at all."
 GGR_the_best_training_man_can_find_desc:0 "The Iberian Peninsula has the most complex terrain in West Europe, and the Iberian people believes they can never be conquered by foreign powers under its protection. However, after years of conquest, the German Reich is big enough to own all kinds of terrains in this globe. From lush forest to steep mountains, from frozen land to muddy swamps, every kind of terrain made by the earth has been conquered by us, and the Iberian Union won't become a insuperable barrier to our forces.\n\nTo easily root out the resistance, our special troops will receive specific training designed for the landform of Iberian Peninsula. And with the incomparable military power, the Reich will provide our courageous soldiers the highest standard of training in this world. When our special forces show up before their eyes, the Iberian soldiers will realize that the strength of the Wehrmacht is much far beyond their imagination."

And the bad news is, decades of chaos have doomed the infrastructures in France, and the Iberian governments is also incapable of constructing a few modern roads. If we wish to invade Iberia from France, we're going to face the problem of slow marching speed and shortage of supplies.\n\nSuch a situation is obviously not what we wish to face, yet the Reich still needs to get it at any cost. Unlike those incompetent nations, the national socialist doctrine has given us unimaginable power to concentrate our nation's strength on the major tasks we're going to face. Time is running out for us, but no matter how impossible it seems, we'll build broad and unblocked highways and railroads from Paris to the heart of Iberia, and that's why the Third Reich is the unchallengeable hegemony of the world."
 GGR_from_alger_to_marrakech_desc:0 "With Algers under our authority the General Staff has been able to begin plans for the opening of a new front in the Iberian campaign. While out forces strike into the mainland of the Union, we can now deploy forces to the deserts of North Africa to capture the Iberian territories of Morocco. New air bases will be built on our little beachhead to facilitate troop and supply movement, along with a steady stream of combat aircraft to provide cover for our advancing forces. Our objective will be to seal off Iberian North Africa as a potential fallback point for our foes. We have seen with our own eyes the damage that soldiers from Iberian can do when operating out of their colonial possessions. Were we not the ones who helped bring Franco to Spain during their own civil war? We will not make the mistakes of the Second Spanish Republic."

Your government has failed you, and your army is too corrupted to organize any real defenses against us. Your cities will be razed, villages will be pillaged, industries will be seized and everyone of you will be forced to work for the Reich whether you like it or not. In a nutshell, you and the Iberian Union, are doomed.\n\nHowever, there's still one opportunity for you to take. All we wish to destroy is the Iberian government and its loyalists, and anyone wish shares the same enemy with us can become our allies. We German people are benevolent and we'd like to show you mercy as long as you're feeling oppressed by the Iberian government and willing to fight against it. People of Basque, Catalonia and Portugal, please don't let this once-in-a-lifetime chance slip through your fingers! Stand up, join the German side!

 GGR_call_to_the_basques_desc:0 "Our initial plan about the total civil war failed, but it doesn't mean that all our efforts were in vain. The Basques have been oppressed by Madrid for a very long time, and their hatred towards Spain is getting ever stronger in these days. If we can get their support via some propaganda and diplomatic methods, their struggle in the north will do us a great favor in our war against the Iberian Union. To achieve this, a propaganda article haven been drafted by our diplomats.\n\n"People of Basque, please hear our voice. You are one of the bravest nations in this world, and a close kin of we Germans ethnically. But for years, you've been humiliated, tortured and oppressed by the Spanish bastards. We do admire your unyielding determination to fight against it, but you cannot win this war on your own. Now please answer to our call of friendship and join this holy war against the Iberian Union. You will win your rightful place in our New Order once we succeed.""
 GGR_call_to_the_catalans_desc:0 "Our initial plan about the total civil war didn't go well, but we can still reach out to those who had already been hostile toward the government of Iberian Union before our propaganda. At the west of Iberian Peninsula, the Catalans have been oppressed by Madrid for a long period, and they're willing to do anything for their independence. Though they've been polluted by decayed values and will be enslaved by us according to our post-war plan, we can still make a temporary alliance with them before the fall of the Iberian Union. To achieve this, a propaganda article haven been drafted by our diplomats.\n\n"People of Catalonia, we know you may not like us, but it doesn't matter right now. Please think about it, is there any benefits for you to reject our proposal of alliance and friendship. Accept our invitation, fight alongside the German Reich against your enemies in Madrid, and you'll have the freedom you've craved for decades.

 GGR_call_to_the_portugese_desc:0 "Unlike the fools of Basque and Catalonia, our agents in Portugal have brought us good news after our ultimate.

With the Portuguese on our side, the Iberian Union will collapse To achieve this, a propaganda article haven been drafted by our diplomats.\n\n"People of Portugal, twenty years ago, the Spanish lied to you, cajoled you into the so-called 'Iberian Union'. But twenty years have passed, we know that you have through their true ambitions under the name of it. Are you an equal partner of the Spain, or a low servant in their eyes? You must have already gotten the right answer in your head, and now, the German Reich has come to give you a hand. Twenty years ago, that lie started with the fear of a fabricated 'German invasion', and now, after twenty years, you can end it with a real German invasion of Spain. Fortune is smiling on you, and please take this chance to correct your mistakes in the past, for you won't have a better one more.""
 GGR_but_no_one_answered_desc:0 "Hearing our call of friendship, many Iberians contact us and expressed their expectation for an alliance with the Reich. The Reich, of course, appreciates their good intentions, but it is a shame that the luck doesn't stand on their side even though they made the right choice. Considering the current situation in Iberia, they're not needed anymore. And since they're definitely not racial brothers of the Reich, there is no reason that they could enjoy any privilege that other Iberian people shouldn't have. Any promises we made before will be defined as fabricated and invalid, and they will be treated like all other dissenters and the Iberian scums. All must understand that no one can bargain with the German Reich, and total submission is only way he can take.\n\nAnd after dealing with those bastards, all memories of our promises will disappear with them. No one is going to know what happened during our conquest of Iberian, and all Iberians will live equally in fear from this time on."
 GGR_demand_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "Dissenters never disappeared in Iberian Peninsula: in this past, they keep criticizing the rule of Franco and Salazar, saying their authoritarian regime is an oppression of everyone in their nation; and now, we know that many is hostile toward our governance and secretly cursing our soldiers, generals and officials. They won't be able to do this anymore. The former rulers of Iberian didn't succeed in suppressing those dissents, and their failure has leaded to their final collapse before our forces. We, with our advanced experience of purging those insects in other places, cannot repeat their foolishness.\n\nFrom this day on, all Iberians must be totally loyal towards the German Reich. Every move they make, every word they speak and every mood they expressed will be closely watched by our agents, and any sign of disobedience will lead to imprisonment or even execution. They can have no doubts, no hesitations and even no free thoughts, for all they need to know is to follow our orders. They used to think they cannot stand anymore under the 'oppression' of the Caudillos, but now they will understand what true oppression really means."
 GGR_no_more_games_desc:0 "The ghost of terrorism has been haunting around Iberia since the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War, as different organizations directly fighting against the government all over the peninsula. And the Iberian government, due to their inefficiency and corruption, never really suppressed those terrorists. Consequently, the strength of those organizations kept growing and caused more and more troubles every day. Eventually, the prosperity and stability of Iberian Union was doomed in constant violence and riots.\n\nBut now, we could tell those terrorists that, their good old days are gone. Failing to pacify its own realm is a shame for a nation, and we cannot act like those Latin scums. There will be no more stupid childlike games between police and terrorists, for now the real anti-terrorist campaign is going to start."

Adéu, Sagrada Família, sadly you didn't get your people redeemed; Adéu, Hospital de Sant Pau, it's shame you can save your people's lives but not their souls; Adéu, Palau de la Música Catalana, from now on there will be only German military music can be heard in Catalonia.

 GGR_contain_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Iberia is large, and any attempts to govern the Iberians with one single political body may lead to low efficiency and failure to maintain local stability, as the Iberian Union has showed us. Luckily for us, from the beginning of our conquest we've noticed this problem and set up 6 different RKs in total with each one dealing with one specific region in the peninsula. Divide, conquer and rule over, such a strategy is as old as time itself, and we shall implement it here.\n\nIn addition, to avoid the possible risk of communication and cooperation between different ethnic groups in Iberia, we need to divide those people with enough caution. Population for each RK must be carefully designed so that each RK may be able to handle their own realm on their own without needs to worry about a total uprising. Through the scientific administration the Reich can gain as much as resources and maintain the peace and stability of Iberian Peninsula."
 GGR_always_vigilant_desc:0 "The conquest of Iberia is indeed a great victory for the Reich, and we did have reasons to celebrate for it. Yet it would be foolish to ignore the threat of other powers in the world that still seek any opportunity to weaken our fatherland, especially the OFN and its American master. Each German victory in Europe is a warning of them, and scared of the mighty military power we hold, their subversive activities is getting more and more frequent. And thus, our soldiers must stay vigilant enough at any time.\n\nFor the US, Iberian Peninsula is westernmost part of Europe and therefore has great strategic values. Our agents reported that secret ships and OFN spies have been sent from their ports to Iberia. Due its distance between Germania and Iberia, we may not be able to deal with the sudden case there and as the result, we can only rely on the sense of responsibility of our local occupied forces. All ships that move near our coastline must be cautiously checked and make sure no one can sneak into the Reich. The security of Europe is at our troops' hands."
 GGR_close_the_dam_desc:0 "In history, Gibraltar, as the gateway of the Mediterranean Sea is the key of global trade for Mediterranean nations, which includes many of our former and future enemies. Considering this, one reason of our Iberian conquest is to control the lifeline of Italian international transportation and trade so that we can weaken their economy a lot and even make it collapse without a military campaign. And now, as the whole Iberian Peninsula has been firmly controlled by the Reich, we are able to cut the throat of the Italians and destroy their ability to sustain themselves.\n\nToday, according to the direct order from Germania, the Gibraltar Dam will be closed until all Mediterranean nations bow before the German Reich. When we started constructing the dam, many have doubted and even mocked at the utility of such a grand project, especially when the program was suspended due to financial reasons. But now, the dam will become a true nightmare for all Italians when they realize how terrible their shortages can be. After closing the Gibraltar dam, all our plans about Iberian Peninsula will be finished perfectly, as the economy of Italians will soon be strangled to its last breath. Now let's cheer at the beauty of sunset in the entrance of such a peaceful and vast sea. Sieg Heil and cheer for the Fatherland once again!"

However, we can't be rash: in order to avoid unnecessary casualties, we need to approach our enemy carefully and have our backs covered.\n\nTo address this, we have two solutions: on one hand, we can reach an agreement with the Finnish, and have them grant us military access to their railways and port facilities, greatly helping our logistical situation. On the other, we can strengthen Reichskommissariat Moskowien and ensure that the Russians already under our authority don't stab us in the back at the first chance..."
 GGR_keep_your_friends_close_desc:0 "Our allies in the North are our best bet against the Russians. By sending them guns and other smaller concessions, we can make sure they won't ever protest if we use their land as a staging ground for the invasion.\n\nThis time, we'll be the ones striking from the frozen North, and the Russians will flee in terror! How's that, General Winter?"
 GGR_masters_of_the_arctic_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our access to the port of Murmansk, we can improve it to house a warfleet and the convoys needed for a naval invasion! While we don't necessarily have to follow this route - and indeed, the waters will most likely be frozen, preventing any actual landing from ever happening - it will be a threat nonetheless, and the foolish Russians will be forced to divert several units to protect hundreds of miles of useless, frozen nothing!\n\nWith their forces divided, we can take our time and choose the most effective way to crush these vermins!"
 GGR_and_your_enemies_closer_desc:0 "In the end, our best bet against the Russians is Reichskommissariat Moskowien. Not only is it the logistical crossroad for the entire operations - which means that a revolt would make Fall Rot collapse on itself immediately - but most of the Russian levies we have deployed come from there.\n\nIt is imperative, therefore, that we strengthen the Reichskommissariat, and ensure the local authorities have enough men and guns to keep everything under control. With our backs covered, we can launch our offensive without having to worry about our rear!"
 GGR_ensure_russian_loyalty_desc:0 "The Russians employed within our army are more numerous than they are loyal. With several fighting units, and a large part of the logistical machine being Russian, a native revolt in Moskowien due to racial conflicts, or dissatisfaction with the treatment they receive while under our command, would cripple the war effort with disastrous consequences.\n\nAs much as we loathe to even think about it, we might need to increase their pay and living conditions so that they have at least some reason to remain loyal to us. Of course, we can always let them understand what happens to those who betray the master race, with the help of a generous number of summary executions..."

Our panzerdivisionen are eager to trample the Russians under their threads once more, and both regular soldiers and mercenaries have been extensively trained and equipped for the coming war.\n\nThe time to blow the horns is almost here! As soon as our agents are done with their operation, and the Russian morale has been sufficiently lowered, we shall bear the eagle and the swastika to the Slavs, to rule as their masters for a thousand years and more!"
 GGR_renew_terror_bombings_desc:0 "As long as the Luftwaffe fulfilled its admirable duty in bombing the Russian desolation, the warlords were kept in submission. With the end of the bombings due to the Bürgerkrieg, the warlords began building up their strength once again, and eventually began unifying through means either peaceful or violent, giving birth to the monster we are now facing.\n\nIn order to counter the Bolshevik menace, and let these savages understand that the sky is OUR domain, and ours only, we shall resume the terror bombings over the entirety of Russia. By dynamite or by napalm, the Slavs will bend to their master, one way or the other."
 GGR_send_in_the_firebrands_desc:0 "Among the Russians living in Moskowien are many who support our ideology. Like Count Vlad of Transylvania, who sent Turkish prisoners infected with the plague back to their masters to spread disease and panic among the invaders, we shall plant agitators, firebrands and terrorists in the territories belonging to our enemies, ready to turn the unsuspecting populace to our cause, or sabotage their war effort.\n\nThose Russians are so foolish to think that all of their kin are on their side, or cruelly oppressed. While they might indeed be true on the latter, the former is still very much up for discussion, and our generous gift will surely be a VERY convincing argument..."
 GGR_coordinated_rebellion_desc:0 "Russia has been divided for more than two decades, and many of those warlords had - or still have - deeply conflicting political ideologies. This means that there's lots of fertile ground to seed dissent and foment rebellion: by coordinating the agents we have sent there and having them infiltrate already-existing opposition movements, it will be easy to set up well-timed uprisings and other disturbances.\n\nEfen in the case that they don't manage to completely topple the enemy government, they'll still provide a useful source of distraction, forcing them to divert troops to guard supply lines and sensitive targets from terrorist attacks or raids."
 GGR_fear_campaign_desc:0 "We can't limit ourselves to destroy their infrastructure and industry. If we want to prevail quickly and easily, we need to destroy their very hopes and dreams of resisting our advance!\n\nTo address this, our bombers will drop not only their explosive payload, but also leaflets written in Russian where the common folk will be able to know with exact precision the fate awaiting them should they resist.\n\nOf course, they will all share the same fate of servitude whether they fight or not, but they don't need to know it, do they?"

 GGR_their_people_are_weak_desc:0 "Finally, our efforts have paid, and the Russian people is weaker than ever. The wretches live in terror of the next bombing run, just after they thought they would never have to endure such torture any longer: they run and hide like rats, and spend their restless nights in abject fear, for they know what awaits them at the end of the war.\n\nThe time has come to reap the fruits of our hard labor!

 GGR_the_first_domino_desc:0 "Even though we won twice against the Russians in the last two decades, the harsh weather - especially winter - reaped many victims among our forces both times. With modern technologies and synthetic materials, we can easily provide proper winter clothing for all our forces at a fraction of the cost it would have taken during the last war.\n\nBy supplying our men with warm, comfortable war attire, we shall deny the Russian rabble their only advantage, and prove, once and for all, that not even General Winter can hope to defeat the Reich!"
 GGR_winter_clothing_drive_desc:0 "Fighting in the snow isn't just a matter of keeping yourself warm. ice, snow and low temperatures provide a wide array of logistical, tactical and strategic challenges that, if not properly addressed, will result in a humiliating defeat.\n\nBy training our troops in winter warfare and the use of weapons in extreme conditions, and teaching our mechanics and pilots how to keep their vehicles in optimal state even when the fuel in their tanks freezes, we shall prevail as we did in the past!"
 GGR_ice_training_desc:0 "Our invasion of Russia is like a great game of domino. All the pieces have been painstakingly set into place, but for this reason it is imperative that the first piece falls in the proper way.\n\nWestern Russia is the first domino, and our invasion won't be able to proceed to the next stage until all of it has been secured. To this end, we need to occupy the entirety of the territories belonging to the Western warlords: our men need to understand the difficulty of the task, and feel pride for being the ones who will ensure the swastika rises from Moscow to the Pacific Ocean!"
 GGR_loot_the_factories_desc:0 "After what now is Reichskommissariat Moskowien, the "free" Western Russia is the most industrialized area among the territories belonging to the former Soviet Union. Such a wealth of industrial power can't be wasted, and should be properly exploited for our invasion!\n\nIn order to ensure our troops receive all the supplies they need, we shall seize as many factories as we can before the bolshevik rabble can evacuate or sabotage them, and divert production towards the war effort. If this can't be done, we'll simply tear the entire building apart and bring everything to Germany!"
 GGR_expand_the_reichskommissariat_desc:0 "As the Russians West of the Urals share a mostly uniform culture, it would be most advantageous to integrate the newly-conquered territories into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, whose experienced officials are best suited for such a task.\n\nWith their tried methods to properly rule over the Russian rabble, they won't have problems overseeing the pacification and subsequent integration of Western Russia into the larger Reich, ensuring all meet their production quota, and partisans don't hinder the war effort."
 GGR_fight_the_insurgency_desc:0 "As expected, civilian partisans, deserters from the Russian armies and even bandits have started striking against occupation garrisons and unprotected supply lines. While the occupied territories are still under direct military control and waiting for integration into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, we need to act to crush the rebels before they can hinder the war effort.\n\nBy deploying special troops to the most troublesome regions, and showing the wretches that we aren't above retaliating against the civilian population, even their families and loved ones - no, ESPECIALLY their families and loved ones - we should be able to keep them under control until proper police forces come to patrol the roads and cities."
 GGR_find_some_friends_desc:0 "Of course, brute force won't suffice by itself in keeping these insolent inferiors in their place. Our agents have already started to look for potential... allies in this struggle, and they report satisfying results: as we advance, they will spin a thick web of ideological deserters, paid sycophants, traitorous politicians, informers and many, many others.\n\nWhen we leave for our next target, these native collaborators will ensure the resistance is kept under control, by both offering the common people an acceptable face to our iron-fisted rule, and selling their comrades in the opposition to the Orpo before they can put any of their plans into action!"
 GGR_searching_in_perm_desc:0 "Despite being Slavs, the Aryan Brotherhood was mainly comprised of ardent supporters of national socialism. By looking among their ranks for potential recruits, we can set up a loyal - or at least, partially so - paramilitary force entirely made up of Russians at a fraction of the cost required to form a proper police force!\n\nAlso, should they fail in their duty towards the master race, or prove a disappointment in other ways, we can always send them into the slave camps and replace them with professionals... Waste not, want not!"
 GGR_reestablish_the_roa_desc:0 "The Russkaja Osvoboditel'naja Armija (ROA), or "Russian Liberation Army", was a commendable effort to sow division and strife among the Russians, by providing deserters and collaborators a banner to flock to. In the end, however, it proved useless, and Vlasov betrayed us to establish his own petty realm to rule as a warlord.\n\nSince the experiment was still promising, we shall re-establish the ROA, but under a new management. We'll only choose loyal officers from Moskowien, and they shall be properly kept under control by the Abwehr to ensure they don't start having strange thoughts as their predecessors did..."
 GGR_rush_to_the_urals_desc:0 "With Western Russia under total control, we now need to strike at the warlords in control of the Urals. It will be a tough battle, as the wretches not only had the time to prepare for war while we were crushing their brothers, but they also enjoy the protection of the Urals themselves: tall, impervious and heavily fortified, these mountains will prove a difficult challenge even for our best units.\n\nThe Oberkommando has devised two possible solutions to this problem. The first is to send in more fresh troops from the Vaterland to storm the mountain fortresses, a costly but effective solution. The second is to establish Russian penal battalions and force them to attack the fortifications or face execution: while much cheaper in both money and German lives wasted, this solution is also riskier as there is a higher chance of desertion or even revolt..."
 GGR_do_it_ourselves_desc:0 "The Russians have proved time and again their mettle, and for this reason we can't trust them any longer. We'll break the Urals with German strength and blood, no one can stand against us!\n\nBy initiating a new conscription campaign at home, we'll surely be able to fill any manpower need we might have."
 GGR_all_russian_penal_battalions_desc:0 "Spilling German blood amidst the Ural peaks is a total waste, especially when we can achieve the same result by spilling Russian blood. As the last wars taught us, there's always too much Russian blood left to spill: there must be, if they can repopulate so quickly after suffering such losses twice in two decades...\n\nIn order to take the mountain forts, we shall form Russian penal battalions by conscripting wretches taken from prisons and slave camps. They'll have a simple choice: almost certain death at the hands of their own kin up in the snowy Urals, or certain death at our hands if they refuse. If they survive, there's always another fort to take, or another minefield we can't spare deminers for...\n\nAfter all, we are just copying their own tactics: as Zhukov said, "If there is a minefield, the infantry will advance as if there wasn't a minefield"
 GGR_redevelop_the_roads_desc:0 "Advancing towards Siberia is a difficult task for our logistical department. Russian infrastructure is already underdeveloped enough, but the situation has worsened after the bombing campaign and the fighting: now, most railroads are fully unusable, and the majority of the roads are covered in craters, almost all bridges cut to prevent us from advancing.\n\nIf we want to ensure our troops receive all the supplies they need for the coming campaign, then a concerted effort is needed to bring the infrastructure back to working order. We shall pave our own way to the final victory!"
 GGR_take_the_people_desc:0 "With the occupation of Western Russia now completed, we can start establishing a proper exploitation structure. All those who fought against us, and the ones who refused to submit even though they remained neutral, shall be enslaved to the master race and put into camps where they'll spend the rest of their lives toiling for the Reich and understanding the depth of their mistake.\n\nWith the new extraction and production facilities, our war machine will be unstoppable! The inferiors should find comfort in the fact that their sacrifice will serve to elevate the Reich to even higher reaches of power and might!"
 GGR_rebuild_the_aa_line_desc:0 "The Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line was the original target of Unternehmen Barbarossa. A line cutting Russia from North to South along the Volga river, it was to be extensively fortified and serve as a buffer against any attempt at either invading or bombing Germany from the East. However, due to the economy collapse in the Fifties, it was left almost undefended and subsequently lost to the Second Russian War. Even though we managed to repel the offensive, the border was redrawn nearer to Moskowien.\n\nWith our offensive triumphant, we can now reverse this shame! The A-A Line shall be rebuilt, a stalwart sentinel forever guarding Germania from her enemies! The first step is to rebuild the forts and trenches, a sufficient measure for now as the Russians don't possess the means to properly threaten complex fortification systems. In due time, we shall complete the work, and the line will stand for a thousand years!"
 GGR_eyes_to_the_steppes_desc:0 "The steppes of Central Asia are a potential source of problems. With their bandits and revanchist warlords, any Reichskommissariat we establish in Russia will suffer incursions and raids: the best solution is, of course, crushing these degenerates before they can pose any actual threat!\n\nBy relenting our offensive against Eastern Russia, and concentrating our efforts on the Central Asian warlords, we'll be able to resume our offensive without any hindrance coming from our exposed flank."
 GGR_man_vs_machine_desc:0 "Most of the steppe bandits rely on hit-and-run tactics, where cavalry forces, supported by few motorized units, strike at the enemy from the flanks or the rear, steal any useful loot, and then retreat before the foe can retaliate. This will prove to be a hindrance, and requires an adequate response.\n\nBy bolstering our mechanized corps, even our basic infantry will be far superior to anything they can throw at us! The nomads of the steppes have no mechanized forces, and even should they have any, they'll probably be a small percentage of their total army, which means they'll be mercilessly crushed by our technologically and numerically superior regiments!"
 GGR_torch_it_all_desc:0 "Central Asia is mostly worthless in the larger picture. Bereft of any meaningful industrial base or even resource wealth, it would be useless to waste men and reichsmarks to establish a proper garrison and administration.\n\nHowever, what we can do is to strip this useless land of anything worth reusing and relocating the machinery near Moskowien, where we'll be able to properly exploit it without the need for constant watch..."
 GGR_dont_look_back_desc:0 "With our duty done here, we can leave Central Asia without looking back. When the rest of Russia is properly dealt with, we'll return and establish a proper Reichskommissariat, but for now this land is best left on its own.\n\nIf we're lucky, the wretches will even kill each other on their own without any outside help! This would considerably speed up our plans to integrate the region..."
 GGR_finish_them_off_desc:0 "With most of Russia under our control, we can now launch the final offensive against the Siberian warlords! We need to be careful about the extreme weather and the logistics, but once we have prepared, our enemy will crumble easily.\n\nAfter all, Siberia is a depopulated region without any meaningful industrial development. Their army will melt like snow in front of the Wehrmacht, and their hopes will be crushed like brittle glass by the hammer of the Reich!"
 GGR_sow_the_seeds_desc:0 "With most of Russia under our control, the few, pitiful remnant are cowering in fear of our war machine, like the cowards they are! It's time to launch the last propaganda initiative, where we'll try to convince as many as possible to desert and either join our cause, or simply stand idle as the last vestiges of Bolshevism are utterly crushed.\n\nEven if they don't revolt against their commanders, every deserter is one less Russian to fight! Not that there are still many left ready to fight..."
 GGR_national_socialism_stands_triumphant_desc:0 "Siberia was home to several movement sympathizing with National Socialism. By defeating the last remnants of the Soviet Union, we have undoubtedly proved the superiority of our ideology compared to the corrupt scions of Marx and Engels!\n\nIf we play our cards right, we can motivate several such movements to join our cause. While they'll never be proper Aryans, they'll make fine collaborators when we integrate these lands into the great Reich..."
 GGR_drive_them_into_the_sea_desc:0 "The time for the final push has come! Our Panzerdivisionen shall rout the pitiful leftovers of the Russian warlords towards the ocean, where they won't have anywhere else to retreat! Let's see how many will be ready to jump into the sea and commit the ultimate sacrifice for their ideology!\n\nI have the suspicion that very, very few will. After all, Bolsheviks are known for their cowardice..."
 GGR_threaten_the_japanese_desc:0 "With our recent expansion, we have come to border the Japanese in the east. Our former allies might protest, and ask for their former possession back - after all, when they ceded it to the Russians they didn't expect us to conquer it - but now it's too late to ask for its return!\n\nAll of Russia has been conquered by the German might, and no one will stand against it! Perhaps stationing a couple nuclear missiles near the border will keep the Japanese in check, so that they don't go ahead of themselves, won't it?"
 GGR_the_end_of_the_rus_desc:0 "Victory at last! With the complete conquest of Russia, the German Reich proves once more its might against those who once dared to stand defiant before the glory of the eagle and the swastika! The Russian people is no more, either assimilated, enslaved or driven into the wilderness to fight like the rats they are!\n\nA grand triumph shall be held in Germania! All the military leaders shall be present alongside the Führer for this momentous occasion, where the power of the Reich shall be exposed for all to see! Heil das Reich! Heil Germania! Heil Göring!"

GGR_review_the_fleet:0 "해군 재검토"
GGR_review_the_fleet_desc:0 "Once upon a time, before Hitler had even joined the National Socialist movement, the Kaiserliche Marine was the pride of Germany, and the envy of the world. Indeed, it was so powerful that the weak, pitiful west forced us to dismantle it after the shame of the Great War, for fear of us returning to greatness. Of course, this did not stop us from rebuilding our fleet in the glory days of the Reich, restoring the Kriegsmarine to heights unseen by even the Empire. By the end of the Second World War, the German fleet was among the strongest on earth, with the masses of U-Boat wolfpacks becoming the bane of our enemies and the surface fleet, backed by the power of our battleships, spreading fear across those who opposed us. For a time, it seemed, the old imperial dream of naval dominance could be achieved.\n\nHowever, as of late, the Kriegsmarine has been, if not treading water, sliding backwards in its ability. The ships and submarines rust in their harbors, underfunded and undercrewed. The Kriegsmarine in general has become the black sheep of the Heer, constantly overlooked in favor of the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht's needs. Nowadays, the Kriegsmarine is in a state of disrepair, slowly decaying. This cannot stand, especially with some of the Führer's more grandiose plans requiring a strong navy to succeed.\n\nTwo schools of thought have emerged in the Admiralty, each butting against each other in a constant battle. The first school emphasizes the need for battleships in the modern age, arguing that with simple renovations and fixes, the sheer power a battleship brings would dominate both the American and Japanese fleets. The second school pushes heavily to scrap our old battleships, instead pivoting into the new world of carrier-based doctrine.\n\nThe decision falls to Göring now, who must decide- shall the old, tried and tested battleship prevail, or will it fall to the modern competition of the aircraft carrier?"

While this choice is certainly a controversial one among the old guard of the Kriegsmarine, it is certainly a necessary one- what use is a battleship if it can't even see its target?\n\nThe restructuring of the Kriegsmarine is set to begin immediately, starting with the renovation of the battleships. The process to gut the old kings of the sea, painful as it is, must be begun now. That way, with both the weight of maintenance and the profits of the scrap, we can begin production on our new line of carriers, and make a tidy profit in the end. Though this process will strike deep at the heart of any true German patriot, it must be begun now, or else we will find ourselves unready and unable to fight when the time comes."

While this plan does not try to save the battleships in their current forms, what it proposes is almost as shocking and daring as the original change.\n\nThe plan, obviously refined and rewritten multiple times, details the potential opportunity we currently have to refit our battleships into carriers, instead of scrapping the old hulks and building new ships. While the process of converting our battleships into carriers is certainly a costly one, the plan emphasizes both the practical and overall benefits of such a change. Practically, the plan will allow us to keep some of the old hulls around as bases to new carriers, instead of being forced to fully scrap each of our relics. Overall, these retrofits would give us the necessary experience needed to build full carriers.\n\nWhile scrapping the battleships is certainly the more economical choice, the possibility of repurposing our old prides of the fleet into a modern day wonder of Germany has captivated the Führer. With the flick of his pen and a word to his advisors, the plan has changed, and those battleships that once seemed to be reaching the end of the line have been granted a new lease on life."

In such a situation, it seems the risk is just too great.\n\nTherefore, as painful as it is, we will have to dismantle and scrap some of the Kriegsmarine's greatest ships. Though we have tried to save and restore them, it seems that the years of neglect and disrepair have taken their toll. Even now, scrapping ships take the first sections of these kings of the sea apart, tearing old traditions away piece by piece.\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, however, and the silver lining in this particular cloud is quite comforting. The steel we scrap from the oldest battleships can be remade into the hulls and sections of our new carriers.

Whatever one's opinion is on the plan in the Kriegsmarine, the only important opinion on the matter is the Führer's, and he is firmly in favor.\n\nAs Göring bluntly states, the only way to defeat such superpowers as America and Japan is to defeat their navies on the open seas, and a modern Plan Z would give the Kriegsmarine the ability to do just that. As Hitler worked so tirelessly to defeat the Royal Navy, so shall we work tirelessly to defeat the Americans and Japanese.

Instead, our fleet shall renovate our battleships into the modern age, adding the improvements of the modern age to our behemoths.

Our fleets are nearly impenetrable. Our cruisers can shatter any skirmishing force, our capital ships can single handedly level fleets and cities alike, and our crews are the best in the world. With such power at our disposal, one has to wonder what a nation could do to resist such an overwhelming force. Indeed, it seems at this point, only a nuclear strike could destroy our ships.\n\nWhatever the Japanese and Americans decide on doing, it's clear that the Kriegsmarine is the new king of the seas.

Perhaps some of their generals will even cross over, grinding their war effort to a halt. The thought of Himmler vexed as everyone deserts him is enough to make the Führer laugh even during wartime.

It was in that campaign after when geniuses of the skill of Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian proved with amazing success the power of inter-branch coordination.

In came a group of four men who looked far more suited in overalls and straw hats than the suits they were wearing. As soon as they laid eyes on Göring, they made the faces of children in a candy shop or of men facing their reckoning with God. Hell, they were probably resisting the temptation to kneel on the floor and grovel. Their leader, Robert Williams, said nervously, "Mein Führer, it is the greatest honour of our lives to meet you."\n Göring nonchalantly flicked the cigarette ashes on his desk. He was not paying these strange men much attention. "Oh? Oh, yes, of course. It's my pleasure." The two military men beside Göring give him a look that was more exasperated than angry, as they were used to and perfectly happy with their supposed leader's apathy and numbness by this point.\nRemer got straight to business. "Gentlemen, you have certain paramilitary organizations who might be willing to support our cause against your degenerate government, correct?"\n "Yessir!" Replied the second-in-command Gordon Mohr. "The Christian Patriots Defense League is at your disposal."\n "Sure... Excellent. Let us discuss some plans we have for the assassination of the US president," said Remer, who was effectively controlling the meeting by now. These were some of the most eccentric men any of the three Germans had ever seen, but there was no harm in getting them to do some dirty work for the Reich if they were so eager to help.\n At the end of the meeting, Mohr humbly asked, "Mein Führer, if I may make one small request of you. I have a letter from one of our fellow sympathizers, Father Charles Coughlin that he has asked I give to you to read. It would be another wonderful honour."\n "Of course," replied a distant Göring, almost forgetting to reach out and take the letter. "I will gladly read it.""

Sadly, most of the suspects were killed in the pursuit, and nothing was found on the bodies"\n\nMost people in the room, including [GetName], knew that the madman in Germania had something to do with it, but without proof there was nothing to be done about it.

How to spend it had never been in question; the Staatsoper Germania had premiered a new run of Weber's Der Freischutz, and the Führer was determined to attend the show come Hell or high water. Why, even if Schörner were to barge in and announce that they had entered into war with America or Japan, Göring would not be dissuaded. He needed this as a man in a desert needs water.\n\nBundled up in multiple layers for disguise and accompanied only by the most discrete and trusted of his personal guard, the man who ruled over all of Europe and much of Asia and Africa did not look the part. He was careful to avoid the gazes of any of the other opera goers, as even with all of his efforts to disguise he was still the most known man in the Reich, if not the world. After a few stressful encounters necessary to procure his seat, Göring was finally able to take a place in the most prestigious of the viewing boxes. Now all that was left was to relax, and immerse himself in the show.\n\nThat was his plan at any rate, but it was not destined to be. The performance, as expected of the renowned theater, was as terrific as Göring could ever remember it being; its quality was not what haunted his mind as the lines of "O diese Sonne" ran through his head. No, it was the dawning realization on the part of the Führer that he, for all his power and prestige, was in no better a situation than young Max. Those damned militarists, Schörner, Remer, and the rest, they were the demonic Zamiel who had given him the magic bullets that had granted him such success. When, the thought flashed into his mind, would it come time for the seventh bullet to be fired? And what would be its terrible price? He shuddered silently as unbidden images of hellfire and death presented themselves to him in an inescapable montage of doom. The magic of the night was gone, and the Führer collapsed into a deep sense of fear as he heard the chorus utter the line that had always been able to move him before, only now in quite a different sense."

Even the most stupid, recalcitrant of races would naturally learn a thing or two about fighting there after such a long time. Though serious construction efforts might be hampered by the terrain, an effort must be made to reinforce strategic chokepoints with bunkers and set up both anti-air batteries and radar stations on hilltops.

Despite our numerical superiority and extraordinary discipline, no German soldier can hope to survive his boat sinking a kilometer out to sea, or topple a cliffside bunker with his bare hands. Instead of attempting to overwhelm the defenders with wave after wave of assault boats, we must ensure our men are as prepared as they can be. The Kriegsmarine, likewise, will need to bring every gun they have to bear on the shores of Kleinasien to save as many German lives as possible.

Syria's industry is further afield, but still an easy target provided that our bombers are able to cross Anatolia unscathed. We predict that Turkey has little enough industry that a bombing campaign of only a few days should see their arms production grind to a halt.

The generals warn of caution, however; the mountain ranges and narrow passes will largely negate our numerical advantage, forcing us to rely on more focused breakthrough forces or find some way to circumvent such obstacles. Despite their origin in the barbarous steppes of Central Asia, the Turks are a mountain people through and through; we must be wary of any tricks they might have picked up in the past few centuries. This is relatively unfamiliar territory for the Wehrmacht, and the Luftwaffe's ability to provide air support will be stymied. Thorough planning and discipline will be of the utmost importance in this campaign."

Every soldier worth his salt recognises the importance of logistics and proper use of available supplies. That said, the Caucasus mountains are filled with extremely tight bottlenecks, and there are plenty of places where supplies might be misplaced or stolen by mountain-dwelling partisans. It might be worth focusing our plans proper maintenance of supply lines, and on maximizing the use that our men get out of their supplies.

They are some of the toughest, hardest and most elite troops in the world; they faced down tremendous odds in some of the harshest battles of the Second World War, and lived to establish their legend. We have just the right targets in mind: beyond the Caucasus, there are relatively flat areas in Armenia and along the coastline, where they could be dropped in significant numbers along with enough supplies and heavy weapons to hold out until the rest of our forces push through the mountains.

We know that no matter what we do, crossing the Caucasus will be a bloody affair; maybe we should just bite the bullet and accept our casualty estimates as they are. When confronted with the possible damage to morale the troops might suffer, the same generals who suggested this strategy noted our massive reserves of Pervitin, a combat stimulant left over from the last war. Pervitin helped many pilots, tankists and Panzergrenadiers through weeks of tough fighting, keeping them sharp and awake for days on end.

Despite the difficult fight ahead, spirits are high, particularly among our Austrian troops who long to settle the historical rivalry with the Turks once and for all.

We, as the defenders of Europe - and those foreign peoples with old ties to Europe - declare that the autonomy of the Syrians will be enshrined in our war goals for Operation Gertrud.

True, they might regard our own nation as a land of heathen devilry, but they are so distant and radical that they could never pose a threat to a superpower like the Reich. Funding radical militants who wish to see the end of the Turkish state and a return to tradition would serve us well; far removed from the borders of Germany, they will never be a problem in the future. These groups are savage, bloodthirsty and obsessively puritanical, imbuing them with a fighting spirit that compensates for their disadvantages against the Turks.

As such, Kleinasien is not to be treated as a defeated nation, but as a militarized zone permanently occupied by our troops; maintaining order will be difficult there, but a thorough beating should put an end to any ambitions of Turkish independence.

More divisions can be shipped across the Bosphorus as needed, but the nature of Kleinasien also necessitates the construction of better infrastructure; the Turks have done a poor job of modernizing their nation in the past few decades.

Still, their fear can be exploited; with the strength of the Wehrmacht on full display during Operation Gertrud, their meager military must be quivering in their collective boots!

Now that we have a border with Italy's possessions, we should move a number of divisions into the area to conduct open exercises, aggressive aerial patrols and general displays of force.

Now, with the Reich stronger than ever and the Wehrmacht pushed to its very limits, he plots against his commander-in-chief and thereby the entirety of the German people. Should he succeed in overthrowing our government, the Reich will surely be plunged into an abyss from which it will never escape - a deathtrap of deranged militarism and senseless violence.\n\nGöring must rise to the challenge one last time. For the Reich and its glorious conquests to be secured in perpetuity, the Monster in Uniform must be destroyed along with each and every deviant traitor who would follow him."
 GGR_donitz_shadow_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine, even after being brought to heel, was never a friend to Göring. Grand Admiral Dönitz's shadow still hangs over our great fleet, tainting it with Bormannite conservatism. While the Führer now finds himself facing his own erstwhile militarist allies, there are still far too many questions about the political nature of the Kriegsmarine's leadership. It is unlikely that Schörner has brought any of them into his camp, but if their loyalty is not secured they might choose to remain neutral in the power struggle, just as they did during the Bürgerkrieg. Still, if the Führer can demonstrate the validity of his new, dynamic form of National Socialist conservatism, they might be reined in and their mighty guns directed to his benefit."
 GGR_can_we_trust_the_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The Führer must have his navy on-side to maintain German power projection and overseas capabilities, no matter what comes. Quiet negotiations shall begin; the Abwehr will be dispatched to probe the officer corps for any Schörnerite presence or plans of disloyal neutrality. Their loyalty is easily worth whatever paltry concessions they might demand of the Führer in exchange for deeper political cooperation. Once their political position is ascertained, our strategy for handling them can be adjusted accordingly. They certainly can't be any harder to manage than the militarists ever were."
 GGR_find_the_trustworthy_desc:0 "The struggle between the Führer and his treasonous field marshal is not yet common knowledge outside the shadowed halls of the Reich Chancellery. The average German on the street knows nothing of the coming storm, and the Kriegsmarine, always at sea, knows even less. Of course, this is precisely how the Führer would have it; the fewer individuals are compromised with knowledge of the divide in the Reich's leadership, the better. Care must be taken in our present dealings with the Kriegsmarine so that they learn nothing more than they must. Only those few reliable admirals with a vested interest in Göring's success should be brought on board."
 GGR_we_know_who_we_can_trust_desc:0 "Namely, not the Kriegsmarine. During the Bürgerkrieg, they fled to Crimea, showing that the only colors they flew were their own. They might have professed loyalty to the Reich above all else, but how could we ever believe that excuse when Göring was clearly the only legitimate Führer in the first place? The Kriegsmarine has been insubordinate for years, dithering at every order and not even bothering to maintain the correct political standards for its leadership. The only appropriate solution is to cut out this cancer infecting the Reich - purge the ranks, from the admiralty down to the lowliest e-boat crew! They will be of little use against Schörner anyway, so who will miss those sea-rats?"
 GGR_an_airforce_with_a_navy_desc:0 "Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine will always be secondary to the Heer and the illustrious Luftwaffe. With the old guard and unreliable crews purged, we should begin the long-overdue process of reforming our naval command to correctly represent its position. We have had quite enough of salt-worn old men and disloyal, drunk sailors. Naturally, the most logical choice here is to put men who have experience in combat, organization and administration in charge, but there is currently a dearth of skilled seamen for some reason. Thankfully, the Führer knows plenty of talented and politically reliable men in the Luftwaffe who are due for promotions! These men will form a new board to replace the admiralty and ensure the swift reorganization and - more importantly - loyalty of our reborn Kriegsmarine."
 GGR_revive_the_freikorps_desc:0 "The Freikorps - nearly five decades have passed since their glory days, but the saviors of the Reich live on in the German cultural consciousness. Their victories over communism and the Jewry were forever immortalized by Hitler, and their deeds remain the bedrock of our National Socialist traditions. Freikorps membership, or descent from a Freikorps veteran, remains a marker of prestige in our society. None would question us, therefore, if we were to announce the reformation and formalization of this old paramilitary. To ordinary citizens, it would appear perfectly innocuous - a means by which to prepare as many people as possible for war and allow old soldiers to maintain their martial pride. To the Führer, however, it will be the largest and most well-trained militia force in history: a personal paramilitary at his beck and call. Our enemies will quake at our numbers, should further strife come!"
 GGR_arms_under_the_table_desc:0 "Strictly speaking, the Reich has a vested interest in keeping the capacity for violence among the populace at a low level. These are dire times, however, and the new Freikorps cannot afford to be bound by the same laws and regulations as civil organizations. Anything not being directed to the Wehrmacht should be funnelled to the militia; guns, grenades, trucks, even light vehicles and helicopters if possible! They must be a true fighting force, able to hold their own against anything the enemy might throw at them. Every militia fighter must be the equal of a hardened grenadier!"
 GGR_the_unsullied_service_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, Göring's pride and joy, has always been loyal to him and always will be. He is their glorious father and their favorite son, marshal and veteran both. Schörner could never taint this branch of the military, the pinnacle of Aryan martial might! Organizing them for a possible conflict with the militarists will therefore be a simple matter - Göring speaks, and they obey. Air wings shall be recalled, Air Landing divisions put on standby and Fallschirmjäger roused from barracks. While loyalists in the other branches will undoubtedly have a role to play, it is the knights of the sky who will bring us final victory."
 GGR_protect_the_bases_desc:0 "Knowing that he could never sway them, it is likely that Schörner will instead try to sabotage the Luftwaffe by any means possible. Naturally for such a brutish man, his first choice will be to attack vulnerable bases and hangars, probably with commando units or bribed turncoats. Security at all key Luftwaffe facilities must be increased dramatically. It couldn't hurt to have better-armed units up to and including Panzer companies guarding them. Furthermore, security checks must be tightened up and base personnel monitored closely. Even a single broken link in the chain could have severe consequences for our beloved aviators."
 GGR_mark_targets_in_advance_desc:0 "Schörner has not yet begun to move against us openly, so there is no risk in scouting 'his' territory. It will be obvious to his clique what our reconnaissance aircraft are up to over their Reichskommissariats, but they wouldn't dare turn them back. While we do not expect Schörner to possess a significant air force of his own, the Abwehr has confirmed that he has been devising an answer to the Luftwaffe. His allies also possess large numbers of older aircraft, ostensibly to maintain control over their airspace. It is imperative that we find this mockery of the Luftwaffe wherever it hides and wipe it out the moment Schörner makes his bid for power."
 GGR_move_against_schorner_desc:0 "All possible preparations have been made and enough loyalties have been secured. With the more practical concerns taken care of, we have some administrative reorganization to do. Schörner's clique is deeply entrenched in OKW and in several important Reichskommissariats, which simply cannot continue. We must clear his toadies out of their positions and replace them with more loyal and controllable men of the Führer's own choosing. Schörner will push back against this as soon as he hears of it, but if we move quickly enough we should be able to completely displace his clique before he is prepared for open conflict."
 GGR_replace_the_field_marshal_desc:0 "Schörner once served ably, but no longer. Having lived through both World Wars, the West Russian War and all of the Reich's subsequent conquests, he is getting old and tired. Surely, the old warrior deserves peaceful semi-retirement in a quiet, less stressful role. Reichskommissariat Kamtschatka, perhaps? The Führer is certain that his old friend will be most grateful to have fewer commitments - and to be very, very, very far away from Germania. It's such a stressful place to live, after all."
 GGR_the_afrikajager_desc:0 "Siegfried Müller is incompetent, corrupt, treasonous and possibly the most pathetic excuse for a Reichskommissar in the entire Reich. His oversight of Zentralafrika turned out to be a complete sham and it is only by the Führer's mercy that he yet lives. However, his apparently undesirable traits also make him pliable and easy to control. He can be appeased with material wealth, has no grand ambitions, and his incompetence can be compensated for by delegating his duties. Müller is likely to be the worst Field Marshal the Reich will ever have, but he will certainly be the most useful."
 GGR_the_berliner_ratte_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is no friend of Göring, but he is easily the most competent candidate for the position of Field Marshal. With a long record of service and a reputation for honest patriotism, Speidel is immensely popular amongst both the populace and the Heer. Merely promoting him to the position of Field Marshal would be seen as a supremely wise and generous act, and could bring many militarists to heel. However, he might prove to be more trouble than he's worth; Speidel is a vocal critic of militarism and the Abwehr reports that he has always privately opposed the further expansion of German territory. He may not even be any more loyal than Schörner, in the end. That said, perhaps his principles will win out over his political opposition to Göring, and he will restrain himself appropriately."
 GGR_nepotism_desc:0 "Frankly, Göring has had enough of self-proclaimed 'suitable candidates'. All these ambitious, self-serving men squabbling to take Schörner's place - what good are they, really? How can any of them ever be trusted to abide by the Führer's directives? Any one of them could be another Schörner in waiting, another traitor seeking to stake his claim on the Führership! No, we need a good man, someone we can trust, someone who will neither challenge the Führer's right to rule or attempt to rock the boat.\n\nSomeone like... Theodore Göring, beloved nephew of the Führer! Under-qualified? Perhaps, but also reliable. Besides, who's to say he won't learn on the job?"
 GGR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "At last! We had our doubts - our fears, even - that Schörner would not go quietly, that he would go to any lengths to dominate the Reich. The eruption of a second Bürgerkrieg seemed inevitable as the Field Marshal gathered his forces and rallied countless traitors to his banner. Those few enemies of the Reich who remain no doubt waited with bated breath to see our mighty empire fall to infighting once more.\n\nAnd yet, their dreams will never be realised. The treasonous Field Marshal has been unseated from his office and stripped of any capacity to wage war upon us, all without firing a shot! Relegated to the furthest reaches of Siberia and with his allies bought, bullied or broken, the monster in uniform will never again threaten the Führer's rightful mandate. Heil Göring!"
 GGR_test_their_loyalty_desc:0 "Since assuming power, the Führer has seen many new generals commissioned. The cream of the Reich's officer corps, these young men are all seasoned veterans of our many conquests, having learned as much on the battlefield as in the academies. Their loyalties remain undecided, likely due to their preoccupation leaving little time for politicking. Now, however, with Schörner's clique working to shore up their strength, the young generals have become a target for militarist intrigue. The traitor will surely attempt to bring them into his camp by any means necessary. We have to sway them before he has the chance - by hook, or by crook!"
 GGR_incentivize_the_new_guard_desc:0 "Despite their claims to be proud, principled men in the Prussian tradition, many of our new generals are anything but. Part of it is simply the nature of power; money is ultimately merely another means by which to acquire it. In that regard, it is no less effective a currency than blood. Those younger generals who are not yet wholly loyal to either Schörner or the Führer could be easily swayed in the latter's favour by the sweet allure of higher salaries and pensions, or even 'gifts' straight from his own purse. Making someone's life a little easier rarely goes unappreciated, after all..."

They aren't content unless they're enjoying fine dining every night, cavorting with half a dozen high-class ladies and zooming around in the latest Mercedes sports cars. Though the older officers shake their heads and rant about the days of austerity under Hitler, the Führer understands the wants and needs of this new and talented generation of leaders. If they require even greater rewards to be satisfied, so be it. Fast cars, country estates, wine from the Führer's own cellar - whatever it takes, they must be loyal to us!"
 GGR_an_abundance_of_medals_desc:0 "The downside to being a newly-minted general these days is the unfortunate shortage of medals one can wear. Back in the days of the Empire, every general worth his salt would be absolutely festooned with medals and his uniform decorated with gold filigree. Only a few trembling old men can still boast such a grand panoply, and the younger generation of officers feel that they are unfairly compared to the old Prussian officer corps. In his generosity, the Führer has proclaimed that he will restore this proud aesthetic tradition. Henceforth, all deserving generals will have however many pieces of gold, silver and silk to decorate their uniforms as they feel is necessary - all that is necessary is for them to swear eternal allegiance to the one true Führer, Hermann Göring. For one's glory to be so resplendent, is that so high a price?"
 GGR_we_know_where_you_live_desc:0 "Gold, jewelry and fine wine? Who do these upstart generals think they are, middle-aged bourgeoise housewives? The true German officer needs no incentive beyond patriotism! If he cannot find it within himself to devote the entirety of his being to the Reich, then perhaps he needs a little reminder of what is at stake! There will be no tolerance for preening, vainglorious children within the Wehrmacht's command structure; they will serve because the Führer demands it! All suspect officers will be closely monitored by the Gestapo, and any cowardice, corruption or disloyalty duly punished by the most severe means possible!"
 GGR_and_youre_families_desc:0 "Some young officers think themselves brave. With their egos bloated by their rank and rewards, they believe that they are above discipline and loyalty. Not even the harshest threats to their livelihoods are taken seriously, perhaps due to our historically lax attitude towards officer autonomy under the militarists. They will soon learn that Göring is not Schörner - he does not tolerate his subordinates living corrupt lives as petty kings of their divisions. If threatening their persons is insufficient, perhaps their families should become involved in present matters. After all, isn't family the core of Aryan values?"
 GGR_never_look_the_other_way_desc:0 "Though we have always tried to be merciful to the lesser races of the world, it is an unfortunate reality that many are as recalcitrant children who refuse to acknowledge their betters. Well, as the saying goes: "Spare the rod, spoil the child." We have been tolerant up to this point, but recently some of our subject peoples have been far too uncooperative - even violent. We cannot show weakness in this crucial time; we must discipline these ungrateful savages with bullet and bayonet! Some might balk at this task, but there are a number of officers in the Schörnerite tradition who will follow any order, no matter how harsh or - in the eyes of weak foreigners - inhumane."

A number of our best officers, once thought loyal and true paragons of the Reich, have been directly implicated in horrific war crimes against non-Aryan populations! That something like this could have happened on Schörner's watch is unthinkable - how could any good, honest German ever succumb to such violence and depravity? State media will make this outrage known to the whole Reich, and the guilty parties arrested and brought to trial immediately! National Socialism does not permit acts of senseless brutality and genocide, and nor will the Führer!"
 GGR_reward_faithful_service_desc:0 "Many of the Führer's closest followers have been with him for decades. These officers have proven their loyalty time and time again, supporting him in the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg and beyond. The bravest and truest of Germany's soldiers, their time to be justly rewarded has finally come. Medals and financial benefits are not enough - these men simply must have their own Reichskommissariats! Is there any more comfortable and well-deserved retirement than to manage one of our prosperous and hard-won colonies?"
 GGR_governor_generals_desc:0 "There was a lot of debate within the Führer's cabinet about where to send our new Reichskommissars. After all, we have already allocated all of our conquests to RKs, or annexed them into the Reich. Then, a stroke of genius struck the Führer: Central Asia! It remains one of the most ill-managed and rebellious areas in the greater Reich, probably due to the overstretched and weary administration. The logical solution to the problem is, naturally, to divide the region into four new Reichskommissariats, thereby killing two birds with one stone; the administrative issues will be solved, and our generals will have their promised fiefdoms far, far away from Germania."
 GGR_wandering_minds_desc:0 "The Führer has been notified of an unfortunate occurrence in our logistics department: the new Reichskommissars report that their troops are severely under-equipped! This is truly a tragedy, but how could it have happened? All the paperwork on Germania's end show that the required equipment was shipped out on schedule. Perhaps there was some error, or the trains delivered their cargo to the wrong place? Well, never mind. This will soon be resolved - the Führer himself has pledged to oversee all future deliveries of equipment to Central Asia personally! Our men can rest easy knowing that he's on the job!"

 GGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Treason without compare has struck the Reich once more - we are again engulfed in civil war! The traitor Hans Speidel has risen up in rebellion, and the former Field Marshal, Ferdinand Schörner, has established himself as a rival claimant to the Führership! We have come so far, conquered so much in the name of National Socialism and the Aryan race; we cannot afford to fail now!\n\nOur great Führer has led us through trials to eclipse even the World Wars! He has defeated fleets of thousands - crushed rock and metal and bone beneath the grinding treads of the Wehrmacht! His reign will not end this way, not at their hands! The world he has built will endure for a thousand years! Sieg heil!"
 GGR_the_key_to_victory_desc:0 "Schörner might have his conscript hordes, but we are the sole bearers of the Germanic martial tradition. No violent thug pressed into service and armed with a rifle produced in some god-forsaken Reichskommissariat can hope to match a true son of Germany. We will demonstrate to the world once and for all that German steel, backed by German discipline, is the finest in the world! Only ensuring the continuation of our tradition of high-quality soldiers and equipment will keep us safe from the tide of treachery rising around us."
 GGR_is_on_the_workfloor_desc:0 "German industry remains unrivalled, and we must keep it that way to secure victory! Our factories are filled with strong, dedicated working men, but they slacken and grow restless as word of the war reaches them - this is unacceptable! The bosses must drive them to work harder than ever before, for every bullet that arrives too late could see another valiant soldier of the Reich murdered by the traitors. Failure to dedicate one's entire heart and soul to work in this crucial time is tantamount to desertion, and will be punished as such!"
 GGR_supplies_from_ukraine_desc:0 "An unfortunate but unavoidable side-effect of the Reich's recent expansion is the stretching of our supply lines and the shortage of vital resources accompanying it. The traitors have access to all the industry and resources within the lands they illegally hold, including those which are central to the war effort! Thankfully, with Ukraine secured for the rightful Führer, its vast supplies of oil, steel and grain remain available to us - a very useful thing indeed, with our lands once again riven by war. The Balkans remain secure and difficult for any invader to take, so our eastern supply lines will be redirected to travel through that region alone. We cannot afford further shortages now."
 GGR_is_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Our soldiers have fought long and hard, many for years on end. Still, we must demand one more great effort from the Heer. No matter how many officers and spoilt, ungrateful grunts have defected, the truest and noblest of the Grenadiers remain at our side. It is they who shall carry us to victory, and all possible measures must be taken to maximize their potential. Whether that is wages to keep them loyal, food to keep them happy or Pervitin to keep them awake and active, the loyal soldiery will have what they require, and give their all in thanks to the Führer! In this hour, no alternative to absolute dedication is permissible."
 GGR_soldiers_from_the_balkans_desc:0 "The Balkan Garrison is the hard core of the Wehrmacht. Cornwall might have been the best posting, but no amount of watching over shepherds and fishermen could make that garrison the match of the Balkan men! Those grizzled veterans have been fighting a ceaseless guerilla war against rebellious subhumans and Bolshevik partisans for nearly thirty years. More importantly, they have remained at arm's length from the political intrigues of Germania; they are a strictly loyal and obedient force of soldiers and airmen at the Führer's beck and call. It's a good thing that we have subdued all major partisan groups in the region, for men such as they are needed more now than ever. They will be recalled to the Reich and placed directly on the frontlines - the traitors will have a nasty surprise waiting for them if they expected green conscripts!"
 GGR_no_more_militarists_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the traitor Speidel has been a frequent topic of discussion within OKW. The answer, of course, is obvious: no talks with turncoats! The Führer recognizes that no military man ambitious enough to take independent action can ever be trusted. As though the simple act of treason were not bad enough, Speidel is an infamous crypto-Speerite who has time and again questioned the core tenets of National Socialism! Some say he even refuses to accept our deserved right to rule over the lesser races of the world! We will crush this German Judas and all who follow him, as we would any other enemy of the Fatherland!"
 GGR_talk_to_the_rat_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is a traitor, but he is nowhere near as dangerous as Schörner. Speerism is all but dead; he represents no ideological threat to us, only a minor strategic one. Perhaps his apolitical nature and dedication to the preservation of German lives can be turned to our advantage. Schörner represents a threat not only to our new order, but also to the Reich itself - his deranged ambition would see countless millions thrown into the meat grinder for no tangible gain whatsoever! Speidel is not a strong-willed man, and an appeal of equal parts reason and logic might sway him to at least refrain from attacking us and focus his forces on Schörner instead. We can ill afford a war on three fronts, after all..."
 GGR_drive_out_the_villains_desc:0 "The presence of traitors' feet on German soil is a grave insult to the honor of our race and nation. With every day that passes, more gullible fools flock to their banners, spreading the twin poisons of militarism and pacifism. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formulation and execution of a plan to push the renegades out of the Fatherland itself. This will be a legendary cleansing, the likes of which have not been seen since the Bürgerkrieg, to purify Germany of its ills and carve in history the eternal glory and righteousness of our one true Führer! No mercy will be shown to the bearers of this rot and decay, who threaten the very foundations of our world!"
 GGR_germany_under_one_banner_desc:0 "Our situation remains precarious, but the worst of the fires have been extinguished as the traitors have been driven from the Reich proper. Our forces have completely secured the German heartlands and are now busying themselves with mopping up the last holdouts and partisan cells. Speidel and Schörner have fled like the cowards they are, but their forces are already rallying in the Reichskommissariats aligned to their respective sides. Owing to the breadth of our conquests and the chronic disloyalty of the various Reichskommissars, they remain in possession of a great deal of land, resources and manpower. The fight must be taken beyond Germany, but it will be a long, hard road to victory from here on out."
 GGR_use_the_slaves_desc:0 "What is a slave but a machine made of meat, to be used and discarded as its master wishes? Even with our healthy surplus, we have historically placed too much value on the lives and wellbeing of slaves, thinking of them as a precious commodity - this lax attitude ends now! They are a resource to be spent as necessary, and there is no shortage of cheap fuel for war's furnace these days. We must purge the last vestiges of sympathy for these subhumans from our society and put them to maximum possible use; no more breaks, sleep, food or even water unless they prove their particular value. For every fleshy machine that breaks down, there are millions more available to replace it, so why fret over a few more bodies committed to the crematoriums every day?"
 GGR_punish_the_deserters_desc:0 "As the war rages on, the chaff separates from the wheat. Accounts reach us of entire battalions defecting, refusing to follow orders or even retreating without permission. The snake Schörner has always been right about one thing, at least - acts of supreme cowardice cannot be tolerated. Harsh punishments for deserters have been the norm for decades, but with the very existence of the Reich on the line, all disciplinary efforts must be redoubled! If a thousand must die to push a million forward, then so be it! Anyone who refuses to serve in combat will serve on the firing line!"
 GGR_harsher_quotas_desc:0 "Even citizen and volunteer workers continually fail to meet our requirements and expectations! It is shocking and disgraceful to see this kind of unpatriotic laziness in vital war industries, especially considering the stakes of the current conflict. Henceforth, proper military discipline will be employed in all industries, and quotas raised to the necessary levels. For a working man to give anything less than the entirety of his being to the national effort is just as treasonous as siding with the enemy! We'll instate 18-hour working days if we have to; nothing less than total militarization of the factories will bring us victory!"
 GGR_attack_the_pacifists_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of human nature that the common people never really want war. More often than not, they merely lust for the idea of crushing and dominating their nation's enemies. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? However, it is not the soft-hearted masses that dictate policy, but the Führer! The weakling pacifists infesting the Reich's heartland are as much a threat to the morale of our nation as deserters and cowards - thankfully, there is an easy way to turn the people against them and bring the populace to the Führer's bidding. All we need do is remind the people of this war's true stakes, which will expose the pacifists' lack of patriotism and endangerment of the nation. This has never failed us before, and once carried out will ensure that nobody will complain when those treasonous scum are dragged from their houses and shot as the cowards they are."
 GGR_men_on_the_frontlines_desc:0 "What do we even have men in the factories for? What value does a man truly hold if he will not don a helmet and carry a rifle into combat for the sake of his country? We face a life or death struggle for the future of the Reich - now is the hour for each and every true Aryan man to live up to the standards envisioned by the great Hitler! We need everyone to fight this war - from every floor of every factory in every Gau! Any who refuse to down their ploughshares for swords will be considered traitors to the cause and dealt with appropriately!"
 GGR_women_in_the_factories_desc:0 "The Aryan-Feminists bleated for years about wanting the opportunity to work in factories like their husbands; now, they shall have it. With the men shipped off to more suitable occupations, we have a skilled labor shortage that slaves cannot fulfil. True, these women are lacking in experience and the strength of soul that makes men superior workers, but this is Judgement Day for the Reich! Extreme measures must be taken at home just as readily as on the frontlines, and if that includes violating sacrosanct gender roles, then so be it."
 GGR_pows_in_the_camps_desc:0 "All these captured traitors are languishing in POW camps, eating our bread and occupying our guards. That bread should be going to the troops, those guards should be fighting for the Reich, and those prisoners should be making themselves useful! If they would claim to be the true sons of Germany, then let them try and prove it in the work camps! Perhaps their claims will be verified, or maybe they will redeem themselves through back-breaking labor - "Work will set you free", after all. While we're at it, perhaps the numerous civilians who have yet to prove their worth should be... redefined. Redefined as Schörnerite spies, for instance, rather than mere cowards and slackers."

 GGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "Once more, the Reich has fallen into chaos. Göring may have been our preferred stalking horse in the Reichstag but his gluttony and incompetence have cost us dearly. His economic mismanagement has sunk the Reich to a new low, his flamboyance and extravagance emptying its coffers and putting its slaves into open revolt. The German people have been infected with his laziness, his femininity, and his cowardice. Fortunately there is no character so low that righteous war cannot rectify it."
 GGR_stand_for_your_fatherland_desc:0 "Most of our citizens have sat idle these past few years, content to let slaves do the work. The Wehrmacht has become the only constant, always requiring more men to maintain the balance of our empire. It is vital that the people understand the importance of what we do, that they join us in our purging of the rot that has corrupted the Reich. Goebbels may be long dead but his lessons hold true - the people must be galvanised by propaganda. Let the posters and banners fly. It is better they make the choice to enlist on their own. It lets them think they still have a choice."
 GGR_war_in_the_factories_desc:0 "This is a total war. Goebbels understood the value of making the war felt by everyone, from the front lines to the fields to the factories. We must ensure our workers know the importance of their labour, and redouble their efforts to produce arms for the fatherland. The factory floor will be reorganised into a home front, with clear ranks established for every worker. Work squads will be directed at their tasks by floor sergeants, and every task will be timed down to the minute, ensuring when a mistake is made it will not be made again. When we are done, the production line will be indistinguishable from the front line."
 GGR_war_in_the_fields_desc:0 "Out here in the fields, you fight for your meals. All one can see for miles on end is the Reich. All one sees is the front line. Europe is consumed in warfare once more, and it is essential that the soldiers understand that.\n\nIf we do not hold Ukraine, whose bread will feed their families back home? Danish pork and butter are a staple at every table, Bohemian cars fill the streets of every city, Baltic farms are home to a cousin of every other man in this army. If we do not win this war, we risk losing everything the Reich has fought for for the past century. We fight for what is ours."
 GGR_war_in_the_mind_desc:0 "This war is perhaps the most important we have ever fought. If the Reich cannot be halted in its fall, if Göring and Speidel are allowed to continue to destroy it then all is lost and the Führer's dream will be dead. Our troops must understand this - they must not falter in their mission, they must show no mercy, and they must never surrender. Thus far they have been found lacking. The number of rounds wasted on deserters is too high when they could be put to use against the enemy. We shall require our troops swear oaths of loyalty, and officers instructed to keep a closer eye on their men. And every man will keep an eye on his comrades - for there are traitors around every street corner."
 GGR_volkssturm_desc:0 "To achieve a great future blood must be spilled. Just because one is not eligible for conscription into the Wehrmacht does not mean one cannot be of use to their country. The Volkssturm shall serve as a home for those too old for the Wehrmacht, those too infirm to drill with a rifle and those women who are called upon to serve the Reich in its time of great need. Though their equipment may be lacking in quality, their training substandard and their uniforms virtually nonexistent, they will fill holes in the line just as well as any Heer Soldat. It will serve as a useful means of disposal for critical of our way of thinking."
 GGR_all_traitors_shall_bleed_desc:0 "Our efforts have proven successful so far, with the flow of fresh recruits to the front line broadening into a torrent. There will always be elements of cowardice that must be rooted out however - the common soldier must be taught the value of discipline and diligence. Anyone attempting to undermine the war effort, by words or by actions, is a traitor and will be treated as such. The Reich is a machine of flesh and metal, and when a cog gets stuck or a spring breaks, you replace it. We have neither the time nor the inclination to waste our efforts with trials or prisons. Shoot them."
 GGR_those_without_desc:0 "We had hoped that Göring would prove a willing ally as Führer - while he may be vain and gauche he is a military man. Sadly it was not to be, his leadership limp-wristed, his monetary management ham-fisted and his policies ill-thought. He has proven truculent in our attempts to steer him and now he has bucked the reins and risks bringing the Reich we have fought so hard for crashing into a ditch. He must die, and those that followed him in life will follow him to the firing line.\n\nEnding that glory hound Speidel will merely be the cherry on top of the cake. From the battlefields of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line to the balconies of the Berghof he has followed us, always casting his shadow. He has hindered us for too long, and it will be a pleasure to see him swinging from a rope. "
 GGR_and_those_within_desc:0 "Examples have been made, and we have been patient enough. Soldiers linger away from their duties, eager to spend as much time away from the front as possible. They make excuses, hide in their barracks, spend time on frivolities like lunch breaks. No longer. Spare time is wasted time, and wasted time is dereliction of duty.\n\nThe newly issued 'Richtlinien für die Behandlung der Zeitverschwender' will crack down on these time wasters. Any soldier found away from the front lines without written orders from a superior officer will be hanged. Any officer who fails to carry out these orders will be shot. What more fitting punishment for those who refuse to defend German women and children?"
 GGR_no_retreat_desc:0 "This front is too vital to fall without a fight. No matter how many men they throw at us, no matter how many bodies we must expend, we will bleed for every second we must buy for our forces across the Reich to muster against the enemy. There will be not one step back for our men, not until they reach the very walls of [ROOT.Capital.GetName].\n\nOf course, the Reichsmarshall and his staff are too vital to leave to the enemy. They will evacuate when the time is right. "
 GGR_shorten_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Even we are willing to admit the Wehrmacht has become somewhat bloated since its glory days in the forties. Our ranks are filled with upjumped, inexperienced officers who scarcely remember the Second World War, let alone the first. They are more a hindrance than a help - what use can they be commanding men in combat if they have never seen the front lines?\n\nWe shall do them a favour and shorten the chain of command. Those without experience will be demoted to NCO ranks, those that complain will find themselves no different to the Soldaten they once commanded. Perhaps if they survive, they can work their way back up the ranks."
 GGR_slaves_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Slaves are one of the few things we have in abundance. They may be lazy and insubordinate, their work shoddy and substandard, but they provide the majority of the Reich's labour. They are many and individually quite worthless - it would be a mistake not to utilise them in our hour of need. Their blood is inferior but they take a bullet just as well as any Aryan.\n\nPromise them freedom, or food, or a day off - we have no obligation to follow through. March them at gunpoint and send them at the enemy barricades. Every one that dies is a German life saved, and maybe after the war there won't be so many of them to worry about."
 GGR_nowhere_left_to_run_desc:0 "A cornered dog is the most dangerous kind. Every man, woman and child here knows their duty, to defend this land to their dying breath, and with all avenues of escape cut off even the most desperate coward must stand and fight. When men are ordered to march, we expect them to march. When they are ordered to kill, we expect that they kill. And when they are ordered to die, we expect them to die. Any less is treason."
 GGR_a_lost_cause_desc:0 "The situation here has become untenable. The front lines are dissolving, with deserters fleeing faster than our blocking squads can shoot them. All the same, we can ensure the enemy gains nothing of value from this land. Land mines and indiscriminate artillery fire will slow their advance long enough to extract men and materiel, while we set light to the fields and salt the earth beneath with defoliants. Ammo dumps will be rigged with time delayed bombs, sending any would-be scavengers to kingdom come. There is always the next Reichskommissariat."
 GGR_exhaust_the_workers_desc:0 "Scorched earth tactics do not merely extend to the land itself. Blood and soil are inextricably linked - it would be ridiculous to burn the crops and leave those who tend them to replant them the next day. They must be wrung for every last drop of effort before we evacuate, every ounce of arms and armaments and supplies taken. If they must work in double shifts to ensure that we eventually take the helm, so be it. When we return they will no doubt be grateful we spared their lives."
 GGR_dispose_of_the_useless_desc:0 "Slaves have always been disposable - that is their purpose. If we cannot take them with us to the next front, so be it. Round them up and put a bullet in them before we leave. The work camps they once occupied are valuable assets and it would be foolish to leave them intact for the next contender. Shell them, bomb them, set them alight. There is no sense in evacuating those with no reason to live."
 GGR_burn_capital_desc:0 "A capital is temporary, for we are always on the march. If this one does not suit us we will find a new one, one more suitable for our needs. Of course, it would be hypocritical to leave this city intact and ready starve when we have demolished the factories and salted the earth behind us in the name of a better Reich. They do not even have slaves any more. It is kinder to set it alight behind us when we leave."

The failure of National Socialism in it's current state is evident. Now it falls to Speidel to restore the Reich to some semblance of sanity. If that means reform then so be it. Working with students, working with partisans or even abandoning RK's outright. The Reich will be reformed into something more reasonable. It doesn't have a choice."
GGR_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "If the German people as well as all the other people currently within the Reich want to see their chains broken and a measure of freedom restored, then they have no choice, but to stay with us. While our promises have to be vague at the moment, once we have triumphed over Schörner and Göring surely we will reform the Reich into something more "pleasant" than what it has been in the past."
GGR_rally_the_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the army still follows Schörner or Göring, even the forces that have joined us are still somewhat reluctant to accept Speidel as their new leader. In this critical situation we can't afford to let lingering distrust impact our effort to save the Reich. Let's remind them, that Speidel is the saviour of Germania during the first civil war, the vanquisher of Himmler's coup during the West russian War and that now he will save Germany once again. Unsere letzte Hoffnung heißt Speidel."
GGR_rally_the_students_desc:0 "The students of the Reich have suffered much in the recent years, between the first Civil War, Görings crackdown and being sent off to die in the various wars. Hence their distrust of any Wehrmacht general, even one that actually wants to improve their situation is natural. Speidel will have a lot of convincing to do to gain their support. However if they want to see reform of the Reich within their lifetime then they will have no choice but to support Speidel. "
GGR_a_united_front_desc:0 "It took a lot of talking, haggling and pleading, but finally the Students and the parts of the Wehrmacht that have sided with us have agreed to form a united front against our enemies. It's condition is still brittle, but with time and hopefully success it will form into a front of solid iron that will have the strength to do what it must: Save the Reich from its current self."
GGR_call_to_the_partisans_desc:0 "While dealing with the various collaborators that have supported Reich, Speidel has inevitably gotten contact with various groups that are willing to rise up as partisans, but whoms ideological composition is not so far away as to be untenable. Directly helping potential enemies of the Reich might not be the clean choice, but giving a hand to let these partisan groups rise up in our current enemies territory can prove very valuable."
GGR_the_iberians_desc:0 "Ever since Iberia fell to our invasion, the peninsula has become a mess of partisans and garrisons fighting it out. With the Civil War this situation only intensified. With the number and variety of resistance organizations very large, it is easy to simply support a few of those to rise up in pro-Schörner and pro-Göring controlled areas, but not in ours."
GGR_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Schörner controlled areas include many of the former and current slavic inhabited lands. Having them rise up in an attempt to liberate their lands is not only likely to happen with or without our help, if we give them a bit of support here and there, they will likely draw away a significant amount of hostile forces away from our current areas of engagement. And no matter who wins, we can just deal with them afterwards."
GGR_the_scandinavians_desc:0 "Scandinavia, especially the valuable mines of Lappland and northern Sweden have seen large influxes of slave workers recently. With the territory being lowly populated, vast in scale and difficult to control, it is a prime area for an uprising. A bit of help here and there can help this to come about quicker. Still the emptiness of the region will prevent the uprising from spreading too far into our own areas of control."
GGR_all_for_a_prosperous_europe_desc:0 "With various partisan uprisings as well as our own war effort underway, a glorious future for Europe might now be within reach. Speidel's Germany and its vision is clear: All of Europe shall become prosperous once more under our leadership, the leadership of the Einheitspakt"
GGR_know_when_to_fight_desc:0 "This war is not yet over! We may have been pushed back and delayed temporarily, but we will fight on from one of those Reichskommissariat loyal to us. And there are enough of those around that we can repeat that process time and time again. Still we will fight to the last for the vision that Hans Speidel represents: A Reich of reason and not of madness that can hold up to all challenges."
GGR_call_troops_from_overseas_desc:0 "The fight for the heart of the Reich is the most important front in this whole conflict, but where Speidel is also important. We should recall troops from overseas and those areas less relevant to our cause and concentrate on securing our central area of operations."
GGR_the_saviour_of_germany_desc:0 "He is the saviour of the West Russian war, He is the protector of Germania, He is our last hope for change in the Reich, He is Hans Speidel!

 GGR_rule_the_waves:0 "Rule the Waves"
 GGR_rule_the_waves_desc:0 "Such a large invasion requires a large fleet to escort our convoys, lest they be sunk by marauding Italian ships. Therefore, we will allocate more capital ships to protect our invasion force and more of our funding to make sure that those ships are always in fighting shape. Germany shall rule the waves!"
 
 GGR_specialist_training:0 "Specialist Training"
 GGR_specialist_training_desc:0 "Amphibious landings often result in fighting of unmatched brutality and casualties. While such brutality cannot be altogether avoided, we can still initiate training programs for our elite marines. Rigorous drills and even mock amphibious landings will shape these men into expert fighters who will secure our foothold on the Italian beaches. Once the marines have their beachhead, the bulk of our army will be able push all the way to Rome!"
 
 GGR_and_the_skies:0 "And the Skies"
 GGR_and_the_skies_desc:0 "Just as it is the case at sea, maintaining superiority in the air is crucial to our invasion of Italy. A substantial portion of our funding will be directed to the Luftwaffe, whose help is needed to complete our invasion of the Alps and to protect our convoys that will be used in our amphibious assault. Especially considering his former role as Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe, Führer Göring understands just how important maintaining control of the skies is for fulfilling our plans. We will not ignore the needs of our armed forces on the ground, in the seas, or in the skies."
 
 GGR_dividing_supplies:0 "Dividing the Supplies"
 GGR_dividing_supplies_desc:0 "Invading through the mountains, especially ones as treacherous as the Alps, is going to cause a great deal of difficulty with our logistics. We must allocate more money from our budget to provide as large of a supply surplus as possible for our northern units, and assign personnel to enforce strict rationing among the troops. The Alpine invasion will no doubt be a struggle, but we can at least make sure our northern invasion force doesn't outright starve. Better a hungry soldier than an utterly starved one."
 
 GGR_find_the_money:0 "Find the Money"
 GGR_find_the_money_desc:0 "Arguably, the most challenging aspect of our grand invasion will not even be caused by the Italians. Rather, our huge plans and allocation of an obscene quantity of resources to those plans is resulting in our budget becoming... excessive (to put it lightly). It's too late to go back on these plans now, so we will resort to taking out as many loans as needed to fund our immensely expensive invasion. This war may be more trying for our accountants than for our soldiers, but they'll figure it out."
 
 GGR_destroy_the_italians:0 "Destroy the Italians"
 GGR_destroy_the_italians_desc:0 "It's been a long time coming, and everything is now in place. The marines wait in their landing craft, the northern invasion force sits eagerly at the border, and our men, airplanes, and ships are all prepared to kill and die so that the Reich may bring the Italians to their knees. The Italian rats won't even know what hit them. So long traitors, you won't be missed. Goodbye!"
 
 GGR_help_from_an_old_friend:0 "Help from an Old Friend"
 GGR_help_from_an_old_friend_desc:0 "Our beloved friends and partners at Temmler sure do know how to make some incredible supplements. Colloquially referred to by our troops as "Hermann Göring Pills," Pervitin brand methamphetamine tablets greatly stimulated our soldiers and increased their wakefulness to great effect back in the 30s and 40s. There may have been a great deal of medical reports suggesting extremely inhibitive side effects that would make taking methamphetamine unworthwhile, but this is nothing more than evil propaganda designed to steal away our glorious victory. Our men will fight while on meth, and they will destroy all who oppose them like the Aryan supersoldiers that they are!"
 
 GGR_the_big_push:0 "The Big Push"
 GGR_the_big_push_desc:0 "Following our successful landing, the likes of which has never been seen before, and our Alpine incursion into Northern Italy, the Italians are very much on the backfoot. Each day their utter destruction becomes more inevitable, as each day our forces march closer and closer to Rome. We will keep pushing and pushing and pushing until there is nowhere left for the filthy traitors to run! Not one step back!"
 
 GGR_the_tactical_approach:0 "The Tactical Approach"
 GGR_the_tactical_approach_desc:0 "Much to the chagrin of Generalfeldmarschall Schörner, Führer Göring (the world's most experienced and greatest military mind) has concluded that the Großgermanisches Reich can best subdue the Italian threat through thoroughly-planned offensives. To make matters worse for the Generalfeldmarschall, the Führer has explicitly forbidden tactical nuclear action: conventional tactics, while unsexy, are apparently less likely to trigger massive retaliation. This does give us a great deal of autonomy, however, in using the Kriegsmarine - all those nuclear submarines will need alternative deployments now the big guns are off the table..."
 
 GGR_release_the_kraken:0 "Release the Kraken"
 GGR_release_the_kraken_desc:0 "Italy's soft underbelly has always been its poor coastal defense network. Porous, unguarded, and surrounded by useless desert, the Italian coast is ripe for the taking - and the Kriegsmarine, Europe's most powerful sea-force, shall seize it! Ignoring the advice of lesser men who call for 'moderation', Führer Göring has declared that the Großgermanisches Reich must 'Release the Kraken'. We shall act swiftly and without mercy for our opponents. When the Kriegsmarine has sunk or mothballed every ship bearing the Italian ensign in the Mediterranean, they will beg us to step onto their shores - and we shall, of course, indulge them."
 
 GGR_surrounding_the_boot:0 "Surrounding the Boot"
 GGR_surrounding_the_boot_desc:0 "To ensure that our containment of Italian naval forces is successful, the Großgermanisches Reich must build an invisible undersea wall. Such a wall would cut the Italians off from potential assistance from the OFN, destroy their supply lines from the Colonies, and lay the groundwork for a decisive entry onto the mainland itself. Forget about what we know regarding 'feasibility' and 'poor line-of-sight' in most of the Mediterranean - the will of the supermen has always proven superior, and so it shall be for our brave U-Boats and capital ships! "
 
 GGR_the_stealthy_approach:0 "The Stealthy Approach"
 GGR_the_stealthy_approach_desc:0 "Our racial science has laid down the facts as they stand: the Italians are naturally inferior to the Aryan Superman, and there is no evidence that can claim otherwise! Being inherently superior in physiognomy, our tactics shall prove inherently enigmatic to the Italians as well. Which is just as well, because the Führer has sanctioned the same tactical doctrine as we used in the last war! They will never expect to be pelted by torpedos before the surface fleet arrives to mop up the corpses of Italians. This is absolutely foolproof and will never backfire on us. We swear it by the Reich!"
 
 GGR_naval_hit_and_run:0 "Naval Hit and Run"
 GGR_naval_hit_and_run_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine is our prized possession, and its losses will hurt our capabilities dearly. The Führer, in the run-up to our aforementioned naval campaign, has set in stone the tactics that shall be employed by our U-boats to minimize losses. Hit-and-run tactics, while dishonorable, will prove effective in destabilizing enemy naval forces while reducing hits to our own - more importantly, it will soften the ground for mass confrontation between fleets, should we choose to initiate it. Doing so will eliminate the Italian Navy piecemeal, at our own timing, and ensure that the Soft Underbelly will remain soft for the foreseeable future."
 
 GGR_strength_is_everything:0 "Strength is Everything"
 GGR_strength_is_everything_desc:0 "Germans do not hide! Except when we hid in the forests at Teutoburg, or in the trenches at the Somme, but otherwise we do not hide! And so we shall not hide from these pitiful Italians under the cover of the waves - no, we shall confront them with our highly, highly effective surface fleet, armed with capital ships and enough gunnery to turn the damned Adriatic black. If all goes well, we will decimate the Italian Navy just like the Turkish fleet at Lepanto, and this time there will be no shipyards to save them. Therefore, we shall invest heavily into our capital ships to ensure that they're in fighting condition prior to our official declaration of war."
 
 GGR_preserving_our_power:0 "Preserving our Power"
 GGR_preserving_our_power_desc:0 "The Großgermanisches Reich is the luckiest nation on Earth to have Führer Göring at its helm. As can be expected, our investment in our surface fleet has met with positive results, and while the Kriegsmarine now owes a lot of very angry bureaucrats a huge sum of loan funding, we have secured the ability of our capital ships to effectively annihilate our Italian opponents when the time comes. And which is the more important of the two? It's our wartime capability, obviously. It's not like we're Bormannites."
 
 GGR_time_to_strike:0 "Time to Strike"
 GGR_time_to_strike_desc:0 "The Großgermanisches Reich is fully prepared to strike the unsuspecting Italian nation in a day of infamy - the first of many for them, no doubt. Mercy would be a gift we can ill-afford at this stage - shock and awe are the only language worth speaking in wartime. We shall be swift and brutal, annihilating our opponents who so stubbornly refuse to subordinate themselves to our Reich. Generalfeldmarschall Schörner, the time has come. Execute the Invasion of Italy. "
 
 GGR_no_one_to_help_them:0 "No One to Help Them"
 GGR_no_one_to_help_them_desc:0 "The Italians, in their natural incompetence, have allowed the Großgermanisches Reich's Kriegsmarine to surround the Italian peninsula, like the idiots they are. As they lament about eventually missing the days of Mussolini, their lines of supply are crumbling, one by one, and their so-called allies stand helpless. Our invasion shall not be impeded by any unsavory foreign actors who desire to sabotage our nation's rightful claim over Italy. "
 
 GGR_smash_the_ports:0 "Smash the Ports"
 GGR_smash_the_ports_desc:0 "Our choice to delay the invasion and continue preparations has proven wise. With the Kriegsmarine enthusiastically choking the life from the Italian peninsula, the Großgermanisches Reich has found itself able to further damage Italy's military capabilities. Precision strikes, constant volleys of air-fire and bombardment, and the occasional firebombing - we shall render Italian ports useless bar scrap metal collection. Not a single ship will leave harbor, or at least none will leave in one piece. "
 
 GGR_infiltration_tactics:0 "Infiltration Tactics"
 GGR_infiltration_tactics_desc:0 "Our power is undeniable and the Untermensch shall surely falter. It is also undeniable that our men will die in huge numbers if we do not use them wisely, even against savages. It is best that we invest in the training of operatives that shall infiltrate deep into enemy lines - if we are successful in disrupting Italy's defensive encampments it will ensure that our naval invasion shall suffer less strained supply lines. Moreover, if we are successful it may limit German casualties when we land on the beaches of Italy. A little planning will do much for us when the time comes: be assured, however, that it will all be worth it."
 
 GGR_the_time_has_come:0 "시간이 다가오다"
 GGR_the_time_has_come_desc:0 "해변으로 갈 아군을 준비해야 할 때가 왔습니다. 크릭스마리네 해병대는 지중해를 안전하게 보호하고, 이탈리아 함대를 격멸하는 모든 목표를 성공적으로 달성하며 대규모 수륙양용 상륙작전의 길이 열렸습니다. There is now a critical window of opportunity, before land defenses are fortified and the beaches turn into killing fields: we must land the soldiers of the Heer as soon as possible. And when we have landed in strength, the Heer will display its untamed might against the pitiful remnants of the Italian army. And then - how did the Latin go again? We will engage in, ah, making a desert and calling it peace."
