NPP 극우파로 등을 돌린, 남부 민주당원들을 멸시하는 많은 사람들은 이 법안을 불쾌히 여기며, 현재의 은광업자들에게 피해를 줄 것이라고 생각합니다. 마찬가지로, 이상하게도 NPP 중도파도 같은 입장을 취하고 있습니다. 그들은 이 법안이 미국인들의 일자리를 빼앗을 것이라고 주장하며 노골적인 반대 입장을 드러내고 있습니다. 이제 남은 것은 이 법안이 의회의 전장터에서 살아남을 수 있을지를 보는 것 뿐입니다."

After months of work within the Treasury, and months of planning to finalize attempts to push it through Congress, the bill has failed to make it through a floor vote.\n\nPresident Bennett offered his \"sincerest apologies to the citizens of the United States for the extreme partisanship within the federal government.\" Throughout the Senate and House of Representatives, Republican and Democratic congressmen continuously shake their heads, grimace, and express their frustrations over the Silver Act being defeated by political chicanery. Administration officials stated that \"the administration will continue its efforts to aid the American economy, despite the evident political hurdles to even the most basic of tasks.\"\n\nOn the other hand, NPP congressmen have related surprise over their success on the legislative floor. Far Right and Center NPP congressmen shake hands and congratulate one another in the Capitol, while R-D legislators field angry calls from their voting base. The Democratic branch of the R-D's, in particular, are reeling, with large swathes of former Democratic voters turning to the NPP, even as the Republicans raise questions about the Bennett administration's fitness for office. The administration is scrambling to find a solution to the bill's failure."

 USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "미국의 건립 초기부터 교육은 지역적인 사안이었습니다. 지역 학군이 학교를 유지해왔고 각 주에서 교육의 방향을 제시해 왔기 때문입니다. 그러나 이것은 부나 권한에 따라 큰 격차가 생길 수도 있음을 의미합니다. 그렇게 되면 많은 학생들이 미래를 위해 필수가 되는 완전한 교육을 받지 못할 수도 있는 것입니다. 연방학생지원법은 각 주와 지역구에 필수적인 자원과 미국 전역에 교육의 기본적인 기준을 제공하여 이를 바로잡을 수 있을 것입니다."

 bill_6_failed:0 "In a shocking announcement, the Federal Student Aid Act has failed to clear the Senate. Overseeing the vote, Vice President Hubert Humphrey has announced that the act has failed to acquire enough votes, leading to a major blow to his and President Kennedy's effort at school reform.\n\n\"The failure of this effort to reform America's schools will reverberate throughout the years,\" Bobby Kennedy angrily thundered during a press conference. \"The next George Washington Carver will never get the chance to see their full potential. The next Ernest Hemmingway will be stuck in poverty. The next Thomas Edison will never get to change the world.\"\n\nThe FSA Act would have set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government would have provided money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the now tabled law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile state's rights supporters cheer the failure of the \"draconian\" and \"tyrannical\" efforts to level the playing field for education across America, Civil Rights groups and education unions decry the failure of the law and the many inequalities that will persist for the indefinite future."

 RD_R_compromise_desc_6:0 "Senator Scoop Jackson has been meeting with multiple Republican senators throughout the sprawling Senate Office Buildings, most of them individually in the attempt to get enough votes to pass the Federal Student Aid Act.\n\nIn fact, Scoop has been surprised about how receptive to the idea of additional education funding is with his colleagues from the other side of the aisle. After all, there is nothing more popular with a politician seeking re-election than to point to a new school in their district, or the improved test scores, to show that, yes, they are doing their job.\n\nBut, like usual, there are some concerns with the law as it has been written. For one thing, some Senators have expressed concern about how the federal mandates will strip the states of their prerogatives to manage education, which would be incredibly unpopular in some states, especially in the south and west. Other senators were a bit uneasy on the cost of the FSA, which will tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to the budget. While, again, they like the idea of supporting education, they also don't want to saddle those same children with even more debt when they become taxpayers.\n\nHaving taken their words into account, Scoop has approached the committee writing the bill, and made his suggestion:"

 USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "아메리칸 드림에서 중점을 두는 한 가지가 있습니다: 본인 소유의 집을 갖는 것. 그러나 전쟁이 끝난 후 부동산 개발업자들은 중산층 교외주택지 개발에 더 집중해왔습니다: 큰 도시 중심에서 떨어진 곳에, 끝이 막혀있는 구불구불한 길을 따라 세워진 수천 개의 비슷비슷한 집들. 이것은 소수인종을 포함한 많은 이들을 주택시장에서 몰아내도록 만들었습니다. 적정주택법은 이러한 문제를 해결해 줄 것이며 새로운 지역사회를 이루기 위한 새로운 집과 편의시설을 건설할 것입니다."

Complaints about the cost, the dictates on how the money would be spent, and even lingering segregationist elements in Congress scuttled the law that would have revitalized major cities, opening up housing development for minorities and working class families, and created a whole new chorot of property owners.\n\n\"The President is disappointed at the Senate's rejection of the Affordable Housing Act,\" a spokesman for the White House said in a press conference. \"Nevertheless, the fight to expand home ownership and give all Americans, not just the wealthy and middle class, the chance to buy their own house will go on.\"\n\nThe defeated law would have allowed cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill would have also provided subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and helped to establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city. These new homes would not have been apartment blocks like some opponents had suggested, but duplexes, townhouses, row houses and other such buildings to allow more people access to housing that the larger, car focused suburban dwellings that are too expensive, or even forbidden, for racial minorities to access: government funding would have been provided on the condition that no barriers will be put in place for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or anyone else.\n\nSadly, the early design plans for the \"Kennedyburgs\" that many were starting to call them, have to be shelved for now, and millions of Americans will have to continue to rent and live in substandard and dilapidated apartments and tenements."

Also in the law were regulations mandating that full-time workers be given an eight hour work day, or at least generous overtime pay. Penalties would have been put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as \"part-time\", a \"contractor\" or \"freelance\", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects of the now dead bill was the establishment of a federal minimum wage: $1.50 for full-time employees in most industries, with agriculture and a handful of service industries allowed to set a slightly smaller minimum wage to a minimum of $1.10. But this minimum wage would have been re-evaluated every year based on inflation, to maintain the purchasing power.\n\n\"The President is incredibly disappointed in the failure of the NRLA,\" a brief statement issued by the White House said. \"However, President Kennedy and his administration will continue to fight for the everyday American worker, and will encourage Congress to revisit this bill in the future.\"\n\nBusiness leaders and Wall Street celebrated the failure of the \"communist\" law, with the stock market having one of the best days in a decade at the news that the NLRA died. Even a majority of the American population seem to have agreed that the act was maybe a step too far, though the individual components of the law still poll well.

Penalties would have been put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as \"part-time\", a \"contractor\" or \"freelance\", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects of the now dead bill was the establishment of a Federal Pension System. A small percentage of an employee's paycheck would have been withheld, and paid into the FPS. This money would then be put into safe investments such as government bonds to continuously grow the pot. When retiring at a minimum age of 65, or when a worker is severely injured and unable to continue working, a liveable pension would have then been paid to them for the rest of their lives, annually adjusted for inflation.\n\n\"The President is incredibly disappointed in the failure of the NRLA,\" a brief statement issued by the White House said. \"However, President Kennedy and his administration will continue to fight for the everyday American worker, and will encourage Congress to revisit this bill in the future.\"\n\nBusiness leaders and Wall Street celebrated the failure of the \"communist\" law, with the stock market having one of the best days in a decade at the news that the NLRA died. Even a majority of the American population seem to have agreed that the act was maybe a step too far, though the individual components of the law still poll well. So maybe there is a hope in the future?"

It's the individual state's job to determine what and how they teach, and we will get out of their way to do it."
 bill_15_passed:0 "President Margaret Chase Smith today has signed the \"Power to the States\" Act into federal law, having passed through Congress last night after a midnight vote.

Each state, county and city knows what is best for them.\"\n\nThis law curtails the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would effectively allow various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of \"separate but equal\" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.\n\nThe controversial law is a victory for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. However, opposition has been pronounced from civil rights activists as backsliding, and also from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states.

The opposition from civil rights activists, and from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states, was enough to convince a majority of senators to not go ahead.

Winning an easy majority from both the National Progressive Party and the Republican-Democrats, it appears to have had a much broader base of support than was initially thought. Most happy at the news were the bill's main proponents: Senator Michael Harrington and Governor George Wallace, who came to a compromise on their differing views on welfare to create something that worked for both parties.\n\nAs soon as it is signed into law, millions of poor Americans -many of them from the poverty-stricken, rural South- will now be able to apply for government financial assistance. The bill's success has shown much of America that the National Progressive Party is truly capable of working together as a united political group on more than just foreign policy. It has also greatly strengthened the position of President Margaret Chase Smith, who stands to see a great uptick in her approval ratings."

Senator Michael Harrington, who was one of the bill's main supporters, called the result \"unfortunate\".\n\nThe bill was heavily anticipated as the first instance of true cooperation in the National Progressive Party over welfare programs. Vocally supported by Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP, it found good ground in the House and quickly made its way to the Senate. Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace.

It will establish new hiring guidelines for federal contractors, give preferential support to minority-owned businesses, and implement quota systems to ensure that public colleges give more opportunities to the underserved.

Initially highly unpopular and still polarising even now, extensive lobbying has managed to secure the support necessary for the bill being passed.\n\nThe bill, which includes the slashing of welfare and social security budgets, has paved the way for the president's broader economic and fiscal agenda. While it is uncertain how this budgetary reorientation is going to impact the American economy in the long run, analysts have been cautiously optimistic. The Goldwater administration meanwhile, is overjoyed at this major political victory. It is likely the administration will want to capitalise on the momentum the passing of the budget has generated, and more proposals are expected to follow.\n\nAs could have been expected however, the adoption of the budget has unfortunately widened the divisions within the Republicans-Democrats. Many Republicans have expressed their deep opposition to the president's fiscal agenda. Consequently, many of them now feel tempted to flock into the welcoming and eager arms of the Center-NPP. How this will affect the stability of the coalition will remain to be seen.\n\nNevertheless, it is a major victory for the White House and Secretary Don Regan in particular, whose fiscal philosophy, dubbed \"Reganomics\", has been the cornerstone of the bill. This victory is a momentous occasion which is undoubtedly to lead to the popping of champagne bottles in the oval office. Certainly, the president can sleep a little easier knowing this battle has been won."

It now seems however, that these efforts were to no avail, as the bill lies dead on the floor of congress.\n\nWith the rejection of the president's budget, the flagship of the White House's economic and fiscal agenda has been sunk. Weeks of hard work have been undone in a single stroke and it seems ever more uncertain if President Goldwater will be able to push the other elements of his fiscal and economic agenda through congress. For now, the new administration's efforts have been stopped dead in their tracks. Reportedly the cabinet is currently convening in a room in the West Wing on how to proceed from here on out. Secretary Don Regan, whose fiscal philosophy has been a central component of the bill, seems particularly infuriated at the news of the bill's defeat.\n\nOpponents of the bill have been overjoyed however, with the Republican half of the Republicans-Democrats having found cause to celebrate. How this will affect the Democrats' position is uncertain, although this legislative defeat has certainly shown their weakness. In any case, it is a serious blow to the president's agenda.

The administration has been working together with Wallace F. Bennett extensively, a venture which now seems to have paid off. Congress has ratified a series of bills proposed by the Goldwater administration which have strengthened the American dollar's ties with the shiny metal. America will be building up its gold bullion reserve, restoring the promise that every dollar can be exchanged for gold. This way, we can end our dependence on the much more unstable silver: that second-rate inferior metal. In doing so, the ever-increasing trend towards inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks and prices will be stabilised. Secretary Don Regan has laid the groundworks by coordinating with the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, making sure that our country is ready for a return to prosperity at home. This move has been welcomed by many in the financial market.\n\nThe passing of the bill is no major surprise to the Goldwater administration or most political observers. But nevertheless it is a clear indicator that the Goldwater administration can rally the support it needs. It is likely the president and Bennett will continue to work together on similar topics in the future."

Congress is now seeking continuing legislation for extending previous spending levels into the next year, leaving military spending levels and troop deployment authorizations untouched.\n\nEven as President McGovern and his aides regroup after this setback, OFN ambassadors in Washington privately reported relief that the most radical provisions of the USA FREEDOM Act - namely, its proposals to begin select withdrawal of American troops from overseas - were rejected in Congress. The Australians, most notably, have relied on a robust U.S. presence to bolster their position on the doorstep of the Co-Prosperity Sphere for decades, and their ambassador publicly expressed their desire to reaffirm U.S.-Australian defense arrangements in the aftermath of the Act's failure."

It was nothing massive, of course - a mere flute of champagne before today's stack of paperwork - but the gesture itself was all that mattered. After decades of work, of politics, of endless traveling across the American continent, she finally accomplished something monumental. People rarely feel the effects of whatever goes on in Washington, but this bill was sure to fundamentally change the lives of millions of Americans for the better. Her campaign was all about Japan and Germany, but Smith herself never forgot about the nation that mattered the most - America.\n\nMargaret took one last sip of champagne before returning to her duties. It was remarkably sweet, a taste that reminded her of her younger years, back when she was nothing but an office worker at Daniel E.

Subjected to a slow campaign of attrition by Southern senators, protests by segregationists, and antipathy from the White House, Black leaders were forced to watch as stronger provisions pertaining to labor rights, hiring discrimination, and police brutality were stripped away. Many on both sides have come to blame Nixon for the current state of affairs-with segregationists outraged that the president let the bill move through Congress at all and civil rights advocates accusing Nixon of attempting to sabotage his vice president to remove a potential challenge in the 1964 presidential primary."

In this desire for the care of servicemen, the LeMay administration managed to construct the greatest expansion of the G.I.

Having been harassed regarding the needs of African-American veterans, and the overall need of veterans as a whole, President LeMay has used the opportunity to throw together several celebrations alongside figures in the military high command as well as veterans throughout the countries. \"Though I appear to you as Commander-in-Chief, know that it is I who seeks to serve you, now, after all your years of service.\"\n\nHowever, as all things within the span of the Wallace and LeMay presidencies, nothing can stand without the potential rise of controversy in its wake. In particular, Progressives throughout the country have criticized the Far Right's focus on veteran social standing when all of the country has been put through economic hardships, some of which they say \"comes from the Far Right's insessance of a free market.\" One group of Republican protesters in Washington D.C. continued to shout \"They fight, we fight, we all fight!\" while waving around banners depicting X's over the President's face."

Appalled in seeing the thousands of veterans out there who suffer, day in, and day out, hurt by political scheming taking precedence over humanity. \"How could anyone call themselves a patriot in acknowledging that they have destroyed simple aid towards those who gave themselves over to fight the Nazis, to fight the Japanese, to fight tyranny and despots themselves?\" President LeMay said, regarding the failure.\n\nHowever, despite the shaming remarks lashed out by the President, many stand proud of their defiance of the Far Right. In particular, many sects of Progressive wings sought to stand against President LeMay and the administration inside the White House, claiming that the President's actions had only been an opening into furthering Wallace's Far Right ideals. \"LeMay doesn't know what he's doing out there, and yeah, maybe he wants to look good for all those who served their country.

The constant fights have exhausted Americans throughout the country, with the clashing coming to a head as the military has come under fire for being regarded as racially segregated and, thus, without justice to all Americans.

Throughout the country, African-American veterans of the Second World War have gathered, some back into their old military units, to celebrate President LeMay's long-needed reforms. \"We fought just as hard as any white soldier did, whether they were in the Pacific, or out there on top of machine guns in England.

But mark my words in knowing that I have fought dearly for you, the young Americans who seek to serve their strong, godly country.\" African-American veterans of the Second World War protested the acts of the Senate, having organized marches upon the steps of Washington D.C.\n\nDespite the lengthy efforts of the President and his administration in working towards the progressiveness of the United States military, some remain silently proud regarding the Far Right's senatorial failure. Many groups have claimed several statements regarding their support of African-Americans looking to serve their country, but their outright refusal in bending towards the desires of the Far Right. \"All LeMay wanted was to look nice so that he could put in the next big Far-Right hammer of oppression.

There were a handful of civil rights activists, still in shock that \"Bombs Away LeMay\" had somehow pushed a real civil rights bill through Congress. At the center of it all, was her husband, smiling broadly and looking ridiculous sitting in front of a tiny bill-signing table. Clinging to him were dozens of Black little boys and girls.\n\nHelen smiled as Curtis pulled a small kindergartener in a suit onto his lap and handed him one of his pens, which the boy immediately put into his mouth. The children, students at the Thaddeus Stevens School in Washington, had been her idea. Curtis had always been fond of children and always been willing to open up to them in a way he didn't with other people. She'd passed the idea along to some member of his staff as a way to get him to be less stiff, to be more human. When people looked at her husband, she wanted them to see more than a cigar-chomping caricature. She wanted them to see a man ready to serve as president for all Americans.\n\nOf course, there were people who wouldn't like that. It seemed that every letter thanking Curtis came paired with a death threat. Just the other day, police had stopped a man at the Capitol with a bomb strapped to his chest. The day before, some raving fascist had tried to climb over the White House's wrought-iron fence. On television were images of celebrating Black Americans and dark rallies attended by growing throngs of discontented whites. At the head of them was a pale, thin man warning of the threat of  \"miscegenation and liberalism\" and vowing to stop it at all cost.\n\nBut for now, Helen pushed these thoughts from her mind. There would be a time to worry about the future. For now, she wanted to celebrate what her husband had achieved, to acknowledge the countless lives that would be transformed by his hard work.

When Wallace had come to her husband and asked him to join his ticket, Helen had begged and pleaded with her husband to reject the offer. It would destroy him, she said, transform him from a hero to a bum.\n\nNow, years later, she found herself sitting numbly in the White House residence, hands clasped together, waiting for her husband after the failure of his civil rights act. On the television there were pictures of rioters spreading across the country, of laughing segregationists, of some smirking communist speaking to a crowd in Minneapolis. The one thing that united them all was a burning hatred of her husband. It was not just that he had betrayed Wallace but that he had failed, that he had once again proven that no man escapes from the morass of Washington.\n\nHelen heard the click of an open door behind her. She turned to see her husband. There was no anger in his face, no sign of the clever, cigar-chomping character invented by the newspapers. The Curtis LeMay she saw looked gaunt and hollow, his face empty of all hope. The only time she had ever seen him look like this was when he came home after the War, when they sat in her mother's little kitchen in Cleveland and he told her in a deadened voice of all the cruelty he had inflicted. For nothing.\n\nShe felt herself rise and wrap her arms around his stiff form. \"Things will get better.

It wasn't just Thurmond's stubbornness-the Senator had made no secret his thoughts on LeMay's \"sudden betrayal\" and attempt to \"facilitate racial intermixture.\" It wasn't Thurmond's peculiarities either-his humorlessness and reptilian courtliness. It was the goddamn phoniness. More than his love of states' rights or the \"Southern way of life,\" Strom Thurmond cared about himself and was willing to indulge any ugly, racist fantasy that let him accumulate power. Yet, here LeMay found himself, trying to win over the senator on the issue of civil rights.\n\n\"So,\" said Thurmond in a low, dull voice, \"you're expecting me to betray the South, to go against everything that our party, yourself included, campaigned on in '64?\"\n\nLeMay paused for a moment, both to swallow his anger and to give himself a moment to think. \"Yes,\" he said, choosing his words carefully. LeMay had never been one for negotiation. He preferred facts delivered to him straight. \"The country is furious. Steaming. You've seen the bums they put on television, talking about how we need radicals or... or worse to solve this civil rights issue,\" LeMay gestured toward his desk. \"Unless we find some way to move beyond Wallace, there's gonna be someone worse than me behind that desk. You don't want that. Neither do I.\"\n\nThurmond gave LeMay a dispassionate look. \"Oh, you don't need to tell me that, Mr. President.\" The word felt like an insult in Thurmond's mouth. \"The sooner Wallace is thrown into the dustbin of history, the better. The only question is whether we can come to some kind of... arrangement that can get the NPP-FR on board.\"\n\nMore fucking showmanship. LeMay forced himself to play along. \"What'd you suggest?\"\n\nThurmond gave the president a viper-like smile. \"Oh, nothing too terrible. My aides and I might just amend the language. Carve out some exceptions. Restrain some of the more aggressive provisions. This bill could benefit from the South's unique perspective to ensure the federal government doesn't overstep her bounds, don't you think?\""

 USA_sen_bill_name_64:0 "The Educational Success Act"
 USA_sen_bill_desc_64:0 "Written in consultation with conservative thinkers at the American Enterprise Institute and newly formed Hudson Institute, the American Educational Success Act seeks to chip away at selective, ivory tower institutions and stop the \"rising tide of mediocrity\" that undermines the nation's international competitiveness.\n\nThe bill does this in two ways. First, it provides large tax cuts to all institutions of higher education across the country. Second, it also strips away various regulations that limit how these institutions seek and receive donations and how they manage their endowments, provided they first increase enrollment to meet certain benchmarks. In this way, the proposal builds on LeMay's GI Bill by expanding access to education for all Americans while also providing greater latitude to universities on how they manage their operations."

Buckley, Jr.\n\n\"As I wrote a decade ago,\" said Buckley, seated on stage. He spoke in an unplaceable, imperious accent, \"most universities have lost sight of the Christian, free-market values upon which this Republic was built. It is the responsibility of alumni to force them to promote individualism, to withdraw donations from institutions that promote contrary values.\"\n\nThe audience, a mix of conservative activists murmured in agreement. The Hoover Institution interviewer cleared his throat. \"And you think this recently passed bill in Washington by LeMay, the American Educational Success Act-.\"\n\n\"Not quite the approach I would have taken, but I will admit that his bill is a good first step of excising government control from public education and... giving more power to institutions to resist the kind of atheism and collectivism we see in Germany. Besides increasing the number of students who can attend this lovely university,\" he flashed a devious grin, \"the changes will empower those who want to ensure our universities are competitive and instill moral values.\"\n\n\"So you support LeMay? You think that conservatives should support-?\"\n\n\"I merely mean that his proposals offer a more credible way forward than his leftist opposition and, certainly, certainly, a better alternative to the overreaching, coercive-and some might say racist-conduct of his predecessor... though that's a low bar.\" The audience broke into laughter. \"Let's just hope he doesn't exceed his authority going forward.\"\n\nBuckley flashed a smile. It was clear that, while LeMay was no close friend to the movement, he was not yet its enemy. He would escape Buckley's scorn for another day."

Collectivism. Higher education has become infested with communist inspired by totalitarian ideologies from abroad. And yet...\" He smirked and paused for dramatic effect. \"It's clear these issues inspire little interest in Washington.\"\n\nThe interviewer, almost invisible on stage, steepled his fingers. \"Talk more on that.\"\n\n\"Well, I think you have to take a look at the wholly unserious nature of the LeMay Administration. Wallace was bad enough with his, shall we say, peculiarities...\" The audience chuckled. \"But LeMay has wasted his political capital on what? A half-measure of a bill that, due to its failure, will do nothing to help alumni to combat the extreme ideologies taking root on campuses nationwide? I don't see him grappling with those disparaging the Christian, free-market principles the republic was founded on.\"\n\n\"What would you advise going forward then?\"\n\n\"Oh, pray that Western civilization survives the NPP's reckless approach to governance without too much damage.\" He said in a deadpan, hoping for an audience reaction. \"Other than that, I'd support good, reliable conservatives like Barry Goldwater who are actually capable of running a government and won't farm their work out to out-of-touch technocrats.\"\n\nThe audience began to clap as Buckley gave a contemptuous sneer. It was clear that LeMay had lost his support, that he and his conservative allies had found him lacking."

 USA_sen_bill_desc_65:0 "The American Relief and Recovery Act, better known as ABRA or the \"LeMay Business Tax Cuts\", is a major piece of legislation proposed by the LeMay administration to encourage economic growth. Building on promises made by Wallace and LeMay during the campaign in 1964, the bill reduces the tax burden on all American businesses. It would reduce corporate tax rates across the board, expand deductions available for large and small businesses, and offer incentives to otherwise encourage American companies to buy new equipment and promote further growth.\n\nWhile passage would represent an enormous achievement for the conservative movement and business leaders such as Donald Regan, some have noted the intentional way this bill appears to synthesize the priorities of major think tanks, lobbying groups, and influential senators. There are rumors that LeMay is using this bill to build a coalition for some larger proposal, but what this might be remains the subject of speculation."

It includes various provisions meant to spur free trade arrangements and otherwise \"strengthen mutual trade benefits in an open and nondiscriminating way.\"\n\nWhile the bill has enthusiastic support from the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups who extol the virtues of free trade in \"unshackling America's economic potential,\" the response in other quarters has been notably muted. Trade unions have expressed concern that unrestricted trade will undermine US wages and encourage manufacturers to relocate their factories overseas. Even the White House's support appears tepid, with the president offering bland platitudes about the ways the bill would expand OFN cooperation and little more. "
