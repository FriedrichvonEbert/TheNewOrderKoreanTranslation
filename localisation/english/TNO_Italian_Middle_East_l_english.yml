 ime.1.t:0 "레반트 총독부"
 ime.1.d:0 "The grand dreams of colonialism and an imperial Italy seemed so close to becoming reality. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the tricolour waved over the defeated British forts, as the victorious Regio Esercito advanced in the Middle East - after Egypt, Palestine soon fell, as the British lion bled under the talons of the Italian eagle. When Italian troops entered Jerusalem, Rome's propaganda took no time to paint the triumph as the mighty echo of an ancient past - the glorious legions, that had once brought order and peace to Judea under Vespasian and Trajan, have now returned to Palestine led by Benito Mussolini, the Caesar of our age.\n\nOf course, reality was much different, and its taste much more bitter. Native resistance to Italian occupation was strong, and the more the Italian Empire spread far and wide on the map, the more its forces were stretched thin on the ground. Fascist plans to turn the Levant into a loyal and Italian province of the Empire by assimilating the natives were soon canned, as opposition to Italy was one of the few things capable of uniting the various ethnic, religious and cultural groups in the region. Projects to resettle the Levant with Italians never left the drawing board, as the people of the peninsula preferred the much safer lands of the Fourth Shore, and after years of endless cycles of revolt and repression, the new Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, in his bid to resolve the many ailments of the Empire, finally decided that a new course of action was necessary.\n\nEnter Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa. In the Duce's eyes, the young general of the Carabinieri had three characteristics that made him especially fit for the position of governor - efficiency, demonstrated in his relatively short but dashing career, lack of sympathy for fascist rhetoric, and most of all, a complete lack of involvement or interest in politics. Since the beginning of Dalla Chiesa's tenure, a semblance of order returned to the Levant - with the new governor agreeing to allow autonomy and a moderate level of freedom to those who were content with that, and focusing the efforts of his garrison on the more radical paramilitaries and resistance groups. An uneasy peace was built in the Levant - a fickle, fragile truce, built to protect the many innocent civilians of the region, whatever their religion or ethnicity, from the horrors of what could very well be an endless, subterranean war."
 ime.1.a:0 "And yet, peace can't last."
 
 ime.2.t:0 "A Letter From Karameh"
 ime.2.d:0 "Riservatissimo - For the Governor's Eyes Only\n\nTo Governor Dalla Chiesa in Jerusalem, From the regional Carabinieri command in Karameh.\n\nWe would like to report to Your Excellency that the construction of the new headquarters of Fatah in the town of Karameh has been completed, and the current leader of the organization Arafat Yasser has taken residence in the structure. As per Your Excellency's orders, a Carabinieri garrison was situated in the vicinities of the village, and the bridge over the river Jordan that connects the location to the West Bank is kept under watch for any unauthorized movements. The offer of emir Hussein of garrisoning the bridge with soldiers from his own armed forces has been kindly declined.\n\nThe loyalty of the emir of Transjordan is still questionable at best, and he is still one of the main providers of funding for Fatah. However, we do not believe that any direct threats are coming from his court in Amman, as the main source of Hussein's wealth is the oil deals between Transjordan and ENI - which of course, would become null and void should he break the treaties that bind him to us. At any rate, any move against the emir would surely provoke a widespread insurrection, as he enjoys widespread popularity among his subjects in Transjordan and many conservative Arabs in Palestine. Interestingly, Hussein's alliance with Arafat doesn't seem to be exactly comfortable - the two have little in common, besides a somewhat shared goal of more independence from Italy.\n\nRegarding Arafat himself, we still recommend keeping him under close watch. Despite his young age, he enjoys immense popularity among the Arab youths in the West Bank, and while it is true that allowing Fatah to maintain her own paramilitaries was a necessary evil, they still represent a threat - especially considering that Arafat has consistently refused to back down from his requests for full independence and native rule. Still, we believe that for now breaking the truce would be against Arafat's own interests, as fortunately he places the well being of his own people over mad quests for vengeance - and he too fears the consequences that hostilities would inevitably bring, should they resume. In conclusion, while the current situation is far from ideal and will inevitably deteriorate in time, we would strongly advise against any offensive move against either Arafat or Hussein. The most appropriate course of actions would be to continue the negotiations and buy for time, until hopefully Rome realizes the untenability of our situation in the long term."
 ime.2.a:0 "Keep Amman and Karameh under close watch, but do nothing else for now."
 
 ime.3.t:0 "The Defense"
 ime.3.d:0 "The armored cars made their way along a dirt road, proceeding straight as a ruler along grain fields. Farmers in dirty clothes toiled the arid earth, as the scorching sun burned their skins, as the kibbutz came closer and closer into view. From the desert, life - fields, farms, animals, a small town, palm trees and flowers, defiant against the surrounding sand and rocks. Up above, the Italian flag flew in the wind, and right next to it, on a pole just as tall, the blue and white flag with the Star of David. When governor Dalla Chiesa stood up and left the car, a small band of soldiers stood to salute him - their uniforms kept impeccably, their weapons old but polished to a shine, despite having been just used in training. The local detachment of Haganah.\n\nThe kibbutz was ordinary, no different than all the others Dalla Chiesa had inspected in the past, all mostly concentrated around the areas where Jewish settlement was more prominent - around Tel Aviv and Haifa, and to the north near lake Tiberias. A town hall, a school with a playground in which children chased each other and kicked a ball around laughing and shouting, a small synagogue, rows and rows of small, clean and orderly houses. People of all ages walked around the streets of the village, busy in their daily mansions - kids, the first generation native to the kibbutz, young men growing strong and healthy by working in farms and shops, and smiling elderly people, hiding in their memories the horrors they had witnessed in the past. And around the village, watchtowers, barbed wire, and armed Haganah soldiers stood and watched, guns at the ready.\n\nWhen the Italian Empire began to allow Jewish refugees from the Reich in the Levant, accepting the existence of Haganah was a necessary, even if unspoken, part of that deal. After all, having a single self defense organization dedicated to protecting and policing the kibbutzim was a better solution for both the Jews and the Italians, especially considering the Haganah's self imposed policy of havlaga, or self-restraint - in other words, the Haganah never attacked, but only defended. The people of the kibbutzim, especially the elderly, had known what it meant to be defenseless in the face of horror - now, in their new home in the Levant, they would never be without a defense again."
 ime.3.a:0 "Order military patrols to steer clear of the kibbutzim in this region - no need to provoke tensions."
 
 ime.4.t:0 "The Battle of Latrun"
 ime.4.d:0 "Truck tracks, footprints, blood. Italian soldiers running around, rifles in their hands, with officers shouting orders. Women crying in the streets, boys shouting insults and spitting on the ground while a soldier searches them and another one points a rifle at their backs. One tries to make a run for it, a burly Regio Esercito soldiers knocks him unconscious with the butt of his rifle, and two of his teeth fly away from his mouth. And in the middle of the chaos, the shouting, the crying, one man stands still, staring at the still warm corpses, covered with a white blanket - governor Dalla Chiesa.\n\nNobody knows yet how the Irgun commando managed to reach the village of Latrun, so far into Arab territory. The Carabinieri are still busy analyzing the scene, interrogating witnesses, examining corpses. They were a few dozens, and surrounded the town at night, attacking at dawn. For Irgun, Latrun has a symbolic meaning, as it sits on the only road connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - but otherwise, it's only one of many tiny Arab villages scattered around Palestine. Perhaps this is why Irgun expected no resistance - their commando, numbering a few dozens, planned to attack at dawn, sweeping into the village, and causing mayhem before the Italians or anyone else had time to react. Instead, what they found was a sleeper cell of the ANM, which had set up shop long ago in Latrun.\n\nThe battle broke out immediately, and devolved into house by house fighting when Irgun units managed to enter the village. Gunfire was heard for hours, before the closest Italian division was able to encircle Latrun and mop up the remnants of the Irgun commando and the ANM fedayeen. Numerous civilians lost their lives in the short but violent battle, but among both Irgun and ANM soldiers, casualties were extremely high, and Italian troops even managed to take prisoners from both sides - a rather rare occurrence. Ironically, a tragedy such as this proved itself helpful. Dalla Chiesa turned away, and looked at the soldiers surrounding him. Something had to be done."
 ime.4.a:0 "Take care of the wounded civilians and set up a defensive perimeter. New orders will arrive shortly."
 
 ime.5.t:0 "Scopi e Metodi dell'Irgun Zvaì Leumi B'Eretz-Israel"
 ime.5.d:0 ""As you know, Irgun, officially known as National Military Organization in the Land of Israel, is a clandestine paramilitary and terrorist movement operating in the entirety of the Levant. It was founded in 1931, from a small core of hardline Zionists, and it expanded slowly, absorbing smaller Zionist groups. Their ideology can be summed up in three points: first, every Jew has the right to enter Palestine; second, only active retaliation can stop the Arabs from encroaching on rightful Jewish land; third, only Jewish armed force can ensure a Jewish state. Their goal is simple - to turn the entirety of the Levant into a Jewish state.\n\nThey don't claim just Palestine, either - their aims include Transjordan as well. They're not afraid to extensively use violence against both Italian soldiers and Arab civilians. Their organization is rigid, with a well organized military hierarchy, and especially shadowy - they have contacts in many kibbutzim, Jewish communities and Haganah units scattered around the Levant, and every single Jew in the Governorate could potentially be a member or supporter of Irgun. While we do know the names of some of Irgun's major leaders, including their commander Menachem Begin, we have little actual information that would allow us to strike them precisely. They are a dangerous enemy, hiding behind every corner and every stone, and they will not hesitate to pull the trigger if they have you in your sights."\n\nDalla Chiesa stopped, and the Carabinieri generals and officers gathered in the room stood silent. Maps, diagrams, charts and photographs were hung on the walls and scattered on the table of the dimly lit room, as cigarette smoke filled the air. "Of course, a traditional counter insurgency campaign would be a disaster. There is no way to tell apart an Irgun affiliate with any average Haganah soldier or even any ordinary Jew - it would result in a massacre, and would break any good will existing between us and Haganah, eventually increasing Irgun's popularity among the Jews. A new tactic has to be employed.""
 ime.5.a:0 "Dismissed."
 
 ime.6.t:0 "Rapporto sull'Harakat al-Qawimin al-Arab"
 ime.6.d:0 "Riservatissimo - For the Governor's eyes only\n\nTo Governor Dalla Chiesa, Jerusalem From the regional Carabinieri command in Latrun.\n\nWe would like to report to Your Excellency that the interrogations of captives taken in following the events in Latrun has provided us with valuable information about the nature of the armed Palestinian resistance movements. After extensive application of persuasive interrogation methods, we have managed to learn that despite acting under a single name, the fedayeen fighting for the Harakiyyin have actually no idea about the overall operational status, tactical plans or even composition of ANM units different from their own.\n\nThis has led us to conclude that the ANM is organized in a loose and decentralized network of cells, each acting on their own and largely independent from one another. The chairman of the ANM, George Habash, is currently suspected to be hiding somewhere in the Lebanese highlands, and doesn't seem have to have much control over the organization. While nominally a communist movement, the ideological purity of the ANM seems shaky at best - when interrogated on the topic, the Latrun captives demonstrated only an extremely cursory knowledge of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and other classics of communist thought, and seemed to be motivated above all else by Arab nationalist, anti-Italian and anti-Zionist rhetoric.\n\nWe are led to believe that the ANM is in fact not a single movement, but a loose coalition of numerous pre-existing cells and organizations, united by their opposition to Italian rule and a decentralized chain of command. While apparently a weakness, this characteristic is also the ANM's greatest strength - such a movement is effectively impossible to decapitate, and focusing on eliminating one cell will do nothing against the organization at large, as its other parts can continue operating autonomously. We were not able to effectively confirm or deny the existence of ties between ANM cells and Fatah. The Latrun captives have been hospitalized following the interrogation, and will be transferred to the closest internment camp after they recover."
 ime.6.a:0 "File this report in the archives."
 
 ime.7.t:0 "Operation Masada"
 ime.7.d:0 "Dalla Chiesa drank the last sip of coffee, by now disgustingly lukewarm, and put the cup back on the desk. Scattered on his desk, piles of documents, reports, interrogation logs, photographs, maps, all marked with coffee stains and pen markings and annotations. In this kibbutz near Haifa, there might be an Irgun commander disguised as a Haganah sergeant - this remote village in Transjordan could be the location of an ANM hidden arsenal - and at least a dozen different dots on the map of Palestine could be the location of the next Latrun massacre.\n\nThere are many in the Levant who hate Italy and everything it stands for, but those who are willing to pick up arms fueled by that hate, usually hate someone else even more. Divide et impera, the Romans said - and no place is more divided than the Italian Levant. There is only one way to deal with ANM and Irgun, and that is making them deal with each other - while at the same time making sure that the thin line protecting the civilians from the chaos is always occupied by an Italian soldier. The people of the Levant will learn that we are the only hope for peace in the country, and if that they'll have to work with us if they hope to bring an end to the bloodshed - and God knows, these lands, these people, have already seen too much blood.\n\nThe governor gathered the necessary documents into one large envelope. In it was a plan to ensure that the garrison could keep the Levant under control without excessive costs in money or lives, just for a few more years. Many in Rome wouldn't like it, and perhaps the goons in the PNF should be left unaware of the finer details. After all, Ciano would surely understand - this is for the greater good of Italy. Dalla Chiesa closed the envelope, and looked once again at the letters printed on the outside.\n\nOperation Masada."

 ime.8.t:0 "Operations against Irgun - Success!" 
 ime.8.d:0 "Our recent attempts to provoke armed conflict between the forces of Irgun and the Harakiyyin appear to have been a resounding success. According to recent reports by the Carabinieri, fifty Irgun terrorists travelling along a stretch of desert in search of a supposed newly established village (the location - and existence - of which we have fabricated) found themselves ambushed in the early morning by an ANM raiding party, as planned. While the Irgun fighters retaliated with their characteristic fury, the ANM possessed better weapons - not to mention more time to plan. In the end, the Irgun fighters barely escaped, leaving twenty of their own behind to rot in the desert sand. \n \n Irgun's activity throughout the Levant has dropped drastically as they slink back to their dens to lick their wounds, leaving the Harakiyyin the stronger power - for now. George Habash has not made a public statement on the matter, although our spies in the ANM inform us he is growing more confident of victory by the day."

He had to find a new home - there was nothing left in Wilna but death and ash.\n\nHe had wandered for years through the wastes the Nazis had created. Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, he had seen them all, seen their horrors, and seen what they had done to people. Still he pressed one. When he arrived in Italy, he dared not show his face. They said the Italians treated the Jews well - but they had also said that about the Nazis all those years ago. He wondered what he would find at his ultimate destination - more camps? More death? Perhaps he'd find more Kovners and Wilnas.\n\nWhen he stepped onto the Kibbutz, he did not know what he was looking at. The people seemed calm, happy, safe. He watched a child run to her mother, laughing. He turned his head again and saw a young man chatting nervously with a girl.

 #Israel - Palestine Ideas#
 ISR_dream_realised:0 "the Dream Realised"
 ISR_dream_realised_desc:0 "For 2000 years, the Jewish people have wished for a place to call home, and for the first time, this wish has been granted. A Jewish homeland has been founded in the Levant, and the Jewish people now have a place where they can live without fear of extermination and oppression. However, our situation is precarious. We must carefully navigate the many internal and external threats facing our nation if our homeland is to remain free. We have fought for too long to allow this dream to be crushed."
 ISR_ethnic_demon:0 "the Ethnic Demon"
 ISR_ethnic_demon_desc:0 "The Mapai may dominate Israel, but the Ashkenazi dominate Mapai. The leadership holds what some call a superiority complex over the other Jewish ethnicities, and their policies reflect this. This influence ranges from economically favoring Kibbutzim, to other, more discriminatory policies. While opposition to these views are making their voices heard, the Mapai's dominance within the political sphere means the situation likely won't change anytime soon."
 ISR_brittle_brittle_alliance:0 "A Brittle Brittle Alliance"
 ISR_brittle_brittle_alliance_desc:0 "The Jewish Resistance Movement was a broad coalition quickly formed to oppose the communist regime created by Habash. It was not an alliance formed from political or economic agreement, but an alliance made for survival.\n\nHowever, this has led to the new state being incredibly divided by wildly different beliefs, and the JRM's different factions struggle to agree on even the simplest of things."
 PAL_The_Land_Liberated:0 "Palestine, Liberated"
 PAL_The_Land_Liberated_desc:0 "After decades of struggle against fascistic imperialism where much was lost, every son and daughter of Palestine can now raise their heads unbowed and unashamed, for they have a homeland of their own. Nonetheless, the struggle has taken its toll on our nation. Blood and sweat have given birth to our nation; Many lives and much labor. Now we must ensure that it can never be lost again - securing our independence by the pen and the rifle alike. And, most of all, all of Palestine must work towards building a true homeland, so that our nation may be proud to call each of us her children."
 PAL_Fatah_Triumphant:0 "Fatah, Triumphant!"
 PAL_Fatah_Triumphant_desc:0 "Through careful political maneuvers and a great many promises to almost every party involved in the Levant, Fatah and the charismatic Arafat have wound up as the most legitimate authority in the Palestinian quarters of the Levant. Energetic, young, and immensely popular, Fatah is determined to prove itself as the only faction that can lead an Arab Palestine into both peace and prosperity through cooperation with her neighbors. It has paid off. Arafat's name is well known across the Levant as the man that won Palestine her independence - and the only man capable of leading her to a stable future."
 PAL_The_Spectre_Of_Corruption:0 "the Spectre of Corruption"
 PAL_The_Spectre_Of_Corruption_desc:0 "One could wonder how exactly Fatah has still managed to maintain its leadership over the wide spectrum of Palestinian parties and armed organizations. If one went along with that line of questioning, they would find themselves mired in a web of promises, underhanded deals, and bribes stretching across the Levantine Union.\n\nFatah, for the most part, has kept its head above the water, but several within the organization seem to conflate the words "Peace" and "Profit." This has not gone unnoticed by members of the opposition, and unless this specter of corruption is dispelled soon, a complacent Fatah could find its leadership and legitimacy challenged by a myriad of opponents vying for the coveted positions of leadership the party has secured."
 PAL_The_King_And_His_Legion:0 "the King and his Legion"
 PAL_The_King_And_His_Legion_desc:0 "King Hussien of the Levant is many things. A reformer and a pragmatist to his supporters, and a repressive, authoritarian autocrat to his opponents. This difference of opinions matters little to the crown, but not the Arab Legion. A professional force trained and equipped once by the British Empire and then by the Italian. Political repression has been a hallmark of the monarchy's recent history and has only reached new heights as their reign extended to the Levant.\n\nHeavy-handed violence, regular army patrols in civilian territories, and an all but undeclared state of martial law have all contributed to an appearance of stability - and a reality of severe suppression for all those accused of fermenting opposition, be it purely political, Arab, Jewish, Shiite, or Maronite. Many wonder how long this trend of military despotism will continue unquestioned before it is met by an equally militant and radical opposition."
 ISR_Jewish_Unrest:0 "Jewish Unrest"
 ISR_Jewish_Unrest_desc:0 "From the perspective of the Levant's sizable Jewish minority, the handover from Italian to Arab rule has been akin to going out of the frying pan and into the fire. The hostility of the government towards them has created widespread feelings of anger, insecurity, and disenfranchisement, a simmering cauldron of rebellious sentiment that can only end one way: by boiling over into mass rebellion. The Hussein regime's ability to avoid bloodshed seems less likely by the hour."
 ISR_Demands_For_Democracy:0 "Demands for Democracy"
 ISR_Demands_For_Democracy_desc:0 "If Hussein's belief was that the Arab population of the Levant would be automatically endeared to the government solely because the king shared their ethnicity, he was evidently sorely mistaken. Many of the younger generations see little difference between the autocracy of colonialism and the present dictatorship, and pro-democracy sentiment is expanding exponentially within the population. Although the power of the army prevents these feelings from amounting to much yet, the future could pose a challenge for the king's ability to retain power."
 ISR_Mapai_Dominance:0 "Mapai Dominance"
 ISR_Mapai_Dominance_desc:0 "In the wake of the Jerusalem Conference, the Haganah have transitioned from protectors of Jewish settlements in the Levant, to governing the young nation of Israel. Now known as the Mapai, or the "Workers' Party of Israel," they have effectively become the face of the new state. For better or for worse, the Mapai dominate Israel's politics, economy, and culture. While some celebrate their progressive policies and reforms, others are wary of their paramilitary past."

 POLITICS_GG_CHIESA_DESC:0 "카를로 알베르토 달라 치에사 총독의 기상천외한 경력은 많은 사람들을 놀라게 합니다. 제2차 세계 대전의 훈장을 받은 베테랑인 달라 치에사는 카라비니에리 장군이었던 그의 아버지의 뒤를 따르기 위해 육군에서 카라비니에리로 자리를 옮겼습니다. 전쟁이 끝난 후, 그는 레반트에 있는 새로 획득한 영토로 배속되었고, 그는 그 지역을 괴롭혔던 다양한 테러리스트들과 준군사 집단을 조사하고 억압하는 과정에서 그의 기술과 용기를 보여주었습니다. 불순분자들의 체포에 체포가 잇따랐고, 그는 카라비니에리 내에서 빠르게 진급해 결국 갈레아초 치아노의 눈에 띄게 되었습니다.\n\n새로운 총독을 레반트에 임명할 때가 되었을 때, 신임 두체는 또 다른 늙은 파시스트를 선택하는 대신 젊은 장군을 후계자로 선택했습니다. 그는 파시즘성향이 거의 없다는 것이 잘 알려져 있었기 때문에, 그 선택은 논란의 여지가 있었습니다. 그의 짧은 재임 기간 동안 카라비니에리 장군은 비록 비정통적인 방법을 사용해야 했더라도, 레반트에 겉보기나마 평화로움을 가져다 주었습니다. 로마는 결과를 기대했고, 이것이 바로 달라 치에사가 그들에게 보여준 것입니다-극단주의 반군 단체들은 억압의 표적이 되었고, 반면에 협상할 용의가 있는 사람들은 휴전을 받아들였습니다. 하지만 레반트의 운명은 여전히 위태롭습니다.\n\n치에사는 이 지역에 대한 이탈리아의 통치는 오래가지 못할 것이라 믿고 있고, 이 지역이 다시 혼란에 빠지지 않는 한 이탈리아와 레반트의 많은 민족들 사이의 어떠한 형태의 합의가 이루어져야 한다고 여기고 있습니다. 카라비니에리 총독은 평화 비슷한 것을 레반트에 돌려주는데 성공했습니다. 그것이 얼마나 오래 지속될지는 아직 미지수입니다."
 
 POLITICS_Umberto_La_Rocca_DESC:0 "It's said that the destinies of people are decided in the very moment of their birth, and in the case of Umberto La Rocca, that might be true. Born in Port Said from an Italian father and a French mother, young Umberto soon became fluent in three languages, including Arabic - because of this, he was attached to Arab troops in World War Two, fighting with distinction as an officer in North Africa and the Levant against the British. After the war, La Rocca started a brilliant diplomatic career, being sent on missions all over Europe and even to the U.S., where he represented Italy and her nascent empire.\n\nAmbassador La Rocca returned to his homeland in recent times, tasked with yet another mission. For years, the Levant has been a hotbed of conflict, but since the Jerusalem Conference ended with the partition of the Governorate, a fragile new order has been set up in the region, and Jerusalem itself is at the centre of it. Established as a corpus separatum, Jerusalem is a neutral area, garrisoned by Italian troops and administered by a council of representatives of the many religious and ethnic communities which make up the population of the world's holiest city - and at the head of the council sits La Rocca, the impartial and neutral negotiator tasked with making sure that conflicts are defused, crises are resolved, and everyone gets to go home safely at night.\n\nNow, La Rocca knows that from him depends not only the future of Jerusalem as a safe haven for peace among the peoples, but also that of the Levant itself - for while both Palestine and Israel reluctantly accepted the establishment of the corpus separatum, the volatile nature of Levantine politics means that a threat may arise suddenly and with no warning. Only time will tell if the Holy City will be the keystone for building a lasting peace in the Levant, or the eye of a newly risen storm."
 
 POLITICS_Ahmed_Jibril_DESC:0 "Ahmed Jibril was never one for compromise. In his view, things in the Levant were simple, and plain for all to see. Palestine was inhabited by Arabs since ancient times - then, Western imperialists and their Zionist lackeys occupied the country, stole land, displaced inhabitants and claimed lives for the sake of their vile ambition and greed. The Palestinians wanted to resist, but alas, their leaders were grossly unfit to the task: cowards like Arafat, ready to sell his own country in exchange for empty promises of peace, puppets like Hussein, too content lining his pockets with lire to care about his homeland, and morons like Habash, too busy philosophizing to do anything useful.\n\nAnd so, the Palestinian Liberation Front - General Command was founded by Jibril and a small group of Palestinian fighters. Its goal - to liberate Palestine from the oppressor and the Jew. Its methods - anything and everything that could bring about its goal. The PLF-GC rapidly went from obscurity to becoming the most prominent Arab militia in the country, as many turned to the only group who was truly willing to fight for them. And wherever the PLF-GC went, terror, bloodshed and death soon followed - for no price was too great for the liberation of Palestine.\n\nNow, the Italians are gone, and Jibril and his men are finally in control of the country. And yet, their work is far from over. The Zionist snake still lurks, ready to spread its poison once again, and from all directions, threats are already emerging against the newly liberated Palestine. With any means necessary, Jibril and the PLF-GC intend to make sure that nobody can ever enslave Palestine and its Arab people ever again, and that the eternal Jew gets the payback it deserves for trying to steal what belongs to the Palestinians."
 
 #POLITICS_Hussein_ibn_Talal_DESC:0 "Once, the name of Hussein ibn Talal, scion of the Hashemites, was merely one among many others in the long list of native rulers, tribal chiefs and petty kings, vassals to Italy's vast empire, the prestige of his dynasty barely elevating him above the others. His father Talal had agreed to renew the treaty of protection with Italy that his own father Abdullah had signed, but in later years, Talal's severe mental illness made him completely unfit even for the role of a puppet, and it was so that the young prince Hussein became Emir of Transjordan.\n\nEver since then, Hussein worked vigorously to develop his fiefdom - always presenting himself as a staunch ally of Italy while secretly supporting the fedayeen, and closely working with ENI and other Italian businesses to exploit Transjordan's vast resources while pocketing a massive hoard of wealth. Still, the emir's apparent loyalty was rewarded by Rome, and Transjordan was given considerable autonomy inside the Levant, even being allowed its own army. The more Palestine descended into ethnic strife and open rebellion, the more Transjordan became closer to a model protectorate: stable, prosperous, and loyal.\n\nHussein used his wealth and connections to gain Italy's trust, and so it was not surprising that after Italian hegemony in the Middle East was reaffirmed following the Second Italo-Turkish War, Rome saw that only an Arab king could keep the region stable in the long run. Now, Hussein, newly crowned King of the Levant, is in control of a new, hopeful Arab nation: however, the future already casts dark shadows upon his reign. Between the emir's autocratic tendencies and rising Jewish resistance to the new Arab majority kingdom, Italy's gamble to rely on Hussein's loyalty may soon prove to be a grave mistake..."

 POLITICS_JORDAN_ABDULLAH_I_DESC:0 "The Name of Abdullah Ibn Hussein is one that sparks controversy, for some he may be a freedom-fighter who tries his best to counter the demands of the occupier and ensure the interests of his people, while for others he is no more than the lapdog of imperialists who betrayed his people and the legacy of his father. However, the truth is far more complicated than either the vilification or glorification of the man that has come to define 3 decades of Hashemite rule over the lands of Jordan.\n\n Born in 1882 to the future Sharif of Mecca, Abdullah would see his father revolt against the Ottoman caliph and their imperialist hold over Arabia and would lead his armies into the conflict, reigniting the once dim sparks of Arab nationalism. The Arabs revolted and the dream of a unified Arab state was over the horizon, yet it never came. The Arabs were partitioned into monarchies, each ruled by a son of the Sharif. The daring Abdullah was offered the throne of Iraq, but he refused it, instead opting to serve as Emir of the newly christened Protectorate of Transjordan. Abdullah would dutifully serve his country and the needs of his people into the dawn of the Second World War.\n\n As the Axis powers advanced into the Middle East and occupied the former British holdings, Abdullah would pledge his Allegiance to Italy in hopes of maintaining his rule under the Italian eagle. Though the Italians would remain distrustful of him due to his British collaboration and his struggle to balance the Italian interests with that of his own people, they would nevertheless, recognize his efficiency and administrative skills especially in comparison to the neighbouring governors in Palestine.\n\n  However, not all would be good for the Emir, as the Palestinian Jihad of Al Husayni would see an assassination attempt, an attempt that would reverberate throughout the Hashemite dynasty, cracking it into halves. As the King of the Arabs looms towards his death, the tension between these two factions of liberals and collaborationists sears."
 POLITICS_JORDAN_NAYEF_DESC:0 "Is the preservation of one's dynasty worth the betrayal of their ideals and the very virtues and principles that were once cherished by them? While the intellectuals with their romantic concepts of nationalism and democracy might say no, Nayef bin Abdallah of Jordan sees things in a different light.\n\nBorn in 1914 at the dawn of the First World War, Nayef was still young when his grandfather organized a revolt against the Turks, he did not experience that time of intensified nationalism in the region, instead, he only saw travesty as he matured. First the fall of the Hashemite stronghold of Hejaz, then the removal of the Hashemite King in Syria due to his overly dignified insistence on nationalism that brought him nothing but ruin, then worst of all the butchering of the Hashemites in Iraq like animals to the slaughterhouse. Nayef could not help but wonder if he and his father were next? The Prince's head would remain spinning with confusion and hesitancy at his own question.\n\n However, he would not remain undecided for long. The outbreak of Al-Husayni's Jihad would prove to be a turning point for him. His father was marked by Al-Husayni and targeted for assassination, but by some miracle from God himself, the bullet would miss. However, its consequences would echo in the prince's mind and the House of Hashim as a whole. To Nayef everything became obvious. Only by suppressing these so-called independence movements and aligning themselves further with the Italians could the King's head avoid the guillotine.\n\nThough he has always been his father's favoured son, Nayef still has the opposition of his brother and the court liberals. Nevertheless, the king remains committed to preventing the fall of the last bastion of Hashemite rule."
 POLITICS_JORDAN_HUSSEIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1935, Hussein ibn Talal was always the favourite of many, even his grandfather did not believe either of his sons could be king, instead seeing potential in his grandson Hussein and treating him with extra care and privilege. The young and charismatic prince made the masses cheer, while his father was mistrusted for his supposed lunacy, and his uncle jeered on as a traitor and bootlicker.\n\n Hussein has lived his entire life under an occupied Jordan, one exploited and colonized, first by the British and then by the Italians, and like his namesake before him, Hussein has forever despised this situation. He saw the misery of his people, whether Jordanian or Palestinian, and how they were crushed under the weight of the Italian Empire. The people dreamt of liberty, of freedom, of independence, yet their dreams were stolen from them.\n\nAngry with the exploitation of his people and wishing to see them set free, Hussein grew renowned for his idea of a "Liberal Experiment" and anti-Italian rhetoric, effectively becoming the face of Jordanian reformism and his father's deputy in the liberal faction of the royal court. Furthermore, his desire and wishes to see his people grow happier, see their dreams fulfilled, and their lives improved, has seen him grow increasingly popular with the common toiler.\n\nThe beloved King marches with his people onto new horizons with plans to continue the democratization efforts that his father started and advance the people's will. Hussein has even approached moderate pro-Italian and leftist movements in hopes of reaching common ground with them for the common benefit of his people and country. However, many remain doubtful of the monarch's sincerity and commitment to democratization, despite his own nationalist and liberal credentials; suspicions that may just be proven correct as he begins to clash with the more republican elements of Jordanian politics."
 POLITICS_NAYEF_HAWATMEH_JOR_DESC:0 ""
 
 POLITICS_George_Habash_DESC:0 "George Habash's rise to prominence was one fraught with hardship, pain, tears, and blood. Born into a Palestinian Christian family, as a young man Habash immediately joined the Arab fedayeen against the Italian occupation of the Levant following World War Two. A convinced Marxist, Habash founded the Arab Nationalist Movement, a wide front of socialists, communists and left-wing Arab nationalists fighting against Italian and Zionist occupation of the Levant - waging a violent guerrilla war against the fascist invaders while declaring their commitment to turn the Levantine lands into an independent, non-denominational, socialist republic.\n\nDespite internal divisions among the Levantine Arabs, largely thanks to Arafat attempting to sell his land to fascists and Zionists from under his own feet and Hussein's unrepentant reaction and greed - Habash and the ANM have finally achieved their revolutionary goals. The peoples of the Levant rose up against imperialism and bigotry, a crowning victory after years of popular struggle, and the country now marches ahead to build its new future, with Comrade Secretary-General Habash charting the course.\n\nHowever, Habash's struggle is far from over. Zionist militias such as Irgun, and even large sections of the Haganah, have taken up a bitter resistance against the new People's Republic, and among the Arab people, reactionary and fundamentalist sentiments still creep like a snake in the darkness, spreading their counter-revolutionary poison among the people. Now, Habash must defend what he conquered - defend the people, defend the idea, defend the Revolution. Only time will tell if the light of socialism will live on in the Levant, or if its flame will be stamped out by the rising darkness."

 ime_hotline_jerusalem_desc:0 "Since the end of World War Two, the Levant has been one of the most troublesome areas of the newly acquired Italian empire. Ethnic conflicts, fierce resistance to Italian rule, and an inhospitable terrain have made the region into a hotbed of insurgency and rebellion, and the continuous crackdowns and repression of the past have proved ineffective. Now, a semblance of peace has been achieved in the Levant, as an uneasy truce has been brokered between the Italians, Haganah, and Fatah - however, governor Dalla Chiesa knows that such a situation is not destined to last. We must continue to solidify the existing relationships between us and our reluctant allies, otherwise all hope of maintaining the region stable will be lost."
 ime_yesh_matzav:0 "Yesh Matzav"
 ime_yesh_matzav_desc:0 ""The situation" - this is how the many Jews of the Levant refer to the somewhat peculiar circumstances they live in. Many of them were already here before World War Two, but a significant wave of Jewish immigrants reached the shores of Palestine during the chaos that rocked the Nazi empire in the 50s - as Italy decided to let them in and give them a place to settle in their ancestral homeland, hoping to gain a loyal ally in governing the region. Reality was much different, of course - the Jews weren't interested in becoming loyal subjects of Italy but much preferred to keep to themselves, and now some half a million Jews live in the territories of the Italian Levant, most of them concentrated in northern Palestine. Keeping the majority of the Jewish population content with our rule is fundamental to maintaining peace in the region, as it is the only way to contain the spread of Irgun and radical Zionist ideas."
 ime_confirm_kibbutzim_self_rule:0 "Confirm Kibbutzim Self-Rule"
 ime_confirm_kibbutzim_self_rule_desc:0 "Although many Jews of the Levant live in large cities, especially Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem, most of them live in newly built settlements in the countryside, known as kibbutzim. A kibbutz is a collective community, usually based on agriculture, which aims to be self sufficient and to be able to protect itself from attacks, with numerous kibbutzim having their own garrisons affiliated with Haganah. While initially there were attempts to directly govern the kibbutzim, we soon discovered that allowing them to autonomously govern themselves is a much better and cheaper option, as most of the Jews living there are simply looking to live their lives free of oppression and persecution. We shall push for new legislation confirming and expanding the autonomy of the kibbutzim, and reinforcing our pact with Haganah to allow them to defend themselves."
 ime_crackdown_on_illegal_settlements:0 "Crackdown on Illegal Settlements"
 ime_crackdown_on_illegal_settlements_desc:0 "One of the major causes of contention and discord between the Jews and other populations of the region, chiefly the Arabs, is land issues. When Jews were settled in the Levant, they were assigned some of the most fertile and rich land in the region, much to the dismay of the native Arabs who wished to keep it for themselves.

However, these illegal immigrants represent a problem - often impoverished and either sheltered by a kibbutzim or living in poor quarters of large cities such as Haifa and Tel Aviv, they often escape our grasp and are in danger of being radicalized by Irgun.

This policy is known as Havlaga, the Hebrew word for "self-restraint".

Yitzhak Rabin, the supreme commander of Haganah, is not only an expert commander but also a charismatic politician and a skilled negotiator, and someone we would very much as a friend, rather than as an enemy.

Formally a part of the Regio Esercito, the Carabinieri largely have their own autonomous command structure, and have always been present in large numbers in the Levant, with governor Dalla Chiesa himself coming from the ranks of the Carabinieri. The relative autonomy of the Carabinieri means that, especially here in the Levant, they are rather uninvolved in the politics and scheming that tends to happen in the high command in Rome, and their general lack of sympathy for fascism is all the more reason why they should be kept firmly in place as the cornerstone of the garrison."

Then, the stay behind units will attack the rear of the advancing Turkish troops, and then our main force will counterattack the Turks as they're taken by surprise. We expect to be able to inflict massive losses to the enemy this way, greatly slowing down their advance and hopefully convincing them that this war simply isn't worth it."

By doing target bombing runs and swift commando raids, we can greatly damage the flow of supplies from mainland Turkey, by destroying roads and railways as well as blowing up the convoys themselves. The Turkish troops won't be able to resist much without equipment or fuel, and when they're starving and deprived of ammunition we'll be able to sweep them away!"

Our victory was largely due to an ace up our sleeve - the Regia Aeronautica. Italy was one of the first countries to develop a powerful air force, and it was the first country in history that utilize airplanes to bomb enemy troops, during the First Italo-Turkish War itself. Now that the Second Italo-Turkish War is upon us, we can remember that as we beat them once, we can beat them again.

To them, it will look like our forces are everywhere, ready to strike at any time, even behind their own lines - and they will realize that for every inch of territory held by us, they will have to pay a high price in material and men."

With our recent overtures to the Jews, we might able to broker a truce with Irgun, at least for the duration of the war - this would allow us to focus our efforts on the Turks, but it would understandably greatly upset the Arabs in the region."

By creating a joint planning board including Haganah and Arab Legion officers and generals overseen by us, we'll be able to coordinate Jewish and Arab efforts against the Turkish menace. Sure, this will inevitably cause scuffles and the first meetings of Arab and Jewish officers will likely turn into shouting matches, but the steady and devastating march of the Turkish menace leaves us with little choice - fight together, or die alone."

For Arafat and Fatah, the most dangerous enemy of the Palestinian and Arab people is no longer the encroaching Zionist plans of domination, but the oppressive yoke that Turkey wishes to place on Palestine just as it did on Syria - and for Haganah, the greatest obstacle to a Jewish homeland is no longer the terrorism committed by the Arabs, but the ever expanding tyranny of the Turkish state. While they certainly don't love each other, Arabs and Jews are now somewhat more willing to tolerate each other in the face of a common enemy, and that already is a sign for hope."

The Levant was unstable before the war and the defeat at the hands of the Turks had eradicated any pretense of stability. The Arabs and Jews had believed, at the very least, that the Italian presence provided some sense of security. That was clearly no longer true.\n\nDalla Chiesa heard an engine roar to his left followed by the screech of tires on pavement and shouting in Hebrew. He turned and saw two guards collapse into a pile of blood, their throats ripped open. The sound of the gunshots seemed to reach him later than the bullets reached their targets. He looked down the alley from where the gunshots had originated. A single car, black, was barreling towards him.\n\nScreams filled the air, Dalla Chiesa's included. He wanted to run but he couldn't. The parade wasn't advancing. His Ferrari wasn't moving. He wasn't moving! The car was going to hit him!\n\nThe black car rammed into Dalla Chiesa's Ferrari.

The only thing these animals understand is violence." He pointed to several cities on the map laid out in front of him. "Begin executions here, here, and here. Twenty fives Jews and twenty five Arabs each day until someone comes forward with information about Dalla Chiesa's assassination.

Early on in the day Prime Minister Ciano received an urgent call from Jerusalem telling him that Governor Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, talented adminstrator and personal friend, was shot dead by unidentified terrorists. A hastily written speech about the development had to be delivered to members of the PNF shortly, and the Duce found himself with little time to truly comprehend the magnitude of what had happened. Scribbling down minor notes about the governor's career into a short obituary, Ciano felt a true and muted dread over what would come next.\n\nOnce the meeting was officially in session, his fears proved to be well-justified. Scorza and his party of hardlines gave him no pause, denouncing Chiesa's "lenient policies" as cause for his untimely death, and insulting everything the man had ever done to sow the seeds of peace. Instead, they called for Francesco Colombo to be made governor of the Levant immediately, in order to 'restore Order' to the province and ensure that Italy's grip on the levant remains as tight as it can be. Colombo's appointment barely passes the vote, with a considerable minority abstaining. They could not concede the appointment to Scorza's man, but Chiesa's policies could not be supported when the man himself was filled with bullets when they failed.

For the first time in weeks news coming from Jeruislame could be described as positive to the regime, and there was no reason to believe they would not continue to be this way, as the governor's "Special directives" regarding various resistance movements and how to best dispense with them showed no sign of slowing down. This week they were concerned with a recently discovered cache of Arab explosives east of Gaza, and how they would be captured and handled by the week's end...\n\nIn a half-collapsed mud hut on the outskirts of the small village of Najd, Haneen held on to her two children with all the power she could muster, wailing at the Blackshirt brutes whenever they asked her where her husband had gone, where he his his belongings, when he would be coming back. After what felt like years of torment the kicks and the rifle butts went away, leaving her half-conscious, but alive. Her elder was crying, and so she murmured an old song that she had first heard decades ago to calm the boy.

Leave the Jews and the Arabs to deal with the endless lists of dead and wounded, Italy has bled long enough for strips of desert and orchads of orange trees.

As Italian forces withdraw, both the Zionist Irgun and Marxist Arab National Movement paramilitaries have crawled out of the woodwork. Already, reports are coming in of pitched battles between the two forces that will determine the fate of the Levant. Whoever emerges the victor will be tasked with bringing order to a war-torn region populated by two ethnic groups that increasingly cannot stand each other's presence.

The case for prioritizing water for the Kibbutzim is obvious -- agriculture is generally water-intensive. However, the Palestinian delegation has lobbied for water to be prioritized for Arab villages, so that they may practice their own form of agriculture. In the end, it is Italy's decision as to who gets the most water."
 jercon.3.a:0 "Jewish Kibbutzim."
 jercon.3.b:0 "Arab Villages."
 
 jercon.4.t:0 "Agricultural Subsidies"
 jercon.4.d:0 "Agricultural subsidies have historically been used to fund the general modernization of Levantine agriculture. Now, they are being fought over by both sides over who gets the lion's share of the money. Various arguments such as the relative lack of irrigation in Palestinian farms or the continued expansion of Kibbutzim have been brought up. Once more, both delegations look to Italy to decide this issue, as the mediator of the conference."
 jercon.4.a:0 "The Jews will receive subsidies."
 jercon.4.b:0 "Fund the Palestinians."
 
 jercon.5.t:0 "The Nomad Question"
 jercon.5.d:0 "Bedouin nomads roam around the south, where small skirmishes have taken place between them and other settlers, over various land disputes as well as consumption of resources. The Palestinian delegation has called for more legal protections for the Bedouins, as well as incentives for nomads to urbanize. The Jews, on the other hand, argue that the status quo is fine as-is, and that funds should be focused on better issues such as poverty and infrastructure overhauls. Once more, Italy must rule on this issue."
 jercon.5.a:0 "Less Protection."
 jercon.5.b:0 "More Protection."
 
 jercon.6.t:0 "Where The Black Gold Flows"
 jercon.6.d:0 "Unlike the rest of the Middle East, the Levant has little oil deposits, forcing it to rely on outside sources for its needs. As such, an additional oil pipeline shall be built in order to service their needs. The question is where exactly it should be built. The delegations have given their preferred options: Gaza and Tel-Aviv. The benefits of the pipeline being built in either city are obvious: it would provide numerous jobs to the local population during and after construction. Yet again, Italy must mediate this issue."
 jercon.6.a:0 "Tel Aviv."
 jercon.6.b:0 "Gaza."
 
 jercon.7.t:0 "For Whom The Black Gold Flows"
 jercon.7.d:0 "Now that the issue of the pipeline has been solved, the debate has moved onto the topic of the oil revenues. The Palestinians argue that the oil money would be better used by them, in order to install infrastructural improvements such as electric expansion as well as social housing. Meanwhile, the Israelis are pushing for them to receive the oil money for use in upgrading hospitals as well as expanding schools in the region. Ultimately, it is decided that..."
 jercon.7.a:0 "The Jews get the money."
 jercon.7.b:0 "The Arabs get the money."
 
 jercon.8.t:0 "Second Round"
 jercon.8.d:0 "With the issues of oil, nomads, agriculture, and water all resolved, the first round of negotiations has completed. The second round of negotiations begins now, with an agreement finally beginning to take shape. Sporadic protests have broken out in both Palestine and Israel, but they can be ignored. The agenda for this round of negotiations will be on refugee camps, reconstruction, the formation of a police force, Jerusalem, and the division of land."
 jercon.8.a:0 "We're making progress!"
 
 jercon.9.t:0 "Refugee Camps"
 jercon.9.d:0 "Refugee camps are, surprisingly enough, a hot issue amongst the delegations. The Israelis argue that priority should be given to them in order to house Jews making Aliyah. Meanwhile, the Palestinians argue that priority should be given to them, as immigrants from the Arab nations have started to stream into the Levant. Only one side can prevail in this matter, as there are not enough funds to fully accommodate the projected numbers presented by both sides."
 jercon.9.a:0 "Refugee Camps for Jews in the West."
 jercon.9.b:0 "Refugee Camps for Arabs in the East."
 
 jercon.10.t:0 "Levantine Reconstruction"
 jercon.10.d:0 "Reconstruction efforts have been going on intermittently, such as the repavement of roads, renovation of villages, as well as upgrades to sewage facilities. However, with the withdrawal of Italy from the Middle East, these reconstruction efforts would be better served focusing on either Judea or Lebanon. The Jews have pushed for Judea, as their historical homeland, to be reconstructed. Meanwhile, the Arab delegation has called for Lebanon to be reconstructed first, as numerous problems with infrastructure have been reported in the area."
 jercon.10.a:0 "Focus on Judea."
 jercon.10.b:0 "Focus on Lebanon."
 
 jercon.11.t:0 "A New Police Force"
 jercon.11.d:0 "A police force must be formed in order to fill the vacuum left by the Italian withdrawal. There are two options, with the Jews pushing for the Palmach organization to lead it, while the Arabs are pushing for the Arab Legion. The Palmach is the elite strike force of Haganah, while the Arab Legion is the former regular army of Mandatory Palestine, now commanded by independence groups. It is decided that..."
 jercon.11.a:0 "Palmach will form the police force."
 jercon.11.b:0 "The Arab Legion will form the police force."
 
 jercon.12.t:0 "Addressing the Jerusalem Controversy"
 jercon.12.d:0 "Jerusalem is an especially sensitive issue to both the Israelis and the Palestinians, given its role as a holy city for Muslims and Jews alike. As such, the Israelis are pressing for more rights and lands within the city. The Palestinians, on the other hand, argue that the status quo works just fine, and that no changes will be necessary. We must tread carefully, for many will be angered by the decision we take here."
 jercon.12.a:0 "Additional land and rights will be granted for the Jews."
 jercon.12.b:0 "No further adjustments are necessary on this issue."
 
 jercon.13.t:0 "The Great Divide"
 jercon.13.d:0 "The next issue on the agenda are the borders between the explicitly Arab lands and the explicitly Jewish lands. These are essentially the boundaries for settlement for both the Arabs and the Jews. Ever since the formation of the Italian Middle East, these borders have been unclear. The Arab delegation has pushed for the Jerusalem line, which favors them, as well as a general expansion of settlement rights for their side. On the other hand, the Jews have advocated for the Jordan line, which would expand the potential for further Jewish settlement. After tense negotiations..."
 jercon.13.a:0 "Jordan Line."
 jercon.13.b:0 "Jerusalem Line."
 
 jercon.14.t:0 "The Final Round"
 jercon.14.d:0 "The end grows near for the Jerusalem Conference, as all parties come closer and closer to reaching a full agreement on the status of the Levant. Peace is on the horizon, as the first drafts of the Jerusalem Accords have begun to be written. The next issues to be discussed are interfaith dialogue, a Good Neighbor Policy, new infrastructure, and trade. These are not as controversial amongst the delegations, and are essentially the finishing touches."
 jercon.14.a:0 "We are in the home stretch."
 
 jercon.15.t:0 "Interfaith Dialogue"
 jercon.15.d:0 "Most of the tension in the Levant can be attributed to the difference of religions between Jews and Muslims. Under our watch, interfaith dialogue programs shall be launched in order to promote religious tolerance. Furthermore, cultural exchanges will fall under the purview of such interfaith programs, in order to promote non-discrimination. However, the conference is split on who to focus on: the Jews or the Muslims. With a vote called, the result is as follows:"
 jercon.15.a:0 "The interfaith programs should focus on the Jews."
 jercon.15.b:0 "The interfaith programs should focus on the Muslims."
 
 jercon.16.t:0 "The Coexistence of Nations"
 jercon.16.d:0 "Italy is to enact a Good Neighbor Policy on the Levant, with economic aid, cultural exchanges, and mutual military assistance for all countries. However, fierce debate has been raging within the government over who we should focus our policy on. Rightists in the government are pushing for aid to be sent towards the Jews, while the more leftists are pushing for a policy in favor of the Arabs. After much deliberation, it is decided that..."
 jercon.16.a:0 "Priority should be given to the Jews."
 jercon.16.b:0 "Priority should be given to the Arabs."
 
 jercon.17.t:0 "East or West?"
 jercon.17.d:0 "Before full withdrawal can take place, we must make amends and do our part to rebuild the Levant. Italian companies will build new rail lines in either the east or the west for further economic development as well as ease of transportation. For obvious reasons, the Arabs are pushing for the rail line to be built in the East. Meanwhile, the Jews are calling for it to be built in the West. After hours of deliberation, it is decided that..."
 jercon.17.a:0 "West."
 jercon.17.b:0 "East."
 
 jercon.18.t:0 "Tariffs and Trade"
 jercon.18.d:0 "The issue of trade has been brought up, with the main problem with it being where it is being directed. Two possible solutions have been proposed: the sea and the ports, or the inland cities. Through ports, the importation of goods from faraway lands is far easier, although port expansions may take up money that could be better used elsewhere. Meanwhile, inland expansion would greatly improve infrastructure, at the cost of limiting our imports and exports. In the end, there can only be one."
 jercon.18.a:0 "Expand the ports."
 jercon.18.b:0 "Focus on the inland."
 
 jercon.19.t:0 "Forgetting Old Wrongs"
 jercon.19.d:0 "targai please put in a prompt"
 jercon.19.a:0 "Favor The Jews."
 jercon.19.b:0 "Favor The Arabs."
 
 jercon.20.t:0 "The End of the Jerusalem Conference"
 jercon.20.d:0 "The final drafts of the Jerusalem Accords have been distributed today, as the Conference winds down to its end. Through negotiation and compromise, an agreement has been reached between the two sides, to be ratified in the near future. With the issues and disputes having been resolved by the Conference, there remains a final question that must be answered, possibly the biggest problem for the delegates to resolve: whether or not the lands should be divided or remain together. However, with the previous success of the Conference, it is certain that a viable solution can be reached upon the issue. Sanity will prevail in the end."
 jercon.20.a:0 "The final choice awaits, and it is perhaps the biggest one of them all".
 
 jercon.21.t:0 "One or Two?"
 jercon.21.d:0 "On the last day of the Jerusalem Conference, everyone has gathered to discuss the possible formation of a Levantine Confederation or a partition of the lands. For the first time, the Jewish and Arab delegations have both split on the matter, with pro-Confederation and pro-Partition camps forming. Those that argue for a Levantine Confederation say that ethnocultural and religious tensions can be solved, and that in time, these tensions will fade. Furthermore, it would bring less of an economic shock to the region if the Confederation was formed. In the pro-Partition camp, they argue that sectarian violence would only worsen under one country, and that it would be better to work as independent allies, rather than two adversaries chained together. Both make compelling arguments, but there is only one solution. That is..."
 jercon.21.a:0 "The partition of the Levant."
 jercon.21.b:0 "The formation of the Levantine Confederation."
 
 jercon.22.t:0 "Irgun Growing in Power"
 jercon.22.d:0 "The paramilitary organization Irgun has recently exploded in membership and operations, with reports of increased activity across the Levant reaching our desk. Most in the government believe that it's for the best that we continue to work with Arafat, albeit with increased aid to help ensure this threat is combated. Others believe that we should contact King Hussein and get his aid in fighting the threat. Another, unspoken option, is to work with Irgun, while breaking our relationship with the Arabs."
 jercon.22.a:0 "Approach Emir Hussein."
 jercon.22.b:0 "Trust in Arafat."
 jercon.22.c:0 "A Deal With the Devil."
 
 jercon.23.t:0 "The JRM Forms"
 jercon.23.d:0 "With the ANM takeover of the Levant, several Jewish groups such as Lehi, Haganah, and Irgun, have merged into the Jewish Resistance Movement. Their purpose is to resist the ANM wherever possible, and in time, overthrow them. At the moment, we can only send arms and funding to the JRM, but already, shipments are being organized for their efforts. We can only hope from afar that the JRM's efforts will bear fruit in the future."
 jercon.23.a:0 "Let's hope we can get a hold on this situation."
 
 jercon.24.t:0 "A Meeting with Hussein"
 jercon.24.d:0 "The Governor-General has recently stepped out of a meeting with King Hussein with an interesting proposal. Hussein claims that Arafat is untrustworthy and is not negotiating in good faith.\n\nThe King maintains that in order to keep the peace in the Levant, it would be best to leak Arafat's location to the Irgun and let the Jews "handle" him for us. With Arafat out of the way, the Fatah will surely splinter, and thereby allowing us to negotiate directly with the King to secure a hopefully quick and advantageous agreement.\n\nBut, there's no telling what the ramifications of Arafat's assassination may bring if he's killed at all and perhaps it's best we keep things as is."
 jercon.24.a:0 "Leak Arafat's location to Irgun..."
 
 jercon.25.t:0 "Arafat Assassinated!"
 jercon.25.d:0 "Arafat is dead, killed by an Irgun attack on his safehouse. Already rioting has ensued in Arab majority territories with Jewish communities find themselves under siege by Arab paramilitaries. Haganah and Irgun clash with the ANM and Fatah in running gun battles in Jerusalem while our garrison struggles to get the situation under control.\n\nHowever, not all news is bad, King Hussein has been able to maintain order in Trans-Jordan and the Arab Legion remains in peak fighting condition. We shall contact Hussein and ask him to assist our beleaguered forces in maintaining order in the rest of the Levant. The King has served us loyally in the past there is no reason we that should change now."
 jercon.25.a:0 "Get me a line to Amman!"
 
 jercon.26.t:0 "A New Kingdom"
 jercon.26.d:0 "The Arab Legion marches west, King Hussein at its forefront. Disciplined soldiers and veteran officers sweeping aside Jewish and Arab paramilitaries alike. While the Legion fans out across the Levant to assist the garrison in crushing any stubborn holdouts, King Hussein departs to the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nWith cheering crowds and our approval, the Emir of Transjordan had declared the Kingdom of the Levant, with him at its head. Hussein has promised continued cooperation with the Italian Empire on top of his other promises of secular and constitutional rule. Many doubt his sincerity but it's clear for the time being Hussein is wise enough not to bite the hand that feeds him, and we have secured ourselves a new ally in the Levant.\n\nHail King Hussein of the Levant! Saviour of the Levant! King of Jordan, Lebanon, Sinai and South Syria, Protector of Jerusalem and King of the Arabs!"
 jercon.26.a:0 "To future success and continued cooperation!"
 
 jercon.27.t:0 "A Meeting with Begin"
 jercon.27.d:0 "Menachem Begin was an unassuming man, bald and wearing spectacles he wasn't what one would expect of a man whose organization has caused him so much trouble in the Levant. Sitting at a table cleaning his glasses, the man looked almost grand-fatherly, not that Chiesa would ever fall for that.\n\nBegin wasted no time getting down to business. The request was fairly simple all things considered, Chiesa and, by extension, Italy, would support Irgun's takeover of the Levant. In exchange, Begin would keep the Levant within the Italosphere and allow the ENI to continue to use the pipelines which flowed through the region.\n\nA hard bargain he knew, but what choice did he have? The Haganah and Fatah were at each other's throats, the ANM grow more powerful by the day, and god knows what the Lehi was up to.\n\n"Do we have a deal Governor?""
 jercon.27.a:0 "We do."
 
 jercon.28.t:0 "The JRM Forms"
 jercon.28.d:0 "Our forces in the Levant have been forced into a humiliating retreat. The ANM has successfully instigated a general uprising, turning much of the population against us, and forcing us to withdraw. The presence of an anti-Italian state so closes the Suez is greatly destabilizing, not to mention the loss of the pipelines which connect us to the Oil fields of Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nHowever, not all is lost, the Jews of the Levant are no friends of the Arabs and have unified under the banner of the Jewish Resistance Movement. The JRM has approached us asking for support in overthrowing the ANM. In return, they promise the establishment of a pro-Italian state in the region. While the JRM represents an excellent opportunity to help restore some semblance of our old position in the Levant, many are wary of allying with the very people who caused us so much trouble in the past."
 jercon.28.a:0 "Give them our support, the Arabs need to be taught a lesson."
 jercon.28.b:0 "We cannot trust them."
 
 jercon.29.t:0 "Arafat Assassinated!"
 jercon.29.d:0 "Yasser Arafat, leader of the so-called "moderates" of Fatah, has been in hiding ever since the Socialists in the ANM have taken over the region. Fatah, while weakened, has retained a significant presence throughout the region, contesting with both the Jewish Resistance and the ANM.\n\nHowever, a mouse can only hide for so long, and Arafat's location has finally been discovered thanks to a helpful tip from our Italian friends. Already an elite detachment of the best fighters the JRM has to offer is converging on his position, he will not get away. It's time to put an end to this nuisance for once and for all."
 jercon.29.a:0 "Farewell, 'friend'."
 
 jercon.30.t:0 "Victory for the Jewish Resistance"
 jercon.30.d:0 "Across the Holy land, the fighters of Judah have risen. Aided by Italian supplies, we have successfully crushed the Arab radicals who would oppress our people, like the Romans of old. Their leaders are dead, and their fighters scattered. As we speak, the last holdouts are being hunted and destroyed.\n\nStanding over it all is Yisrael Galili, the enigmatic leader of the JRM. While Galili's plans for the future of the Levant remains unclear, it appears that it will be sometime before the Arabs will acknowledge us as the rightful owners of this land. Already there is talk of Arab resistance even as the ANM is driven out. Peace it seems will remain a distant goal."
 jercon.30.a:0 "To the fighters of Judah!"
 
 jercon.31.t:0 "An Israeli State"
 jercon.31.d:0 "We have done it! After months of struggle and conflict, we have defeated the ANM, and for the time being, crushed the last true obstacles to the formation of a Jewish state. As the flag of Zion rises above Jerusalem, the Jewish people have a home once more.\n\nHowever, discontent with the defacto military dictatorship run by the Haganah and Irgun is already starting to appear, and the issue of the native Arab population which outnumbers the Jews of the region by the substation margin grows more pressing by the day. The future of Israel remains cloudy and uncertain."
 jercon.31.a:0 "A homeland, if you can keep it."
 
 jercon.32.t:0 "Triumph for the Arab Nationalist Movement"
 jercon.32.d:0 "While they may have fought hard, without outside aid the Jewish Resistance ultimately could not stand up to the strength of the Arab Nationalists. Their leaders dead or in hiding and their fighters scattered and driven underground, it appears the last threat to the ANM has been defeated. Already there are celebrations in the streets, as the Socialists consolidate their position. The region's Jews have already seen record levels of emigration, while those that remain brace themselves for another generation under what they consider foreign rule. "
 jercon.32.a:0 "The revolution is victorious!"
