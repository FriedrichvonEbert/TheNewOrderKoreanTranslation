The accursed tsars first caged us, and the Soviet Union continued keeping us from roaming the great steppes of Kazakhstan! It is my life's goal to bring back freedom and prosperity to the Kazakh nation. But this task will not my easy, my friends! The Russian devils will do anything in their power to keep us from standing strong once more. Our freedom will be paid for in the blood of our former jailors! The Russian mongrels will be purged from our ancestral homeland!'\n\nSo began Joğarğı Köşbasşı Gaziz's greatest speech, to an enthusiastic crowd of supporters."

 AKT_On_the_Blood_of_Our_Fathers_desc: "The Russian perfidy goes a long time back, my friends. In the 18th century a chain of forts was extended to our north as the barbarians drew ever closer. Soon, they had subjugated the proud Kazakh Khanate. These foreigners cared not one whit for our traditional lifestyle; they forced our forefathers to settle down. Predictably, entire herds of animals died. The Soviet regime only brought new ways to starve our ancestors into submission. But now we are free to avenge our fathers, and our father's fathers. Our strong Blueshirts shall march north and spill the blood of the wicked Russian people!\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'On the Blood of Our Fathers'"

 AKT_On_the_Blood_of_Our_Sons_desc: "'The Germans, in their great wisdom, sought to free the people of the Soviet Union from their Russian shackles. Let me tell you, my friends, I hoped the worst would be over when German tanks rolled into Moscow. But the demons from the north merely retreated further east, into hidden military bases where swarms of planes had been stowed away. To this day the Russian continue their eternal struggle against all that is good and proper by sending bombing runs into Kazakhstan. Our, our children... Sorry, my friends, I grow emotional when I think of the future the Russian bombing has tried to impose on our sons. But Russian blood will be spilled to pay for Kazakh blood!'\n\nExcerpts from a speech, 'On the Blood of Our Sons'"

It boils my blood to know that in the shadows of our great nation filth accumulates without end, poisoning the very earth our ancestors gave us. As long as I, Gaziz, am supported by the noble Qazaq Tami Party, the light of justice will reach every corner of our proud state. Those who oppose our new order will rue the day they began scheming against us!'\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'On a Restored Kazakhstan'"
 AKT_Our_Own_God: "Our Own God"
 AKT_Our_Own_God_desc: "The restoration of Tengrism to its proper place continues throughout our noble nation. Citizens increasingly reject the soulless atheism of the Soviet era or the foreign religions of Islam and Christianity.\n\nWe can further integration of Tengrism into society through religious education for the young and integration of a state controlled Shamanic association into the life of all our citizens. The 'rediscovery' of sacred sites will help us transform regular army units into sacred warriors, willing to die to defend their homeland. As we give rightful worship to Tengri, Tengri strengthens the legitimacy of our government over our people."
 AKT_Brothers_in_Arms: "Brothers in Arms"
 AKT_Brothers_in_Arms_desc: "To our south lies Turkmenistan, a fellow proud nation of central Asia that was freed from the Soviet yoke. Diplomats from our government have reached the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat and begun talks of an alliance between our nations. As Turkmenistan is a fellow regime of the turkish people, the idea of Kazakhstan being united by puppets of the Russian world does not sit very well with our neighbors of the south. A full alliance might not be on the table... But weapons and increased access to Iran (and thus the outer world) through Turkmen land would help our strategic prospects."
 AKT_Shaman_Guidance: "Shaman Guidance"
 AKT_Shaman_Guidance_desc: "It is well known that our leader Gaziz is a pious man, and regularly visit a shaman for advice and guidance. This soothes our citizens as it reinforces the idea that their head of state is merely a tool of the spirits.\n\nRecently a rumor has begun spreading that Gaziz's shaman adviser has predicted that he was prophesied to be a great unifier and leader of the Kazakh people. While we would never confirm or deny rumor about our chief's private religious life, our state ministry for cultural enrichment can help spread this rumor across our land to increase Gaziz's prestige."
 AKT_Fueling_Revenge: "Fueling Revenge"
 AKT_Fueling_Revenge_desc: "Hatred of the Russian is a renewable resource, as each generation of Kazakh must be reminded of the torments inflicted on their ancestors by the northern barbarians. By sending out our blueshirts and government officials, we can spread anti-Russian sentiment even further through our land. These seeds of hatred will help us harvest a fresh crop of courage and patriotism when the time comes to win back our land."
 AKT_Russian_Bombs: "Russian Bombs"
 AKT_Russian_Bombs_desc: "Russian bombings might have ended for the time being, but their memory lives in the mutilated bodies of our citizens and in the ruins of homes and cities. By keeping alive the anger caused by the Russian's cruel bombing campaign, our leader Gaziz seeks to sharpen the people's rage against the northern devils."
 AKT_Our_Own_Guernica: "Our Own Guernica"
 AKT_Our_Own_Guernica_desc: "Gaziz has an artist's soul, and is known to weave pathos and anger expertly in the fabric of his speeches. The famed painting 'Guernica' by Pablo Picasso has recently given him an idea for a new speech.\n\nIn a small village on the Kazakh steppe we set our scene. A town built near a watering point, where countless herdsmen and wanderers across the ages have stopped to rest for the moment. An eden on earth for poor wretches at the end of a long day of travel. This matters little to the Russian devils, for the village was bombed one morning into oblivion. As the dazed villagers crawled out of the ruins to mourn their lost village, the Russian planes made a second bombing run to catch any survivor.\n\nGaziz has a good memory for names, too. At the height of the crowd's indignation, the names of the thirty villagers can be recited. All the better to whip the crowd into a frenzy. Our very own Guernica."
 AKT_False_Kazakhs: "False Kazakhs"
 AKT_False_Kazakhs_desc: "'These are difficult times, my friends. Our hearts must swell with love and empathy for our fellow Kazakh even as false prophets and cruel tyrants lead them astray.\n\nBut this love must be tempered with anger for those false Kazakhs that oppose our quest to unite Kazakhstan once more! These leaders and their lackeys must be named, and their laughable ideologies detested by all good Kazakh. Our countrymen must be liberated from the despair they have fallen into, so that they might not be lead astray again!'\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'the False Kazakhs'"
 AKT_Kazakh_Unity: "Kazakh Unity"
 AKT_Kazakh_Unity_desc: "Communism? Islam? Democracy? National Renewal? All terrible foreign plots to keep the Kazakh people divided, or united in slavery to decadent foreign regimes. As long as even one Kazakh cries out for freedom, Gaziz will keep marching on to unite all Kazakh under one nation, free and eternally strong. Unlike petty dictators who have no ambitions for the Kazakh other than arraying a million slave for their petty whims, Gaziz understands that if the Kazakh are to be united to one another, they must be united to their leader first foremost. In this way a great chain of Kazakh shall be forged one link at a time on the unshakeable foundation that is our leader Gaziz."
 AKT_German_Heroes: "German Heroes"
 AKT_German_Heroes_desc: "'No people has done as much to struggle against the evil Russian nation as the Germans. In the first world war, was it not Germany that attempted to free the people of eastern Europe from the Russian yoke? And in the second world war was it not Germany that put an end to the supreme evil of a Russian nation? Even today, the German maintains garrisons in western Russia, ever vigilant to the threat of the northern barbarians. Their planes seek Russian airfields, trying desperately to stop the Russian revenge bombings on us.\n\nWe Kazakh know our true friends, and it is my intention to unite Kazakhstan to honor the German sacrifices. We shall strive to be worthy comrades of the German heroes, and apply to join the Einheitspakt to spread the light of civilization ever further!'\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'the German Heroes'"
 AKT_Cuman_Courage: "Cuman Courage"
 AKT_Cuman_Courage_desc: "There is value to religion and myth as social institutions. It is an important link to our ancestors, to our fellow citizens and to future generations.\n\nOur leader Gaziz desires to see the native religion of all Kazakh, Tengrism, be revived. In addition he wishes to see the ancient Cuman leaders be honored as heroes to all Kazakh people. Fearsome warriors and free men of the steppes, the Cumans are what the Kazakh people should aspire to be, to return to. We must get rid of foreign religions such Christianity and Islam and return to the faith and strength of our forebears."
 AKT_The_Sun_Will_Guide_Us: "The Sun Will Guide Us"
 AKT_The_Sun_Will_Guide_Us_desc: "The revival of Tengrism also comes with its own opportunities to better unite our people. The sun goddess Gun Ana is second only in importance to Tengri, the sky God himself. Gun Ana is life, Gun Ana is fertility; she is warmth and health. Patroness of the unfortunate.\n\nOur leader has thus decided to make her the symbol of his regime. The blueshirts will bring life back to the Kazakh people, and in time all Kazakhs will flock to our sun flag."
 AKT_We_Are_Warriors: "We Are Warriors"
 AKT_We_Are_Warriors_desc: "We Kazakhs are strong! We are determined! We are warriors at heart, unwilling to back down from a fight!\n\nThe endless plains shape strong men, able to ride for hundreds of kilometers. It nourishes its children's body and soul, by offering just enough resources to sustain a man willing to fight for his life and his family's. Courage, determination, cooperation and daring are the essential elements of life on the steppe, and these values mold men strong enough to fight for what is theirs when the time comes. Let weaker nations tremble, for the Kazakh warriors ride again on the plains!"
 AKT_We_Ride_Again: "We Ride Again"
 AKT_We_Ride_Again_desc: "It has finally happened! The Russian bombings have stopped!\n\nOur blue shirts are helping people clear the final set of rubble. Now that the northern demons have fled the skies of Kazakhstan, we must turn to their lackeys. Democrats, islamists, bandits, communists, all must be quashed if we are to free Kazakhstan from Russian influence.\n\nFirst, we must prepare our great unification army. Much work remains to be done!"
 AKT_Gather_Arms: "Gather Arms"
 AKT_Gather_Arms_desc: "If we're to cut the strings from all Russian puppets, we must first equip ourselves!\n\nThe Aktau military is spreading throughout the land, gathering any weapon it can find. Old Soviet caches, disarmed bandits, small scale gunsmithing operations. Every single rifle results in another patriotic blue shirt equipped for the sacred struggle to free Kazakhstan."
 AKT_Repair_the_Ruins: "Repair the Ruins"
 AKT_Repair_the_Ruins_desc: "The senseless Russian bombing has stopped for the time being. While brave Blueshirt warriors ready themselves on our border, other groups of the noble QTP busy themselves to help Kazakhstan. The Blueshirts' engineer corp has set out to repair any soviet era factory it can. Old machinery is assessed, and any structure too damaged to be used see its content spread out to other factories. Every factory that is reborn from its ashes is another tool to help the Kazakh rebirth. Military factory will give us the weapons we need to secure Kazakhstan, while civilian factories will give us the tools to rebuild it."
 AKT_Put_Them_to_Work: "Put Them to Work"
 AKT_Put_Them_to_Work_desc: "Our campaigns of national purification have rounded up several Russians hiding in our midst!\n\nWhile some among our organization urge death to all Russian invaders, our great leader has urged clemency for the time being. Many of these northern barbarians are simply dumb brutes or sniveling cowards, the tools of the Russian leadership throughout the ages. Our leader Gaziz has instead encouraged Russians to be incorporated into our work force at gunpoint. In this way these wretches can atone for the crimes of their ancestors, and for all the work stolen from generation of Kazakh citizens."
 AKT_Ready_the_Troops: "Ready the Troops"
 AKT_Ready_the_Troops_desc: "In the 40s and 50s the German Wehrmacht has shown time and time again that a single well trained professional soldiers is worth ten time his opposition when deployed against untrained militias and amateurs.\n\nGaziz has instructed his generals to drill the troops relentlessly as our nation prepares for war with the other claimants to Kazakh reunification. Men in great physical shape with a decent understanding of infantry tactics can out-fight and out-think their enemies. Intense training also helps us find the best of the best among our men. Useful material to reinforce the most elite Blueshirt units."
 AKT_Masters_of_Man_and_Horse: "Masters of Man and Horse"
 AKT_Masters_of_Man_and_Horse_desc: "Our land is large, and varies from vast deserts to nigh endless steppes.\n\nIt is thus crucial we recruit as many nomads and desert dwellers as we can. These men's ability to cover vast areas in a single day as well as their knowledge of the land beyond our border will be of great use when we launch our campaigns. Wherever man and horse goes, so shall our military go! We are the people of the horse, and with our equine companions we shall take back our land!"
 AKT_The_Steppe_is_Our_Home: "The Steppe is Our Home"
 AKT_The_Steppe_is_Our_Home_desc: "Our nation is the steppe, and so the steppe must be every soldier's home. By eschewing fixed military bases for the majority of our troops, we can get the men to live as their warrior ancestors. Every few mornings our soldiers undo their camp, and then use horses and a few trucks to move to a new location. This doubles as a good training regimen as long days spent walking the plains or riding on horseback keep our soldiers strong. The steppes encourage us to be the best we can be!"
 AKT_Begin_the_Recruitment_Drive: "Begin the Recruitment Drive"
 AKT_Begin_the_Recruitment_Drive_desc: "While the size of the army is not everything, it is certainly an important aspect of its strength. Yes, outnumbering our enemies is a great way to swing the balance in our favor. But a great number of men under arm is much more than that. It's having enough men to keep supply lines secure. It's keeping reserve troops on hand to reinforce sectors that need it. It's having enough soldiers to rotate battlefield troops to let our men rest after long campaigns.\n\nA major campaign to increase the size of our army shall begin. The importance of defending Kazakhstan against the Russian devils as well as the benefits of military service will help drive young men to our standards."
 AKT_They_Took_Your_Homes: "They Took Your Homes"
 AKT_They_Took_Your_Homes_desc: "I remember a Kazakhstan where every family was free to find its place, my friends. Where herdsmen were free to wander the steppes, and where villagers nurtured their villages throughout the ages. The Russians broke our nomadic ancestors' way of life. They corralled men and women into factories to serve as their slaves. And now the bombing campaign has broken a thousand thousand Kazakh roofs. Join our struggle, and make sure that they're never given the chance to hurt us again!'\n\nExcerpt from speech, 'On a Strong Kazakh Army'"
 AKT_They_Took_Your_Families: "They Took Your Families"
 AKT_They_Took_Your_Families_desc: "'The young, the old. Babes suckling at their mother's breasts were not spared, no more than their frail grand-parents were.

'\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'On a Strong Kazakh Army'"
 AKT_But_Not_Your_Lives: "But Not Your Lives"
 AKT_But_Not_Your_Lives_desc: "I've been asked by many young grief stricken Kazakh, \"Why have I been spared?\". It's a difficult question, my friends. But those that survived through the Russian bombings still hold on to their lives even as everything else was stolen. My friends, the only answer I can give is that you live today to return the favor to the Russian invaders and their Kazakh tools. You must live so that they die!'\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'On a Strong Kazakh Army'"
 AKT_Ready_the_Defences: "Ready the Defences"
 AKT_Ready_the_Defences_desc: "A nation's capital is its brain and heart. We cannot allow our capital city to be threatened by the Russians ever again!\n\nA network of fortresses around the capital will help deter any direct assault. From there, layers of trenches and bunkers can expand outward. In time the capital's garrison will be able to defend the city for extended periods of time. As a result our frontier units can be brought in to break any siege attempts."
 AKT_Against_the_Poles: "Against the Poles"
 AKT_Against_the_Poles_desc: "The Poles seek to emulate their Russian Slavic cousins by taking over our land and oppressing our people. We must defend against further Polish encroachment by reinforcing our border with them and deploying more troops in the region.\n\nSoon, New Poland will meet the fate of Old Poland. When the time is right we will storm in and free our people from the Polish shackles!"
 AKT_Against_the_False_Prophet: "Against the False Prophet"
 AKT_Against_the_False_Prophet_desc: "To the north east lies Aktobe, where a false prophet bewitches the children of Kazakhstan. Chairman Onoprienko is nothing but a tyrant in the making, and his ideology of National Renewal is nothing but a sham. Why should Kazakhstan be renewed when its greatness has always been there, obscured by the conniving Russians?\n\nBut Onoprienko is dangerous. He has whipped his army into a professional force, and now his men gather on Aktobe's side of the border. It is imperative that we reinforce our side of the border, and prepare our men for war with Onoprienko's mad junta!"

 AKT_To_Arms_desc: "'It is time my friends! Our army stands ready to strike at our enemies. A long path lies ahead, and every step will cost us the blood of countless patriots.

 AKT_Death_to_the_Settlers_desc: "The Polish settlers take our best land away. They crush our people underneath their foreign boot and murder any Kazakh that dares to oppose them. No more!\n\nAny settler that does not immediately leave Kazakhstan will be slaughtered by our advance forces. Land for land, and blood for blood! There shall be no mercy for the settler vermin! Just like the Germans before us, we will free our land from the Polish menace!"
 AKT_Force_Them_Out: "Force Them Out"
 AKT_Force_Them_Out_desc: "A Polish state? Laughable! A poor, deficient people is no more able to build a modern state than a group of wild animals might.\n\nHowever, no matter how slimshod their attempt at a government is, the Poles have managed to build a hierarchical system of government to manage over so called Nowa Polska. While this barbarous state was designed to oppress our people as efficiently as possible, we can make use of the Pole's structure by replacing their incapable bureaucrats by our own men. Our new province will thus be managed efficiently, for the good of freed Kazakh everywhere."
 AKT_Take_Everything: "Take Everything"
 AKT_Take_Everything_desc: "Every hunter knows, the weakest of animals might turn into snarling beasts when cornered. Thus it is imperative that we relieve the remaining Polish squatters of any means of resisting us. Rifles, horses, hunting knives. Everything must be stripped away, and redistributed to our men.\n\nTo achieve this our Blueshirts have split our new territories into subregions, and begun systematically rounding up the Poles and taking away their weapons. This will leave us free to deal with them when the time comes."
 AKT_Death_to_the_Liar: "Death to the Liar"
 AKT_Death_to_the_Liar_desc: "'There is no greater criminal in this world than the man who preys on the despair of his people for profit. To the north east lies an evil man, a false prophet, a great Liar to the Kazakh people. He preaches national renewal even as he and his cronies prepare Kazakhstan for a new takeover by the Russians. This must not be tolerated, my friends!\n\nOur men will free Aktobe, and any lackey of the great Liar will be killed where he stands!

 AKT_Tengri_Forgives_His_People_desc: "'Tengri is the great sky father, and the Kazakh people are his children. Does a father not weep with joy when his children come home to him? Has a father's love no limit, extending to children that have been led astray? And is a father's anger directed not at the victim of a crime, but at its culprits? My friends, today we welcome back friends and family into the fold. The black mark of National Renewal will slowly be erased from the minds of our new citizens, replaced by the love of Tengri and the joy of being Kazakh.'\n\nExcerpt from a speech, 'On Tengri's Love and Forgiveness'"
 AKT_Destroy_His_Cult: "Destroy His Cult"
 AKT_Destory_His_Cult_desc: "Nikolai Onoprienko has proven a determined enemy of the Kazakh people, and was in the process of centralizing all power of the National Renewal junta unto himself, completing his transformation from evil prophet to petty god of his own domain.\n\nOnce we have broken his cult of personality his religion will collapse on itself. In this regard we must be grateful that Onoprienko had begun centering all of Aktobe on himself; it is so much easier to destroy a religion once its prophet has been vanquished by the force of history!"
 AKT_The_Red_Menace: "The Red Menace"
 AKT_The_Red_Menace_desc: "The Kyzylorda are the greatest threat to our reunification of Kazakhstan; not to mention, they are also the strongest remnant of the diabolical Soviet rule.\n\nTwo sucessive defeats to the German liberators has not managed to crack General Momyshuly's hold over his red army remnants. Some semblance of Kazakh strength and discipline must have seeped into these Russian stooges, for their mechanized battalions remain some of the greatest across the ruins of Kazakhstan. We must prepare for our greatest conflict. Failure is not an option!"
 AKT_Fortify_the_Border: "Fortify the Border"
 AKT_Fortify_the_Border_desc: "As the final stages of the first world war, as well as the two wars of liberation between the Germans and our Russian oppressors, have shown, mechanized units form the greatest threat to an unprepared modern army. A combined arms offensive can crack even well prepared defensive position, and once a breakthrough is achieved the enemy is free to penetrate into our strategic depth and play havoc with our lines.\n\nBy reinforcing the border with the Kyzylorda with several lines of mines, anti tank positions and fortresses, we can make a stand against the metallic horde to the east. Our few anti tank guns and portable rocket launchers can be concentrated in designated killing fields to blunt any enemy advance. The border with the reds will be fortified and ready for our invasion."

I can assure you, my only priority is to follow the sacred path laid ahead of us by Tengri Himself!\n\nTo our east lies the shadow of a shadow, the abominable remnants of the abominable Soviet Rule, living proofs of the ongoing devolution of the Russian devils! Since the tyrannical rule of the tsar, the Russians have outdone themselves by creating the godless Soviet Union. What kind of men can strip a nation of its sacred traditions and claim it is doing so for the good of its workers? Now, the hour of truth approaches.

If anything the red flag of socialism is a crimson rag, stained by the blood of countless Kazakh men and women. But it is not too late, my friend, for a new red banner to be crafted. One made by killing all those who would shackle the Kazakh nation. It is time to wash the Kyzylorda's red flag in the blood of traitors and tyrants, and to liberate our brethrens from Soviet subjugation! To the front, my friends!

 AKT_Gazizov_Loves_the_Workers_desc: "Like every good lie, the communist manifesto contains a kernel of truth. It is true that the workers are the true core of any great nation, and it is true that a cruel ruling class often ends up oppressing them.\n\nTo help smooth the transition of the Kyzylorda's former inmates into our civilian population, a generous program of subsidies and social programs will be launched. Village leaders and big men are of particular importance. After all, all are equal, but some are equal more than others."
 AKT_Show_Us_Your_Skills: "Show Us Your Skills"
 AKT_Show_Us_Your_Skills_desc: "The true tragedy of Russian rule over fragmented Kazakhstan is that the Kazakh people are prevented from working together for the betterment of the land.

For the greater picture, association of shamans and the leadership of Gaziz and his Blueshirts is all that Kazakhstan needs.

Today you all came here to see the beginning of a great cause, the birth of the renewed Kazakh nation that awoke from its long dream!\n\nFor centuries, our proud and mighty people have been oppressed and humiliated by the Russian barbarians. The unscrupulous Khans, as well as Tsarist and Soviet sycophants, everyone who sought their petty goals and acted against the interests of their nation, traded our freedoms to the conquerors from Moscow and those few brave individuals who refused to recognize the Slavic sovereignty were ruthlessly destroyed. Not satisfied with merely subjugating our people and robbing of our earned wealth, the Russians were eager to put us in a slavish position and divide our race into opposing clans, shattering our national unity for their enrichment on our sorrows.\n\nEven after the Muscovite empire fell under the mighty strike of the German state, they never stopped to terrorize our families and never abandoned their hope to destroy our nation. On the verge of this bitter infighting of a Kazakh against Kazakh and attempts of Russians to restore their heinous rule, we ask you to overcome your mutual hatred, sowed by our most despicable enemies, and unite towards one purpose - the supremacy of the Kazakh people in their own lands, our shared dream that is impossible to achieve as long as a Russian is allowed to spread their evil in Kazakhstan. Our country faces the times of the greatest challenges, and even if the few of you would allow your weaknesses to take over your will, our glorious mission will meet its tragic end.\n\nMay here the providence of gods give us the courage and perseverance to us, the people who fight for the freedom and greatness of our race.\""

The language of violence is the only language that is understandable to Russians and this is the only way they can speak to other nations.\n\nEven though their empire faded into oblivion decades ago, some of their warlords continue to terrorize our people and condemn our sons and daughters to a miserable existence. Those children of the Kazakh race who didn't lose their parents in a Bolshevik massacre against Germany are now objected to suffer under the endless cover of Russian bombings and to die in senseless wars for the most pitiful Slavic gains.\n\nLook upon all those orphaned Kazakh children who lost their families and their shelters to the Russians, look upon all those graves raised by fathers for their fallen sons and ask yourselves if you wish to live in coexistence with the dishonorable race of murderers and butchers.\""

As it turned out, the rumor had been correct, in so far as most of the checkpoint's employees were absent for the day. Only a few bored conscripts prodded the scared refugees in line with their rifles, shepperd dogs desinterested in their herd.\n\nThe bureaucrat at the border processed as many as he could in the line. Technically, none of them had the necessary exit visas needed to escape. In Aktau, political opponents, Poles and Russians were seen as an essential ressource for the state's industrial projects. In practice, outlets like this checkpoints existed to relieve the nation from its most desperate individuals. Instead of forcing them into terrorism or revolutionary thoughts, the Blueshirt preferred to see a temporary exodus of politically dangerous inhabitants until Aktau had its act together.\n\nAnd so the bureaucrat treated each group of refugees. They handed him their forged or black market documents, and he graded them on their efforts. Some he milked for bribes; others he let go. Some he forbade from crossing the border. The times were tough, and the bureaucrat needed money for his family. He wasn't sure that the desperate refugees fully understood this, and so he accepted their abuse stoically.

Long speeches and lavish banquets were arranged in the evening, and several traditional poems and epics were sung late into the night.\n\nBut not all is well in Uzbekistan. Our diplomats have carefully analyzed the country's internal situation. Opponents to the pan-Turkish nationalist regime still lurk in the countryside, and gun running from Afghanistan keeps opposition groups and regional opposition much better equipped. Internal dissent amongst the ruling party is also an issue; various heads of the army and civilian government do not agree on the country's internal and foreign policies. With so many internal problems, the Uzbek military establishment is leery of getting involved in Kazakh affairs, especially without clear proofs that Aktau will win the upcoming unification wars.\n\nThese issues however do not affect the long term prospects of Uzbekistan much. Their government is similar to ours in its rejection of weak outsiders in favor of strong Turkish traditions. Men of all factions in the Uzbek state have reassured us that they pray fervently for our victory. While they cannot offer an official military alliance at the moment, they have offered us guns and supplies. Afghan contraband weapons seized from rebels and stockpiled in the capital will start being transferred to us in the coming weeks. Their removal from the country will prevent any one faction from seizing them for a coup, and help strengthen our army to defeat the Russian swines across Kazakhstan. The Uzbek government looks forward to our coming liberation of Kazakhstan from foreign influence."

 akt.7.desc: "The shaman and the leader walked together toward the east in silence. The rising sun would soon meet them as they approached the sacred grove, and endless Tengri above them would watch on this most auspicious day. Smoke from the previous day's bonfires mingled with fresh cut grass. Not far, a hundred horses grazed on balls of hay brought in for the occasion. A feast for man's companion, preceding a feast for man himself.\n\nThe shaman had been one of Gaziz's earliest supporters. One of those that had kept the old faith even through Islamic and Soviet oppression of Tengri's believers. The sacred man carried the weight of years on his shoulder easily, walking at a brisk pace that the leader struggled to keep up with. The sky and earth gave the older man surprising vigor. Gaziz may have been many things to many people, but in his heart of hearts he was a true Tengri believer. The sky lord had saved him from the abyss of despair where the bombing had brought him, the tough years of seeing his beloved Kazakhstan destroyed even further as a consequence of Russian meddling.\n\nThere! In the sacred grove's heart, tied to a great stone grazed a colt. The animal's nostril flared upon the two strangers arrival. The shaman gently pet the creature's head, soothing the colt's nerve. \"You know, Gaziz, you've done great things since seizing power here in Aktau.\" \"Only by the sky father's will.\" Gazizov said meekly. The shaman nodded once. Great sadness shone in his eyes. Or happyness? \"You've done great things indeed, Gaziz. You'll make a great leader of united Kazakhstan, a conqueror for the ages.\" Gazizov nodded, words somehow dying in his mouth. The shaman nodded once more, and then produced a blade. The colt did not suffer. Soon, the smell of warm blood mingled with smoke and grass under the endless blue sky."

 akt.8.desc: "The recruiting station was an ugly building, a shack of corrugated metal seemingly holding out of spite for gravity. A slimshod attempt at strengthening the foundation had seen ugly supporting steel beams welded to the corners of the room. This mattered little to the men inside. Nor did it matter that chairs were missing. The recruits sat in neat rows on the ground, waiting for their number to be called up by the recruiters. When one of the youth's turns came up he went to stand in front of the appropriate office to begin a terse conversation with the military men.\n\nThe young could all have come from the same family. A particularly poor family, one affected by calamity after calamity. A pale flame burned in eyes too big for the emaciated face that contained them. The Russian bombings on the Kazakh industry of Aktau had been particularly violent, and so many children had lost everything, only to be kept alive by Blueshirt food donation. Now that they approached adulthoods, the orphans of Aktau wanted to give back to their homeland. Many had lost home, friends and family to the senseless deaths and dreamed of justice for the Russian's crimes.\n\nThankfully, these young had been helped by Gaziz to endure the inimaginable. They knew better than to doubt the enemies of the great leader, those that suggested that the Germans had bombed them. No, the true enemy of the Kazakh people had always been the Russians. Gaziz had taught them how to keep alive the embers of the Kazakh nation, and now the embers would be lit anew. A great firestorm would purify Kazakhstan and resurrect the nation. These young men might not live to see it, but they would fight for their nation until Kazakhstan was safe."

But Gaziz's singular gift of oration once again saw the crowd eating from his hand.\n\nGasps of horror came from the crowd as their leader brought forth this newest tale of terror. Encouraged by a few Blueshirt plainsclothe men in the crowd, the public gasped in horror at the destruction of a peaceful oasis town. Roars of indignation surged as Gaziz told of the bombers making a second run to kill all those that survived the first bombing run.\n\nAnd just as planned, the slow and steady recitation of every \"victim\" of the bombing. Newborn Aiday, torn from his mother's breast. Village chief Mukhamed, killed while trying to help a family out from under rubble. Every name, every sad end was another beat of Gaziz's war drum. Soon the anger and hatred boiled in the assembled crowd. Someone shouted \"We need to make the Russian bastards pay!\" It did not matter if the heckler had been a planted Blueshirt agent, of if he had been earnest. Nor did it matter if the leader's story was true, or invented wholeclothe by Gazizov. What mattered was the crowd's reaction, its undivided righteous wrath.\n\nYes, Gaziz was an artist. And his people's very soul would always be his favorite canvas."

Without some early warning of Russian bombers coming in, resident of Aktau risked never getting to bomb shelters in time.\n\nWith the equipment online, the engineers had some time to rest for the first time in months. They tinkered lazily with the equipment, occasionally trading wrenches and soldering irons for a cup of tea. Summer was slowly coming to an end. Not far from the techies, their guard regiments had resumed their training. Men did push-up drills as officers shouted them down. How would they reconquer Kazakhstan if they couldn't follow instructions? The officers had to be though, they claimed, because the Russians out there would definitely fight back hard. The soldiers didn't complain; they relished the chance to get in there and fight to free Kazakhstan.\n\nFurther into the capital, there was much activity in the general headquarters. General pondered plans as their support staff read reports on Aktau's economy and the status of the army's supply chain. Once a while a Blueshirt officer would come in and help their military counterparts.\n\nYes, summer was giving way to fall.

In these rough times, most of the recruits were underfed lanky youngsters that might pass out from strenuous activity. But they had a fire in their belly. Many of the adults, in contrast, looked in better shape. Their application to the army had either resulted from conscription, or from seeking a better job in life.\n\nIt mattered not to the drill sergent why they had appeared on his doorstep. All that mattered to him was their discipline, resilience and will to improve. All of the cohort had lived through the Russian bombings. They knew how to work together; that being woken in the middle of the night meant running for shelter instead of grumbling; that every day might be a fight for survival. All the drill sergeant had to do was take this raw, unbridled will to live, and mold it into a battalion of soldiers.\n\nSome recruits assumed that training couldn't be any harder tha life in the Kazakh wastes. The drill sergeant loved these recruits the most, since they were often the easiest to break. He'd provide comfortable beds to half of the men, and then test their ability to work together. He'd notice what clique would form among the recruits in basic training and use the knowledge against them. No man is an island, and the drill sergeant used this to great effect to hit his recruit where it hurt most. None of them relished the pain, but they learned to endure it."
