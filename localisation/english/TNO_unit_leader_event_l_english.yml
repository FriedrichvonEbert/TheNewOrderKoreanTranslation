 unit_leader_events.1.d:0 "In [From.GetHerHis] service to [From.From.GetNameDef], it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] has pushed [From.GetHerselfHimself] too far. As a result of the bad climate in their operational area, the [From.GetRank] has now fallen ill, and will likely need some time to recover. Until [From.GetSheHe] gets well, [From.GetSheHe] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."
 unit_leader_events.1.a:0 "Unfortunate"
 unit_leader_events.2.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wounded"
 unit_leader_events.2.d:0 "In bringing the battle to a successful conclusion, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at a bit too much risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been wounded, and it will likely take some time for the wounds to fully heal, until which time the [From.GetRank] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

 operative_events.1.t:0 "Agent Captured"
 operative_events.1.desc:0 "While deployed behind enemy lines, [This.GetName] was apprehended by enemy [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. Reports from other sources indicate that [This.GetSheHe] is held in a remote location for interrogation. While we believe that [This.GetSheHe] will try to resist interrogation for as long as possible, it is likely that the enemy will eventually gain useful intelligence unless [This.GetSheHe] is rescued or killed before [This.GetSheHe] breaks."
 operative_events.1.a:0 "We must mount a rescue operation!"
 operative_events.2.t:0 "Agent forced into Hiding"
 operative_events.2.desc:0 "While on assignment in [From.From.GetNameDef], [This.GetName] was evidently detected by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. The last message [This.GetSheHe] sent said that [This.GetSheHe] noticed enemy surveillance following [This.GetHerHim] and that [This.GetSheHe] was going to execute evasion and escape procedures. \n\nAs part of these procedures, [This.GetName] will naturally have broken contact with [This.GetHerHis] handlers to avoid compromising them or others.\n\nIf successful, [This.GetName] will contact us again in a few weeks."
 operative_events.2.a:0 "We can do nothing but wait and hope."
 operative_events.3.t:0 "Agent Killed"
 operative_events.3.desc:0 "It appears that [This.GetName], one of our agents deployed in [From.From.GetNameDef], has made the ultimate sacrifice and died in the line of duty. Reports from [From.From.GetAdjective] sources are naturally sparse, but it appears that [This.GetName] was being tracked by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence. It seems likely that [This.GetSheHe] was about to be captured and either choose death to avoid giving out vital information under interrogation or was killed by [From.From.GetAdjective] agents while resisting arrest."
 operative_events.3.a:0 "A hero, called to [This.GetHerHis] final rest."
 operative_events.4.t:0 "Agent Injured"
 operative_events.4.desc:0 "Following a close encounter with [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence, [This.GetName] has reported that [This.GetSheHe] will be out of action for a while to tend to the injuries [This.GetSheHe] sustained while fighting off an attempt to detain [This.GetHerHim]. \n\n[This.GetName] is now in a safe location, tending to [This.GetHerHis] wounds, and will be unavailable for a few weeks while [This.GetSheHe] recovers."
 operative_events.4.a:0 "[This.GetSheHe] will be back in the fight soon enough."
 operative_events.5.t:0 "Enemy Agent turned"
 operative_events.5.desc:0 "Our counter-intelligence service has achieved a major success: following extensive interrogation, and upon being informed of [This.GetHerHis] likely fate if [This.GetSheHe] was charged with espionage, the captured [From.From.GetAdjective] agent [This.GetName] has agreed to cooperate with us in return for a full amnesty of [This.GetHerHis] crimes against the state.\n\nWith [This.GetHerHis] in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of the [From.From.GetAdjective] intelligence services, [This.GetSheHe] will no doubt find it much easier to infiltrate [From.From.GetNameDef] and remain undetected by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence."
 operative_events.5.a:0 "But we expected [This.GetHerHim] to die?"
 operative_events.6.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Operative Captured!"
 operative_events.6.desc:0 "[This.GetName] has been caught attempting to infiltrate our administration and leak secret information back to [This.GetHerHis] superiors. Upon interrogation, [This.GetSheHe] revealed [This.GetHerselfHimself] to be a foreign asset for [From.GetAgency] operating on [From.From.GetAdjective] soil. It is still yet unknown what the exact nature of [From.GetAdjective] interest in our nation is or what sections of our administration have already been exposed to the eyes of [From.GetAdjective] Intelligence. With [This.GetName] imprisoned and awaiting further interrogation, we can only hope that eventually [This.GetSheHe] will reveal all there is to know of [From.GetAdjective] operations in [From.From.GetNameDef]."
 operative_events.6.a:0 "We have ways of making you talk."
