 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_YEVDOKIA_BERSHANSKAYA_DESC:0 "예브도키야 다비도브나 베르샨스카야는 러시아 내전 중 적군을 지원하다 죽음을 맞이한 부모님의 족적을 따라가고자 했습니다. 그녀는 18살이 되자마자 항공 학교에 입교하여 파일럿이자 비행 강사가 되었습니다. 독일의 침략 당시, 여성으로만 구성된 3개의 폭격기 연대(586, 587 항공 연대, 588 야간 폭격기 연대)가 결성되었습니다. 이미 십여 년 간의 비행 경험을 가진 여류 비행가였던 베르샨스카야는 588 항공 연대의 지휘를 맡게 되었습니다. 588 항공 연대의 작전 환경은 이상적인 환경과는 거리가 멀었습니다. 그들은 구식 복엽기를 사용해야만 했고, 유일하게 잠행할 수 있는 방법은 비행기의 엔진을 멈추고 그들의 타겟을 향해 활공하는 것이 전부였습니다. 그러나 이러한 한계에도 불구하고, 588 항공 연대는 그들의 임무를 대단히 성공적으로 완수하였으며 독일군은 그들에게 "밤의 마녀들"이라는 별명을 붙였습니다.\n\n혼란스러웠던 모스크바 철수 이후 소련 공군의 지휘계통이 무너지게 되었지만 588 항공 연대를 비롯한 몇몇 다른 연대들은 베르샨스카야를 중심으로 모여 조직 체계를 유지하고자 하였습니다. 그녀는 안정적이고 조직적인 퇴각을 이끌면서 금방이라도 무너질 것 같았던 잔존 공군 병력을 시베리아 수르구트 근교의 임시 활주로로 재배치하는데 성공하였습니다. 그 다음 해에 자칭 "자유 비행단"은 아르한겔스크에 잔존한 소련의 공업과 긁어모은 잔해 그리고 가내 작업장을 활용하여 군사력을 증강시키는 한편, 그들의 핵심이었던 베테랑 파일럿들은 신병 양성을 위해 힘썼습니다. 그들은 서부 러시아 전쟁 당시 귀중한 전력으로 활약했으며 전쟁이 끝난 이후에도 그들의 힘을 보전할 수 있었습니다. 현재까지도 베르샨스카야는 루프트바페의 폭격을 막아내기 위해 전투기를 출격시키고 있습니다."

 FAV.2.desc:0 "Whilst is is not uncommon for us to receive donations or even tribute from some of the warlords in response to our efforts to defend the skies of Russia, we have received a gift from a more unexpected source. Towards Moskowien lies the region of Vyatka which has, it seems, become the 'Empire' of 'Emperor' Vladimir the first.\n\nModelling himself as 'the alternative' to Bolshevik and fascist rulers, he is seemingly gaining some degree of support in West Russia and has decided to show us his 'gratitude' for our service in protecting the skies as best we can. At his own expense, the Emperor has donated a number of aircraft to further aid our efforts. We suspect whilst there is truth to his desire to thank us, there is a large element of him trying to secure our support for his regime. Regardless, we have sent our gratitude for the donation."

Manpower is scarce and precious, and the Free Aviators must balance §GGround Crew§! and §PPilots§! carefully, to ensure mission-readiness and an ability to replace losses. New pilots and ground crew shall be recruited every 30 days.\n\nThe COMBAT menu covers missions against the Germans. In this menu, aircraft will be committed directly to combat, or placed in reserve for later use. The aircraft directly in use will be able to fly against German incursions - an intelligence event covering German activity will fire every 30 days. Aircraft that are kept in reserve cannot fight, but are immune to being destroyed.

 ### National ideas ###
 FAV_night_witches:0"Night Witches"
 FAV_night_witches_desc:0"We have never stopped fighting. Not in the war, not in the frenzy of evacuation, and not over the long years of disorder and collapse that followed. We have always been there, rising to combat the German invaders, even as others who claimed to do so fell into internecine conflict. But we did not, will not, ever stop. When the Germans come in their bombers, preparing to rain death upon the peoples of Russia, we respond. We avenge. And, far more often than they would like to admit, we win. Many years ago the Germans, in their fear, named us the 'Night Witches.' Their pilots of today will again learn the reason for that moniker, preferably as their crippled aircraft speed, ever faster, towards the ground. With them inside."
 FAV_aerial_society:0"Aerial Society"
 FAV_aerial_society_desc:0"The disproportionate numbers of pilots and aircraft in our lands, together with the experiences and outlooks of our leadership, have resulted in every societal problem being looked at through an aerial lens. We compensate for poor infrastructure with airbridges. We use long-endurance reconnaissance aircraft instead of traditional border patrols. As well as much more besides. Every question posed has an answer in the skies, and we will prove it."
 FAV_collective_improvisation:0"Collective improvisation"
 FAV_collective_improvisation_desc:0"Our lands are barren, to put it mildly. Despite this, we maintain an air force capable of challenging, and occasionally defeating, the mighty Luftwaffe, and we do this through extreme improvisation. Whether it is replacing high-performance engines with those from tractors, distilling grain alcohol to replace aviation fuel, or repairing damaged metal wings with fabric and wood, we figure out a way to make do. This attitude towards collaborative improvisation permeates our society, ensuring that whatever the challenge encountered our people, instead of succumbing to despair or defeat, work together to find an innovative solution."
