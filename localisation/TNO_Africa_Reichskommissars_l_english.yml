 POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_MULLER_DESC:0 "국가판무관 지그프리드 뮐러는 라이히에서 가장 사랑받는 미디어 스타입니다. 대담하고, 매력적이고, 주목을 끕니다. 젠트랄아프리카 국가판무관부의 카리스마 넘치는 지도자이며 라이히의 아프리카 판무관들 중 가장 부유합니다. 폴란드, 프랑스, 러시아에서 활약한 베테랑인 뮐러는 독일에게서 돈을 뜯어내는 하극상은 저지르지 않고 지속적으로 이윤을 창출하는 유일한 식민지 중앙아프리카를 이끌고 있습니다. 그의 중앙아프리카 통치는 "레세페르" 즉 "거의 무개입"으로 표현됩니다. 외국기업이 콩고의 가치를 황폐화시키고 중앙아프리카의 금고는 해운 통행료로 채워집니다. 반면 뮐러의 독일인들을 여행을 떠나 생각없이 술을 퍼마시고, 움직이는 것은 무엇이든 사냥하고, 치마를 입고 도박으로 수표를 날립니다. 다른 국가판무관부, 외국, 독일에 용병으로 나갈때 빼고는 늘 똑같습니다.\n\n뮐러의 관심사는 사냥입니다. 아프리카의 모든걸 사냥하기 위해 정기적으로 정글 깊숙히 떠납니다. ANC 파르티잔을 우연히 만난다면, 가장 위험한 사냥게임을 시작합니다."
 POLITICS_HANS_HUTTIG_DESC:0 "라이히 전역에서 국가판무관 한스 휘티히만큼 음험한 사람은 거의 없습니다. 세계대전에서 잔혹한 말살수용소를 관리했던 휘티히는 오스트아프리카에서 국가사회주의를 무자비하게 이행하는데 헌신합니다. 미로같은 아프리카 수용소에서, 폭동을 일으킨 군중 속에서, 그는 나치의 전대미문의 공포이자 파괴의 수학자로 여겨집니다. 휘티히는 자신만이 아프리카에서 유일하게 진실을 보는 독일인이라고 생각합니다. 아프리카는 완전한 어둠의 심장을 가진 대륙입니다. 그리고 다마스쿠스의 강철 주먹은 인간 이하의 악을 분쇄해야 합니다.\n\n휘티히의 라이히에 대한 충성심, 잔혹함, 조직적 능력은 거듭 입증되고 있습니다. 효과적이고 순수한 정부를 구성하고, 독일인만을 고용하고, 아프리카 SS사단을 거부하고, 로도시아의 옛 영국인들에 의해 강화된 그의 정예 친위대의 끊임없는 훈련과 전투에 이르기까지 휘티히의 경직되고 군국주의적인 사회는 식민지보다는 대규모 수용소와 더 유사합니다. 그러나 동료 판무관들은 퇴폐와 부패에 통치를 떠넘기고 번영과 과분한 부를 과시하는 연예인으로 밖에 안보입니다.\n\n이에 대해 휘티히는 동료들에 대한 경멸만을 나타내며, 오로지 라이히와의 연을 통해 남쪽과 동쪽의 피할 수 없는 분쟁을 계획합니다. 그는 아프리카에 있는 유일한 나치 정보기관이 그에게 붙인 이름에 대해 아무런 논쟁도 하지 않습니다. 아프리카엔 다른 누구도 필요치 않습니다."
 POLITICS_EMIL_MAURICE_DESC:0 "어느날 아침, 한 무리의 시위대가 기본적인 복지와 최소한의 인권존중을 요구하며 국가판무관 에밀 마우리체의 집무실을 에워쌌습니다. 대부분의 다른 국가판무관부에서 이러한 시위가 벌어지면 공개적인 총격으로 신속하게 청소하고 반정부 행위를 부인할 것입니다. 그러나 마우리체가 일어나 시끄러운 고함소리를 들었을때, 그가 한 행동은 커튼을 닫아 달라는 온순한 요청이었습니다. 기능이 정지된 후 비난은 곧 사라졌습니다.\n\n아돌프 히틀러의 운전기사이자 사적으로 친했던 마우리체가 50년대에 라이히를 떠나 마다가스카르로 오면서 끔찍한 무관심이 시작됐습니다. 그의 조상 중 명확한 비아리아적 요소가 있다는 비난 속에 총통이 임명했습니다. 사형과 뒷방 늙은이 중 그는 후자를 선택했습니다. 토아마시나에 도착한 이후 마우리체는 식민지 내정에 거의 신경을 쓰지 않고 회의도 하지 않으며 섬 전체에 고통받는 사람들의 비명을 무시했습니다. 유일하게 사랑하는 고국으로 돌아가고자 수없이 탄원서를 보냈지만, 모두 무시당했습니다.\n\n조직적인 유대인들의 저항이 강화되고 말라가시 민병대가 중앙 고지에 기지를 세우는 와중에도 마우리체의 공허감은 더욱 커졌으며 군국주의자들은 정권과 계속 거리를 두고 있습니다. 여전히 충성스러운 사람들은 무력충돌이 가까이 왔다는걸 알지만, 그가 보여주는건 무관심 뿐입니다. 그가 유일하게 꿈구는건 망명입니다. 이 거대한 집을 만드는데 기여했을지도 모르지만, 그 집을 탈출하는게 그가 원하는 것입니다. 악으로부터 구원받기위해."
 POLITICS_WOLFGANG_SCHENCK_DESC:0 "한때 라이히에서 가장 뛰어난 에이스였던 볼프강 솅크의 남서아프리카 정부는 공중에서 만들어졌습니다. 수백번의 비행으로 조국에서 유명하며, 폭격기 개발에 대한 전문지식으로 루프트바페에서도 유명합니다. 하지만 아프리카에서 가장 가난한 국가판무관부의 대표이며, 산업 기반이 부족하여 활주로 수입과 가스에 의존하고 있습니다. 앙골라 지평선 너머에 있는 사람들의 생각대로, 그의 관심사는 급성장하는 공군입니다. 그의 공군은 사하라 이남의 하늘을 지배합니다.\n\n수년간 솅크는 남서아프리카가 독일령 아프리카의 항공중심지라고 자부했습니다. 내부적으로 그는 관대함과 동료 국가판무관 지그프리드 뮐러와의 우정으로 유명합니다. 그는 종종 개인 헬리콥터를 타고 사파리나 사냥에 참여합니다. 이는 아마도 토착민과 SS 업무로부터 벗어난 구름 속 피난처일 것입니다. 하늘이 그를 끌어당깁니다. 그곳엔 위안이 있습니다."

 GERAF.2.t:0 "The Lifeline is Cut"
 GERAF.2.desc:0 "The news of the Civil War in Germany shocked the world and sent many a politician scrambling, but none more so than Germany's loyal vassals in Africa.\n\nAlready having been in a constant state of unrest with the rising forces of African nationalism and the ever growing flames of Communist thought in the repressed people's there, the nations had more and more come to rely on the homeland for military and economic support in return for the massive output of colonial resources.\n\nWith Germany in flames, however, and the central government seemingly disappeared in the smoke, this support has suddenly dissapeared. Already, slaves have disappeared from their barracks and insurgent groups across the Congo have begun a new wave of attacks."
 GERAF.2.a:0 "No need to... panic, stay calm, STAY CALM!"
 GERAF.3.t:0 "The New Age of Resistance"
 GERAF.3.desc:0 "As the situation in the African Reichskommissars has deteriorated, the various rebels that the regimes have been battling for twenty years have faced their greatest string of successes yet. Multiple military posts and plantations across Africa have disappeared as the rebels have gotten bolder and bolder in their strikes, and Göringstadt has become swarmed with panicked refugees as independent farmers and settlers have abandoned their homesteads in the wake of this new invasion.\n\nWith rebel control of the countryside and the noose slowly tightening on the central cities of the colonies, it is clear that the Reichskommissars days may be numbered."
 GERAF.3.a:0 "What did we ever do to deserve this?!"
 GERAF.4.t:0 "Afrika Schild"
 GERAF.4.desc:0 "With the situation spiraling out of control, drastic action clearly became necessary for the survival of the German states in Africa. While the three colonies of Ostafrika, Zentralafrika and Südwestafrika had always had friendly relations, their interactions had never been much further, and they had maintained separate security forces, administration, and Reichskommissars.\n\nWhile this situation has worked well enough with the central administration in Germania to manage the colonies, now that said administration has seemingly shattered, it is clear that action needs to be taken.\n\nAfrika Schild is the proposed solution, a united defense alliance and a centralized military administration, the alliance may be our only chance to save our domains from utter collapse."
 GERAF.4.a:0 "All for one and one for all!"
 GERAF.4.b:0 "We are doing perfectly fine on our own!"
 
 GERAF.7.t:0 "Offer Ceasefire"
 GERAF.7.desc:0 "Although our brave soldiers have made large gains, this war has perhaps dragged on for too long. With our current position in the war, it would be trivial to get the South Africans and their American allies to agree to an offer of a ceasefire, on our terms of course. However, it might be wise to push on, as Endsieg seems to draw closer and closer"
 GERAF.7.a:0 "Offer it"
 GERAF.7.b:0 "We will push on!"
 
# GERAF.7.t:0 "The South Africans refuse" #duplicate loc key
# GERAF.7.desc:0 "It seems that we have underestimated the South Africans willingness to make a deal, as they have replied that they have no intention of agreeing to our generous offer of a ceasefire. This matters little of course, Endsieg will come to the Reich eventually" #duplicate loc key
# GERAF.7.a:0 "So be it" #duplicate loc key
 
 GERAF.9.t:0 "Offer Ceasefire"
 GERAF.9.desc:0 "As this war drags on longer and longer, some of our advisors have begun to push for an offer of a neutral ceasefire to be presented to the South Africans and their American allies. While wi might have scoffed at such ideas before, perhaps we have better things to worry about. On the other hand, Endsieg might be just out of reach"
 GERAF.9.a:0 "Offer it"
 GERAF.9.b:0 "We will push on!"
 
 GERAF.10.t:0 "Offer Ceasefire"
 GERAF.10.desc:0 "As we lose more land by the day under the enemy advance, many of our advisors and even some commanders have demanded that we offer a ceasefire to the South Africans and their American allies. While we would lose a large amount of territory as a result of such a ceasefire, perhaps it would prove to be the best course of action in the long run. But perhaps the one thing keeping us from Endsieg is our lack of will."
 GERAF.10.a:0 "Offer it"
 GERAF.10.b:0 "We will push on!"

 GERAF.11.t:0 "Activate Werewolves "
 GERAF.11.desc:0 "As the South Africans and their American masters push farther and farther into our territory, we are presented with a unique opportunity. As is standard for all Reichskommissariats, we have established our own units of werwolf partisan fighters who will cause chaos and confusion behind enemy lines. We shall make them pay dearly for every inch of ground they take."
 GERAF.11.a:0 "They shall strike from the shadows"

 GERAF.12.t:0 "Werewolves return"
 GERAF.12.desc:0 "Due to driving the invaders from our own territory, we have managed to link up with our werewolf units. While many are battered and bruised they are still stoic in doing their duty for the fatherland, they shall be commended."
 GERAF.12.a:0 "Their service shall be remembered"
 
 GERAF.13.t:0 "Die Geloof Offensief"
 GERAF.13.desc:0 "Our military commanders have drawn up plans for a bold and surprising offensive, nicknamed Die Geloof Offensief, or the Promise Day Offensive. The plan involves gathering and organizing all of our brave partisans into cohesive units. Once assembled they shall be used on a grand offensive starting on the 16th of December. We hope that this will catch the enemy completely by surprise, although this will noticeably decrease the effectiveness of our partisans."
 GERAF.13.a:0 "Execute the plan!"
 GERAF.13.b:0 "We would rather not take such a risk"
 
 GERAF.20.t:0 "Pounce on South Africa!"
 GERAF.20.desc:0 "While Afrika Schild has proven fruitful, and we have scored a choice few victories against the rebel forces, the situation has still not recovered. Still, we lose more and more land every day to the cursed partisans.\n\nThe solution seems to have fallen into our laps. An invasion of South Africa has been suggested constantly in different forms for the past twenty years, and we have gone so far as to keep a steady stream of arms and weaponry, with the Reich's approval and support, going to the Boer's to help them with their struggle. This finally seems to have found fruit, as with the situation in South Africa also deteriorating, the Boers have declared their independence from the South African government.\n\nIt is unsure if their rebellion will see much fruit, but if we were to support them in their struggle, we could find a strong ally to help us against our own insurgents. The other fear is that if we allow the Boers to go to the wolves, the OFN will most likely support the South African government, and then we'd have our enemies at our doorstep. America is cautious however, no doubt if we join the Boers, the Yankees and their pets would be too afraid of conflict with the mighty Reich to try and stop the events."
 GERAF.20.a:0 "The Reich does not bow, it rules!"
 GERAF.20.b:0 "We'll find some other solution..."
 
 GERAF.21.t:0 "The End of the War - Ceasefire!"
 GERAF.21.desc:0 "It is over. The Americans and the OFN have proven far more eager to hop into another war, and despite the bravery and ferocity of our fighting boys, the betrayal of the local partisans has sabotaged our war effort and ultimately caused us to fail to take our objectives. The only thing that stopped our complete capitulation to the hordes of barbarous Americans and their South African allies was the support from the homeland, which had barely managed to return things to a standstill.\n\nWith America seemingly exhausted by the bloody nose our superior forces gave them, and with our militaries desperately needed to refocus back home, we have accepted the American offer of a ceasefire, though have refused their petty offers for peace. While this will hurt the Reichskommissars, especially the massive landgrab on the part of the OFN, perhaps the shrinking of the borders will ultimately prove to be a good thing for our security."
 GERAF.21.a:0 "Peace with honor..."
 
 GERAF.22.t:0 "The End of the War - Ceasefire!"
 GERAF.22.desc:0 "It seems that the South Africans and their American allies were suffering just as much as we were. Our offer of a neutral ceasefire has been accepted. as South Africa and America proved to lack the will to pursue a war against our superior German tactics and equipment. Although we have suffered heavily through this war, the same can also be said of the Americans, who now face a growing peace movement in their nation.\n\nNow we must turn our attention to other matters, while we have been successful at managing the increased amount of resistance so far, it is never a good idea to get complacent."
 GERAF.22.a:0 "Now, to more pressing matters"
 
 GERAF.23.t:0 "The End of the War - Ceasefire!"
 GERAF.23.desc:0 "When the news of the South Africans accepting the ceasefire finally came to our headquarters the officers had special cases of aged wine brought up to celebrate. Once again the superiority of the German way of warfare is displayed to the entire world. The Americans, forced to flee from our superior forces with their tails behind their backs, come home to a massive anti-war movement our victory is all but total.\n\nNow we must turn our attention to managing and advise the new Boer republic, to ensure that they too reap the all the benefits of superior German administration, as well as to ensure that they realize how much they owe to the Reich, and their obligation to pay it all back with interest."
 GERAF.23.a:0 "Another victory for the Reich!" 
 
 GERAF.24.t:0 "The South African war: Victory!"
 GERAF.24.desc:0 "As the last helicopters evacuating whatever is left of the American forces in South Africa leave, it finally dawns on the remaining South Africans, they lost. Whit this final victory the Reich's dominance over Africa is all but assured. The loyal Boers are fine subjects, and worthy of being given the majority of South African land.  Of course, it will be necessary to help this young government through its troubled beginnings, and we will be providing our best advisors on the matters of domestic policy and trade. Once again, the superiority of the Reich is made apparent. Now, if only those Africans would learn the same lesson we just taught the Americans"
 GERAF.24.a:0 "The Reich's superiority is total!"
 
 GERAF.26.t:0 "Deja Vu"
 GERAF.26.d:0 "After our stunning victory against the uncivilized hordes of American and South African soldiers, we quickly moved into the territories fo the former South African Republic. Our economic analysts, the ones that were personally trained by Göring himself, predicted that by fueling the economy with the fires of war and supplementing that with the spoils from our new conquests, would ensure that our previously rather collapsing mp economies would explode into massive growth.\n\nThose economists were shot today, as the news of another slave plantation being burned down by ANC resistance fighters reached the headquarters of Africa Schild. The supposed "Wealth of Africa" with which we were supposed to save our budgets has, unfortunately, seemingly vanished with the evacuated South African government.\n\nThe Boer republic, our client state administering what was once South Africa, has proven itself to be less than successful at capitalizing on the economic base that exists there. Soon after their government was established the various militia groups that made up the Boer army, once united against their common enemies, soon fractured into cliques centered around powerful generals  with the main contention between them being the Boers relationship to us, with a growing force of Afrikaans military men declaring that they will refuse to bend the knee to a German just like they refused to do so to an Anglo.. While tensions are dormant for now, they will not remain so for long\n\nWhile they may be uncivilized, the ferocity and skill of these African resistance fighters is undeniable. But what is truly keeping us down is the newfound cooperation between the ANC and the few rouge South African army units still active.\n\nWhile the ANC might previously have been described as a highly motivated but lightly equipped force of revolutionaries, the second part of that sentence must be removed now that they have access to military grade hardware and training. It seems that the supposed "Economic miracle of war" was just an illusion."
 GERAF.26.a:0 "Damn it all to hell!"
 
 GERAF.27.t:0 "The Ides of March"
 GERAF.27.d:0 "During the middle of the night, in a secluded field in the German colony of Zentralafrika, a plane takes off. Its crew will never return. Inside is former Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, he flees from what appears to be death itself. A few hours later the plane lands in Anjou, the capital of free France. There Müller is met with a warm welcome by his closest friend and newly declared head of the military junta that now leads Free France, Jaques Massu.\n\nA few days earlier Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig invited Müller and Reichskommissar Schenck of Südwest-Afrika to a celebration of their mutual victory over the American swine. Schenck, being located closer to Hüttigs manor, arrived first. He would never return. Müllers spies had warned him only a few hours before he arrived at Hüttigs estate that Hans was planning to murder them both. Unwilling to pursue a war against the elite forces under the command of Hüttig, Müller decided that his time as leader of Zentralafrika was over, and fled the country.\n\nNow the sole remaining figure of German authority in the region is Hans Hüttig, the butcher of Africa. As he took control of all of the German colonies in Africa he announced the creation of the Großafrikanischer Reichsstaat, a new administration which would ensure that the proper ideals of national-socialism would be enforced over Africa.\n\nLittle news leaves the Reichsstaat, but what comes out is horrifying. Entire regions "Pacified" by Hurtings fanatical SS soldiers. Slave labor camps that stretch on for kilometers. And a total dedication to eradication any shred of resistance that remains in Africa."
 GERAF.27.a:0 "For Hüttig!"

 cog.38.d:0 "Ostland is often considered the model colony, always acting in The Fatherlands name, trying to be true aryans. Hah! Not under Reichkommisars Müller's watch! Zentralafrika is, if anything, a exploitation site for the Reich, and a amusement park for the Reichkommisar himself. Because if there truly is anything that Müller loves in this world, it is hunting exotic animals in all kind and shapes. The land, meanwhile, is exploited to everyone's content. Tons upon tons of natural recourses are taken through the ports of Zentralafrika on a daily basis, funneling the Reich's great expenses. Who knows what awaits The Heart of Darkness in these dark times? Well,Müller certainly doesn't know, or care."
 cog.38.a:0 "Truly,there isn't a more natural joy in life than the thrill of the hunt!"
 cog.39.t:0 "The Aryan on the Moon"
 cog.39.d:0 "Müller thought that today couldn't get any better, The Hunt was generous, the weather was excellent and the company? Flawless. But oh oh oh! Müller truly must be a lucky man, because news reached him when he was relocating to another hunting spot, that the German space program, that the brave men who want no less but the starts themselves for their Fatherland, have finally succeded in their grand mission, fit for only the Aryan. Truly, the Aryan race is the chosen race, for how else, could they beat everyone else in such a grand race? Gone to waste are the American and Japanese efforts, for The Reich, The Fatherland of the Master Race, The center of The World has finally completed Man's Last Conquest and landed a man on the moon!"
 cog.39.a:0 "Another great accomplishment for the Ubermensch!"
