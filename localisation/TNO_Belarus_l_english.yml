 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_RADASAU_ASTROUSKI_DESC:0 "Some men spend their entire lives clinging onto the fires of ideology, fighting with every last drop of blood, sweat, and tears in order to keep their radical hope alive. Radasłaŭ Astroŭski would point to the unmarked graves of each of those men and women in response. Originally studying physics and mathematics, Astroŭski's many setbacks in the school system came rewarded by becoming a Commissar, then a politician for the First All-Belarusian Congress, where he lit the fire of his core ambition: the independence of a Belarusian state. \n\nIn his rise, Astroŭski worked with all manner of people to support Belarusian independence. As the Communists flooded in, he appealed to them, and he even established a Polish-Belarusian Society to foster these views amongst the Poles to the west. However, as the Nazis came in the early years of the war, he knew that the best way forward was the same thing he did with the Soviets and the Poles: work with them, fight alongside them, and, eventually, success will be had. And, as the Soviets died and fell apart in the East, and the democratic Allies faltered and retreated in the West, Radasłaŭ Astroŭski's plan had succeeded, as he managed to survive the onslaught of the Second World War, with a hidden desire for independence and a new, shiny seat of administration within Belarusian territory. \n\nHowever, having a position of administration under the Nazi jackboot has not made the task any easier. Ever since the Nazi victory, the demands for Astroŭski and his compatriots to carry out massacres of the Jewish population of Belarus, or to deport entire groups of his constituents away to be chained to the Nazi plantation has fostered an abominable situation in Astroŭski's dream of a free Belarus. With the dream of freedom on the horizon, however, Astroŭski understands that he mustn't give into the temptations to become another unmarked grave of a passionate revolutionary; rather, he must continue to do three things, and three things alone: work with them, fight alongside them, and find that success on the horizon."
 
 ### Ideas ###
BLR_Bring_on_the_Youth:0 "Bring on the Youth"
BLR_Bring_on_the_Youth_desc:0 "Now is the time of national liberation, and all must do their part to fight for Belarus. The men have been sent off to war, the women have been put to work in the fields and factories, but the children remain idle and useless. This must change if we wish to win this war.\n\nRecruitment drives, propaganda, and various other forms of encouragement will be used to motivate the youth to do their part for a free Belarus. Every honorable teen will join our ranks, and they will serve with pride in our divisions."
BLR_This_is_Our_Land:0 "This is Our Land"
BLR_This_is_Our_Land_desc:0 "The homeland of the Belarussian people has been occupied for centuries, traded between various empires like a pack of cigarretes. Conquerors have marched their armies through Belarus time and time again, as war after war has been fought through our hills and forests. However, while these empires may know our land, they do not understand it like we do.\n\nBy using our knowledge of the backpaths, the passes, and the secret trails built by years of partisan activity, we will fight for every inch of Belarus we can. Any enemy who dares trespass on our soil will be torn to shreds, never even seeing those who took their lives."
BLR_For_Belarus:0 "For Belarus"
BLR_For_Belarus_desc:0 "For centuries, the Belarussian people have been oppressed by numerous masters. Sometimes it was the Russians, sometimes the Poles, once even the French and the Swedes. Currently, our latest masters have been the Germans, who have been exceptionally brutal in their attempts to grind us into the dirt and wipe any mention of Belarus from history.\n\nNow, however, we find ourselves in a stellar position to win our freedom for the first time in centuries. Germany has fallen to pieces in its own desperate struggle, and Ostland collapses in a bloodbath even more chaotic than the one in Germany proper. In this time of crisis, Michal Vistuka has risen to lead us forward into a new dawn, one of prosperity and freedom for all Belorussians. Fight on, brothers, for a better future!"
BLR_The_Black_Cat_Spirit:0 "The Black Cats"
BLR_The_Black_Cat_Spirit_desc:0 "While the battle for Ostland may before the first trial of combat for many, it is certainly not the first fight that Michal Vituska has found himself in. When the Germans first entered Belarus, sweeping it out of the hands of the Bolsheviks, Vituska was trained to be the leader of an anti-bolshevik partisan group, the Black Cats. Ever since then, he and his organization have spent years patrolling through Ostland, fighting communists wherever they crop up.\n\nNow, the Black Cats' experience and training can be put to good use. Our new recruits will be trained in the ways of partisan warfare, just as Vituska was long ago. Soon, every solider will be an experience guerilla fighter, ready to destroy any enemies that dare challenge us."
BLR_We_Are_Like_Vipers:0 "Like Vipers"
BLR_We_Are_Like_Vipers_desc:0 "An army is only as good as its soldiers, and we must make sure our soldiers are the best in Ostland. While the German contenders have professionally trained troops at their disposal, and Kovner's band has decades of experience under its belt, our soldiers currently are what Vituska had at his disposal, along with numerous groups of lightly trained Belarussian citizens. Therefore, where we lack in training, we must make up in ferocity.\n\nEvery soldier, no, every citizen must know how to resist against any foreign occupier. Men will be trained in the art of hit-and-run tactics, women will be taught how to use weapons and stop invaders, and even children will be trained in various, low-level forms of warfare. Every citizen will fight as hard as they can against any enemy, draining their will to fight and strength to push onwards. If we cannot have the resources or experience of the other actions, our will and motivation will more than make up for it."
BLR_For_Ostland:0 "For Ostland"
BLR_For_Ostland_desc:0 "Belarus is free, but the fight is not yet over. To our north, various factions still grapple over the fate of the Baltic States, wreaking havoc across the plains and rivers. Each of these factions has nothing but the worst in mind for their citizens, and we must step in to stop them.\n\nThese factions are traitors to Germany, or even outright enemies, and Vituska has stepped in to put an end to it. We shall call upon all true sons of the Reich to join our righteous cause of autonomy and freedom, and we shall crush those who still stand against us. All of Ostland will be in our hands!"

BLR.1.t:0 "Vituska's Dilemna"
BLR.1.desc:0 "Vituska pondered over the choices left open to him. And in his own mind, he still had his own thoughts haunting him as they stared at his face. As war claimed Ostland and sank its teeth into it, the man wanted to be careful./n/nAnd he indeed was careful. He could go one way or the other. But after taking one way, there was no going back. One path could get him the support of the people of Belarus, and another could secure him superior weapons and more competent fighters.\n\nYet, to him, choosing now seemed difficult. If he sacrificed the choice of siding with the partisans, he could face greater trials in taking and holding on to the land. If he didn't, he could run the risk of facing defeat due to a lack of experience and an absence of firepower.\n\nYet, no matter how much he wanted an alternative to simply choosing one while forsaking the other, it was time to choose. There was no more time."
BLR.1.a:0 "We must go with our people."
BLR.1.b:0 "We will go with the greater advantages."

BLR_The_Collaborator_desc:0 "We finally have a chance to take Ostland for ourselves. But we must decide on an approach. And we must choose wisely. There are two ways we can take for the sake of our homeland.\n\nWe can look for our comrades among the freedom fighters. Or we can seek the aid of the Germans and the other collaborators. \n\nWe can only take one out of two of these paths. Once we take one, there is no going back for the other one."

Vituska has gotten in contact with some of his closest associates in the SS, and though they are few in number, they are willing to lend us their great expertise and their mastery over the equipment they have come with.\n\nThey may not be the most desirable types, but they will have to do so."
