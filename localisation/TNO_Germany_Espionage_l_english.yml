To prevent the specter of Bolshevism from returning to Europe, we will send operatives to sabotage these separatists and their devious plots, giving the advantage to the Iberian Axencia Anti-Seperatista forces.

GER_Espionage_aid_spanish_fascists:0 "Send Aid to the Spanish Fascists"
GER_Espionage_aid_spanish_fascists_desc:0 "From war comes opportunity, and much opportunity has been laid out in the battlegrounds of Iberia. Among the disparate factions that fight over the future, the hard-right has settled in and began their fight for Iberia's future- something that could pay off in spades for the Reich. Of course, the Reich can only reap the spoils of war if the fascists of Iberia succeed. As such, we shall supply them with arms and ammunition in order to keep them one step ahead of their rivals."

In the middle of the night, an elite team of Fallschirmjäger veterans will deploy from a plane far above SAM range and perform an experimental American form of vertical insertion known as a High Altitude Low Opening Jump, swiftly landing in what SIGINT suggests is the weakest area of SS-Hauptamt control, former Wallonia. They will raid an SS communications center, retrieve High Value Intel, and exfiltrate to the coast northeast of Dunkerque, where they will activate a radar beacon and be picked up by submarine.

His strong enmity with Heinrich Himmler since the days of Fremde Heere Ost and ambition to unify the German swamp of intelligence agencies into one led him to this very point, as the President of the Reichsnachrichtendienst.\n\nYet, just as in the Second World War, Germany is in danger - and just as Fremde Heere Ost was not sufficient to Gehlen then, the Reichsnachrichtendienst is only a stepping stone for him. It would be wise to not underestimate the Fox and his ambition."

Friends and colleagues since the days of Fremde Heere Ost, Wessel soon distinguished himself as a man of iron stoicism, yet eloquent demeanor and sharp mind. Too sharp even for his former friend, in the end.\n\nFar from an ideologue, Wessel's leading principle is safety and stability for the Reich and the German people. This also means doing away with the Reichsnachrichtendienst's nature as a shady cabal it gained under Gehlen, instead transforming it into a service that is truly determined to protect not only the Führer or the Party but Germans as a whole.\n\nIn removing Gehlen from his control over the Reichsnachrichtendienst, the Reich gained - and the Führer, perhaps, lost. It remains to be seen if Wessel's loyalty to the people may bring him into conflict with the Führer."

Never again would the Slav dare build a state to rival the might of the Reich, and in the absence of the strict authoritarianism of its successive governments, the illiterate Russian peasant would revert to his base instincts of violence and raiding for any meaningful future. Or at least, so we thought, joining the First Führer in his dismissal of the Russians. Then came the West Russian War, and while officially we swatted the bolshevik hordes aside with ease, in reality the state was severely weakened by the conflict and the integrity of our eastern lands was considerably compromised even up to this day.\n\nNow the spectre of that conflict rears its ugly head again. While we long expected there to be some sort of unification attempt between the unorganized warlords of European Russia and Western Siberia following the suspension of our punitive air raids during the Bürgerkrieg, an unexpected development was the reformation of the Siberian states thought collapsed in the fifties, thanks to a combination of foreign interference and refurbished Soviet industry.\n\nNow, Russia has been rapidly coalescing into two powerblocs faster than what any analyst thought possible, and what's worse, they appear to be engaging in diplomacy with each other. A reunified Russia cannot be allowed to happen; while we would of course win any potential conflict, the cost in lives, money, and damage to our Reichskommissariats could easily be prohibitive!

We have also noted that Yelena Karbysheva, daughter of the League's former leader, is also a member of this organization, and we could use her as a propaganda tool.\n\nBatov himself was displeased to work with us. While the General did not hide his distaste for the Reich, his hatred for the Black League was more important at the moment.

Five rebels were guarding a warehouse full of guns, though the weapons themselves were complicating everything.\n\nBatov's dogs started shooting as soon as the League's troops busted through the doors. It did not last more than five minutes. Soon, every enemy was dead, and Viktor and his troops needed to clean the mess the rebels left. Their mission was to capture the warehouse, but they also should have apprehended at least one of the bandits. Perhaps one could have revealed who had supplied them with German-made weapons. Most likely, the rebels had smuggled the guns from the West. Some were as old as the West Russian War, it seemed.\n\nNevertheless, Lieutenant Viktor was unsure of how to write his report. A warehouse filled with German guns and Batov's thugs was sure to attract the attention of the Black League's high command. Perhaps even the Glavkoverkh would read his words.

The Father's inner circle consists almost exclusively of priests and monks of the Orthodox persuasion, and most of the extremely limited state apparatus consists of communal coordination agencies staffed by former bolsheviks, and militia systems dominated by North Siberian natives with a deep distrust of even European Russians, and even more so non-Russian Europeans, who they seem to believe are some sort of devils. Nevertheless, there exists a few more regular divisions of Slavic troops alongside the native militias, and it is here we were able to find some purchase. An officer, upset at the lynching of his former superior, a man known as Rodzaevsky (see Appendix A: Reich Assets & Sympathizers In Harbin During The Weltkrieg), revealed that the overall commander of the regular divisions is a man named Pavel Sudoplatov, a former NKVD agent and independent power broker from The Father (see pg.9 for an abbreviated pre-war biography based on Moskowien records).\n\nTo bolster Sudoplatov's legitimacy as protector of the region vis a vis The Father, the Russia desk has suggested to use our contact's network of former Rodzaevsky followers to raid a series of villages near a garrison of regulars. We have hired a group of mercenaries formerly based out of the port of Magadan (see pg.11) to ensure the regulars win the skirmish, and if possible, ensure our contact does not survive it.

Carl smiled as the two sides started firing. Perfect sightlines from their position, Sudoplatov would have his heroic victory, whether he was the one who ordered it or not. His smile faded as he caught a glimpse in the scope of a mustachioed fellow who was wearing the grey coat of Sudoplatov's men despite being with the raiders. Could it be the Alpha?

Numerous scandals have broken out of nowhere, splashed across the headlines of every newspaper in the country- and the names of prominent reformist politicians are the subjects of these PR disasters. Liberal influence, which has been gaining among the people for years, has come to a total halt- even receding in some places in favor of more conservative groups. It seems that the impenetrable popularity of the reformists has finally been pierced, and now we can watch with satisfaction as they deflate like a balloon.\n\nAs cathartic as this may be, however, the question of where these sudden leaks are coming from intrudes on our enjoyment of the moment.

While these targets may not be your top threats, they are the ones we are currently able to handle without sparking suspicion. I trust that you will deem these candidates as acceptable losses to protect your position. Each of these targets, if not dealt with swiftly and decisively, could use their knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET ONE: Karl Brandt, administrator of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program. Has close knowledge of your involvement in the Aktion T4 program- could use against you. NOTE: Despite your close personal connection to Herr Brandt, he poses a great danger to the security of your regime, particularly your support among the reformists.\n\nTARGET TWO: Karl Hanke, Gauleiter of Lower Silesia. Recommended you to Herr Goebbels, initiating your rise in the party. Knows of many of your controversial acts- very dangerous. RND sources indicate ties to SS-Ordenstaat Burgund. NOTE: Once again, despite your close connections, Hanke possesses a great threat to your power and influence, and may use his knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET THREE: Hans Kammler, engineer. Noted for his work on the V-2 Rocket. Once a subordinate of yours. Knows of your previous usage of and position on slaves. No personal connections- could leverage knowledge against you.\n\nOnce again, each of these men holds a sword of Damocles over you and your Fuhrership, and may drop it at any time.

He was a man dedicated to science and medicine, and he was one of my closest friends back in the day. Though we may have drifted apart as time went on, the bond that was shared between us never died, and I could not possibly express my full grief at his untimely passing. That an automobile accident struck down such a gem of our Reich serves as a terrible reminder that all of us are merely human, and must treasure and cherish our days on Earth..."\n\nHowever, if Karl Brandt, currently resting peacefully in his coffin, could speak instead of Speer, his story would have been vastly different than the eulogy that the Führer gave. Perhaps he would have regaled the audience with how, while he was returning from work, a truck veered out in front of him, forcing him off the road at high speeds. He may have emphasized how, while he was dazed and stunned by the crash, multiple RND men surrounded his vehicle. He certainly would have screamed about how the man in front of the wreck, noticing how Brandt still moved, drew his pistol and put one bullet directly through Brandt's skull. Brandt would have closed his tale on the fire, set by those same men that killed him, that engulfed the car and destroyed the evidence that they had ever been involved.\n\nBut Karl Brandt was dead, and so the crowd gave a standing ovation to their Führer as he concluded, not even suspecting the truth behind the untimely death of Karl Brandt."

When the soldiers went out to search for him the following morning, they found Hanke lying unresponsive against a tree, with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. One of the Landsers, a medic, pronounced Hanke dead at the scene. A subsequent coroner's report found that Hanke had been dead for several hours before being discovered. More concerningly, it has been confirmed that Hanke was shot with a Polish submachine gun or pistol, casings from which were found nearby. Local Ordnungspolizei officers confirmed that a Polish terrorist cell had been active across the border with the General Government in recent years, and at least one member remained at large.\n\n"This is a terrible shock to me," said the Führer of Hanke's murder. "As many Party faithful know, it was Hanke's recommendation to the late Dr. Goebbels that began my career in the government. Not only do I owe him my position as Führer, but he was also a dear friend and confidant of many years. I hope with all my heart that our brave police officers and detectives can bring this case to a satisfying conclusion and enact justice for my friend and colleague."\n\nKarl Hanke had been a mildly controversial figure in recent years, owing to his long-standing support for the SS. He faced criticism at times from fellow NSDAP members for his political views, but was fully exonerated of alleged ties to treasonous elements by the Führer himself shortly after the Bürgerkrieg.
