jap_newflavour.1.d:0 ""새해 복 많이 받으십시오. 하야토 씨." 1962년 1월의 첫날, 하야토와 그의 동료들은 새해의 휴회 기간이 끝난 후, 쌀쌀한 한겨울의 달에 국회로 복귀합니다. 국회의사당 건물은 멀리서 음산하게 보였고, 전날 밤부터 내린 비로 땅이 젖어있었습니다. 대정익찬회에 있는 하야토의 동료들은 서로에 대한 깊은 우정을 보여주며 그를 즐겁게 맞이했습니다. 아마도 올해, 하야토는 모든 것이 순조롭게 진행될 것이라고 혼자 생각했습니다.\n\n"괜찮으십니까?"\n\n"그렇고 말고요."\n\n내각총리대신 이노 히로야는 올해가 일본 국민들에게 지속적인 번영의 해가 될 것이며, 범아시아주의의 실현에 1년 더 가까이 다가갔다고 선언하면서 올해 첫 국회 회기를 개회했습니다. 대정익찬회의 의원들은 나뉘어 앉아있었습니다. 하야토는 자유파 바로 옆의 보수파 사이에  앉았습니다. 그들 뒤에는 개혁관료들과 당의 후원자들인 키도파가 있었습니다. 모든 것이 잘 되어 가고 있었습니다.\n\n그 다음에는 예산안 편성이 등장했습니다. 보수파들은 군과 국가에 할당하는 비율을 전년과 동일한 수준으로 유지하자고 제안했습니다. 자유파들은 군 예산의 삭감을 주장하며 논쟁을 벌였습니다. 이에 격분한 개혁관료들은 냉전의 절정에 도달하지 않았기에, 국방국가의 원칙을 버릴 수 없다고 주장했습니다. 키도파들은 그들의 손을 들었던 적도 있었습니다. 1952년에 말이죠. 그 뒤로 그들은 서로 다투었고, 입법부에서는 또 다른 싸움이 벌어졌습니다.\n\n하야토는 한숨을 쉬었습니다. 또 시작이군요."

jap_newflavour.4.d:0 "Some men say that money makes the world go round, others say it is the root of all evil. To some men in the Japanese Empire, it is both the ends and the means of their life's work. Kaya Okinori is such a man.\n\nKaya's political career has been one of feeding the stream of income to an increasingly militarized Japan. In 1936, he joined other Japanese officials in maximizing the profits from Manchukuo, utilizing the mineral, agricultural, and labor wealth of the region to its limit, especially as the Empire came into conflict with the Americans in the Great East Asian War. By this point, Kaya was the Minister of Finance, and spent many years learning the tools needed to rise in the cutthroat Japanese political system. Most important was knowing what people to listen to.\n\nSince his tenure as the Finance Minister, Kaya has served in the House of Representatives, making close friends with many of the military representatives, especially IJA veterans. The Imperial Army had been an excellent tool to enforce his authority in Manchuria, and a well-seasoned man like Kaya is perfect for proposing some ideas the civilian government may find controversial.\n\nHead of the Reform Bureaucrats wing of the Yokusankai, Kaya's small clique fights for centralization of power above all; bickering among government branches has only delayed Japanese prosperity. The man does hold true to his ideals and belief in a better, stronger Japan, it is no secret his ideals are dependent on his friends, many of whom need a respectable man in the Imperial Diet to achieve their own goals. Whatever the case with these rumors, Kaya Okinori intends to keep the military and industrial power of Japan on a tight leash, no matter what."

jap_newflavour.5.d:0 "Kido was a man of many contradictions. A noble, but also a deputy; a former prime minister, yet an aspiring power-broker, and a grey eminence without a lick of touch in politics. Irrelevant, they called him, a done-with failure. Nobles and deputies alike liked to tell him as they mingled within the chambers: "The fifties, Kido-san." To hell with the Fifties - that was a long time ago. The only thing that could bring Kido's affable, jocular, and jovial temper to a boiling simmer was a reminder of a time when he had power, but powerless. Another contradiction.\n\nHe sat in his corner of the House of the Representatives' lounge, the only Deputy dressed in a decent suit, and who conducted himself with decent etiquette. Were he to sit in the Nobles' lounge, he would be laughed out of the room because of his loose cravat and patterned tie. Kido did not care. When they needed favors, they would come to him, and Kido was not someone so easily offended by a mockery of his mode of dress. No noble should be angry at his inferiors nor his equals.\n\nTea, cakes, while other deputies brought bread and bundled rice. The conservatives, liberals, and reform bureaucrats talked to their leaders freely. Kidoites, even avid ones, avoided Kido. He sat alone, undisturbed.\n\nA time will come when they would surround him, for scraps of power left untouched at the heels of his tables. He just needed to wait."

jap_newflavour.6.d:0 "In the suburbs near the Imperial Palace, rested the living-spaces and homes of the Kazoku: Japan's nobility and the Emperor's kin. When Emperor Meiji moved his court to Tokyo, all of them followed, from low to high, by the heels of his palanquin. A layer of dew covered the courtyards, rooftops, and eaves of this place. Thickets of leafless trees rustled whenever a stray breeze blew between their naked forms as if trembling from the cold of Japanese late winter. The Konoe residence was here, stately, but not immodest, Japanese-style, but not ancient. Hints of verdant grass covered patches here and there, the signs of a budding spring.\n\nA hush fell over Fumimaro Konoe's house. He preferred everything to be as quiet as possible in his house. His wife was in the attic, searching for old articles of clothing that they can give to the neighbor's son. He took tea in his study, whose sliding doors are embossed with the symbol of the Konoe house, highest of all regents of the Emperor. Or once. Dressed in his yukata, he sat, cross-legged, a crass gesture against noble etiquette. In front of him were the treatises from the outside world, from outside Japan. As had always been the case since his youth, American diplomacy fascinated him.\n\nThese days, everything was quiet. For twenty years since his ministry, Japan had managed to carry on, stabilizing its newfound empire against western imperialism. He did not contact the Yokusankai much nowadays. One did not intentionally seek out one's own failure. It had been years since he had seen the Emperor, who he tried to dissuade from a war with America. Since then, His Imperial Majesty had not called on him.\n\nWhen he did, Fumimaro Konoe would be ready to answer that call."

jap_newflavour.7.d:0 "The sun shone brightly on Niigata Central Station, the transportation hub of the prefecture, the main commute for thousands of citizens, and today - the hosting grounds of the representative for Niigata's third district, Kakuei Tanaka's speech. Flanked by local police, Tanaka was speaking to a sea of rural Japanese today: his constituents, his roots, and most importantly his people. Amongst the sea were signs showing support for the stout representative: "The Niigata Mountains Citizen Association Backs Tanaka Kakuei."\n\n"A very good morning to you lovely citizens of Niigata, I have come with brilliant news for our beloved province," Tanaka boomed in his distinctly rural accent, his speech drowned by the applause of the crowd.\n\n"Many of you shared your concerns with me; 'Oh, Tanaka-san, the Hakushin line is overflowing, we can't get to Sendai or Toyama without cramming ourselves in!'. I hear you, my people, I hear you loud and clear, and I made sure those arrogant bureaucrats in Tokyo heard your voices too!" The Hakushin Line was the only train line traversing through Niigata province. Niigata in 1962 was still very much a rural province, dominated by agriculture, and those economic characteristics had played very much in Tanaka's favour. Tanaka had always championed himself as a man of the people, one who rose from the ranks and broke the Tokyo bureaucratic bubble, and to this day retained the confidence of his constituents through generous construction and development projects.\n\n"So today, fellow citizens of Niigata, I present to you - the foundations of the Jouetsu Shinkansen Line!"\n\nCamera flashes and applause drowned out the ending of Tanaka's speech as the ceremonial ribbon was cut. Tanaka himself was silent during the affair, and broke the first ground as a leader should. He did not need any more words to justify or explain himself: he let the results of his labour speak for itself, and for his constituents."

If Your Excellency could excuse me, I am running several major shipping operations right now - the shipment to Ryojun must be delayed for fears of.....complications. Farewell Prince Takeda, I will receive you again shortly."\n\nKishi Nobusuke hung up the telephone and let out a deep sigh before pouring himself a glass of wine. Domaine Christophe Chatillon, Provence, 1954 Vintage. It's just business, Kishi thought to himself as he flipped open the ledger. Plain and simple, the ledger had become famous for being the Devil's Handbook among Kishi's subordinates, opponents and sometimes allies.\n\n"Procurement: 1570 units of logs, Chinese settlement 70 kilometres west of Harbin. Get Colonel Takashi to ensure all logs are in workable condition."\n\n"Shipment to: Showa Steel Works, Ryojun Complex. Logs to be processed and sent immediately to resource extraction."\n\nLegally speaking, a deputy such as Kishi would not have access to such resources, let alone such executive capacity over state-owned operations in another sovereign state. However, Manchukuo, or "Manchu", as Kishi insisted, was his personal point of pride. Who else could have industrialised an uncivilised, savage backwater in such a short period of time, and even transformed it into the Empire's industrial heartland?\n\nKishi flipped to another section of his ledger, this time with the label "Liabilities and Hazards" at the top. The first page was bathed in red stamps, signifying "Liability Eliminated" - almost poetically metaphorical for the sheer bloodshed exemplified on this page alone. Bureaucrats, officers, politicians, students: nobody escaped the eye of the Devil of Showa. Kishi rang the intercom button at the bottom of his desk.\n\n"Schedule a meeting with General Akira Muto. Thursday, next week - at the Sukiyabashi Jiro.""

jap_newflavour.10.d:0 "Colonel Onishi threw his bottle to the ground and lazily raised his fists. He had beer stains down his uniform, his medals were oiled in a particularly potent alcoholic brew. In a slurred speech, the colonel insulted the salaryman outside of the dirty late-night bar with all the energy he could muster, before hurling himself at him.\n\nThe salaryman was thrown to the ground, hitting his head against a red-brick wall, and wailed a cry of pain. He scurried on the ground to gather his balance until he was kicked by the colonel in the back, squirming more in agony. Onishi struck the salaryman over and over, pummeling him with a drunken fury in the darkness of the night. The salaryman's screams echoed over the buzz of dim street lights throughout the darkened streets, only quietened by the occasional blow to the face or jab at his stomach. He wailed for help, but this only angered the colonel further as he was beaten and thrown about the back alleys in the darkness of the night.\n\nThe colonel grasped a handful of the salaryman's hair and dragged him from the alley to the middle of the street, stumbling to teach him a lesson. He raised his hand to slap the now sobbing and beaten man, until a siren approached from further down the road. The police had arrived, and they leapt out of their cars to stop the fighting and arrest both of the men. The salaryman clung onto the police with sheer terror in his eyes, snot and tears mixed with blood dripping from his broken face. The colonel heckled and roared at the officers, resisting arrest and spitting at the salaryman from a distance. Both were stuffed into a police van and driven to the nearest station, tired and shaking from their scuffle just moments ago."

The clacking of typewriters, chatter of policemen, and shuffling of feet were audible to the dark cells, all presumably coming from the offices above. A report printed out slowly before being shared about by the police officers, sounding like the now comfortably familiar office environment he was so used to, and now missed more than ever. Soon after, the keys jingled down the hallway and the noise bounced throughout the jail cells, and the salaryman leapt from the floor. Pain in his bruised face gnawed at his weak patience, but the thought of freedom so soon had calmed him.\n\nThe immediately heavy footsteps of the guardsman marched down the stone corridor to the jail cells in which both men had been kept in overnight. The salaryman, convinced of his innocence, stood by his cell door, awaiting his liberation. As the guard stopped, and the keys jingled once more, a tingle sprung over him. Keys chewed through the lock, and a metal door swung open, but it was not the salaryman's. The guard saluted the colonel and apologized for his inconveniences, to which the colonel turned his nose up at and hurried out of the station. The guard locked the cell, and walked back up the corridor; each step was quieter and emptier to the salaryman.\n\nThe salaryman shrunk in his cell, and curled up against the icy stone walls of the prison alone. He wept, throwing off his blood-soaked tie and hurling it across the dirty stained jail-cell floor. Burying his head in his arms, his wails muffled by sniffles and cries, he slipped to hide from the rotting walls he was locked away in for what felt like an eternity."

A clerk, operating a station at the counter of the bank, looked up with two parts surprise and unease at the sight of the officer approaching him. Upon reaching the clerk's station, the officer wasted no time on formalities, stating "I would like to speak to the manager of this financial establishment."\n\n"Sir, if it's alright, anything you would say to the manager you can say to me. My job entails doing the tasks that the manager is otherwise too busy to perform on his own. If this is a matter of a loan, I could bring out the necessary papers."\n\n"This is a matter of utmost importance" the officer stated through gritted teeth. "I would like to discuss with the manager the matter of a loan to the Showa-Syonan Shipping and Receiving Corporation. The loan has already been requested, but we are experiencing delays pertaining to incompetence on your end, and the original amount of money requested was denied in favor of a smaller amount. This behavior is...unacceptable." The officer slowly leaned forward, putting his hands together on the counter. His gloves stretched, and his knuckles cracked.\n\n"If I may inquire, officer, what does the army have to do with-"\n\n"You may not. I would like to meet with your manager, immediately. I warn you, boy, you would not dare to show insubordination in front of a division of army soldiers, and so you shall not show insubordination in front of me." The scowl on the officer's face transformed into a look of hatred and insecurity.\n\nThe clerk stared back in fear, before clumsily opening the hatch to the counter so that the officer could enter.

He held his fedora as he skipped down the steps, ushering himself out of the view of the crowds of press. Yelling and commotion beat at him as cameras clicked and flashed; the rush of questions and accusations filled the thick air with embarrassment and flushes of confusion. Akiyama coughed up scattered replies and broken insults towards the tumbling masses of reporters, blinded by the flashes of more cameras, unable to get a word in amidst the allegations tossed in his face of rival politicians in the Diet.\n\nA microphone was hurled in his face, prompting him to answer for his 'crimes'. Akiyama cleared his throat, and explained his criticism of extra-judicial killings in Northwestern China by the military, even detailing his support for the same legal system in which the Emperor was the sovereign of. Before he could finish his statement, the reporters hissed back at him, scoffing with more extreme accusations of treason. Akiyama's face colored further in frustration, and he rushed through the crowd of reporters slandering his every step.\n\nImages of his face circulated in the press the next day, branding him as a traitor and an opportunist, followed by news of his resignation. His words to condemn military operations in China were shortened and trimmed to fit the articles, most branding him as a threat to the Empire.

He took a bow, and returned to his seat amongst his allies in the chamber. A chatter flooded the great hall as each of the Peers discussed amongst one another whilst civil servants arranged documents, wrote lists, and passed around files relating to the debatable topics at hand. Dozens of members about their seats: some debating amongst themselves over the session that had just ended, and about their personal lives following brief moments of snickering. Member Fujiwara was amongst one of these groups, as he swivelled behind him to discuss the lavish new cars he had bought with the money shared by party members the night before in an 'evening entertainment session'. Thinking he could not be heard, he continued to smirk with his colleagues over the fun they had and the riches they could now spend on. He sniffled after a great laugh, and heard the echo of the microphone throughout the chamber - immediately glancing to the centre of the room to see most of the standing peers gazing at him.\n\nFujiwara, glanced in different directions around the room with an embarrassing flush creeping over his face. He swallows a dry mouthful of air, and took a deep breath, before disconnecting the microphone under the judging eyes of dozens of his political rivals. The images of the newly washed cars, the young women, and the expensive wines burned through his head as he shrunk in his chair from the embarrassment; his suit clinging onto him from the sudden coating of sweat he was now lathered in. His eyes drifted towards the President of the House of Peers, whose eyes were round and hateful, and he exhaled slowly, placing his hand over his chin and remaining stiffly silent for the rest of the session."

Letting the walls support it from falling, he took his glasses from his shirt pocket and looked into the sea, where the sun was halfway across the horizon.\n\nThe electric lights, strung like a pearl necklace, began turning on, faint but evanescent against the incandescence. Waves lapped the gray sand of the coast, with pieces of wet flotsam strewn across its surface.\n\nWhen his eyes passed through the lenses, he saw the world. The blobs and blotches became sharp, defined. The miracles of modern science! He thought that there was nothing wrong with his eyes, up until his local doctor recommended him an optician. Wearing his first pair of spectacles was an experience, a discovery. He had never seen the world as clearly as he did, under the eaves of two concave lenses.\n\n"Father?" a voice said from the inside, "are you there?" The doorknob turned, and Takeshi stepped out, the last shreds of sunlight dying on the slopes of his chin. A plain-faced young man, whose work in the dirty marketplaces concealed a brilliant mind. A scholarship! In Tokyo! Hayashi was proud. This kid would go far. "There you are," Takeshi said, smiling, trying to hide the worrisome gleam in his eyes. "How was the catch?"\n\n"Rough." Hayashi said, downcast. "We'll have enough, however." The situation had become awkward.\n\n"W-well," Takeshi stammered, "Akane is in the hospital."\n\nHayashi's eyes widened. The seventeen-year-old Akane, at the cusp of her youth, had to lie in a hospital bed, afflicted with illness. Straightening his bike, Hayashi said to his son, "I won't be home for dinner tonight.""

The medic in his old platoon often carried the same weary and stoic expression whenever he had to convey bad news. Trailing behind the doctor, Hayashi glanced at the past the window at the high silhouette that blocked his view to the sea. The chemical factory, one of Minamata's proudest centers of employment, loomed, its waste-pipes directed coastward.\n\nEntering the doctor's room, they sat down across from one another. The doctor sat behind his desk, pulling a file out of a drawer. Monochrome photographs seemed to spill out of the manila-colored cover. "I am sure," the doctor said, "that you have seen Akane-chan's symptoms over the last few weeks." Stammered words, uneven gait, and strange convulsions. Fingers that curl into claws.\n\n"I have." As a father, Hayashi could only give answers that might help speed his daughter's recovery, and let the medicine-men go to work. "Do you know the cause?"\n\nAfter a brief pause, the doctor answered. "See these photographs here?" Fingers, weak muscles, twisted limbs. "I know you're not one to be peeved at this sort of thing, Hayashi-san." Hayashi nodded. The doctor was right. "All the victims have the same kind of diet: fish or shellfish. Don't take my word for it," he stroked his chin, "but I think the factory over there might be suspect. Heavy metal poisoning. Akane is one of the lighter cases, but it'll be better if she doesn't eat fish from the Minamata area."\n\n"Are you sure that it's the fault of that factory?"\n\n"Seventy to eighty percent, yeah."\n\nHayashi immediately knew what to do."

In the bright glare of the morning sunlight, near the factory's opening hours, as the winds were blowing out to the sea, he and the local veterans stood by its gate, preventing anyone from leaving and entering.\n\nWhen the police came to dissuade them, they brandished their rifles and machetes, rendered no less dull nor deadly by the years spent in unuse. When the police threatened to evict them forcibly from the premises, they fired a few warning shots. Finally, as a last resort, the police sent a friend of Hayashi's, a local bar owner, to meet with him. From a distance, he looked ridiculous, the skin and complexion of a man unused to exertions happening under the sunlight, much less in the early morning.\n\n"Hayashi-san," the bar owner said, "have you gone mad? Have you cracked? If you stand down now, they'll let you go. You're a veteran, Hayashi-san, and they respect that."\n\n"Not enough," Hayashi said, "apparently. Me and the boys here have only one condition: a meeting with any official. Scratch that, prefectural officials. I need someone who can do something regarding this," he pointed his chin at the factory, "this monstrosity. That's all.

Did you find what the man did righteous?"\n\n"N-no," Takeda said, stammering, "I just found him understandable, coming from a veteran's family." In a lower voice, he continued, "When I was little, my father would usually wake up screaming. Now he just sits on the veranda, under the eaves. His eyes - blank. He felt as if his country had left him behind."\n\nWhen they reached the Diet building, Ino got out of the car and addressed his chauffeur."

jap_newflavour.19.d:0 ""Have you handled the matter?" Ino said to the receiver. "I want to see that factory closed tomorrow. No operations would resume, no nothing. If I find out that the veteran is still there, the deal is off. I cannot protect you from the media backlash - that you would have to handle yourself."\n\n"I understand, Ino-sama." The voice over the phone said, belonging to a prominent tycoon who owned the Chisso Corporation. "I must say, this is most uncharacteristic of you. With so much power in your hands - the Tokko, the Kenpeitai - it would have been far easier to handle this matter... discreetly. Still, I would not complain. The Chisso Corporation would be more than happy to receive compensation over the government's requisition of its facilities in Minamata." The voice paused as if to touch on a poignant, prominent point. "Ino-sama, if I may ask, when will the transfer be?"\n\n"Today, tomorrow, next week, I don't know. It'll get there, I am sure, as soon as I can clear the waves. You know, the usual stuff. One cannot be too careful nowadays. Too many eyes watching from the shadows. The independents, the media. Everything is a right mess over here."\n\n"I admire your discretion, Ino-sama. Now, if you will excuse me, my timetable awaits. The business of conducting business." A sigh. "Farewell.""

jap_newflavour.20.d:0 "The Minamata prefectural office building was a squat edifice, having only three floors to manage all the administrative matters of the prefecture. Hayashi had an appointment there, with an official who had promised a meeting to deal with Akane's disease. It was evening, around seven o'clock, and the air had started to bite. The parking lot had emptied, leaving only a scant few cars whose paint-jobs gleamed under the electric lights.\n\nHayashi found himself smoking. It was a habit that he thought he had kicked a long time ago. The presence of nicotine had made him feel better, but its absence made him worse. He would spend money on packs and packs, on and on. It was the reason he was in Minamata. Nowhere else would take him. A cushy office job in Osaka would kill him faster than any lung cancer. Here, at least, he could forget about the War, and provide for his children. He was proud of them. They looked like their mother, and Hayashi's thoughts cut off, cauterized by the heat of the cigarette.\n\nA truck stopped by the prefectural building, and two men stepped out of its cabin. One more through the back. They wore working-clothes and tweed gloves, carrying metal pipes. Hayashi saw that they were walking towards him, in quick and wide strides. He unslung his machete, ready for a fight. He did not know who these people were and why they had wanted him, but he was not going down without a fight.\n\nWithin fifty meters of him, however, the three men charged across the pavement. What reflexes that had remained in Hayashi's old, tired body fell to the wayside as pipes crashed through his ribcage, breaking the bones. He fell unconscious, almost instantly. The three men dragged him to the truck and whisked him away."

jap_newflavour.21.d:0 "Takeshi sat down on his chair, bearing two letters. The first one was a letter of dismissal: the supermarket down the road had refused to employ him. His father's disappearance and the subsequent castigation by the papers had stranded him with a sick sister with no way to provide for himself. The wooden shack seemed lonely without his father's reassuring figure. He refused to believe that his father had decided to abandon them so suddenly and cast his lot with the socialists. It was too lurid; impossible.\n\nThe second one, however, emanated dread. Takeshi could feel fear in his heart whenever he glanced at the letter, stamped by a seal of Tokyo University. He opened it and started reading. Tears welled up in his eyes, his hands crumpling the sheet of paper before tossing it away. Takeshi felt anger rise from within him, a rising, roiling wave of hate that washed his thoughts all over. He picked up the books he had studied with and threw them against the walls, hearing the hollow thuds mix with his incoherent screaming.\n\nHaving no more strength to scream, his legs sagged to the ground. His knees trembled, and when the silence seemed to settle, he sobbed."

jap_newflavour.22.d:0 "After the allegations of corruption within the Ino government, student demonstrations had gathered around various locations in Tokyo, with the largest group outside of the National Diet building. They waved placards and wore masks to cover their mouths, whilst chanting slogans and chimes to mock Prime Minister Ino from the streets. Photographers danced around the boundaries of the groups of protesters; the momentary glare of a camera flash caught these moments in time. Umbrellas freckled throughout the swarm of protesters, lifted in a colorful display of greens, whites, and reds. The chants and chatter of the streets was booming, and the commotion was shaking. It seemed as if there was little order at all.\n\nThat was until a horn signaled from the west side of the street, and the attention of the tremendous crowd shifted to the left. A great line of horses stood by the west-side opening of the street, backed by ranks of what appeared to be the metropolitan police. They were fitted indeep navy blue armor satchels, with small shields and batons, and other riot control gear to face the protesters. There was a silence for a moment as the protesters turned to face the police, but as the horn wailed again and the horses charged into the thickness of the crowds, screams began to echo from the streets. The blunt force and violence between law authority and the protesters descended onto the streets, and the hundreds of unarmed students dissipated into the surrounding areas to avoid police bludgeoning and arrests. The violence and screams filled the district, only matched by the hiss of water hoses used to punish the protesters further, and the armor-clad police continued to march past the Diet building in a regimented hulking trudge."

jap_newflavour.23.d:0 "A restaurant sits at a street corner, the clashing of pots and the boiling of steam emanating from inside. A small woman, firmly gripping her purse, enters the restaurant and walks by the counter, staring at the cooks while doing so. She enters the kitchen, wherein one of the cooks collects a wadded-up bill from her hand, before ushering her down a ladder, hidden underneath some floorboards. She takes a seat in a circle of chairs, unfurling a book from her bag. A poorly manufactured, poorly kempt novel about 1920s America. Under the scratches and tears, the title reads "Th reat Gat by."\n\nThe book club meeting goes by as it normally does. She sits there, quiet, listening to the others discuss the themes and meanings of Tom Buchanan as a character, or the rosy-colored, moving room of page ten, and whatnot. The discussion of the first chapter flies by, all while she stares down at her copy of the book. Are those...eyes, she can make out on the cover?\n\nHer attention is caught when someone offhandedly mentions the green light in the bay. Well, the translation was unclear, but she was pretty sure the green light sat under the water of the bay. She raises her voice. "After thinking about it, I have a guess for what the green light might represent." Looking around, she readies her throat. "The green light is both Daisy, and the American Dream. Gatsby begins his life as a poor man, which is why he can't marry Daisy when he wants to. He works up to a position of wealth, only to find that he still can't marry Daisy. Wealth does not change his heritage, or his new money personality. Both Daisy, and the American Dream, lie underneath the water, out of his reach. It... it represents how the 'American Dream' isn't real, the idea that any man can be a 'parvenu' just isn't true. Money can't break culture and tradition, even in this 'American golden age.'"\n\nThe book club falls silent. Even though no one says so, they can't help but make connections of the American Dream to themselves. They sit here, reading shoddily-made novels in a dingy restaurant basement. The Emperor is the master of Asia, they have formed a Pan-Asian brotherhood of nations across the Pacific, and yet here they are. Where is the glory? The justice?"

jap_newflavour.24.d:0 "Through the grimy alleys of his dusky neighborhood, a little boy ventured towards a beacon which had awoken him, and the rest of his suburb, from slumber. Shining rays beat back the night sky, and noises roared through the gutters. Running across the long street, and using his nimble body to sneak through the community gate, he found himself in front of a great hedge wall, through which he peered to look upon the thunderous rapture beyond.\n\nIn that beyond was a mob of young men and women, dressed in wrinkled tuxedos and short skirts, jumping and dancing to the pulse of the party. The beat to which they danced originated from bands and musicians, scattered around, wielding their last exasperated breaths to push out ear-splitting hybrid melodies of jazz and traditional Japanese, which then pierced deep into the night air. The hedge walls themselves surrounded a manor, covered in bright lights and shiny decor. A pool of crystal water, seemingly surrounding the manor, was filled with party-goers, who were, as a rule, either in soaking-wet formal attire or entirely nude. Around the hedge walls of the manor, the boy viewed cars, overloaded with the drunken daughters and sons of local noblemen and veterans, streaming into the manor.\n\nLifting himself up onto a tree, the boy stared at one man, the host, frolicking through the party with typical charismatic arrogance. Lifting himself above the chaos of the mob, the host cued the celebrations. Neon blue fireworks rushed forward, exploding above the crowd and lighting up the abyss of the sky. The mob roared in a fit of near-ethereal hedonistic glory. A storm of confetti flew throughout the night wind, coating the just-cooked buffets and the just-filled champagne glasses of the party-goers. The boy would've been in envy if he had not already collapsed from hunger pains."

They breathe tired, exasperated breaths out of their near-skeletal torsos. This is their last moment of lucidity, but only one of them recognizes it as such. The searing inferno of the plane crash cannot escape their memory, even in this twilight of the mind.\n\nThe younger chokes up his last words "Was it worth it, sir? Did it matter?" He shakes, and he would cry, if he could. "Will the Emperor ever look upon us...and think, what devoted servants of the Empire. Will... will the officers back home even think that?" His fists unclench. "Two idiots die to a storm, that's what they'll say, we've heard it of others."\n\n"We don't matter do we sir?"\n\n"We never did. Sacrifice is unsung. We're supposed to love him even if we never get that love back, that's what we're doing."\n\nHe looks over towards the older man. "But it isn't sacrifice, sir...no, it isn't. We never did him anything worth it. If...if we had children, they couldn't even love us. Did you have children?" The younger's eyes roll down. "Ueda, please. Ueda I don't know what to do. I'm... I'm never going to see them again. I'm not going to see them again." The younger lets out a cold, shaky breath. "Ueda... will-"\n\n"No." The older gave a light, weak cough, before leaning his head towards the horizon. The younger followed. A large, black formation sat in the sea, past their sight. The younger, in his last moments, thought it to be some kind of monolithic black marble pantheon, a last product of his innocent, naive imagination. The older did not think."

Beaten and held captive, the authorities detained him for hours against his own will. With his hands tied behind his back, he shrieked in fear as he was pressed against the metal deck of the vessel.\n\nThe sailors questioned the fisherman, who responded in a broken combination of Kanak language and English between his whimpering cries. He was not a Japanese spy, the sailors discovered, and, ashamed, they released back into northern waters.\n\nHe was not the first, nor will he be the last victim of the bitter maritime rivalry between the powers of the Pacific. He, like many other innocent inhabitants of the Pacific islands, will suffer at the hands of international disputes they have no connection to."

A Japanese-American, he was beaten and held in IJN barracks overnight with bruises across his body and searing pains down his back. Half a dozen troops interrogated him in the cell, holding his face to bright, buzzing lights and crunching his fingers to tear out answers from his weak and trembling lips.\n\nAccusing him of disloyalty and collaborating with the Americans, Mr. Toru's tired body was confused; he was born in California and considered himself an American, how did he owe loyalty to an Emperor from across the Pacific? His attempts to explain himself were rejected and were met only with humiliation and punishment.\n\nSuddenly, troops flew into the brick cell and dragged Mr. Toru by the arms, dashing him into the streets in the cover of night. He was spread out by the roadside, broken and unresponsive outside of the occasional wail of pain; the midnight silence colored him with lonely and painful scars."
