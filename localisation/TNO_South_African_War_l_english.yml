 SAFWAR.2.d:0 "We are on our very last reserves of strength, near to the final loss of our liberty, and so close to the temptation of declaring our intentions to give up the fight. But this cannot be, not even as we have lost so much of our land and our manpower.\n\nWe cannot and will not allow our Dominion to fall so easily in a moment like this. Though the great shadow of the Reich is coming over us and the brutality of their soldiers is discouraging our people from keeping up the fight, we can not afford to just throw down our arms in and act of cowardice and accept our fate as perpetual slaves c.\n\nEven if this means the end of everything we have fought to keep, and the snuffing out of our lives, we will not surrender now! And never shall we cease in our efforts to keep our Nation alive, cornered as we may be, and stripped of our protections! Though our forces seem to waver, and though our enemies seem to prevail, South Africa shall not bow down to Hertzog and his German puppet masters as long as there is an honest man still standing!\n\nThe Dominion shall die for what it stands for! And the Dominion shall be remembered by the free world for what it has done"

 SAFWAR.4.d:0 "With each breath came more thick black smoke and more hallucinatory fractals,. Was he simply destined to suffocate in the smoldering ruins of his own bunk? The last bit of Dietrich's waking mind trembled with fury.\n\nHowever, just as his eyes began to close, he felt a sharp tug near his pant leg. Suddenly, consciousness had returned, and Dietrich found himself outside, gazing upon the stars. A fit of coughing began."Who?" he croaked, turning to face his saviour. An unknown figure, one he now felt immense love for. "Can you stand? We don't have much time."\n\nDietrich slung his arm over a shoulder, and limped with the strange man off into the woods. They traveled for what felt like hours, until the SS Captain found himself face to face with his savior; a subordinate in tattered rags. He fought the burning sensation in his throat, took note of the insignia on the man's uniform, and mustered speech.\n\n"You have done well Oberschütze... I will ensure you are recognized for your actions."The man simply laughed, and continued walking, greatly offending Dietrich. You consider duty to the Fatherland a laughing matter? Perhaps I was mistaken. The man stopped moving, and Dietrich observed a wild quality that had appeared within his eyes. "You stupid bastard, look around you! You speak of rank and duty, as if such words still hold meaning. The fatherland has torn itself apart, and enemy patrols are likely to descend upon us at any moment! We are just men now, two fugitives in a jungle. I pulled you from a burning building, for god's sake!"\n\nDietrich fell silent , unsure how to respond to such a brazen display of insolence. A tense energy lingered in the air, broken by what sounded like english in the trees behind them.\n\n"You mean to desert... you swine! You would rather live in cowardice then fight for the fatherland in its time of need. You are no different then our subhuman enemy!."\n\nThe english voices drew closer now, accompanied by flashlights. The man jumped into a sprint, intent on completing his treason. Dietrich mustered the strength to correct his limp, and pounced upon the traitor. They wrestled in the dirt, trading punches.\n\n"Let go of me you suicidal fanatic!" The man spat the words into Dietrich's face just moments before his brains were splattered by gunshot. Dietrich threw the corpse off of him, drew the pistol from his belt, and faced the degenerates that were now firing in his direction. He would see his duty to its end"
 SAFWAR.4.a:0 "다른 무엇보다도 조국을"
 SAFWAR.3.t:0 "와일드기스의 스완송"
 SAFWAR.3.d:0 "The building shook from what must have been an artillery shell or maybe even a near-hit from a bomb, but Lucas DeFlandre looked remarkably disinterested for a man who was certainly about to meet his death. He, along with about two dozen of the remaining members of his mercenary company "Les Oies Sauvages" had fallen back to the innermost conference room of the mansion that was now serving as the headquarters of the Zentralafrikan defense effort. DeFlandre watched, disinterested through his remaining eye as two of the remaining guns for hire erected a makeshift waist-high barricade at the door using the conference table and assorted furniture. It wouldn't do much in the long run he thought to himself, and besides, he was too tired from fighting a days long running battle with OFN forces to care much anymore.\n\nThe squad that had stayed behind to cover the mansion's foyer had stopped radioing in some time ago amidst the sounds of heavy gunfire and screams of pain. The handful that had been sent to secure an exit never even responded, and most likely had fled. Good for them, DeFlandre muttered to himself as he picked up his weapon and began to reload and clean it, no reason we all have to die here. Truthfully, he wasn't entirely sure why he hadn't bolted at the first sign of what was coming, but he suspected that deep down it had something to do with that damned pride of his that had carried him through conflicts across the globe with only the utmost professionalism. He had never run on the job, and it seemed like he wasn't about to break that streak. The heavy explosions began again and he smiled humorlessly at the thought of another American platoon walking headlong into the mines they had so carefully prepared. Gunfire could be heard dimly from beyond the room, signalling to the veteran that at least some of the men of the Zentralafrikan army had also chosen to fight. Little by little though, the gunfire slackened as each pocket was rooted out and destroyed. He heard the sound of running feet down the hallway that led to the room, then a scream as the last anti-personnel mine they had deployed took out a few more damned Yanks. Time was up, and their enemy would be at their gate in just a moment. He stood up, and as his men turned to watch their leader he flashed a smile, Well, just another job, no?"
 SAFWAR.3.a:0 "이제 살아남으려면 죽여야지"
 SAFWAR.5.t:0 "남서아프리카인의 마지막 저항"
 SAFWAR.5.d:0 "As the Americans and South Africans crawled Northwards, they were surprised at both the intensity and variation of the resistance they faced. They had known that there would be traps, ambushes, and heroic last-stands a-plenty from the handful of dedicated SS units assigned to the region, but they didn't expect that the German-settler population would so vigorously join in the final battle, or that they would be supported by so many of the native askaris.\n\nBut in retrospect, it shouldn't have been surprising. For the Settlers, there was nowhere left to run, and no one left to negotiate. Reichskommissar had all but vanished into his beloved air as the war turned against them, his battle against his inner demons lost with the broader way. His inner circle had disappeared as well, or fled back to the Reich. There was no such luxury available to either the average German or their native allies. Zentalafrika was chaos, Ostafrika was death, and the passage home too expensive for commoners. To surrender meant likely capture by the African partisans, who did not look fondly on either the Nazi or their collaborators.\n\nSo they fought. Not for their vacant leader, or for the fatherland that had abandoned them, or the ideals of National Socialism that had been so poorly applied. They fought for survival, because it was the only thing left to do.\n\nIn the plains of the south, the Americans found only brush and bombs. In the forests of Angola, there were Germans in every shadow. In the villages and towns soldiers spoke grimly of battles won for the living room, but ongoing for the kitchen. They would not give in. If not for victory, they fought to avoid defeat, and to live just one more day."

Our worst nightmare has been made real as frontline commanders report to the Cape that the "Afrika-Schild", has mobilized a massive invasion of South Africa!\n\nWith the full breadth of the National Party's treachery revealed, a domestic revolt now becomes a struggle for the very destiny of the continent. The future is uncertain, but with the combined resources of German Africa, it seems highly likely our nation may fall without foreign support!"

 SAFWAR.7.d:0 "We've said our prayers as we held the line and the Reich crept closer to Cape Town, and at last they've been answered.\n\nBy an overwhelming majority, the United States Congress has approved a resolution allowing President Richard Nixon to "take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression from disruptive forces in southern Africa." Elements from their armed forces are steaming fast onto our shores as we speak, ready to relieve our lines and push back against the rebels, and their puppet masters to the north. In the meantime, surplus and factory-fresh equipment arrive at our docks in record numbers. Thousands have since crowded the harbor to greet their saviors and new allies with welcoming arms.\n\nWith the might of the Free World at our beck and call, the Union may yet live to see not only the Boers crushed, but fascism's taint purged from our continent once and for all."

 SAFWAR.8.d:0 "The solemn thoughts of the war and its toll trailed behind the troops who had been stationed on base, preparing for the arrival of the new divisions being shipped in. Everywhere you looked, men were clearing the way out of vehicle depots, worn out armored personnel carriers and tanks treaded down the makeshift roads setup within the base, and officers berated their subordinates for not pushing cargo out of the way fast enough for the incoming soldiers meant to help reinforce and strengthen the border against the South Africans. All the while, the Reichskommissar looked onwards, bearing the heat of the ever-burning African sun, as nary a zephyr gifted from Valhalla served the Germans that day. Blessings were, after all, slim to begin with in this war.\n\nJust earlier this week, the surrounding compound had been awoken from the emergency broadcast transmissions from the Großgermanisches Reich itself. Through the static of the transmissions, they managed to get several key notifications, including "United States...entering... South Afrika... Reich... reinforcements... victory... not lost!" The base had entered a feverish excitement in knowing that their savior, the Fatherland, had provided so plentifully past the horrors that the African continent managed to generate seemingly every day. The lack of an undrenched uniform, the constant wear and tear upon both their equipment and their blood, finally, the men would be able to enjoy a new bolstering of men to fight shoulder-to-shoulder in the endless savannahs of this accursed continent. Admittedly, there was continued talk about what could happen out there on the front lines with the Americans lining up to fight as well, but none could surpass the Großgermanisches Reich! As the day had finally arrived, and the distant sounds of trucks and other German machines of war poured into the base's surrounding air, the men had finally finished their preparations for all the reinforcements that were due to arrive"
 SAFWAR.8.a:0 "지크 하일!"
 SAFWAR.9.t:0 "전쟁에서 승리하다!"
 SAFWAR.9.d:0 "The march southwards was one embraced with blood. Battle after battle, the screams and begging of wounded men to be killed grew tiresome for Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig, finally being squashed out of their miserable existence as the tank treads inched forwards. The Schutzstaffel regiments of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika had proved successful warriors upon the African front, and this final siege proved no different from every other butchery.\n\nThe final battle erupted as the Ostafrikan commitment to the war had begun: under the strict orders of Hüttig. The odor of smoke and burnt flesh coupled with the screaming continued for hours, until, from the safety of the Forward Operating Base, the Reichskommissar could bear no more of this wait. He ordered the immediate advance of his regiments across the African plain, until it would assault the Cape, last bastion of defence. Thus, they marched onwards, burning the land, under the strict orders to not leave a denizen alive.\n\nAnd thus, under the burning stars of the African night, Hüttig awaited the news of the battle. Echoes of gunfire erupted, followed by the eventual rising flames of the city as he heard tank shells crumpling the scum-ridden buildings that had made up the city. Finally, hours later, a lone soldier burst into Hüttig's room, causing a thunderous slam as the door hit the wall. The soldier shouted, "Sir, Reichskommissar Hüttig, sir, news from the-" "Rottenführer." Hüttig interrupted. "You allowed a draft in, the African night is cold, you know." He said, immediately shooting up from his seat and walking to the soldier, with a bottle in hand. "Sir, my dearest apologies, sir. I was sent to inform you of the victory over South Africa, the combatants have been flushed out. Our regiments, alongside those of Reichskommissars Schenck and Müller have claimed victory tonight, sir." the soldier finished. "Victory...did you say that of Reichskommissars Schenck and Müller?" "Yes, si-" the soldier's statement was cut off as Hüttig smashed his bottle over his head, ordering him out the room.\n\nThe end to the war was Hüttig's victory, and Hüttig's victory alone, in his mind."

 SAFWAR.10.d:0 " Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller had made a sudden, disheartening realization: despite all preparations and planning for this very night, he had only been on his first drink of the night, unfortunately. However, the bounty laden within his plentiful schedule would be surely harvested later, Müller realized, as his battalion had reached the rallying point drawn out on the war map. As the bombardment that had torn apart the city finally ceased, Müller hopped upon a massive boulder, and shouted to his battalion, "Gentlemen of Zentralafrika, the Reich has tasked us for a mission, and now, we get to employ it as dutifully and properly as possible. Henceforth, you shall carry out these orders: go into that city with whatever other Germans you find in that field, shoot those American bastards, and let's have ourselves a night on the town!" Müller's mercenary company roared with compliance, rushing forth into the African night towards a burning city.\n\nAfter several hours of bored waiting, a lone soldier appeared before Müller, yelling, "Sir, Reichskommissar, si-" Müller spit out his drink, startled by the soldier's sudden salute. "Apologies sir, I was sent to inform you that the city is captured for the glory of the Reich, by the accomplishments of the men of yourself and Reichskommissars Schenck and Hüttig." Müller looked upset at the soldier, saying, "Yeah, whatever, go fuck off to some other plain." as he began walking off, preparing himself for his planned schedule.\n\nInside the city, Müller's party raged as intensely as the fires that consumed the livelihoods of thousands. Taking refuge in one of the blown apart taverns of the city, Müller and his men pranced about, chasing after the free bottles of booze and the highly exotic African narcotics. The men took a moment of calm amidst the storm, as all that filled the air were the embers of burning foundations, flesh, and bone, the smoke of the cigars, even if just for a moment.\n\nSuddenly, a laugh. Then, another soldier laughed, followed by another, until the entire bar was laughing. Then, at that moment, was when the tavern truly roared to life with laughter, booze, and drugs."

 SAFWAR.11.t:0 "전쟁에서 승리하다!"
 SAFWAR.11.d:0 "Several miles into the African savannah, rows of German military aircraft were prepped and ready for the immediate launch upon the approval of Reichskommissar Schenck himself, who had been hidden away inside of a forward operating base. Finally, as the African night sent a chilling shiver down the Reichskommissar's spine, his radio erupted that the bombardment from Ostafrikan forces had begun, while Zentralafrikan infantry had begun their assault. With every fiber of his being urging him not to grab the microphone, Schenck clutched the piece of equipment, saying, "You may begin the aerial operation in T-10... 9... 8..." until finally, German aircraft rocketed off into the beautifully icy African night sky.\n\nThe horrors of the following few hours poured in through the radio within the Reichskommissar's temporary living space. Constantly, he heard the words "Approaching target," "bombing strafe successful," and "reapproaching city." echo through the broadcast, as he silenced his microphone to continue his weeping. The despair had eaten him alive, imagining the terror and chaos reigning down upon the innocent, leaving nothing but death, or a living Hell for those unfortunate souls who survived. Despair had turned to tears, and tears had turned into sobs, as Schenck clasped his face by his rough, calloused hands. The questions of "How could I do this?" and "Why can't I stop this?" escaped his mind hours ago, with only the uncontrollable emotions of loss, despair, and self-hatred clawing at the man's mind. Finally, as tears trickled down his face, a young soldier burst into the room, shouting, "Sir, Reichskommissar, sir! The city has been captured for the glory of the Reich, by the accomplishments of your men, as well as Reichskommissars Hüttig and Müller!" The soldier's announcement was met with silence, however. "Bring me a truck." Schecnk said, coldly.\n\nHours later, Schenck arrived at the city's entrance. Firsthand, he had chosen to bear witness to his crimes, and he had understood the true destruction wrought by his evil compliance in this horrid invasion. Here, African and American men, women, and children lay dead and dying in the streets, with blood mixing with the rubble and soot. Finally, Schenck finished his journey through the South African streets as he knelt down, grasping the burnt arm of a child amidst the rubble, with mercenary's laughs and the gunshots of executions flooding in behind him, and tears rolling down his face."

 SAFWAR.13.d:0 "It truly was a mark of the modern precedent of warfare to bear witness to battle which stressed fiercely into the night. Just hours ago, the march of the infantryman was coupled with the gasps and sputters of tanks treading through the African bush, trudging through as the mud and grass as well as any pair of legs or treads could do. Finally, as the men approached the compound, the sickening relief had dawn upon them: this was it. The war would be over after tonight. And nary a soul had the strength to care about how many would have to die in order to destroy the Reichskommissariats, for once and for all. Hours into the artillery strikes, however, the true face of butchery would alight as soldiers rushed beyond the setting sun to meet the strength of the African and the American.\n\nThe gunfire lasted for hours, with some men beginning to bleed strictly from their destroyed ear drums. Rifles, machine guns, anti-tank rifles, anti-aircraft emplacements, artillery barrages, tank shells, even flamethrower units had been used to destroy as much as possible and fight to the bitter end. Trenches hardly did a man good as dirt and gore and limbs were catapulted into the sky from nearby explosions, while men shouted trying to gain advantage over the enemy. All manner of soldiers descended upon the final battle, as Americans and Africans, both white and black, met Wehrmacht, Schutzstaffel, and Mercenaries in this final stand, some only leaving bones behind in the aftermath of the gunfire and decimation. However, eventually, the Germans broke, after the frigid African night descended upon them, and it was only then that the compound remained vulnerable.\n\nHowever, as light descends upon a world of sin, so too does the rising sun bathe the men of war. No longer was the African continent plagued with a German plague. Finally, victory had been achieved, with no Reichskommissar to say otherwise, with everyone drearily enchanted with thoughts of the future."

 SAFWAR.14.t:0 "OFN이 정전을 제안하다"
 SAFWAR.14.d:0 "The Führer today has received a missive via the Swiss Embassy on behalf of the Organization of Free Nations, the communication is rather lacking in diplomatic niceties but given the state of affairs between the Reich and OFN this is unsurprising. Specifically, despite the negative turn of recent events in the South African War, the OFN feels that a continuation of hostilities is unlikely to produce notable results. They offer an armistice, keeping Südwestafrika, lower Mozambique and Southern Rhodesia but nothing more. And otherwise engaging in a total cessation of hostilities.\n\nDespite our public confidence in the direction the war is taking, the reality is that we are unlikely to be capable of retaking the occupied colonies, let alone advancing substantially into South African territories. Voices amongst our militarist echelons advise that should we continue fighting for much longer it is entirely possible that our forces collapse in their entirety, which would not technically be a loss for the Reich so much as it would be a complete and utterly catastrophe for our international prestige.\n\nShould we accept this offer though it would be a recognition of defeat for the Reich, something that comes with its own issues. Still, it may be preferable to lose the hand rather than the entire body. The choice however, as always, is up to the Führer."

 SAFWAR.15.d:0 "The Swiss have contacted the Reich on behalf of the Organization of Free Nations, after all the war, bloodshed and fighting it would appear that our foes are growing tired. With the newspapers constantly printing reports of massacres, deaths on the front and the native Africans turning on all sides it would appear their public is growing discontented.\n\nThe offer is a simple one, a total return to the pre-war status quo and the utter cessation of all hostilities. At first glance it would seem to be a loss for the Reich, but despite the concerted efforts of our forces in Africa we have been unable to substantially penetrate OFN lines, a swift exit to save face could be useful if we should desire to refocus our efforts upon targets closer to home.\n\nThere may be those who see this as cowardly, but we can point to the fact that whilst we have not gained anything of substance from this South African War neither have we lost anything worth mentioning, some inbred Afrikaners and a few Native SS detachments who likely would not be useful beyond the wars conclusion anyhow. Additionally, this war has reminded the world that for all the Americans claim to be the king, the Reich can strike with equal ferocity.\n\nIt is not up to the Führer to decide whether we shall accept this proffered ceasefire, or continue the fight in the hopes of a true victory?"

The Organization of Free Nations evidently agree that their side is not likely to be the winner of this war as they have, through Swiss intermediaries, contacted us with an offer of ceasefire.\n\nThe proffered terms seem favorable, recognition of the Boer Republic and a change in the borders for South Africa itself. However, it must be noted that the offer does not extend to the South African remnant state being placed under our influence, and a continued OFN presence in the Cape could prove dangerous to our influence in the long term. The more militant amongst our ranks would have the war continue until the entire nation of South Africa is under occupation but we must concede that such an operation would be expensive and quite possibly beyond our current capabilities in terms of occupying troops.\n\nTherefore it falls to the Führer to decide whether we shall accept this rather generous offer, or go all in to secure a victory for the Reich that will be remembered for decades to come."

The Germans, recognizing that further conflict would gain them nought, negotiated a ceasefire and at last, after so long fighting and dying, the young men of Africa return to their homes.

Whilst many are hopeful this was a rogue one off attack, military intelligence and the CIA have advised the President that further deployments of chemical weapons are both likely and imminent.\n\nIn response, two proposals have been developed. Rather than triggering our massive retaliation doctrines, we could instead deploy chemical protection gear for our soldiers and press on. Whilst expensive, it would hopefully halt any further escalations of the war.

The Reichskommissar, fearful that SS agents were likely en-route to finish their task of high profile slaughter, wasted no time in returning to Leopoldville from his hunt.

Claiming to represent a small clique of officers and bureaucrats who still serve the true German government even while trapped within Hüttig's hellish realm, Kai Uwe von Hassel - self-appointed leader of the "Anti-Hüttig Cabal" - asks for funds and reinforcements to prepare the ground for a counter-coup, promising to re-establish German rule in the African colonies after the madman has been deposed.\n\nOur advisors are extremely skeptical about their chances of success, but they still urge us to support them. Everyone knows that Hüttig's dream of a racially-pure Africa will end up into a nightmare of unimaginable proportions, and - according to them - when this happens, the Cabal could strike swiftly, securing at least some land to allow our return to the Dark Continent.\n\nDespite the low chances of success, this is still an endeavor worth trying. There are no risks, as someday the Reichsstaat will surely collapse - with or without our intervention - and when this happens, having a loyal administration in charge of even a small part of Africa will be enough justification to re-establish a permanent, and most lucrative, presence in these resource-rich lands."
