DOM_Dios_Trujillo: "Dios y Trujillo"
DOM_Dios_Trujillo_desc: "The Popularity of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina cannot be understated. To those old enough to remember the poverty and chaos of the 1920s, he is the savior of the nation. To those who are younger, he is the protector of the Dominicans from American imperialism. While there are plenty who see him as nothing more than a brute, the motto of 'Dios y Trujillo' is plastered across the nation, often below his portrait. To many Dominicans, God and Trujillo are one and the same."
DOM_Blanqueamiento: "Blanqueamiento"
DOM_Blanqueamiento_desc: "Blanqueamiento or 'Whitening' is an immigration initiative to encourage settlers from Iberia to move to the Dominican Republic. The goal of this initiative is to eventually 'purify' the 'Hispanic-Dominican race' by replacing the Afro-Caribbean and Mixed race Dominicans with Iberian whites. While incredibly popular with those who do choose to move to Hispanola, not many are currently allured by the promise of land on some humid Caribbean island."
DOM_Rising_Resistance: "Rising Resistance"
DOM_Rising_Resistance_desc: "To outsiders, it appears as if all of the Dominican Republic loves Trujillo, but there are those who would risk it all to see him deposed. However, these forces are weak and scattered after a nationwide crackdown in 1959 saw most resistance leaders thrown into prison. While rebel cells exist, they desperately need help in order to achieve their goals."
