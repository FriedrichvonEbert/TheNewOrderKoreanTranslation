#China

gaw.200.t:0 "The End of the Great Asian War"
gaw.200.d:0 "The war ended where it began. Deep inside a Manchurian forest, a shot rang out. A Japanese man lay dead. And then all was silent.\n\nA few young lives were lost, of course, to the bullet. So many more were lost to the consequences of the bullet. The looting, the rape, the disease. It was as if a great monsoon had swept over the whole of Asia, and then left as soon as it appeared. The roads were in disrepair, the cities in ruin. Families could do nothing but lick their wounds and mourn the dead. The government could do little more. The war was over, at least.\n\nThe scars would remain. The Chinese marched through the streets of the north. They hid the blood. They were victorious, after all! What was there to hide?\n\nThe Japanese could not even afford this luxury. The cities had been bombed to rubble. The empire they once held was dead. In Tokyo, words of revolution rumble, but they are hollow. There is nothing to revolt against. Japan, or the Japan the world knew, is dead."
gaw.200.a:0 "The Rising Sun has finally set."

gaw.201.t:0 "The Spoils of War"
gaw.201.d:0 "Most were reluctant to leave. They were Japanese immigrants to the region, but they may as well have been natives. About half had been born there to Japanese parents. The other half moved in during the emigration pushes after the Second World War. Beauracracies shifted, but they were still as slow as ever. It all culminated in the raising of a new flag. The Chinese occupation had begun. Surprisingly, the populace was quiet. In the end, the Japanese were not popular. They only catered to the rich businessmen and those who could keep feeding the government cash.  "
gaw.201.a:0 "China is free."
gaw.201.a.tt:0 "§YJapan and her non-Chinese allies will sign a treaty of peace and return all Chinese territories held by them.§!"

gaw.202.t:0 "The war goes on"
gaw.202.d:0 "Bing"
gaw.202.a:0 "They will give up, sooner or later."

gaw.203.t:0 "The Fate of the Warlords"
gaw.203.d:0 "After we have decisively defeated our former slaveholders, it is time to bring order back to our own territories as well. Those who have sided with us we shall reward reasonably, but there are still warlords left who sided against us or who did not participate in our Great struggle of Liberation. Now that we have pushed the Japanese off the mainland, we shall demand that these warlords submit to our authority, or face the force of our arms."
gaw.203.a:0 "Time to bring this to an end."
gaw.203.a.tt:0 "§YWe will send an ultimatum to all warlords who did not side with us during the GAW, demanding their surrender.§!"

gaw.204.t:0 "The Response of the Warlords"

gaw.206.b:0 "To hell with the Japanese!"

gaw.300.t:0 "The Fall of Manchukuo"
gaw.300.d:0 "News have reached us today that the authority of the Manchurian Government has finally collapsed. Following the capture of several key cities by NLF forces, the government of Manchukuo has been evacuated to Japan, with the remnants of the Kwantung Army left as the last authority of the Rising Sun in the area.\n\n While the Japanese Government under Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] remains adamant that the fall of the Empire's Industrial Heart is but a minor setback in the "Righteous Campaign against the Chinese rebels", masses of Chinese citizens were seen cheering and celebrating all across China and beyond.\n\nMany observers both within and without the former Co-Prosperity Sphere predict a swift end to the Great Asian War following this decisive development, with China coming out as the clear winner of the bloodiest conflict in Asian history."
gaw.300.a:0 "Victory is within our grasp!"
gaw.300.b:0 "The War is not yet lost!"
gaw.300.c:0 "The End draws near."

gaw.302.b:0 "Nothing but a minor setback."
gaw.302.c:0 "Order is returned to the Steppe."

gaw.303.t:0 "The Parade"
gaw.303.d:0 "A great parade had marched into Shanghai, and they brought rejoice with them. As the soldiers waltzed in, they were met with young women dashing out their doors to flirt with the handsome privates and officers. Aging veterans from the old war walked out to greet the army men in their old Communist and Kuomintang uniforms. Once the Chinese had gotten close enough, the Japanese just left. By boat and foot, they fled because they couldn't win the battle. Not with popular support, already dismal, quckly turning violent. Not with well-trained troops willing to die for Zhongguo rushing in. And so the Chinese were not met with bombs and guns, but with the happiness of a population long oppressed now freed.\n\nBut all was not well in the jewel of the Yellow Sea. From the top of the skyscrapers they once owned, businessmen plummeted with abandon. To onlookers below, it looked as if it was raining the corpses of their former overlords."
gaw.303.a:0 "It was not known if it was suicide or murder."

gaw.304.t:0 "Shanghai is Closed"
gaw.304.d:0 "The rain picked up, and for the first time in a thousand nights, the clubs of Shanghai went silent. A tense atmosphere rose over the city, and the specter of war seemed to grip it. Thousands simply packed up their bags and left. By the end of the day, all that could be heard was the pounding of the rain, like artillery on a trench, the sound of bullets hitting dirt. Cafes in the French Concession closed and the Zaibatsus shut their doors. Gangsters formed truces and treaties, and beggars castrated themselves to the returning occupiers.\n\nNobody was safe. In every quarter of the city, doors came slamming down and soldiers rushed in, eager for a cut. Women were raped with abandon, and any protesting were shot. As the grand looting commenced, word quickly got around the endless slums, through messengers no more than teenagers."
gaw.304.a:0 "The Japanese Army was back in town."

gaw.305.t:0 "An Unstoppable Horde"
gaw.305.desc:0 ""
gaw.305.a:0 "China is lost, but not our nuclear stockpile."

gaw.306.t:0 "Sunset"
gas.306.desc:0 "This would be a nuclear ultimatum if not for the fact that the nuke system has yet to be implemented. Stay tuned until next time when Long Yun may actually cause a nuclear apocalypse!"
gaw.306.a:0 "China is finally Free."
gaw.306.b:0 "Asia shall be Free!"

GAW_CHI_peace_total_victory_desc:0 "Japan depends greatly on her Empire. If we can recapture all of our rightful territory and starve the Japanese of their industrial capital in Manchuria and their resources in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, our former overlords may find peace to be a more preferable outcome than to face a total collapse - a peace on our terms, of course.\n\n§YWe will be able to offer our terms of surrender every 30 days, should Japan choose to desperately fight on."
GAW_CHI_peace_total_victory_tt:0 "Japan will receive a peace offer which will leave us with all Chinese territories on the mainland."
