 IBR.4101.t:0 "알제리에서 떠오르는 기회"
 IBR.4101.d:0 "유럽 대륙의 최신 사건들에 대한 소식이 들어왔습니다. 부르군트 탱크가 프랑스로 밀고 들어왔고, 최단기간에 전쟁이 끝났습니다. 그들의 나치 지배자들에게 거세당한 프랑스는 알제리 땅에 대한 그들의 모든 정통성을 잃어버렸습니다. 우리는 프랑스가 우리의 침공을 막기보다는 더 긴급한 사안에 집중할 것이라는 사실을 잘 알고 있습니다.\n\n이는 절호의 기회입니다. 이 기회는 자주 찾아오지 않으며 이 기회를 걷어차는 것은 무모한 짓입니다. 우리는 누군가 우리 계획을 알아차기 전에 움직여야 합니다. 알제리에서 우리를 막을 세력은 아무도 없을 것입니다."
 IBR.4101.a:0 "우리는 알제리에 개입해 필요한 행동을 취해야 한다"
 
 IBR.4102.t:0 "하르딤에의 편지" #from debrief jardim
 IBR.4102.d:0 "Opportunity rarely has the courtesy to knock at an opportune time. For Jorge Jardim, opportunity interrupted a perfectly good breakfast. Were he a sensible man, he wouldn't have abandoned his poached egg and toasted bread for the letter apparently rushed to him from Madrid, but unfortunately for him he was a politician and such sense was not allowed in this profession.\n\nBright eyes quickly scanned the letter, absorbing both the written word and the unwritten intent behind them all at once. He stood from the table as he reached the end, his mind already turning over the newfound information. According to the letter, the Shadow State was storming into the French rump state and to no one's surprise, the French were receiving the worst of the fighting. The French had been more or less a non-factor for over a decade, unable to maintain control of much of the country outside of Algiers itself. That's why they were here in Oran after all, and the Italians on the other side of the garrison.\n\nBut the letter was much more vague with its actual orders, a necessary tactic to maintain plausible deniability should it somehow fall outside of Iberian hands and cause a scandal. That didn't matter though, they wouldn't have sent him this letter without knowing what he'd do once he got to reading it, and already, he was deep in thought.\n\nA spin, Iberia needed a spin to justify the acquisition of Algeria. While, yes, militarily occupied by both themselves and Italians, it was still legally French, and they weren't in a position to simply take the rest of the country by storm. After all, if they did that, they'd be fighting Italians, not the scarecrow army of the French State. So what excuse could they conjure up that would prevent the Italians from intervening?\n\nHe sat there deep in thought for some time, running through the scenarios in his head. It was clear that whatever scheme was cooked up, they'd have to work with the Italians directly to achieve it. So be it they would play this one by ear.\n\nHe took a bite of his eggs, grimacing as he chewed. Opportunity had made his eggs go cold..."
 IBR.4102.a:0 "음모가 시작되었을 뿐이다."
 
 IBR.4103.t:0 "알제리에 대한 계획"
 IBR.4103.d:0 "현대에 들어서, 군사적 영광은 점점 성취하기 어려운 것이 되었으나, 전 세계 군대의 규모는 끊임없이 커지고 있습니다. 핵폭탄의 출현과 그로 인한 국제적 교착 상태는 군사적 정복으로 역사에 이름을 남기려는 자들의 앞을 막고 있습니다.\n\n무력은 실패하고 있는 반면, 언변과 외교술을 가진 자들은 승승장구하고 있습니다. But in these modern times, it seems like every rock, every blade of grass and every grain of sand is owned by somebody, somewhere, and no one was interested in selling. The world was as small as it was ever going to be, and no one saw value in losing their corner of it.\n\nThat's why when the Caudillos called the greatest military and diplomatic minds of Iberia together to discuss plans for the French Colony of Algeria, they came not with vague ideas and concepts, but with papers, with maps, with briefcases and books worth of schemes. This was an opportunity that they all knew they'd never again see in their lifetimes, a chance to be known as the conqueror- through guns or through words- of Algeria.\n\nGenerals came with grand campaigns and elaborate war plans, some even going as far as to invade Tunis and Libya should the Italians stand in their way. Diplomats cracked open briefcases to reveal grand schemes and plans to buy or swindle the Italian half of Algeria out from beneath their feet. When the Caudillos made the call for all spheres of Iberia to form a plan together, they instead got a rapid- and long- succession of political sales pitches."
 IBR.4103.a:0 "시간이 좀 걸릴 것이다..."
 
 IBR.4104.t:0 "두 개의 계획"
 IBR.4104.d:0 "The moon was gazing down upon the military headquarters in Madrid when the Caudillos finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. After discarding the obvious losers, and then the less obvious losers, the Caudillos were left with two plans to decide between.\n\nAmong the generals, Kaúlza de Arriaga's scheme had the most support. A limited war, but with the added benefit of looking towards the white French colonials in Algeria for support, and the creation of a cooperative government with them in the process. The Kaúlza Plan, as it has been called since he first presented it to the Caudillos, calls for open warfare in Algeria to simultaneously drive out the Italians and pacify the natives all in one fell swoop. The generals have rallied behind the Kaúlza Plan, and already believe that Salazar will support them.\n\nMeanwhile, among the Diplomats, Adriano Moreira's plan had proven to be the most attractive. Rather than approaching the Italian government directly- which would require a great deal of expense to acquire the Italian half of the region- he proposes that Iberia should instead approach the Italian Oil Giant, ENI. If they can convince ENI to support the Iberian claim to Algeria in exchange for a generous deal on oil development in the region, ENI could in turn put much more intense pressure on Italy to accept the Iberian claim. The other diplomats and politicians have abandoned their own rejected plans to support the Moreira Plan, and hope that Franco will support them in turn."
 IBR.4104.a:0 "무대가 준비되었다."
 
 IBR.4105.t:0 "어긋난 두 명의 카우디요"
 IBR.4105.d:0 "It was mid-day when Salazar entered the meeting room. Normally they wouldn't time a meeting so oddly, but Franco had requested he enter once he had fully collected his thoughts on the Algerian issue, and not one moment earlier or later. Sadly, what this meant was that Franco had to dedicate nearly the entire day to waiting, for whenever his counterpart finally got around to attending. He was thankful, then, that they showed up shortly after lunch.\n\nAs expected, Salazar got to talking as soon as he closed the door behind him.\n\n"I had to see everything, but I've made up my mind- Algeria needs to be secured. At any cost, it doesn't matter, we need to guarantee the retornados a home." Franco began to open his mouth to respond, but Salazar snapped at him first. "Don't start about pragmatism to me, not about this. Those retornados were exiled from their home once already, I would rather die than let them be kicked out again, and so soon after the first time! Arriaga's plan will guarantee them their home, and he'll make sure those Italian bastards recognize it!"\n\nFranco half-sighed, half-grunted in annoyance. "I can't fault you for being passionate about your people, but you are refusing to see the larger picture. We need peace in Algeria. A war will win them the land, maybe, but then where will you be, when they all die fighting for it? What good would it do, Salazar?" Salazar started a response, getting out perhaps half a word before Franco interrupted him. "Whatever we settle on, just remember. It needs to be unanimous...""
 IBR.4105.a:0 ""...우리는 서로 죽이 잘 맞는 것처럼 보일 필요가 있다.""
 
 IBR_cauinfo_algeria_tt:0 "§wA stronger Franco§! may §Yimprove the outcome of the crisis in Algeria§!.\n"
 
 IBR.4106.t:0 "알제리의 미래"
 IBR.4106.d:0 "Franco was in the same room again, this time reclined in a seat next to Salazar. He spared a glance to his colleague - who was more focused on the plans before them - before returning his gaze to Kazula and Moreira, who seemed more concerned with shuffling through their things. Eventually, they both prepared to present, but Kazula was mandated to go first.\n\nHe spoke loud, with a boisterous tone that showed his total confidence in his plans. He didn't have any formal charts or flashy models, but simply passed out two pieces of paper and laid a map out on the conference table, a map of Algeria. He detailed the situation (as he saw it), then carefully explained how they could swipe the rest of the country from the Italians. To this end, he also explained the contents of the documents he passed out - they were manifests, of the equipment they'd require, optimistically, to get the job done.\n\nOnce Kazula finished, it was time for Moreira to present his plan for Algeria. During the war plan briefing, the politician had taken the time to properly set up a presentation, though his delivery left some to be desired. He explained his plan, how working with ENI could win Algeria, and of how to make deals situated to look desirable to them. He pointed out the resources required, and how to best use them. With a style of utilizing as little words as possible, his side of the meeting concluded remarkably quickly.\n\nAs both sides had finished their presentation, the Caudillos spoke their verdict. While they both made designs to sell their plans, what the two didn't know was that the Caudillos had both already decided. They told the two, in their back-and-forth speech style, that..."
 IBR.4106.a:0 "전쟁만이 우리를 도와줄 것이다"
 IBR.4106.b:0 "대화만이 싸움을 승리로 이끌 것이다"
 
 IBR.4107.t:0 "하르딤의 새 직업"
 IBR.4107.d:0 "Another letter had arrived in the mail, carrying an opportunity just as lucrative as the first. Today, Jardim had the wisdom to simply set it aside, finishing his breakfast before breaking into the plots and schemes. What were they going to do, shoot him for a few minutes delay? The clinking of silverware was music to his ears, just as the sensation of warm food was music to his mouth.\n\nOnce he finally had the hands to open a letter, Jardim plucked the envelope open with a fingernail and then scanned the page. Attentive anticipation turned to curiosity, and from there to excitement all in the space of a paragraph, as Jardim found himself unable to suppress a laugh. A brand new job, specially for him, as soon as he was finished with his tenure in Algeria. Even better, they were going to pay him for work he wasn't yet doing! Today was going to be a good day, he was already sure.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Iberia proper, there was no laughing, for the "top brass" Jardim was going to join found the entire affair much less amusing. Perhaps it was jealousy, or maybe resentment, or even contempt - but it did not matter where it was coming from, for the end result was the same. Quite a few were unhappy with the new promotion, not least because he wasn't even out of Africa yet."
 IBR.4107.a:0 "All this for a strip of desert..."
 
 IBR.4108.t:0 "ENI 장교들과의 만남"
 IBR.4108.d:0 "The best part of guarding any kind of affluent figure, the bodyguard reflected, was the secrets. He would never tell anyone a word of what he hears during the meetings, not even to his death, but it had become a peculiar hobby of his to collect the secrets mentioned over the conference table. As far as anyone knew, he was maintaining professional posture. What the bodyguard knew, and was a little ashamed of, was that he bided his time by listening.\n\nFor the most sensitive matters, he couldn't do such a thing - he was never where he could hear anything. Today, the man was nearly sure that this meeting was one of those affairs. With another guard, he was to watch the door and make sure nobody else entered. If there was a scuffle, he would stop it. Nothing of the sort happened.\n\nEventually the door opened, with businessmen and diplomats filing out. The guard watched them silently, before he was given his next order:"
 IBR.4108.a:0 ""이 쪽으로 와서 점심이나 같이 먹자고""
 
 IBR.4109.t:0 "알제리의 대규모 석유 계약"
 IBR.4109.d:0 "Jardim stirred his coffee idly, spinning a stirrer around in circles. He had everything he wanted in it - he could splurge like that now - and was merely waiting for a map to show up. Every now and then, he took a few sips of coffee, speeding up as time wore on to beat his cooling drink. His cup was already empty when he heard the door click open, and he had just enough time to set it down before beholding the face of an advisor. In that advisor's hands, a map.\n\nThe map, when unrolled, revealed itself to be a map of Oran, just as Jardim had requested. Not just any map, however. This was a survey map of the oil deposits around the city of Oran. Scribbled over top of it were several pockets of red pencil, with many of the deposits covered by red,\n\n"These are the deposits. " The aide taps a finger on one of the red-covered deposits. "These, are deposits in use. For every one colored in, the fine folks back at ENI have signed on a contract. As you can see..." the man looks up, with a grin on his face. "We're going to turn a pretty penny down here."\n\nJardim knew the worker before him wasn't a part of any of this. He didn't care. "I have a spare cigar here for you, have time for a smoke?"\n\nThe two spent a while smoking together, celebrating their successes in a haze of smoke."
 IBR.4109.a:0 "Practice for our new Italian friends."
 
 IBR.4110.t:0 "ENI Offers Limited Contracts"
 IBR.4110.d:0 "Jardim stirred his coffee idly, spinning a stirrer around in circles. He had everything he wanted in it - he could splurge like that now - and was merely waiting for a map to show up. Every now and then, he took a few sips of coffee, speeding up as time wore on to beat his cooling drink. His cup was already empty when he heard the door click open, and he had just enough time to set it down before beholding the face of an advisor. In that advisor's hands, a map.\n\nThe map, when unrolled, revealed itself to be a map of Oran, just as Jardim had requested. Not just any map, however. This was a survey map of the oil deposits around the city of Oran. There were a few red marks over the paper, where some of the oil areas had been scribbled over with a red pencil. So many had been marked over, in fact, that Jardim could count them on one hand, plus one that was half-colored.\n\n"I suspect you're aware of what kind of map this is. A red colored deposit means the Italians signed a contract with us for it." He places his finger on the half-colored deposit on the map. "Here, we're still working out the details. Looks like it'll happen, though. So..."\n\n"What are they planning?"\n\n"Eh?"\n\n"Why are they so nervous? Think about it. If they didn't have something to hide, they'd sign more deals. Right?" Jardim slaps a hand on the map, looking up at the man who brought it in."
 IBR.4110.a:0 ""I think our olive branch is withering.""
 
 IBR.4111.t:0 "Preliminary Meetings"
 IBR.4111.d:0 "With the contacts in ENI sorted, it will be much easier to come to an equitable settlement with Italy. It is the natural impulse of man to preserve his gains, and so he will be less inclined to enter a scenario where they are at risk. The recent deals with the Italian-owned oil company has created those potential gains - if we were to come into conflict, then the lucrative deals for the black gold would be gone. By planting the seed of profit, we have shown the Italians that our objectives are friendship and cooperation.\n\nTo cement this, diplomats have been sent into a meeting with Italian officials. With the influence of a company who wants to preserve profits, and our show of friendliness, a peaceful solution is in sight. Of course this will not be an immediate affair, and the objective of our diplomats for the first few meetings will be to build trust. "
 IBR.4111.a:0 "Business always finds a way."

 #Market Liberal 1970 Events
 
 IBR.5000.t:0 "Ullastres holds speech on Iberia's need for free-market reforms"
 IBR.5000.d:0 ""I come before you today with a message containing a stark warning, it is your choice, Iberia's choice, whether to heed this warning or to succumb to the detrimental consequences otherwise. We have emerged victorious out of a dark age, some may call it our golden age, but they are either selfishly devious of nature or misinformed. This dark age gave forth the idea that a centralised self sufficient economy was needed to maximise output. Now two important things are to be noted here ladies and gentlemen. The time that this idea emerged under and the results wanted, both inextricably linked, are a product of that dark age. Can anyone here explain to me the need in this atomic age of requiring a war economy geared towards output instead of growth and the welfare of citizens?"\n\n"I come before you today, professing the warning that this era of mindless economic policy has to stop before we fall behind the rest of the world and are eternally forgotten as a union of two of the world's most decadent empires. We must reform, and the reform must be in the direction of freedom. It is precisely economic freedom which ultimately gives people freedom in their daily lives. This, Iberians, is what we will strive for.""
 IBR.5000.a:0 "The people will be convinced when the market delivers"
 
 IBR.5001.t:0 "The Privatization of Government Assets"
 IBR.5001.d:0 "Not shortly after Ullastres gave his well received speech the market-centred new state apparatus kicked into gear, its mission to slowly dismantle itself for the good of the country and less obviously itself. Many of the state run industries which had been under the jurisdiction of multiple government ministries, like the defense or interior, were beginning to be packaged and repurposed to be sold to Iberian private investors who had slightly different goals than their state counterparts. As conservative and falangist protests are springing up around the nation, none large enough to be of immediate concern, the market was beginning its impersonal processes, valuing the prices for the various new products that had just been added to the selection of supply. How this reform will play out only time and the 'invisible hand' can tell."
 IBR.5001.a:0 "The market will pay a fair price"
 
 IBR.5002.t:0 "Privatization Efforts End in Disaster"
 IBR.5002.d:0 "It seems the protestors, in their vehement and often ridiculous sounding arguments, had found some kernels of truth. The privatization effort of multiple state industries, which had been running in the red or generally been a pain for the state, produced unwelcome circumstances in the new more market-oriented economy. At first it seemed as if the state would be running a loss selling capital at a price below the rate expected. This did not bother us, as the main goal was to stimulate the economy and not exploit these sales. Yet as time went by, it seems that private investors were not quite as accustomed to the new Iberian economy as Ullatres had hoped. It was not long before many were asking for subsidies to provide lucrative contracts to the state instead of working on the market. Even worse, it seems that others read some loopholes in the sale agreements and were selling them to foreign investors. It may be necessary for the state to intervene to correct certain market failures..."
 IBR.5002.a:0 "A momentary setback..."
 
 IBR.5003.t:0 "Satisfactory Results from Privatization"
 IBR.5003.d:0 "An acceptable amount has been gained from the recent privatization of state firms, yet it should not go unnoticed that the expectations of the pessimistic conservative elements of our nation were certainly far exceeded. With a decent stream of revenue from leases and direct sales public spending can even be revamped, if only slightly. However even more importantly the Iberian government's move has stimulated the invisible hand of the free market to begin to work its magic with the concepts of demand and supply, something which in the previous era had almost strictly been adhered to only to state needs."
 IBR.5003.a:0 "These gains will surely benefit Iberia"
 
 IBR.5004.t:0 "Privatization Pays Incredible Dividends"
 IBR.5004.d:0 "The 'Miracle of Madrid' they called it, yet this ignored what truly was an awesome display of Iberian entrepreneurship and commerce that rather should be known as it rather should be known as the 'General Iberian spring'. With the privatization of state firms from multiple struggling ministries at the behest of the government, a strong spike in economic activity has occurred, mostly obviously in the private sector. The investors have not let the old capital go to waste in the slightest and are letting mismanaged assets finally come to fruition, being exploited to their full worth for profit and dividends. The growth rate for the peninsula shall likely be staggering for the next few years unless there are extreme external market shocks."
 IBR.5004.a:0 "God is truly with us"
 
 IBR.5013.t:0 "A Nation of Opportunity" 
 IBR.5013.d:0 "The freshly plastered poster drew the furtive yet sometimes mildly interested gazes of many a passerby in a Madrid market square. Its queer colorings drawing in mild attention to a message most either did not comprehend or could entirely care about.\n\n'A land of old wisdom and new opportunity, a steadfast union of people once divided to develop their individual strengths to only meet again and share in their combined fruits of labour. The rock in the roaring sea, we have pulled ourselves to our position through nothing but determination. You can too! With the new government reforms it will be easier than ever to finally work for yourself, enjoy your profits and share in the great project of our union. What are you waiting for?'"
 IBR.5013.a:0 "Free the markets, and the people will follow"
 
 IBR.5018.t:0 "A Work of God"
 IBR.5018.d:0 "An Iberian resurgence was underway, one that could not have been guessed at just a few years before. The union of convenience is beginning to stabilize politically, dealing with many of the major issues of the past regime in a much more effective and humane manner. To some, even more importantly were the economic reforms guaranteeing Iberia as a haven for free marketers in a continent of state organised economics. The difference in bringing about prosperity between the two forms of economic management are starting to show effects, even in the short term. However the progress made are baby steps which will ultimately raise this previously severely weakened nation onto the world stage. Work will be continued, and for once the citizenry can look to a bright light at the end of the tunnel instead of glooming darkness."
 IBR.5018.a:0 "Our work has only just begun"
 
 IBR.5005.t:0 "The Importance of a Responsible Democracy"
 IBR.5005.d:0 "Democracy, a concept filled with an amalgamation of different ideas and themes, is nearly as old as Western civilization itself. To see its power one must look no further than the renewed prosperity and might of the USA. A giant awakened, almost towering over the other great power regimes. Why not emulate this? Yet we have to be careful, this cannot be thrust onto our people without consideration of the lack of liberty in Iberian culture. How can such a powerful tool be given to a citizenry who still in parts respects the empty promises of demagogues whether on the right or left? This has to be a slow process, one guided by our party as we have Iberia's future at the core of our mission, not personal advantage. This is our mission from God, to infuse the culture with individualism and its accompanying responsibility. Allow people to fend for themselves and see that their voice has impact and therefore consequence. Until then we must reign like the backroom despots of the past."
 IBR.5005.a:0 "The people must be heard, but need guidance"
 
 IBR.5006.t:0 "Preparations for Regional Elections Begin"
 IBR.5006.d:0 "All around the nation in the various localities the PRD spin doctors and campaign strategists were beginning their arduous task of reinforcing the central administration's line of planning for the upcoming regional elections. This was an important event as it could mean a further consolidation of power for the government, enabling them to push through reforms at a quicker rate while guaranteeing their effectiveness on the ground. Hence it was extremely important for the party that this event would go in their favor. Some critics have stated that the government is putting too much attention towards these elections and pivoting away from other pressing issues of state however official statements have repudiated this harshly, labelling some of the hit pieces against them as disinformation."
 IBR.5006.a:0 "Iberia will make the right choice"

 #under until 5012 are reaction events to regional elections
 IBR.5007.t:0 "Choosing a Posture on Social Issues"
 IBR.5007.d:0 "Since these upcoming regional elections are vital in securing a strong base in local areas for the party and to ease in reforms it is necessary to develop a coherent, popular posture on dealing with social issues. The most important of these being the political status of women and minorities due to the stability issue of the union which greatly affected the concept of the Iberian identity. We can however not just limit ourselves in the social sphere to this as our nation is not just plagued by a hovering identity crisis. Once the range of issues and their importance have been made clear, we next need to actually choose our stances. Should we appeal more to the Conservative portions of the country, who naturally hold great sway in elections from the despotist era, or should we rather target the liberal elements who mostly congregate in the urban areas."
 IBR.5007.a:0 "We will take a conservative posture"
 IBR.5007.b:0 "We will take a liberal posture"
 
 IBR.5008.t:0 "Clarifying our Economic Stance"
 IBR.5008.d:0 "The direction of both the local economies and the broader national economy is of great interest to the party, hence with the upcoming elections we have the opportunity to reaffirm what most already know about our free market stance, or to slightly tone down the rhetoric in favor of a more compromised solution. Weighing up the positives and negatives of the two options makes one realize the precarious situation Iberia truly is in; were we to go with the more market oriented approach we may risk conservative elements of the populace and business world at the very least acting non compliant while not pursuing the free market approach may leave our economy lagging behind ultimately in the global market."
 IBR.5008.a:0 "We remain fully committed to market liberalism"
 IBR.5008.b:0 "We will attempt to reassure the skeptics"
 
#large is when you reassure skeptics, and you obv make gains in the regions you appeal to
 IBR.5009.t:0 "PRD Makes Moderate Gains in Conservative Regions"
 IBR.5009.d:0 "Our election strategy has seen mild success as we were able to infiltrate Conservative strongholds and gain enough seats to threaten their complete dominance. This ultimately will give us enough political capital to begin to try to push through reforms on a local level, but we will still incur heavy costs and have to compromise. These are a necessary part of the ebb the flow of promises that we have to make the electorate.\n\nThe experience still has taught us something though as we now know more about what will appeal to this strata of the populace for future elections. Our name has also gotten out there and any publicity is better than none at all. "
 IBR.5009.a:0 "A work in progress. "
 
 IBR.5010.t:0 "PRD Makes Large Gains in Conservative Regions"
 IBR.5010.d:0 "A great shock, both for the party itself and many establishment figures, hit Madrid today as results from the recent election started to filter in. The PRD has made significant gains in Conservative areas of the nation, something that despite the large amount of propaganda dedicated to the campaign had seemed impossible. It was initially planned and predicted that a small entry point could be made, from which the party could begin to expand their influence. This may now not even be necessary anymore, as with these results future policy changes will be far easier to implement and likely will not receive any sort of major protests. Consolidation will have to be carried out with due diligence, as now losing what had been gained would be a great smear on the party, even on the national level."
 IBR.5010.a:0 "This is our chance. "
 
 IBR.5011.t:0 "PRD Makes Moderate Gains in Liberal Regions"
 IBR.5011.d:0 "The numbers were beginning to come in: almost every working party official browsing line by line with increased dread. Yet despite wishful thinking nothing changed between numerous inspections of the election results. The party had been unable to make major gains in liberal areas, something which had seemed to be a guarantee considering their normal platform. Had there been too many policy concessions to appease conservatives? Had local dignitaries been unaware of the actual electoral mood? All questions that would need to be answered if the party can continue to try to govern and bring Iberia forward into the brighter future they have envisioned. Despite this roadblock likely taking some time to get over some officials cite the gains as an achievement nonetheless and something to be built on. This may be true but did nothing to raise sullied moods."
 IBR.5011.a:0 "Where to go from here? "
 
 IBR.5012.t:0 "PRD Makes Large Gains in Liberal Regions"
 IBR.5012.d:0 "Unsurprising to most it became clear even in the early hours after the last ballots had been cast that the PRD had made considerable gains in the liberal areas of the nation. These were very important to the party, despite their almost ensured support, as future policy would be built upon their backing and any sort of electoral challenge could now be squashed with their votes. However as most dignitaries celebrated, some of the higher level party members were already in deep conversation on the topic of liberal expectation and conservative moderation. Policy changes would certainly come across differently in the two opposing camps. Finding a balance between the two as not to antagonise either to any greater extent was vital both for the stability of the party and the nation."
 IBR.5012.a:0 "Towards a brighter future."
 
 IBR.5014.t:0 "Protests For Divorce in Barcelona" 
 IBR.5014.d:0 "A Liberal thorn, or perhaps further left, was wedged into the soft flesh of party complacency. Because of course the Iberian people are a Catholic one but, under foreign influence and internal oppression, views on certain social issues have radically altered.\n\nIt should have been a peaceful, normal working day with hurried economic activity in the second largest city of the Union. Instead many major roads in Barcelona are blocked by throngs of people protesting for something they have no right to, divorce for any reason. This cannot stand; sedition like this spreading among the populace would shift Iberian politics out of control. Hence the protest must be countered in such a way that is discredited, not merely broken up. The message must be killed, not its messengers. Perhaps some counter protests may do the trick, organized by our friends in the Opus Dei to show the true will of the Iberian people against these hooligans."
 IBR.5014.a:0 "Attempt to set up counter protests"
 
 IBR.5015.t:0 "Counter Protests Succeed" 
 IBR.5015.d:0 "The numerous men of cloth and their countless supporters have succeeded in their mission to drive out heretical thought from the still impressionable minds of the Iberian people.\n\nOpus Dei's large rally in Barcelona ran into the initial divorce protestors on their second day, and was easily able to drown out any influence that could have been enacted on the people's psyche. Their success has allowed the administration some much needed breathing room. The insistence to win hearts and minds instead of using brute force to quash the social revolt has been a clever move to save face with the more left-leaning elements in the country and in the PRD support base.

 IBR.5016.t:0 "Counter Protests Prove to be Ineffective" 
 IBR.5016.d:0 "The effort to create an effective counter protest by the government has been foiled. Not only was the intended outcome of reducing the credibility of the original divorce protest not achieved, but many liberals have also taken issue with government policy considering promises made in local elections. Finding the link between the counter protest organised by the religious followers and the current administration had not been a hard job as speculation regarding the connection between the two groups had been running rampant since the initial swearing in of the party.\n\nA multitude of marches and other forms of protest have begun to erupt around the nation, mostly confined to the larger cities, that condemn the administration of forgoing their promises to maintain strong relations with Catholics and conservatives alike, playing the game of politics instead of staying true to their word. Crackdowns are already occurring, luckily with minimal violence, but the whole affair has left a stain the government may not ever be truly able to clean."

It was unannounced, causing worry from those who believed it to be an emergency address. Luckily this was not the case; rather the president had taken it that this would be a good time to reiterate the importance of Catholic Church in the lives of every Iberian. Using a politicians tongue and expert hyperbole he went on to make his statement for around twenty minutes, delving into history and its lessons for modern society, drawing parallels between godlessness and chaos. Finishing not too soon he also mentioned Opus Dei in positive terms, giving those he presided over the advice to seek out their support in case of emotional distress or a lack of faith. And with that the normal broadcast resumed."

 IBR.5019.d:0 "The progress achieved by the party in transporting a backward nation forward into the new age has been tremendous. Iberia has become a beacon of freedom on the European continent, a bright light in the dark swathes of authoritarianism. All that had to be done was to create more economic freedoms for the people, to allow choice where previously had been mandate. After all how could it all be managed from the top down? The party was not God and neither was this his kingdom.\n\nClearly not everyone was as eager to accept this new opportunity for the union, some had to have their faith reinstilled, often just by positive social reinforcement. On other occasions the vigilant Opus Dei organization was always ready to help. However they have seen the light now, the way forwards into the harmonious society that will be representative of God's will on earth."

 IBR.5020.t:0 "Formulating a Strategy on Government Reform"
 IBR.5020.d:0 "Ullastres stepped forward to the podium, waiting patiently for the gathered ministers and journalists to quieten down before speaking. "The state of the various governmental institutions that were inherited from the dark era of the Caudillos is in dire need of reform. There will be no capability to transform the nation into a stable and prosperous union of equals without, and excuse the metaphor here," he winked almost cheekily while a few laughs were heard in the auditorium, "a great flood to uproot the former constitutional mess of the botched unification."\n\n"The autarchical nature of the old economic and even state policy is best fit for the intolerant hermit nation we once were. We were not listening, we were drawing back into ourselves. Well ladies and gentlemen, I say no more!" He stood back for a moment, again waiting for the applause to subside. "Clearly we will require great expertise for such a task, yet I am confident our new government is up to the challenge. We are also very fortunate to have amassed a significant amount of ties to experts in various fields of the private sector who recognize that it's in their interests to support the recovery. Therefore, do not fret; children of this great country, the nation of Iberia will stand strong and proud, a rock of liberty in a sea of tyranny! There shall be no harkening back to a great era once lost, we will forge our own, right now, that those who will come after us will imitate for eternity to come."
 IBR.5020.a:0 "A strong signal for a bright future."

 
 IBR.5021.t:0 "Advice From a Trusted Friend"
 IBR.5021.d:0 "Following what has already been established as a keynote speech in Iberian political history the new president of the Iberia, head of the reformist market liberals, has seemingly been hard at work establishing the groundwork for the grandiose promises he had made. His staffers have rarely seen Ullastres leave his office with only few people coming to visit, one of these however being the founder of the religious organization Opus Dei, Josemaría Escrivá.\n\nThe man of God has been rather frequent in his visits, often carrying large briefcases overflowing with charts and other assorted papers. Clearly Ullastres had made good on his previous statement about consulting private sector experts to help in forming government policies that will move towards greater economic liberalisation of the nation. Relying on the Catholic likely proves the president's will still play to the traditional base despite his widespread reform plans."

 IBR.5024.d:0 "Citizens of Iberia were greeted today with unsettling news. A government probe has discovered that local institutions around the nation were infested with crooked civil servants who were funded by businesses and private interest groups from the previous era. Their goals were still unclear but their treachery was obvious. Only by chance and skill of the investigators had this scandal been uncovered as judges and other lawmen had covered for the traitors. Even more menacingly it seems that this corruption and nepotism was not just restricted to the various regions of the peninsula but rather had even made its way up to the national level.\n\nNationwide people began to match on the streets protesting against this outrage, calling for the government to intervene. And intervene it shall, but what should be focused on first? The political establishment that had secured and furthered the crookedness of the numerous businessmen who helped fund them along the way?"

 IBR.5025.d:0 "With the rampant corruption that had been recently uncovered by government investigators the many options on how to deal with the situation now lie on the table for Ullastres and his party to consider. The choice to be made is not a simple one with both sides bringing hefty negatives that will weigh heavily on the shoulders of the administration. This should not be a surprise however as no disaster of this scale is likely to reap many positives. Not even when the old seats can be filled with those loyal to the new Iberia. The more benevolent option is to continue monitoring the traitors and try to reform them, only seeking to eliminate those beyond saving and who have done the most damage. The effectiveness of this is unclear sadly, hence may harm long term goals of the government. Mass arrests on the other hand will make sure that the system can be rebuilt, fashioned into a more effective state devoid of the taint of the of the past. Yet this will not go without consequences when caving to the public. A hard choice will need to be made. "

For them this morning proved an unwelcome break in the incessant cycle of monotony. Riot police clad in armour, kitted out with shields and other equipment that would speak of a serious riot began amassing in the main streets of cities all around the peninsula. Even small conservative rural towns were not spared of this treatment either, rather they seemed to garner the most state attention.\n\nShortly after noon it became clear why, in many of the locations that were covered large mobs began to assemble, waving placards and posters decrying the government crackdown on conservative and falangists, painting them to be one of political sabotage. Having had time to set up and gain advantageous positions the police was able to control the protests and keep most of the planned marches peaceful. A great strategic victory for our government that even the press praised highly.

Our citizens must be free, free to live comfortable lives where they can pursue their goals to the best of their abilities. The old system of the despots clearly had never provided this.

 IBR.5031.d:0 "A slow rasping at the door. Shifting his gaze lazily away from the papers he was working on the president gives the signal to enter. The sight greeting him should have worried him immediately; an exhausted staffer, clearly eager to get his message out on the one hand yet timidly reserved on the other as if fearing Ullastres' reaction.\n\n"Get on with it please, I have a lot of work I still need to finish before the cabinet meeting tomorrow."\n\nWith a spluttering cough the young man conveyed his message in a grave tone. The head of Opus Dei, Josemaría Escrivá, who had been making his way home after the meeting with president earlier in the day had been shot by a lone assailant while climbing into his car. He had been quickly rushed to the hospital, but his condition at this point in time was unclear. It was likely that the would be assassin was a falangist unhappy with the current political situation. The gears were already beginning to turn even before the staffer could finish, Ullastres considered the possible assassin list and motives, considered reprimands, considered consequences. Then he remembered it had been his friend who was lying in the hospital, possibly at death's door, and he rushed out of his chair past the spluttering man."

In his momentary weakness the president stepped forward, stumbling almost, to the side of his friend. He almost shrieked when suddenly Escrivá's eyes snapped open and he gripped Ullastres' arm tightly. "Come closer," he whispered gravely.

 #Marlib oil crisis event (would be epic if gotter wrote this)
 
 IBR.5404.t:0 "Slashing Fuel Subsidies"
 IBR.5404.d:0 "The previous provision of fuel subsidies to certain sectors of the economy had been justified upon the grounds that it was a necessary component for industry to grow and hence should be provided to an extent by the government to help Spain compete abroad. Even prior to the crisis this policy had been deeply criticised by members of our government who argued that all it was doing was wasting precious resources which would have been allocated more efficiently by the market. The crisis has given these arguments further impetus, throwing even previous defenders behind the idea that reform was needed. In order to adjust to the crisis, we hence need to ensure that the little oil we can salvage for the economy is allocated to the sectors of the economy that need it. Hence only those that can pay full price and highly demand it should be able to claim it."

Structural issues concerning the labour market and environmental regulation could create long lasting unintended negative consequences. Others have reacted to the claims with harsh venom. The extreme free marketers continue to hold by the mantra that the only good market regulation is no market regulation. A choice has to hence be made, do we support slight reform and possibly compromise upon our ideals or do we hold steadfast and run the risk of letting the crisis further tank the Iberian economy?"

 IBR.5406.d:0 "With the backdrop of the current economic crisis we have run into a further problem. Many creditors have become restless with the worsening economic situation. They now demand that interest payments on government debt have to be moved forwards in order to safeguard their other investments. Our state should only be a simple night watchman, providing law and order to ensure uncompromised movement of market forces. For us to accumulate debts is a sin and represents failure. We likely should hence pay them back now.\n\nYet we are completely in our right to withhold on these payments. The previous payments have all gone according to procedure and we are on target to effectively deal with our debt in the near future. The demands to pay back now seem almost preposterous. To deal with both the crisis and these payments could result in terrible economic consequences. A decision has to be made."

He thanked them for the resilience that the majority had shown, adding that he truly felt proud to be governing a nation committed to the ideals of individualism. Moving swiftly onwards Ullastres attended to the matter of complaints over government action. Conceding that certain actions, no matter whether their intention was aimed towards the greater good, negatively had impacted some parts of the population. Directly addressing those who were currently employed he promised that with the eventual upcoming upswing in the economy there surely will be a place for them to return to. He however did not apologise. Staying resolute he argued that the policies of the government had been a necessary countermeasure to prevent the crisis from deepening further and critically affecting the economy. With the reforms the newly restructured economy, which now would be able to gain even more from free market efficiency, would emerge from the crisis stronger and more durable to future shocks. When the good times come with this development so too would the benefits trickle down to the public. Finishing with a sheepish smile he added that in time the populace will thank the PRD for what they have done to save the Iberian economy."

 IBR.624.t:0 "특수 지역의 문제"
 IBR.624.d:0 "Regionalism was the scourge of Iberia. It had been that way all the way back to the Reconquista, when the peninsula had been divided amongst half a dozen warring kings. For centuries regionalism was allowed to fester until it became a sagging boil that exploded into two devastating civil wars. Now, with democracy restored and the sensible administrators of the Alianza Popular in power, Iberia had a once in a millenia opportunity to put aside regionalism once and for all. Jorge Verstrynge knew this. His enemies in Congress did not.\n\nFor almost an hour now they had been causing a scene, the parliamentarians of the Unión Republicana and the Partido Renovador Democrático, berating the government in the strongest possible terms over its opposition to the autonomy of the regions. Verstrynge had listened to their outbursts quietly, allowing others from his party to respond to their cajoling, but he was growing tired of the antics. Taking the next opportunity to speak, he rose to the podium.\n\n"Fellow Deputies, I have listened intently to the intervention of those opposite. And I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed. It is as if those opposite have forgotten all the events of the past 40 years. How separatism fueled the divisions of Spain and tore it apart in civil war. How Iberia mere years ago was plunged into the fires of seperatist insanity, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. Well, we here in the government have not forgotten the dead! We have not forgotten the debt of blood that Iberia owes to the martyrs who died for its liberty and unity against separatists and extremists alike! No, we will not allow you to once again fan the flames of separatism that have torn this nation apart. We in the government will chart a new course, one towards a strong, united Iberia!"\n\nThe opposition howled in indignation at Verstrynge's fiery retort, and the debate raged on and on."

 IBR.625.t:0 "The "Rights and Duties of Special Regions" Law"
 IBR.625.d:0 "Iberia was, and always would be, a unitary country, ruled from the center. The victory of the Alianza Popular had made sure of that, and President Manuel Fraga Iribarne wanted to make sure everyone else remembered it. Regionalist hysteria and terroristic separatism would not be tolerated in the new, democratic Iberia. He knew that the sooner that everyone, including the troublesome separatists themselves, understood and accepted this, the better off everyone would be.\n\nThe new law just passed by Congress made that very very clear. Defining the rights and duties of Iberia's regions, the legislation practically ended all pretense of political autonomy, leaving them more as symbolic institutions than actual levers of government. A large portion of people would undoubtedly be very angry. The opposition were practically livid. They would all get over it eventually.\n\nYet there was little point rubbing salt in an open wound. The separatists would be offered a few small symbolic concessions, things that might be of some importance to them, but of little real significance to the unity and security of Iberia. What did he care if the Catalans and Basque wanted to speak their own languages in private? Or perform their own little national dances? Such things harmed no-one.\n\nHe would of course anger the hardliners in his party and those further to the right, but that was inevitable when charting a course away from the ruinous, divisive politics of the past regime. Franga knew that he was in a unique position to finally solve the issue of the regions once and for all, and forge a democratic and truly united Iberia. This had to be done, despite all the detractors on the left and the right. Whatever the cost."

 IBR.626.d:0 "The sun beats down on a clear, beautiful day. The blue sky stretches overhead unto the horizon, and beneath its azure canopy a man in ragged, old-fashioned peasant's clothing heaves and grunts at the back end of an old iron plow, muttering curses at the stubborn ox hitched to the front. "Move, you old bastard!" bellows the peasant, swinging a leather whip at the beast's hindquarters. A nobleman on horseback, dressed in rural finery, chuckles and canters forth, giving the ox a whack with his riding crop and finally setting the mound of muscle in motion. The ox gives a guttural bray, lifting its head from grazing and continuing on its arduous journey across the field. The peasant smiles and raises a fist in triumph, drawing cheers from the large crowd of onlookers seated nearby. A camera clicks, capturing a memory of the past come back to life.\n\nOf course, this is no 16th-century farm, but the first annual 'Rural Roots Festival', designed to honour Iberia's rural past. Held on a warm day near Madrid, the festival has drawn tens of thousands so far with many more expected to arrive from as far afield as Catalonia and Portugal. The peasant and nobleman are just two of many historical re-enactors who have been tirelessly entertaining and educating the crowds. Beside the entrance to the main performance field stretch triple rows of stalls, numbering in the hundreds; many a well-off farmer has travelled up from Andalusia and Extremadura to hawk prime produce, jam, wine and honey. The citizens of Madrid, so used to the greys and browns of urban life, are spoiled for choice and clearly dazzled by the charm and diversity of the countryside's gifts.\n\nAs the day draws to a close and the sun dips towards the horizon, sleepy children are herded home, many tightly clutching toys and curios hard-won in traditional games. More than one farmer, who mere years ago was struggling to make ends meet, fires up his truck and sets off for home with a load of empty crates and a bulging wallet. As earnings and attendance figures roll in, a local council member smiles - this year's budget will be nicely padded for once."

 IBR.628.t:0 "The New National Curriculum" 
 IBR.628.d:0 "Schooling in Iberia has for decades been a stuffy, rigid business. Daily lessons in Latin, prayer at least once a day, and corporal punishment of children, all supervised by the Catholic Church. President Fraga was of the opinion that it was time for a change, if only to bring the country back into the 20th century. Whoever was given the job of spearheading the modernization effort would have to weather the storm of criticism from both the hardliners and the opposition liberals. Fraga would have to find a man of intellect and grit equaling the task.\n\nHe found such a man in Jose Luis Villar Palasi. Previously a minister in the old regime but now a supporter of Iberian democracy, Palasi was a soft, gentle man, unassuming and bespectacled. But underneath that veneer hid a towering intellect. Palasi was a polymath, speaking over 15 languages, and was known for his love of philosophy, economics, and law. And most important of all, he was a modernizing conservative, determined to bring the Spanish education system up to date with the latest trends and practices while maintaining its religious and civic character.\n\nPalasi's General Education Law passed easily through the Council, supported even by members of the opposition Unión Republicana. Its effects were sweeping and immediate. Archaic schooling practices such as Latin lessons were done away with and replaced with useful activities such as sports. Classes in religion would continue on and the Catholic nature of Iberian education would be maintained, but the influence of the priests and nuns would be curtailed in favor of educated professional teachers. Social science, philosophy, economics, and politics would be taught for the first time, and a unified system of standardized testing would ensure every student had a chance of going to university.\n\nAlready immensely popular, the reform has even won over some of the government's detractors, and made Palasi a household name."

However, there is a possibility that not everything is as it appears on the surface. A commonly held opinion within the party is that this upstanding moral character is too clean - and someone who strives so hard to appear honest is certainly hiding something. The train of thought that the Opus Dei is a fraud was something that was prevalent in far more places than ever expected, from a primary concern to a shred tucked in the back of their mind.\n\nIt wasn't hard to reach a consensus that something ought to be done, and so an audit on the Opus Dei was arranged. There was an issue, however. Because of their nature an investigation won't be able to hit everything in a reasonable time, and so to have even a chance of something substantial the investigation must be carefully directed. Suspicions are raised the most in two locations: their finances, and their political connections. Examining their financial connections is risky, as their threat is something any savvy politician knows, but if something is turned up then it could be decisive in discrediting the Opus Dei. Looking into their political connections could expose any ties with political parties that may be present, but if they have taken sufficient precautions then it's likely that nothing could be found regardless. Therefore, in order to maximize the odds of finding something suspicious, the investigators decided to"

 IBR.630.d:0 "President Fraga was not having a good day. For hours the Alianza Popular party room had been engaging in one of the most fractious debates of its short history, split down the middle on its approach to the government's policy concerning women's rights. Before now Franga and his cabinet had seen fit to avoid the question entirely, seeing it as a divisive distraction from the government's current legislative program.\n\nYet a small faction on the left of his party, led by popular journalist and writer María Victoria Fernández-España, had now raised the issue in the party room. Representing the small number of female Alianza Popular deputies, they were loudly calling for the government to encourage women to enter the workforce and break down traditionalist gender roles passed down from the old Iberian regime. Usually, Fraga would have been able to safely ignore them, but much to his annoyance, his secondhand man Jorge Verstrynge had already waded into the debate, backing the women. He would have to deal with Verstrynge's insubordination later, when this mess was over.\n\nThe hardliners were responding as they always did, suggesting that if the government conceded to the feminists they would soon be demanding abortion rights, the right to divorce, and the legalization of adultery, all fundamental challenges to the status of Iberia as a Catholic country. Their rhetoric had now begun to take on hyperbolic proportions, arguing that any movement of women into the workforce would undermine the Iberian family unit, the fundamental building block of Iberian society, thus resulting in social degradation and ultimately collapse.\n\nThe President had stayed out of it until now, hoping that the discussion would cool and they could move on to more pressing matters, but there seemed no end in sight. He would have to take the podium and intervene in the debate, lest the party tear itself apart. His word would ultimately settle things, with the center following his lead. As Fraga took the stage before his party, he set upon a course of action."

 IBR.631.d:0 "Much had changed in Iberia since the days of the Caudillos. Democracy had been restored across the peninsula, new modernizing reforms were being passed almost every month, and the whole country was imbued with a renewed sense of optimism and hope for the future. Yet in the dark and musty courtrooms of Iberia, one felt transported back to ages past. Strict, archaic statutes, some dating back as far as 1944, continued to land a great many innocent Iberians in jail, while the courts were packed with apparatchiks of the old Falangist order.\n\nThe government's New Penal Code put an end to all of that. Hundreds of judges and other court officials associated with abuses under the Caudillos have been sacked, replaced with a new generation of young lawyers. A series of vital democratic reforms have been implemented, ensuring the accused the right to free legal representation and appeal, while also stripping the military of the right to try its members in secret military courts. Freedom of assembly and press are enshrined in law for the first time in decades. Jose Luis Villar Palasi, a legal thinker as well as an education reformer, has earned himself and the government much praise for his role in devising the new system.\n\nYet not everything has changed. Adultery, abortion, and divorce remain illegal, along with a whole series of other statues regulating sexual and social freedom. The death penalty will continue to be enforced for heinous crimes. The right for workers to associate in a union remains nebulous at best, and the police have as much power as they ever did.\n\nPresident Fraga and his party tow a fine line. Iberia must be free and democratic, its courts a beacon of fairness and equanimity on a continent gripped by extremist insanity. Yet it must also remain strong and just, ensuring the social and institutional fabric of the country, already so fragile in the aftermath of the Iberian War, remains intact."

Many knew he had served briefly in the old regime as Minister for Information and Tourism, yet few Iberians recognized his face in the newspapers, and even less knew what his voice sounded like.\n\nFraga wanted to change that. If he was to be the man who led Iberia into its future as a modern democratic nation, he had to be a constant source of inspiration and comfort. Yet so many simply saw him as just another collaborator. Speaking directly to Iberians in their homes via the radio, he could give them his side of the story.\n\n"Fellow Iberians," he said, beginning his address to the nation. "I am speaking to you today to address my role in the old regime. I say to you today, as I have always said and always will say, that I am for a free, united, and democratic Iberia. Yet I believe we must remember the chaos which engulfed our homeland in these past decades. The regimes of Salazar and Franco arose in situations of anarchy across the peninsula, when the forces of extremism threatened to bring civilization toppling down. They united to form Iberia when under attack by those same forces of tyranny. Without these harsh measures, Iberia would not exist, and I would not be here talking to you today. Despite this, the violence and brutality of the old regime was unconscionable, and many mistakes were made. Some will ask why I do not feel guilt for my involvement in the regime of Salazar and Franco. As any who was there at the time can testify, I advocated long and hard within the ranks of the regime for democratic reforms, at risk to my own career and self. If the end result is Iberia, secure and free as it stands today, then I say I would gladly do it all over again.""

 #A Catholic Nation
 IBR.5050.t:0 "A Catholic Nation"
 IBR.5050.d:0 "The Catholic Church has always had deep roots in Iberia, dating back all the way to the Reconquista. As a consequence the nations of the peninsula have historically been unparalleled champions of the Catholic faith, and Catholic orders of all stripes have played an important role in governance and politics. Democratic Iberia is no different, and a number of Catholic organizations play an important role in Iberian politics.\n\nOne such organization is the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei, made up almost entirely of laymen and secular priests not tied to any monastic orders. Though deeply religiously conservative and supportive of Church doctrine, they were ostracised by many Falangists in the old regime who believed that Opus Dei was a covert front for freemasonry. Since the fall of the old regime they have become increasingly popular for their role in various charity efforts and sponsorship of universities.\n\nYet recently they have developed some very controversial ideas. While they recognize that Iberia is and must remain a Catholic state, they have shocked many right-wing Catholics across the country, and their liberal-minded Jesuit rivals, by supporting efforts to expand the freedoms of religious minorities in Iberia. Their leader and founder, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás has argued in his most recent book that "pluralism is not to be feared but loved as a legitimate consequence of personal freedom," concluding with the slogan: "Long live students of all religions and all ideologies."\n\nThis turn has caused serious tensions within the government. With the question of religious freedoms being talked about openly on the streets, pressure is being put on President Fraga to take a side. Either risk losing the support of Catholic hardliners within his own party, or risk alienating a sizable portion of Iberian Catholics. A decision will have to be made, one way or the other."

Their conditions were strict - not many people approved of an investigation into an institution of the Catholic Church, and so it took a lot of compromising to even get an approval into order.\n\nFaced with only a small amount of time, hostile oversight, and overly stringent standards the investigation team was left with the shaft. Even if they didn't, it's hard to tell if it would make a difference. The Opus Dei were to set an example in everything they did, and the audit finds that they did just that. Patrolling their records sent one the impression of a freshly-sponged room, so clean it reflected back at you.\n\nIf anything, the most notable thing to be found in the results is this cleanliness itself - no other organization carries themselves in such a wonderful manner.

As such, the only way even so much as a cursory glance could be approved was to compromise heavily, leading to a shackled audit. Therefore it was necessary to focus on one certain aspect in order to have any chance at a real breakthrough.\n\nTo our delight, pooling the resources into the investigation of the political ties of the Opus Dei has revealed a possible connection. It is a thread, weak and barely present, but nonetheless tangible. One of the main opposition parties, the PRD led by Alberto Ullastres, may possibly have a connection with the Opus Dei. Some even suspect they are nothing but their puppets! With this lead secured, what remained was to validate it by a rigorous investigation.\n\nThere are multiple ways an investigation into this possible political tie can be conducted. The easiest method would be to just conduct an expansion of the previous investigation, with formal support and a shield in the event of unexpected circumstances. However, this may not be enough. Attempting to go through legal channels, while sound, could allow for the Opus Dei to cover up any evidence they might have waiting to be used against them. To counter this a more illegal solution could be utilized, breaking into their headquarters and finding their documents before they could be hidden. It would be disastrous if word of this would get out, but the possible reward is far greater. How will we investigate this possible connection?"

As opposed to just being grateful, they have instead been outraged that we did not give them more. Because of our unwillingness to grant them the mile, they have taken the stance that we do not represent them. The resulting protests, most likely egged on by separatists, have crippled any productivity the minority areas could muster.

Nevertheless, despite the grumbles the police had been on a fair track to being separate from the armed forces.\n\nMaking the case for this has become significantly harder as of late. As law enforcement has been transferred to civilian oversight, the police forces have gone rampant. Reports of brutality have risen significantly, and professionalism and morale have taken a nose-dive.

This legacy of bloodshed has continued on to Iberia, and we have been shackled to it as well. Even though Iberia is a free republic now, many of these terrorists simply haven't gotten the point. In nearly every minority region separatism has taken a major hit, but still holds a monumental popularity among some segments of the people.\n\nMost of these people will never take any action to further the cause they support, but there are those who will go so far as to sacrifice their lives for a misguided campaign. Usually they're just arrested. This action, while effective, is not entirely sustainable. These terrorists will just remain in prison, until they are broken out by their cohorts and returned back to causing chaos on the streets. Only one thing can definitively rule out this possibility, and it is their death; but killing the terrorists brings on a whole new debate.\n\nHow shall the Axencia eliminate these people? The most practical option would be to just kill off anyone suspected of being a separatist. This could prove very messy, and is highly risky. However, it would eliminate all of them far faster. Alternatively, we could send in hitmen to eliminate them quietly. This has far smaller odds of causing a stir - after all, it's only a couple of criminals - but would take far longer to properly be rid of them all.

The details haven't been released to the public, but they're looking to be fairly damning.\n\nThe televised footage has a somber mood, and nobody there seems to be much in a talking mood.

Our inmate turned killer was found out, and placed under a rigorous interrogation. Already put off by their evils, being put under the harsh light of a lamp proved too much for them. He broke, and confessed everything he knew to them. Thankfully there wasn't much to know - two men gave him an impressive amount of contraband in exchange for killing someone. Unexpectedly this information was guided into a deduction that to agents from the Axencia had paid him.\n\nThe scandal threatened to consume the entire government in its inferno, but by denouncing the two as 'lone actors' and terminating them the situation has been for the most part contained.

 IBR.5408.d:0 "A bearded man on the television screen, probably one of those godforsaken student radicals, was holding up a sign. It read "Fraga is a Fascist". The camera lingered on him for some time before panning back out the rest of the rally, several thousand strong.\n\n"Can you believe this shit Jorge?" President Manuel Fraga said, growing exasperated as he stared intently at the screen. "I deliver them democracy and they call me a fascist. The youth are so ungrateful."\n\nJorge Verstrynge, Fraga's second hand man and political proteje, fidgeted nervously in his seat as the two men sat before the television screen. What he would say next would certainly anger his boss, but it had to be said.\n\n"Respectfully Manuel, it's not just the youth. The cuts have turned a great number of people against us. Pensioners, the sick, those with disabilities, the unemployed. Austerity was certainly necessary to stop an economic crash created by the oil crisis, but we have to recognize how unpopular the cuts are."\n\n"They are only temporary," Fraga scoffed. "And what can we do? It's not like we could give in to their demands and reverse the cuts. To do so would be to bow to the will of the mob. No, the streets belong to the state, not the people. The streets belong to me! I would be better off sending in the police to clear them all out."\n\nVerstrynge was disturbed by such talk, but did not let it show. There might come a day where Fraga overstepped, and action would have to be taken, but for now he would have to try to sway him to a reasonable course.\n\n"Look, nobody is saying we give them everything they want. But maybe restoring funding to a few of the programs, partially reversing a few of the cuts. That would defuse the protests and still ensure we avoid financial ruin."\n\nFraga's eyes broke away from the television screen and turned to Verstrynge. He was clearly surprised by the proposal.\n\n"All I ask is that you consider it Manuel," Verstrynge said, trying to ward off an argument before it began. "We all want what is best for Iberia.""

It says so on statements we have put out mere days ago! If we go back on that now it will be political suicide."\n\nThe Minister for Labour was angry, angrier than President Manuel Fraga had seen him in a long time. I guess he had every right to be, with many of his cherished social security programs, implemented by his ministry since the establishment of democracy, being dismantled in recent weeks. Yet still, Fraga had not expected this much opposition, let alone at a cabinet meeting.\n\n"We have no choice," Jorge Verstrynge responded, taking point and showing Fraga why he kept him around as his second-hand-man. He really was quite invaluable in a debate. "The oil crisis has seriously depleted our treasury. If we don't raise taxes we will not be able to pay our debts. We are facing a sovereign default."\n\n"To hell with that," de la Fuente retorted, now turning and pleading directly to the President. "If we need more money, we have to find it elsewhere. It is hard-working middle class people of Iberia who support our government. Raising their taxes will be a stab in the back. I guarantee you, Mr. President, that if we do this our own supporters will throw us out at the next election."\n\nFraga knew there was some truth to what de la Fuente was saying. The traditional middle class base of the Alianza Popular wanted to see less taxes, not more, and support for the government would atrophy as a result. But the economists had been quite clear to him in his briefings on the economic state of the country: Either raise taxes, or face oblivion. Either way, he would have to once again wade into the debate and take a side."

 IBR.5410.d:0 "Licinio de la Fuente had dealt with many strikes. Such was the job of the Minister of Labour. And though he had been a Falangist in his youth, experience had now taught him that a softer hand was necessary in such situations. Driving the unions underground during the old regime of the Caudillos had only made matters worse, inflaming radicalism and posing the interests of the state against those of the working man. That is why he had been pushing for labour reform in the Alianza Popular government, trying to convince President Manuel Fraga to support his changes. So far he had experienced some success. The unions were no longer underground, and he could negotiate openly with their leaders, yet just enough of the restrictions from the old days remained that the state usually had the upper hand. Just how he liked it.\n\nBut the Oil Crisis and now the Public Sector Strike had ruined his plans. Forced to implement sweeping privatization programs in health, education, and even welfare and pensions to raise emergency revenue and cut down on bloated public spending, the government had now triggered one of the largest public sector strikes in Iberian history with tens of thousands of public sector workers demanding a reversal of the privatization scheme and the restoration of government funding.\n\nAs he sat in his office preparing to meet with the union leadership, de la Fuente tossed up his options. He could tell the unions they would not be getting a deal, and push ahead with his orders to enforce the privatization. He would almost certainly have to deploy the Civil Guard to crush the strike.\n\nOr, he could get on the phone right now and call the President. Up until now Fraga had respected his remit on labour issues. More importantly, Franga himself, while deeply worried about the economic crisis, seemed more concerned with avoiding further rifts within the government. De la Fuente knew that if he asked Fraga to moderate the privatization scheme, he might just acquiesce, if only to avoid a split. Whatever de la Fuente's choice, he would have to act soon."

The whole nation was in uproar over the oil crisis and the government's austerity program, now culminating in mass protests and a huge public sector strike. Meanwhile the economy was in freefall, unemployment was at an all-time high, and the state was facing financial ruin. If things did not improve, and soon, Manuel Fraga knew that he and his government would be facing catastrophe. Yet in the meantime, support had to be shored up. Speaking directly to the people, as he had done many times before, was his best and last chance.\n\n"Fellow Iberians," he began, addressing his countrymen in his customary manner. "As you are all aware, the country finds itself in the midst of a deep economic crisis the likes of which it has never faced. We in the government are well aware of the suffering this has generated amongst broad layers of the Iberian people.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government has pursued a policy of austerity, to make sure that the state, which protects and provides for all Iberians, continues to be able to function. These measures are temporary, and were employed with the greatest possible reluctance on the behalf of myself and the government. In this time of difficulty and struggle, we must all band together as Iberians, tighten our belts, and make sacrifices for the greater good of the country.\n\n"Many think that the threats to the security and peace of Iberia have disappeared in this time of economic crisis. They have not. Marxian extremism, totalitarian threats from abroad, and seperatist terrorism may yet return to Iberian shores in this period if Iberians do not remain vigilant and united. In the years of democracy we have built a new, modern Iberia. Now I am asking all Iberians to help defend her, to put the needs of the country and community first. If we all do our duty to Iberia and to god, we will weather this crisis and come out of it stronger than ever."

 IBR.5080.d:0 "Terrorism, liberalism, separatism. No one in Iberia could name a worse combination to conspire for the destruction of not just one nation, but an entire peninsula. Since anarchy and chaos are to be avoided at all costs, so too must their fronts. Never will the tendrils of death spread themselves over the Union, provided we play our cards right. In the same league is of liberalism. The adherents are misinformed, brainwashed into something evil by anarchists. Regardless, the how and the why hardly matter, beyond a reason to oppose their cruelty. It has to be handled with great care, in order to ensure the campaign isn't sabotaged. Every good crusade has a specialization, and there are two specializations that are practical for antiliberal use.\n\nThe most obvious path is to eliminate the corruptors at their core, and destroy the spread of influence by removing the people who spread it. This will have to be handled quietly, as any major disappearances could cause a major catastrophe if exposed. Alternatively, the influences could be quelled by a propaganda campaign. If we choose to use propaganda, there is no guarantee that the influence will be effectively countered. However, there would not be as much of a backlash from the campaign.\n\nResources are limited, so there is only the time and budget to do one of the two. The choice needs to be careful. Once a plan is chosen, there will be no going back on it."

The specifics were simple in concept, but creating a robust framework to operate in was challenging. The propaganda would be vast, all-encompassing, and sustained for maximum effectiveness. Only one last hitch remained before finalization: how would this all be directed?\n\nThere is no denying that separatists can draw from areas outside of the regions they claim to represent - more than once has a non-minority been arrested for working with terrorist groups. Are they more of a threat than the minority forces of these groups? The resources behind the propaganda program are limited, and we cannot hit everywhere at once. We can target the individual minority regions, and cut off the main source of the terrorist manpower. If we so wish, the program could be put across Iberia as a whole. While it runs the risk of being less effective, it also provides a justification for having the propaganda elsewhere too."

To do this, the organizations must be destroyed from within, in order to sabotage their effectiveness. However, Where will the infiltration begin? The groups in question have many tendrils, in many separate parts of Iberia. It is disappointing but necessary to realize that the Axencia lacks the resources to combat all of it at once. For anything to get done, attention needs to be honed in on one specific spot.\n\nOf the myriad of facets, there is one in particular that gains the attention of criminals: universities.The impressionable, young minds are perfect for propaganda. If we were to plant agents in undercover areas then we could catch separatists red-handed. A riskier solution is to attempt to break into the terrorist groups themselves, sabotaging them from inside. This may not work, but disrupting them before they can spread disinformation could make the difference. "

 IBR.5083.t:0 "Rebuilding Strength with Propaganda"
 IBR.5083.d:0 "Typically, it takes no special effort to display strength. A few demonstrations here, a showing there, and a little bit of tough words on top. These methods have withered away to nothing. A series of poor moves have delegitimized the strongman stance to the public, and so people have started to take it less seriously. They do not worry, because they do not believe retribution will not be applied to them.\n\nThe change in perception can be reversed by vigorous application of propaganda and other methods of spreading information. It will take time before the flippant disloyalty is corrected, however, and it will take many resources to do so."

With great thrift, they are able to salvage old equipment and keep a remarkably low rate of object disposal. Because of this they do not usually get much attention, because they can work without it. Given recent circumstances, that has changed.\n\nThe thrift which so characterized the Axencia shortly before is gone. On average, they go through more equipment and more men than they have ever before. Since they are still operating on the relative shoestring of a budget they have always had, this means they have taken a nosedive as an effective force. While the new resources sent their way will undoubtedly resolve the issue, there will still be a hitch in operations. That disruption will not go unnoticed."

 IBR.5085.t:0 "Reassuring the People"
 IBR.5085.d:0 "Normally no issue comes from the appropriate use of force. Fear is very adequate - it keeps people cowed, and removes much opposition by making them afraid to act against the government. Sometimes, however, it can go too far. Enforcers can become a bit too zealous, and carry out their duties with more than a little too much pleasure. This is when things go too far. The most pressing motivation to stop this is how it makes the government appear. When an over-use of force isn't reined in, it makes for a very bad look. It makes the administration of the Caudillos seem brutal, cruel, when in reality it is nothing of the sort.\n\nThis sort of happening is nothing new, but what is new about it is the frequency of its happening. It seems that more loose cannons, more shoot-first types have found their way into law enforcement. This will have to be corrected, with no small dose of 'information correction' to back it up, if the government is to maintain meaningful credibility."

It is for this reason they must go, albeit with a heavier heart. Most are simply misled, brought on by their insidious ringleaders. What they want is more difficult to determine, but it can't be good. Liberalism will dissipate and the people will return to their natural way of thinking, if the sources are cut off. To cut off the source, the head of the snake will be removed. This is no snake, however, it is a hydra. Like any hydra, it has multiple heads, and only one head can be cut off at a time.\n\nThe intelligentsia are one of the most troublesome heads of this despicable hydra, and easily the most vocal. Their calls turn the populace away from their benevolent leaders, and silencing those calls will go a long way to bringing back the natural order. The intellectuals are very entrenched, so removing them is certain to cause an uproar. An operation with less risk is to target the downright treasonous elements of the government. These politicians are attempting to bring the Union down from inside its own administration. Removing them will fix any degenerate shifts the government might undertake. As well, they are not as popular as their intellectual cousins. It is also possible to target the terrorists further, who are in cahoots to help push the propaganda onto good citizens.

So far, they have not been able to prepare beyond a basic level, since the Axencia lacks critical details. Namely, how they are to strike.\n\nSeveral general predictions have been drawn up, and the one approved will be what the Axencia uses to stabilize Iberia. The first plan was to use stealth in order to get things done. Accidents, assassinations, and all sorts would be used to eliminate without causing an uproar. While suspicious, it could be effective. Alternatively, others have advocated the use of a velvet glove - force is not strictly necessary, and the targets will realize that. Working with them while also making sure they know of the violence that could be leveled at them could be very effective, making collaborators out of rivals. Finally, some advocate for making an example out of dissidents. With the fear of reprisal, none will dare act out."

Guillermo had been tipped off about his imminent removal by the Axencia, and so devised what would have been the perfect way to cause a scene. His supporters would gather, and try to obstruct the authorities. The scene would force them to be ruthless, just as Guillermo had hoped, which would bring his cause to the light. He probably would have been made a martyr, but it would have been a victory nonetheless.\n\nThe politician clung to the hope that somebody would come to his aid, even as the chance for it dwindled to nothing.

He finds his voice with a simple clear of the throat, booming out a tone few elders would have in depth and confidence.\n\n"I have... have brought myself here to you all today because I wish to address the Iberian Council." The effort strains him, but he finds himself using his arms, gesturing wildly as he had years ago.\n"Their dedication is truly commendable. Their help is one that has proven invaluable. Iberians!" He snaps, a crescendo of volume piercing through his earlier speech, just as quickly gone.\n"Do not ever forget the qualities of these patriots! The merits of the council are those that you must aspire to! Loyalty, commitment, morality... always, always keep these in your hearts."\n\nAs the Caudillo moves off stage, his voice fatigued from a long and formidable speech, he is given a farewell of applause. It is accentuated by a boisterous chant: Viva Iberia!"

 IBR.719.t:0 "A Special Meeting Regarding the Council"
 IBR.719.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, many members of the Council found themselves with a particular letter in their mailboxes, printed yellow and red and green and many more colors, but those three in particular. This meant only one thing: someone wanted their attention, and that letter contained the reason why.\n\nAs it turned out, there was a very important reason. The Caudillos had a meeting prepared, one to address a particular issue which had come up suddenly. It wasn't a scheduled meeting, because the problem was so sudden that it had to be addressed immediately. The time and date were included, and with it the bait was set. Anyone who wasn't already notified was to be notified by their peers, if at all possible. At the most dire, this situation may even require some more power for the Council to help solve it.\n\nThe chamber of deputies was particularly renovated, with a new coat of paint and new furnishings too. Well guarded, it looked to be a comfortable, easy meeting."
 IBR.719.a:0 "Welcome All!"

 IBR.720.t:0 "A Very Long Meeting"
 IBR.720.d:0 "Things looked to drag on for ages. A Caudillo would present an issue, discuss it with his cohort, then pose it to the council. Like a crank, each part of the council moved an issue back and forth, back and forth, in a seemingly endless motion. In an endless cycle of bickering, arguing, and all-but-brawls, a united consensus would come of something. It was muddled, indecisive, and frequently did not entirely address what they were set out to be. Not to say that everyone participated in such a scheme, but those seemed to frequently lose the tug-of-war with those in it for the money and those who took an unusual happiness in throwing a wrench into the process. They were so engrossed in their debates, in fact, that nobody seemed to notice the guards locking the doors.\n\nSomeone turned to leave, enraged by some comment angled in his direction. He tried the doors, and attempted to open them even harder when they did not open. The council member was prepared to argue with a guard nearby attempting to shoo him back to his seat. Seemingly out of patience, the guard simply knocked the man to the floor with a blow from the stock of his rifle. The thud caught the attention of many, slowly suffocating the noise in the room.\n\nCaetano chuckled, age never dulling the feeling of a good scheme. Franco spoke to those assembled, his voice booming through the room.\n"It was so helpful of you all to attend! We are going to fix the problems in Iberia, and you are going to help us. We are going to stay here until then. So...""
 IBR.720.a:0 ""...I hope you all are prepared for a very, very long meeting.""

 IBR.721.t:0 "Addressing Real Problems"
 IBR.721.d:0 "With the doors locked, armed guards watching every entrance, and the groaning pile of a man dragged back to slump in his seat, the Council found themselves the hostages of men so old they belonged better in a museum. Franco continued speaking.\n\n"There will be no food, no water, and even if it means the deaths of you all, there will be a working plan before we leave this room. So! I would advise you all to stop cowering, and start brainstorming."\n\nSuffice to say, they were much more talkative after the Caudillo's advisory. An issue was presented, discussed, and questioned. It was like a tug-of-war, but now both sides were tugging. The Caudillos would present a problem, the Council would suggest solutions, and attempt to hold them up under scrutiny. The Council would present a problem, and the Caudillos would present solutions. It was rigorous and exhausting, but everyone seemed willing to step up and brave it.\n\nIt was the next day before the Caudillos seemed satisfied, with a prepared document so thick that it seemed a paperweight, and so heavy that an aide had to carry it. The finishing signatures were met with claps of delight by Franco, as Caetano stepped up to say a few words."

 ###Congress Tree Events (Fate of the Council)###
 
 IBR.5100.t:0 "Conservatives Raise Concerns"
 IBR.5100.d:0 "Those whom are defined as Conservatives in our political establishment have rather loudly raised their concerns towards the speed of the reforms that have grasped Iberian political society. Writing to the Caudillos personally, head honchos from the old guard stated clearly and concisely their anxieties toward what is currently taking place in the nation.\n\nBelieving that the "breakneck reformation will allow for the scourge of liberalism and even worse communism to once again flow in Iberia", the old guard Conservatives have written a rather impassioned plea that also states that "the change that is occurring on all fronts threatens not only the political existence of our regime but also the very future of Iberia. We write as a collective to give you our genuine advice that this process may very well destroy everything we have worked so hard to build. This process could lead to a catastrophic turn of events that would tear Iberia apart from the inside. Please do not let his happen."\n\nA stirring letter it may have been, but we still hold the real power in Iberia and we can choose to dismiss the concerns of these vestiges if need be. Or we could also pay heed to their opinions and give them a promise to listen further to their advice."
 IBR.5100.a:0 "We share their concerns"
 IBR.5100.b:0 "These ideas are unfounded"
 
 IBR.5101.t:0 "A Letter of Approval"
 IBR.5101.d:0 "The figures that make up the old guards have seemingly rejoiced at our response that we will listen closely to their concerns and will take them on board. Once again writing to ourselves they have wrote up a pleasant and congratulatory letter that praises our decision.\n\nIn a jubilant letter, co-signed by the major old guard figures, the conservatives have stated\n"To our humble Caudillos, we give our most grateful thanks that you have decided to pay attention to your oldest and most thankful supporters. It is extremely pleasing to hear that you take our concerns about the future of Iberia seriously and will see to it that the fifth column and the agents of chaos won't bring ruin to the nation through this process. You can count on us to help in any way we can to see to it that a great calamity does not occur. We shall gratefully give you our support and you can rest easy that no further complaints will arise should the current situation be kept."\n\nEvidently it seems that conservative support of the government has increased. We may need to count on these men should trouble arise further down the line."
 IBR.5101.a:0 "We have listened to our oldest and wisest supporters, if anyone knows best its them"
 
 IBR.5102.t:0 "The Mutterings of Disapproval"
 IBR.5102.d:0 "With our blatant disregard of the conservatives quite frankly in our eyes unfounded notions, we have received no further written letters begging for us to listen to the old guard. Nor have we also been sent a letter decrying that we have "betrayed the very ideals that Iberia and its governance was built on" or any other such rubbish. These men know better than to further directly challenge our authority, it was ourselves after all who stopped the renegade Falange some time ago, but that doesn't mean they will not scheme against us. These dinosaurs of yesteryear may not look like much but they are heavily experienced in the political game. Some noise is likely to be created amongst the most zealous and hard-line in the faction but the rest will likely bide their time, waiting for an opportunity to trample on the process.\n\nIt is quite likely that we will not be able to rely heavily upon the conservatives as their support for the process dips with their lack of faith in us. Whether this vitriol will remain the tantrums of old men or morph into something far more seditious and dangerous remains to be seen. What is known however, is that the old guard is not happy and likely won't take this decision lying down."
 IBR.5102.a:0 "Let them wallow in their own self pity, just make sure they don't do something actually dangerous"
 
 IBR.5103.t:0 "The Regional Debate"
 IBR.5103.d:0 "Perhaps the most contentious issue in the process is the issue of separatism. Basque, Galicians, Catalans etc. all have made the claims for nationhood and have sometimes used violence as a means to achieve their goals. The history of this issue is seemingly everlasting, it has become ingrained beneath the very skin of Iberia. Many have died fighting for and against the ideals of the separatists but a radical option of paying heed to the separatists is now available. So too, is the option to shut them out once again.\n\nOn the one hand, listening to the separatists and giving them a real Special Regions programme would perhaps allow for the future of Iberia to remain stable and whole in the end. Terrorism would hopefully eventually cease and the needs of these people will be placated within a deal we could hopefully reach with them. On the other hand, giving any sort of leniency to their demands may set the dominoes off and foresee to the balkanisation of Iberia. Whatever decision we make we are bound to upset someone. But we must do whatever's best for the future of Iberia so disaster does not strike in these world changing times."
 IBR.5103.a:0 "These regions will be heard"
 IBR.5103.b:0 "Even in this transition, Spain is one"
 
 IBR.5104.t:0 "The Placating of the Separatist"
 IBR.5104.d:0 "It once seemed like a pipe dream that the Caudillos would even consider notions of regionalism in the nation of Iberia or even in the previous nations of Spain and Portugal. Time and time again the despots, the monarchs and the governors of Iberia's past had ruthlessly crushed separatist dreams. In response the separatists turned to politics by way of the gun and a seemingly everlasting cycle of violence began to grip Iberia. Now, however, the cycle may just be starting to crumble.\n\nWith a promise of listening to the regionalists and considering their demands for a real Special Regions programme, the separatist movements have now been forced to take the process seriously. A real breakthrough may arise from this, it has been enough to make any hard-line separatist zealot think twice about any would-be terrorist attack. While the issue is certainly not been put to bed, a clear expression of confidence in the process has been given by the regionalists. By proxy, this means some confidence has also been given to this governance.\n\nHowever, this decision may come at cost. There are many in Iberia who would rather die than see the nation break up into pieces. Indeed, some may believe that this olive branch to separatism will hasten this. Of course, this is nothing but the delusions of staunch paranoia but we must be weary. Not only of the separatists but of those within our own governance as well."
 IBR.5104.a:0 "A weary start, but a start nonetheless"
 
 IBR.5105.t:0 "The Fire and Fury of the Separatist Menace"
 IBR.5105.d:0 "Iberia is one indivisible and eternal nation. There will be no entertaining of separatist notions that would lead to certain doom. This goes double for the treacherous separatists in Spain who once worked as a heathenish Bolshevik fifth column. We have not forgotten their treachery and to placate them now would let them simply bite the hand that feeds. Its simple, you give these deserters an inch and they'll take a mile. We completely and utterly reject their demands that would have seen Iberia crumple into a failed state.\n\nThis has of course not gone down too well with the separatists who were sticking their neck out talking to the government in the first place. Now it seems we're back to the usual cycle of terror. The more militant and radical elements of the various separatist movements have apparently been "proven right" by our response and more attacks are likely to follow. Let them come we say, for we have faced them down once before and will do so again. The separatist may cry and stomp their feet but they will not tear apart this great nation. We, with all our might, shall see to it."
 IBR.5105.a:0 "Like a rabid dog, the separatist must be put down"
 
 IBR.5106.t:0 "Technocrats Appeal to the Congress"
 IBR.5106.d:0 "With the process chugging along, the technocrats aligned with the Opus Dei organization have sent out a plea wishing for the furthering of their involvement in the process. Believing that the process apparently needs a "qualified voice" to speak up on certain matters, they have sent in a number of proposals that they seek to bring to the table. One such proposal they are particularly pushing is the improvement of civil liberties for Iberians.\n\nOn the outset, these proposals seem all well and good but God knows what these people are truly after. One thing this process cannot allow for is the fifth column to arise once again. It occurred once before and it took the strength of an entire nation and a sea of blood to stop the fifth column antagonist. That being said, it could be worth placating these people if we are to embark on real reform in Iberia. These technocrats could certainly prove to be a key part of the process if we are to take them, and their proposals, on board."
 IBR.5106.a:0 "This process needs their input"
 IBR.5106.b:0 "The Opus Dei should not be involved"
 
 IBR.5107.t:0 "A Technocrats Triumph"
 IBR.5107.d:0 "With Opus Dei's involvement in the process, the dynamics of Iberian political society have clearly changed. Socio-economic liberalism has seemingly been given the all clear, now the floodgates are open for the rest of Opus Dei's proposals. The decision to take in Opus Dei and their opinions has caused no shortage of hoo-ha amongst the more conservative sections of Iberian political society. This matters little though, for the process requires the means of all qualified voices in Iberia. The Opus Dei are to be welcomed on board and bring a hopefully healthy element to the Congress.\n\nThe Opus Dei have of course been nothing but grateful of the opportunity provided to them by the Iberian government. This gratefulness has been showcased by their entrenchment of support for not only the process but also the government as well. The technocrats will certainly have to prove their usefulness as the Congress will soon evolve into its most crucial stages. In any case it is hoped that the technocratic expressors will bring something new and fresh to the table."
 IBR.5107.a:0 "The fresh thinking of technocracy shall bring Iberia back from the brink"
 
 IBR.5108.t:0 "Liberalism Combatted"
 IBR.5108.d:0 "The rejection of Opus Dei and their proposals has not gone unnoticed. Both conservatives and reformers have seen our decision as indicative of our intentions for the Congress but in reality, it was something more than that. For it was obvious to everyone what the Opus Dei's proposals of so called "civil liberties" and their hoity-toity pretensions of qualifications actually meant. This technocracy is simply the scourge of uncontrolled liberalism disguised and thus, the Opus Dei have been put in their place once more.\n\nThis calculated decision has not gone without its consequences though. Any hopes the Opus Dei had in the government and the process has been slashed considerably. Any support we could count on from the technocrats has near evaporated but, we have done what we must to keep Iberia safe and secure from the ills of liberalism once again. We make no apologies and Opus Dei should now hopefully know better than to get considerably involved in matters that in actuality know little about."
 IBR.5108.a:0 "Tramp the dirt down on technocracy"
 
 IBR.5109.t:0 "The Armed Forces Role"
 IBR.5109.d:0 "The situation in Iberia today is far removed from the past and these testing times have clearly influenced Iberian political society. For example, it has become a common belief within certain sections of the Iberian government that the nation is under an existential threat from the forces of terrorism. It has been alleged that Bolsheviks and separatists have ran rampant in the recent past, beseeching our great nation with the horrors of urban warfare. There has thus been a clear worry that the current process will not only not stop the terrorist threat, but also increase it as instability grows in the nation. It is through this worry that the military and its most staunch supports have stepped into the limelight.\n\nThe military very clearly want to have a voice in the current ongoing debates. They, of course, claim they only wish to do so in order to stave off the threats of instability and terrorism. The more cynical amongst us however, deem that they only wish to do so in order to keep hold of their power and stop any sort of reform to the armed forces. Their intentions certainly seem to be wholly political rather than mere love for the nation, Iberia of course having a clear history of military involvement in political affairs. This occasion seems no different but we could put a stop to their meddling in an obvious showcase of our commitment to reform. That being said, capitulation to the armed forces may be necessary in order to stop any separatist threat or leftist plot."

 IBR.5109.b:0 "Rein them in for the time being"
 
 IBR.5110.t:0 "A Very Liberal Indignation"
 IBR.5110.d:0 "Our agreement with the armed forces has clearly rattled some feathers in the Iberian Congress. The more liberal elements amongst us have kicked up an almighty storm in the debates that such an apparently "craven" deal could be struck with the alleged "authoritarian despots whom have next to no regard for democracy". Resignations and walkouts soon followed after the tantrums which all had one clear message. A glaring lack of faith in this government to deliver any "meaningful" democratic reforms.\n\nBut why should we pay heed to these flabby and naive liberals. It would seem from this kicking and screaming that the liberals would rather our nation succumb to socialism, separatism and subjugation than to give the armed forces a deserved role. These men are amongst the most principle among us. They bravely did what was necessary once before to send to Bolshevik menace packing and put separatist notions back in their desired place. So sure, the liberals may be unhappy with our decision but the nation will be thankful for our decision to bring the heroic military fully on board."
 IBR.5110.a:0 "Our brave boys come before any limp liberal"
 
 IBR.5111.t:0 "An Antagonistic Army"
 IBR.5111.d:0 "The decision to so blatantly tell the army and its political backers that they are not needed nor wanted in the political process has went about as well as could be expected with the military and its supporters. Incensed that such a snub could occur, the army has "expressed its deep disappointment that such a decision was taken" but so far that has been all they have done. They have been clearly stopped where they thought they could succeed; the yes men of previous administrations have evidently made them arrogant towards us. Now that they have been told no, like an opulent child they cry out against the rational choice. They will now need to reconfigure but this gives us more than enough time to figure out how to truly sap their power if need be through this process.\n\nHowever, this decision has also irked the military's conservative backers who have likewise expressed a definite voice of a lack of confidence in ourselves and the process. It's plain to see they don't have what it takes to stop Iberia from falling in on itself, so latched onto a past that no longer exists, but it matters little. The process shall go on with no insidious meddling from the armed forces."
 IBR.5111.a:0 "The army shall know its place in this new Iberia"
 
 IBR.5112.t:0 "Broadcasting the Debates?"
 IBR.5112.d:0 "A question has remained ever present throughout this whole process, it teeters on every meeting and talk that has so far been held. Precisely what is democracy and what should it entail? Well certain liberal adherents believe it entails one key feature. The people and their input. In order to envision a truly democratic reformation process, it has been recommended that the final debates should be broadcast to the whole public to show transparency and a genuine commitment to democracy. All in Iberia, be they rich or poor, Spanish or Portuguese, conservative or liberal will be able to watch the most important debates and no doubt voice their opinion towards the results.\n\nThis huge spectacle could have drastic ramifications. While it may show the government has faith in its people and shows an attempt at making a connection with them, it could also cost us dearly. Should the debates go smoothly we have little to worry about, but if they end in disaster then God knows what the consequences will be from the public. Instability is already too high and this just might push Iberia over the edge. We could keep the debates behind closed doors as a precaution but this may also give off signs to our true feelings towards this process."

 IBR.5113.t:0 "Iberians Eagerly Await the Final Debates"
 IBR.5113.d:0 "For the first time it what seemed like centuries, posters and leaflets were seen throughout Iberia that was not just Falangist propaganda or pro-regime material. It was a callout, a mass marketing campaign unlike anything seen in Iberia before. Walls, lampposts and shops all had them on display. It was a message to the whole of Iberia that perhaps the most important event in its history was about to take place. People first whispered about it, somewhat in disbelief, and then they began to shout about it. For the Iberian Congress was about to broadcast its final debates to the entire nation for all of the public to see.\n\nTo those born in the Caudillos Iberia, the proposal seemed foreign and alien yet exciting. A new development that would give a leashed public a legal voice in the proceedings of the nation. To those much older who had seen a society much different from that of Iberia today, there was cynicism but some couldn't help but be optimistic. Maybe, just maybe this could be the real deal. The outcome could be a hopeful one, one that helps stop Iberia's decimation. After all, it appears to be partly in the hands of the people now does it not?"

Decades long ramifications may occur from these debates going one way or another. All will be decided as the council convenes for this great meeting.\n\nAmong the councilmen ranked the most important players in the ongoing political process. The highest esteemed representatives from the technocrats, liberals, conservatives, army and regionalists have gathered to shape the future of an entire nation. We have come too far and sacrificed too much for this great day to descend into petty squabbling, for all of Iberia is counting on this Council to deliver something that would stop the bloody decline of Iberia. Iberia has seen itself through violent separatism, civil war, treachery, public strife, the Bolshevik and German menace but it could slip up now and forever remain a shell of its former self. It is up to this council now to guarantee this great tragedy does not occur."

 IBR.5115.d:0 "As the representatives of the Iberian council toil away at the reformation progress, one proposal has surprisingly enough been pushed with some success. Led, directed and whipped into action by the technocratic faction of the Council, a proposal for the strengthening of civil liberties has found its way at the forefront of debate proceedings. Opus Dei's liberal allies have helped along with this process which could change the very nature of the future Iberian regime. For decades the nation has been ruled by strongmen and their hegemonic grasp on civil society. Now, that power could be broken as the right of the individual look to be ratified under these reforms.\n\nThe reforms are no doubt drastic, a total overhaul of the former principles of Iberian civil society. The reforms are sure to find their antagonists in the army and the conservatives but for now the reforms seem to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. If the current proceedings occur without and hiccups, then the technocrats and their allies will have accomplished a remarkable victory with this legislation."

 IBR.5116.d:0 "As with nearly every important thing in life, necessity is key. And my fellow Iberians, is it really necessary to embark on such a wide ranging and tiresome debacle on civil liberty reform? Would it not be so, that this complete uprooting and overhaul of Iberian civil society would leave us weak to the scourges of separatism and the fifth column threat? The Council it seems is certainly of this same opinion, with an agreement recently being reached concluding that there is no need to quickly make any sweeping changes in regard to civil liberties. The antagonism of the conservatives and the army would no doubt have reached dangerous heights if the Council as to embark on such an all-encompassing reform. Drastic measures are to be left aside as compromise, it is hoped, will be the theme of the debates.\n\nOf course, certain liberals and Opus Dei sympathizers do not quite see the drafting of these scaled back reforms the same way as the majority of the Council. There are cries of a deliberate shut down at an attempt of real reform and the scuttling of a chance for Iberia to become a new society. This view though is as utopian as it is naïve, these liberals are far too narrow sighted to see the larger threat any drastic reform could deliver to Iberia's doorstep.

The militarists have made their contempt known, citing that the proposals from Opus Dei and their allies will make Iberia unsafe. Clearly wishing to play on the threats from Bolshevism and separatism, the army have stated that they would be unable to fight off the dangers to Iberian society. It soon became clear as the heat rose in the Council that with every utterance the militarists made against the proposal, the less chance any sort of compromise could be reached.\n\nThe technocrats fought back against the accusations, defending their proposals and stating that the militarists "only sought to keep a stranglehold on their despotic power of Iberia". With the debate raging on, it soon became clear to all those who saw that the Council was marred by factionalism.

 IBR.5118.d:0 "The attempted push for civil liberty reforms, pursued by the technocratic councilmen, has been met with an immediate negative reaction from the more conservative inclined members of the Council. The conservatives have been brutal in their condemnation of the reforms, stating in heated hustings that the proposals "go against everything Iberia stands for" and "is the sort of treacherous liberalism that would tear this nation apart and subdue it under an unpatriotic ideology". The liberals have held their ground in the proceedings though, coming straight back at the conservatives and condemning them as "tired-out tyrants only looking to keep the Iberian people down and themselves afloat". At one point the debate looked so viscous, it was a surprise chairs were not thrown between the two competing sides.\n\nIn the end, there appears to be a considerable amount of pushback from sections of the Iberian pollical class against these reforms. While the reforms are apparently intended to simply improve the lives of the everyday Iberian, their perception as the work of fifth column liberalism by opposing factions has created a clear schism on the Council."

 IBR.5119.d:0 "A couple of years ago, it would have been unthinkable for what is currently occurring in the Council to actually transpire. For decades, the people of Iberia and their political representatives have scapegoated separatism to an nth degree. They have long called out against the fifth column element of sinful separatism, naming it as one of the biggest dangers to the nation. This paranoia has previously led to the lack of any self-determination or minority representation in the Iberian sate. This though, could be about to change.\n\nWith the usage of their cunning political skills and dextrous tactics, the regionalist faction in the Council have managed to gain sizeable momentum behind their attempts to pursue a Special Regions programme. The programme would result in a real and new change for the Iberian political system, with far greater autonomy being granted to Iberia's minority regions. The success of the regionalists can surely be attributed to their strong connection to the dreams of autonomy. While some still say they pursue a hidden agenda of fully-fledged separatism and the disintegration of Iberia; this has not been shown in the Council as the Special Regions programme looks set to be passed."

The reasoning was the same as it had been the last hundred times. The capitulation to any form of regionalist demands would put the future of the Iberia at risk. It would be a surrender to the terrorist pest, it would see the emboldening of political violence and it would be the end of a project we worked so hard to build and make a reality.\n\nIt soon became all too clear to the majority of the Council that the regionalists had a hidden agenda of unabridged separatism and their proposals of a so called "Special Regions" programme needed to be shot down with haste. However, the regionalists and their wishes could not be just disregarded at will. This is a new Iberia after all. So, it was the Council's preference that token autonomy would be the solution to the minority question. This was of course a rather vague and unenthusiastic proposal that may well be seen through but it was decided that this was far superior to giving in to the regionalists and their alleged fifth column thought."

 IBR.5121.d:0 "Many had feared what would happen to the debates once the question of regionalism was brought up. Many in the Iberian political system have long held staunch opinions about the nature of minority representation and what the placating of such demands could mean for the future of the nation. Any previously comradely discussion in the debates would be eviscerated and forgotten about if clashes arose over allegations of separatism and tyranny. This, it appeared, was precisely what happened when the militarists gave their response to the regionalists proposals.\n\nThe militarist reply was lengthy, brutal and uncompromising. Militarist, after militarist, arose to shout down the regionalists calling them "terrorist sympathizers" and "the hideous face of separatist treachery, hidden behind a suit and tie". Man, after man, gave speeches that stated that "Iberia would never give in to terrorism" that "the nation would remain strong in the face of separatist terror" and "would smash down the terrorist instead of succumbing to it".\n\nThe regionalists were, of course, appalled by these allegations and threatened a walk out due to the tirades of the militarist faction. It seemed as though we were an inch away from the dismantling of the Council and it was only when tempers calmed that a split was avoided. Clearly it seems the Council has some work to do to make sure the question can be answered without resulting in some irreversible political damage."

 IBR.5122.d:0 "The proposals of the regionalists have clearly struck a nerve with elements of the Iberian political establishment. Among the groups it has most raised the ire of is, unsurprisingly, the conservatives. With the discussion of the apparent regionalist proposal of a "Special Regions" programme coming to an end, the conservatives would have one last say before the end of the proceedings. These final states would, as it turns out, scupper any remaining hopes of a functional debate over the regionalist question.\n\nThe conservatives clambered up to speak their minds with little care for what the regionalists thought. In a brazen statement to the rest of the Council, the conservative faction voiced that the proposed reforms are completely unacceptable because Iberia is only the union of two countries and there cannot be any real special status for other "groups". With complete disregard for the demands of the regionalists, the conservatives stated that "Iberia is indivisible and immortal and will not play into the hands of little pests with grandeurs of nationhood."\n\nAs was expected, the statement received an immediate kickback from the regionalists who called the conservatives out over there "blatantly offensive and callous remarks". With this event, any notions about a helpful and healthy debate over regionalism can be disregarded. For it has been shown for all to see that the debate has showcased a problematic dynamic in the Council that, if not put to bed soon, could end in imminent failure."

Instead what transpired was the making of a solid reformist consensus that looks to usher in an era of newfound optimism in Iberia.\n\nThe streets, for the first time in what seemed like an entire generation, were packed out with hearty celebration of freedom and hope. The young and old had come out together, raising the flag of the Iberian Union with renewed pride. The more conservative inclined Iberians conceded a defeat here but not in a way that sort to sow division in Iberia. There was to be, for now at least, no dramatic kneejerk and instead it looked as though there had been consent given to the results of the debates.\n\nA real, great and hopefully everlasting accomplishment had transpired here. With it, it looks like a new dawn is to arise for Iberia. In a world of darkness and despair, now is the chance for Iberia to set itself apart from the rest as a beacon of hope."

The forces of instability, the wreckers of law and order, would have seized upon the opportunity and cast our nation into the depths of oblivion. Some incremental change has occurred, needed to save our nation for belligerence, but we have needed to be slow and steady in our reformation. One day, perhaps Iberia could go through some kind of seismic sudden change, but the time is not right. The nation must hold together as the world around us plunges into confusion and the process we have set ourselves on shall take as long as it need be. For now, we hold the line and this is precisely what the public shall know from these debates.\n\nThe achieved consensus that was broadcasted to the nation was met with a general amount of content. Sure, some naïve dreamers may have been disappointed by the results but the majority were just happy to see Iberia set on course to survive. The nation would endure, at no risk of instability causing unadulterated destruction. With the reaching of a consensus, it looks as though now the stability of our nation can be further secured and the public now have faith in us to accomplish this. It is up to us now to steady the course and hold the line to keep Iberia strong."

The results were, unfortunately, less than spectacular. While the friction in the debates was not exactly overwhelming, it was still enough to undermine any sort of strong consensus that was hoped to be established.\n\nMany in Iberia would have hoped for a solid vision to emerge at the end of these debates but with a lack of agreement in certain key areas, the results are less than pleasant. It is unfortunate that the chance for change or consensus was not truly grasped here but we must plod on, for it is the future of our nation at stake here.\n\nWe may not of got our desired outcome from the debates but Iberia and its government will need to endure. These are testing times and to give in now would be an act of great treachery. The results may have been disappointing but they have not condemned us to ruin yet. We shall go on, and hope to establish a future solid consensus somewhere later down the line."

It seemed as though after decades in political purgatory, Iberia could re-emerge from these debates as a fresh forward-thinking ideal, that could unite people in its spirit.\n\nThis, to say the least, has not occurred. In fact, quite the opposite has befallen upon Iberia. We have been made to look like coños in front of all our people. The constant bickering, the blatantly unhealthy clashes and the lack of anything even resembling a consensus has stifled any hopes that this process first brought about. A clear lack of any sort of resolution has been emphasised by critics of the talks, along with the constant fighting that accompanied the debate proceedings. Now, the message being passed around the public is one of failure and disdain. It seems the incompetence displayed here has made the public even question our legitimacy not only to pass change, but to even keep Iberia stable.\n\nThe lack of any clear vision for Iberia's future is deeply concerning yet we must find a way to press on. A different strategy is needed and new ways of thinking may have to emerge or confidence in the Iberian mission could fall to a dramatic point. Press on we shall, but we now have quite the hurdle to overcome."

 ##Honor The Family
 IBR.689.t:0 "The Madrid Families Festival"
 IBR.689.d:0 "An unfortunate fact of the modern world is that many, even within Iberia, have forgotten the importance of a morally righteous family. To help remedy this issue, a great festival was organized in Madrid, celebrating the Iberian family. It seems to have worked, too - crowds of thousands attended, from Madrid and areas across the country. The festival began in the early morning, with all present taking part in a great mass dedicated to the concept of the family, and of its virtues. The schedule was designed to resemble the cycle of life, and to that end the first third of the event - from morning to noon - was dedicated to the children of Iberia.\n\nChildren played games and activities designed for their amusement, all while being lectured on their importance to the country. The parents were not left out, and were able to pass the time by taking advice on the best kinds of "family equipment" to raise children with.\n\nThe midday was directed to the parents, with several hours of speeches about the importance of their role in the family. There weren't enough guest speakers to cover the entire time, so most had to draw their speeches out as long as possible.\n\nFinally, the ceremony came to an end with a celebration of the elders. After stressing the importance of respect for one's elders, the most important elders of all - the Caudillos - personally performed the closing ceremony."
 IBR.689.a:0 "It is remarkable, how such a small bond can cause such great things."
 
 ##Glorify Womens' Roles 
 IBR.691.t:0 "Iberian Woman Appreciation Day"
 IBR.691.d:0 "A woman must fulfill her roles in society, for a society to function. They were noble jobs, and to help emphasize their importance and nobility, it was decided that an entire day be dedicated to the appreciation of a woman's importance to society.\n\nThe main bulk of the event was organized through the efforts of the Sección Femenina, with Pilar Primo de Rivera leading the event in Spain and Cecilia Supico Pinto representing it in Portugal. The event was celebrated by recollection, contemplation, and faith. Speeches were delivered by the government representatives in each city in the Union, planned to give two final ones in Madrid and Lisbon respectively. Special masses were held in cities across Iberia, where the priests were able to explain the importance of the women's role in bearing and rearing children, securing the next generation of citizens.\n\nThe festivities were cut short when several self-proclaimed 'feminist organizations' started marches in cities across the union, ruining the celebrations through disruption. Even though most protests were successfully halted by police actions, the protests in Madrid and Lisbon proved volatile enough to necessitate evacuating both representatives."
 IBR.691.a:0 "Such a nice day! Not even the protests could change that." 
 
 ##Maintain The Social Window
 IBR.5130.t:0 "Hierarchy and Society"
 IBR.5130.d:0 "Society requires a hierarchy. Human nature dictates that there must be a pyramid at the center of every state - at the top the leaders, and below them the decreasing rank and increasing size of the lower classes. This is how any good state functions, and Iberia is no exception. In order to show our appreciation for these natural laws, we must incorporate them into many of our daily actions. The only question is how.\n\nThe degree to which we recognize the fundamental laws of hierarchy will make a great difference. If we desire to have more heavy-handed dealings, we may enforce this idea formally. If not, then we may simply encourage the populace to follow it while doing so ourselves."
 IBR.5130.a:0 "The aim of this state is to reinforce them"

 IBR.5131.d:0 "The Opus Dei has once more petitioned our government to pursue economic reform. Their incessant requests have turned out to be rather persuasive, and regardless of if it was out of a desire to quiet them down or of genuine conviction, a not-insignificant amount of the government has turned out in support of their economic reforms.\n\nThe Opus Dei, backed by their government benefactors, wish for us to move away from our policy of economic autarky and instead conduct a decisive shift to a more open free market model. Should we listen to them? They have drafted a plan to make a gradual change to their preferred economic model, but for all their posturing we still don't have to oblige them."

 ##Release The Pressure
 IBR.5132.t:0 "Restructuring Unfair Systems"
 IBR.5132.d:0 "While some things are not actually problems, it would be downright stupid to assume that there are no problems within Iberia. Taking these smokescreens and assuming they are the case for every reported issue would be a straight line to the death of Iberia. The minority regions of Iberia face problems and unjustified oppression, rooting from issues designed to suppress them as a people. These systems will need to go.\n\nIn order to make sure the minorities do not get preferential treatment, we will need to determine the extent to which these systems need to be revised. We could probably relieve most of the anger against the government by some token funding, though some more may help keep the complaints away better."

 ##Walk The Line
 IBR.5133.t:0 "Toning Down the Rhetoric"
 IBR.5133.d:0 "Look at our older speeches, of the language used, of the way the documents refer to things. Our language is causing problems. The way the Caudillos speak in public appearances, the way the state press prints reports, above all else it is inflammatory. This tone inspires unrest, as it creates the perception that we are wholly uncaring of their presence.\n\nIf we were to drop this language, then governing the country will likely become easier. We will find many more agents and supporters where we would have once alienated them. Would it be better to drop this language entirely? It would be more work for a benefit that would be around the same as just cutting some of it, which would force less change onto the status quo."

 ##Find Out What They Want
 IBR.5134.t:0 "Results of the Investigation"
 IBR.5134.d:0 "After much delay, corruption, and red tape - all of which is now resolved, for the investigation's sake - the investigation into the minority regions was finally completed. We took careful polls and encouraged that opinions be submitted, and carefully compiled them into various categories of complaints or opinions. Once we had filtered out the low-quality or obviously terrorist poll responses, the results were, to put it lightly, less-than-ideal.\n\nWith their wants and desires firmly on record, we can start to take actions to resolve them. However, the question still stands about how much we should hold ourselves to these resolutions. If we are totally set on fixing the issues, publishing the findings publicly would serve as a motivator, as they would expect us to fix them all. Were we to keep the results private, then we could do as much as we please and call it the necessary amount. "

 IBR.5135.d:0 "The radio crackles to life. The man on the other end, in a voice so monotone it would take practice-honed talent, announces the beginning of a speech. The Caudillos had something to say, and it was urgent enough that it could not wait to be scheduled. With this in mind, most of Iberia had tuned in to listen to the two leaders speak.\n\n"Citizens of Iberia," spoke the two men, their voices so alike once they spoke together. "We have decided that, following careful discussion, we are no longer simply Caudillos. We have been named the presidents of the Iberian Council, a position which we additionally will hold until further notice."\n\nThe Presidents spoke some more, sometimes swapping the speaking position, of topics that were far less related. Finally, they finished. With the long announcement concluded, everyone present in Iberia found themselves forming an opinion. When everything was said and done..."

 ##Localize the Legislatures
 #you get this event if you've already been a bit nice to minorities
 IBR.5136.t:0 "Power to the Regions"
 IBR.5136.d:0 "At the time, it seemed like centralizing the bureaucracy in the two capitals of Iberia - Madrid and Lisbon - was an excellent idea. There was a Union to be kept together, after all, so why wouldn't the heads need to know what the arms were doing? As it turns out, trying to figure out what all the arms were doing, our many flailing arms, has caused Iberia no small amount of grief. The bureaucracy is frequently swamped, and trying to keep up with the many requests piled on it has caused it to fail to actually accomplish anything in a reasonable time.\n\nBecause of this, decentralization is our best option. If we were to hand more powers to the provinces, they could handle their day-to-day affairs on their own, as well as easing the present social tensions. While they will not be federalized - we are not liberals, after all - giving them a bit extra power will ease the central administration's workload. How much would be best to give them?"

 IBR.5137.d:0 "Iberia has had a questionable relationship with minorities. From Franco's oppression to our paternal watchmanship, the many minorities around the country have more than likely developed a resentment of the Union. If we were to give them the option, then, they would nearly certainly split away from our state. Are we really sure people like this should have more power? The threats to our national security could be intense.\n\nOf course, if we give them some limited power, then the minorities could be sated a small amount. Giving them too much would kill the Union, but a token level of power would serve to stop any complaints that we are oppressive. Still, there is always the option to disregard what they think..."

 ##Representation For All Iberians

 #you get this event if you've already been a bit nice to minorities
 IBR.5138.t:0 "A Fundamentally Broken Political System"
 IBR.5138.d:0 "Iberia has been on a shaky footing ever since its inception. Through well intentioned but misplaced policies, decisions made more to sate egos than to help the country, and corruption so thorough it would make president Nixon blush, a country has built its foundations on sand. Some of the decisions the Caudillos made, though sensible at the time, are better off reversed. It seems like the only way to save the Union, is to open up some more politically.\n\nWe need to do something politically. We have our best chance at saving the country by increasing its representation and making those present eager to participate. There are a number of tabled reforms we could pass, though thoroughly overhauling the system could work even better for our ends."
 IBR.5138.a:0 "A thorough overhaul is in order"
 IBR.5138.b:0 "Let us get through the tabled reforms"
 
 #you get this event if you haven't been nice to minorities
 IBR.5139.t:0 "Improving Representation in Iberia"
 IBR.5139.d:0 "Iberia has run just fine ever since the Presidents opted to merge their countries. There have been a few hiccups here and there, and the government is not without its problems, but they have been moved on from and fixed, given time. This is the nature of the Union - it is never perfect at first, but can improve to be near it given the right attention. Some do not get this, and these people, often minorities, will agitate for our destruction. We need them to be silent.\n\nThe best way to silence these pests is not the stick, but rather the carrot. By passing some limited political reforms, we could go a long way to bringing dissent down to acceptable levels. How much would be best? We could work through a backlog of tabled reforms, or simply target the most critical policies."
 IBR.5139.a:0 "Start working through the tabled reforms" #this means the same as IBR.5138.b

 ##Keep an Eye on Elections
 IBR.5140.t:0 "Surveillance for the Greater Good"
 IBR.5140.d:0 "Democracy is all well and good as a system, but sometimes it can produce unfavorable results. Above anything else, an election's primary purpose is to legitimize the regime in the eyes of the people, and if we allow ourselves to be voted out then it fails to accomplish that. We need to ensure that the people - or enough of them - vote for the right choice.\n\nWe will be deploying agents to most major polling stations, and there they will establish themselves and keep a very close eye on the voters. In addition, wire-tapping of election workers is to be conducted with state of the art technology purchased from the United States. Our electoral plans depend on enough information being revealed through constant surveillance. Hopefully, the systems already in place will not obstruct us."
 IBR.5140.a:0 "Let us hope this works out..."
 
 IBR.5141.t:0 "Everything According to Plan"
 IBR.5141.d:0 "Of course, what we wanted done to polling stations was not necessarily legal. If we were to blatantly compromise a perceived anonymity, and even more through breaching legal protocols and precedents, it would create an impressive stir among the public. The matter required sensitive handling, and no small amount of work from our bureaucrats to ensure that our aims were implemented correctly and the laws budged to make them legally bulletproof.\n\nWe should have never even thought of doubting our bureaucratic strength. Loyal to the Presidents, and with a skill to match it, we now have careful observation firmly established over most polling places, allowing us some influence over how people vote."
 IBR.5141.a:0 "Now, about those voting booths..." 
 IBR.5141.b:0 "All in a day's work" #option which shows up in all other cases

 IBR.5142.t:0 "Stronger Electoral Control"
 IBR.5142.d:0 "In a society like Iberia's, it is the duty of the stronger leader figures to guide the lesser masses. This hierarchy is known by all from the lowliest janitor to the Presidents themselves, and the average people accept the guidance of their betters. It is not only accepted, but even desired that the state provide a basic framework for people to do their civic duty within.\n\nThrough this unspoken consent to provide direct help, many facets of the polling stations - including the voting itself - are under our influence. We have the ability to control the ballots themselves, and by combining this assistance with our previous surveillance, very little will happen during an election that we do not know about. The public supports this move, and thanks to that it will be able to last for a long time to come."
 IBR.5142.a:0 "It's harder to do something about the turnout rate..."
 
 IBR.5143.t:0 "Attempts at Monitoring Elections Blocked"
 IBR.5143.d:0 "It would be a bad idea to simply declare our elections monitored. By taking such a decisive course of action, and in the process break many established norms, we would set ourselves up to alienate many who would otherwise support us. Setting up surveillance on most polling stations around the country would be a delicate affair, leaning mostly on the competence of our bureaucratic services to ensure that things are as they should be. If they are not swayed, then we cannot do anything.\n\nGiven the current results, the bureaucrats do not act with Iberia in mind. Unable to actually deny our requests, we have fallen victim to the timeless political maneuver that is not actually doing what we desire. They claim that they cannot make progress in surveillance due to complications in protocol and paperwork - conveniently leaving out how they are responsible for most of it - and even create more when they can excuse it. Political surveillance, it seems, is further from our reach than anticipated."
 IBR.5143.a:0 "Really? Perhaps their budget needs some surveillance as well."

 #A means through which to guide
 IBR.5144.t:0 "A Plan for Election Results"
 IBR.5144.d:0 "Ultimately, an election is an event where the people decide who they think should be in charge of a country. This can be very good for us - the majority wants us, after all - but that same system is a double edged sword. If we were to be voted out, unlikely as it is, then we would be in the uncomfortable position where giving up power would be expected. It would be a nightmare, so we will need to make sure the sleep is sound.\n\nMost of the troublesome parts of democracy can be avoided if we place the people in an advisory role, allowing their decisions to guide us but not order us. Then, we can claim all the benefits of public support and none of the drawbacks of losing it. If we are confident in our support, then we could just allow elections to proceed unimpeded."
 IBR.5144.a:0 "The people's decisions should ideally be binding"
 IBR.5144.b:0 "The people guide, but do not rule"
 
 IBR.5145.t:0 "The Party Question" 
 IBR.5145.d:0 "Iberia's newfound reforms has set many important precedents in its political scene. Dissidents speak more freely now, and ideas that would have been met with hostility are now simply points to be considered. The reformism has brought an entirely new dimension to the business of policy, as anyone with a lick of political sense can see that the environment is definitely changing. One of the new issues buzzing around is that of political parties.\n\nDo we really want more political parties? Iberia has been run by a single party - the National Union - ever since its inception. The argument has been made that allowing the creation of new political parties may be just what the country needs, as their limited dissidence will do wonders towards discharging much pent-up tension. Could these parties be what Iberia needs to save itself?"
 IBR.5145.a:0 "Iberia benefits from multiple parties"
 IBR.5145.b:0 "That is one step too far..."
 
 IBR.5146.t:0 "Presidents Speak in Favor of Parties"
 IBR.5146.d:0 ""After careful consideration, we find that Iberia must evolve to hold more political parties than simply the state. We not only condone the creation of these political organizations, but as Presidents and Caudillos we will take steps to assist in the creation of more, for the good of Iberia..."\n\nWithin mere minutes of the announcement, Iberia found itself in an uproar. The Caudillos, of all people, supporting a multi-party system? It was ridiculous. As it later happened, this event proved the fertilizer for the Iberian political scene to blossom, as the endorsement from the very Caudillos themselves led many to flock to political parties. Democracy had a new vigor now, stronger than it ever would have been otherwise."
 IBR.5146.a:0 "Everyone comes around to it eventually."
 
 IBR.5147.t:0 "Internal Transcripts Leak"
 IBR.5147.d:0 ""Don't you think a non-binding election would cause an uproar we can't handle?"\n\n"Who cares what the people think? What will they do, vote us out?"\n\nLike all internal meetings, transcripts were kept of the entire meeting. The subject of democracy did not come up just once, but several times - and frequently in the same fashion. One would bring it up, and then another would deride the very concept. It would be quite damning, were it not a private meeting.\n\nLike all things best kept private, it didn't stay that way. Our bureaucrats, whether by incompetence or malice, have managed to have our internal transcripts leaked to the public. Before, we had a level of plausible deniability, but now we don't even have that! The public is angry at our approach, and there's nothing to suggest it will subside."
 IBR.5147.a:0 "Idiots!"
 
 IBR.5148.t:0 "Protests for Binding Elections"
 IBR.5148.d:0 "The people of Iberia have turned out in force. In crowds of thousands, protestors march through the cities of the union. In smaller numbers, these same protestors also march through the countryside - presumably to join their urban brethren. It is everything the Guardia Civil can do just to keep these protests from exploding into riots.\n\nThese protests are in response to our recent meetings, nicknamed the "autocracy admissions" by the media. They are protesting for legally binding elections. We cannot disperse crowds of this magnitude, there are simply too many to try it without starting a true revolution; our only hope to keep the status quo is to ignore these protests for long enough that they fizzle out. When this happens, nobody knows."
 IBR.5148.a:0 "Find some meaningless scandal to throw at them!"

 ##Allow the parties to grow

 IBR.5149.t:0 "Moving Towards a Multiparty System"
 IBR.5149.d:0 "Even today, the word of the Presidents is supreme. As they say, then so it shall be done. Their will is law. So when the Presidents decided that Iberia needed a multi-party system - a real one, not a sham democracy with a controlled opposition - then it was decided then and there that Iberia would have itself a democracy. No matter the surprise, or the confusion, orders were orders.\n\nDrastic reforms are being written up, and are only a rubber stamp away from approval. The old laws, limiting Iberia to only one effective political party, will be repealed as soon as possible. With the new political diversity, Iberia is well on its way to becoming a democracy.

 IBR.5150.t:0 "The Rise of the Parties"
 IBR.5150.d:0 "For a long time, Iberia has had no formal political parties. Crushing restrictions have choked them out, leaving nothing but a few fringe groups to organize underground, where they were by and large irrelevant. With the new reforms, other parties are finally beginning to form, diversifying our political scene. They are young, embryonic, and inexperienced. This could be an opportunity like little else.\n\nAgainst our apparatus, which is finely tempered by the rigors of political life, these new parties would have little resistance. If we were to actively campaign about them, then we could keep them weak and marginalized. However, we would be seen as more legitimate if we allow them to grow and become relevant entities."

 IBR.5151.t:0 "The Party Growth Slows"
 IBR.5151.d:0 "It was well known within the government that the parties would eventually stop growing. No-one could attract a universal appeal, and once each party found their entire base, they would plateau. The only question was where - would they be irrelevant, would they be present, or would their combined strength be enough to challenge, or even topple, the regime? Few could provide a definitive date, though it seems like they won't need to.\n\nThe new political parties have started to grow at a slower pace, and with the rate steadily declining they are set to likely plateau in a short period of time. It seems our advice on competition was taken to heart, but not so much so that we face overwhelming threats. What now?"

We have campaigned against the other parties in Iberia, exposing their faults and flaws to the public. It has worked. The other parties, unable to put up a competent resistance to a real campaign, have mostly folded and do not attempt to counter our media - not that they could regardless. Their growth has slowed dramatically, and it looks like they will plateau far lower than the extent required to challenge us. With this taken care of, what should we do next?"

 IBR.5153.d:0 "When we first ordered a campaign in place against the new political parties, we were assured they would be squashed. Our political influence was strong and enforced by veterans, surely there would be no failure. All they needed was a little bit of time to work their magic. As it turns out, we should not have trusted these men with government positions.\n\nThese men are veterans of politics, but it turns out that this means nothing but their time present. They have turned out an incompetent, disconnected campaign. We put our trust into these people and the most they could turn out was pitiful, obvious propaganda that failed to appeal to even the lowest common denominator!"

 IBR.5154.t:0 "The Party Growth Increases"
 IBR.5154.d:0 "As if a failed campaign wasn't bad enough, things have gotten even worse. The propaganda itself has been turned into a selling point by opposition parties, who have taken its disconnected, out-of-touch rhetoric and proclaimed it a reason to oppose us. The public seem to have caught on very easily to this particular piece, for the opposition had a much better campaign staff than we did.\n\nWith our inexperienced new employees, we are unable to stop or reverse this change of events. The parties are growing even more than before - and they are drawing even from our base of support."
 IBR.5154.a:0 "Really?!"
 
 IBR.5155.t:0 "A Final Blow to the Opportunists"
 IBR.5155.d:0 "Finally, Iberia will be freed from organized dissidence! There are many opportunists in the country, full of arrogance and greed. They thought that they might be able to take over the country, now that we have shown openness and tolerance to them. Whenever they are presented a potential opportunity, their first thought is to take advantage of it, rather than showing gratitude. This blind, heedless political opportunism will prove to be their downfall.\n\nThis time, there is no openness and tolerance. In our most genius move yet, the new openness is a trick. We will use it to lure the vultures out, promising a wonderful political carcass, and now that they have taken the bait, sweeping in for their opportunity, we will destroy them. They will not see it coming, as they are arrested and their movements destroyed while they are still vulnerable. Iberia will be saved!"
 IBR.5155.a:0 "Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good crackdown."
 
 IBR.5156.t:0 "The Parties Crushed"
 IBR.5156.d:0 "It is done. The dissident opportunists have been crushed. They were so caught up in their insidious plots to destroy the country that they never saw our crackdown coming. Their greed kept them blind until the last moment, where the ringleaders only realized the error of their opportunism once they were being driven off in handcuffs by the Guardia Civil.\n\nThe Presidents's control over Iberia is secure once more. These parties will never be a threat again, and their movements will wither and die like a bird without its wings."
 IBR.5156.a:0 "I'm not sure what they expected."
 
 IBR.5157.t:0 "Parties Slightly Weakened, but Relevant"
 IBR.5157.d:0 "The parties have not been defeated, like we wished. Despite our efforts to find and arrest the ringleaders, and otherwise sabotage their efforts, nothing has proved as effective as intended. This is not due to any particular resilience on their part - they were still taken by total surprise - but due to our own poor planning. Due to several regulations, technicalities, and plain legal obstruction, we could not entirely remove the opposition's political influence.\n\nIn any case, it is certainly not a defeat for us. They are still weakened, unable to exert the influence they could previously. Our actions may have given them a few more supporters than before, but what does that matter when they can't leverage them?"
 IBR.5157.a:0 "So long as we're still on top."
 
 IBR.5158.t:0 "Crackdown Blocked by Institutions"
 IBR.5158.d:0 "A disaster is unfolding! When we moved to arrest the worst of the dissidents, we found that we couldn't. They were immune to our crackdown, carefully leveraging the laws of our own government against us! The worst among the worst even had the nerve to gloat about it, knowing that we could not reach him.\n\nOnce we went back to the drawing board, we set our bureaucrats off to change the laws sufficiently for a crackdown - but nothing came of it. The bureaucrats have ignored our orders, and we don't have the power to make them heed what we say. We have been betrayed by our own government, so who knows what is going to come next?"

After being sent to disperse the protests in Madrid, a tense standoff developed as the crowd refused to back down. When ordered by the Caudillos to break up the crowds by force, the men of the Guardia Civil openly refused, lowering their weapons and parting for the masses. Similar events have transpired in almost every city in Iberia, and now the Guardia Civil stands idly by, its men openly fraternizing with the protestors, as the mob swells larger by the hour.\n\nThis insubordination cannot stand. The mob must be put down with an iron fist, lest the situation tumble even further out of our control. This incipient revolution must be killed in its crib, even if it means drowning the streets of Iberia in blood.

Pleading to the soldiers not to fire on their fellow Iberians, the masses, having adopted flowers as a symbol of their cause, placed them in the barrels of the soldier's rifles. Thus the Carnation Revolution was given its name.\n\nMoved by the compassion and bravery of the protestors, the soldiers defected en mass, joining their brothers in the Guardia Civil. The military officers followed suit. Within a day of the army's deployment onto the streets, a coup of left-wing officers was launched, storming the Palace of El Pardo and the Sao Bento Mansion and placing both of the Caudillos of Iberia under arrest. The revolutionaries immediately announced their intentions to hold free and open elections as soon as possible.\n\nMillions across the peninsula rejoice at the restoration of their hard-won democracy and the dawn of a new, free Iberia.

Sporadic scuffles broke out across the square.\n\nThen someone fired a shot. In a panic, the Guardia Civil opened fire on the crowd, shooting indicrimantely into the protestors, some of them with machine guns. A stampede ensued as demonstrators tried desperately to escape the bullets. When the smoke cleared, hundreds, if not thousands, lay dead, their bodies crushed, riddled with bullets, shielding loved one from harm or running for their lives.\n\nSimilar massacres have erupted in other cities, spelling the descent of the country into a frenzy of recriminations and violence.

Members of the Guardia Civil are being killed on sight, government buildings are being looted and burned to the ground, and everywhere, men are arming themselves. Meanwhile, in the regions, separatists are organizing openly, taking advantage of the chaos to prepare for open revolt against the central government. Civil War is in the air.\n\nMeanwhile the Caudillos hide in their palaces, impotent before the coming storm, gathering around them what loyal men will fight to defend the old regime.

 IBR.5416.d:0 "Caudillo of Iberia, President of the Government, Champion of the Last Crusade and Hispanic Heritage. Francisco Franco had many titles, styles, and accolades. "Lord of Meirás'' was the least well known of these, and for good reason. Franco liked to keep his summer manor in Galicia out of the way, far from the prying eyes and endless churning politics of El Pardo, the Madrid palace where he usually held court. Here he could rest, and conduct his business in peace.\n\nThat is why when reaching out to Opus Dei, he invited them to Meirás, where the hardliners in the Falange could not be a nuisance. The regime and Opus Dei had a complicated relationship. They were loyal Catholics, but their internal secrecy had always spurned on claims from the more inquisitorial members of the Falange that they were a front for Freemasonry. In a country where membership to the Freemasons was illegal, the mere suspicion was reason enough to keep Opus Dei at an arm's length.\n\nBut times were changing. The Oil Crisis had sent the Iberian economy into a deep recession, with nobody in the government quite knowing what to do about it. Franco was in need of new blood, advisors up to date with the latest economic theories. Opus Dei had amongst its membership many fine economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. Technocrats, disinterested in the petty politics of El Prado who could deliver results and reform the economy on a new, sound basis.\n\nWorking with Opus Dei and its members would have its consequences. The Caudillo knew he would have to put his foot down, stamping out complaints and protestations from Falange ideologues before they could even be voiced. Either that, or the three economists would have to carry out their work in secret, presenting their plans to him at his frequent visits to Meirás. Either way, he was a Caudillo of Iberia, and where he chose to go, Opus Dei, and the Falange, would follow."

The beast fell to the ground unceremoniously and died. Out on his customary morning carriage trip around the grounds of the Pazo de Meirás, his summer palace, one of the carriage horses had slipped and broken its leg. Pitying its pained cries, the Caudillo had ordered it shot. When he was younger he had rode about the grounds himself on the very same horse, yet even that small pleasure had been stolen from him by age.\n\nDuring the carriage ride back to the Pazo de Meirás, the Caudillo once again thought over the National Economic Stabilization Plan presented to him by his new team of economists - Alberto Ullastres, Mariano Navarro Rubio, and Laureano López Rodó. The technocrats' plan was ambitious, proposing a fixed exchange rate, raised interest rates, increased foreign investment, significant cuts to public expenditure, and privatization of key industries. It was exactly the kind of new, pioneering reform that Franco believed the struggling Spanish economy desperately needed.\n\nYet it would also be controversial. The plan went back on decades of economic orthodoxy, doing away with the official policy of National-Syndicalism under which Iberia was neither capitalist or communist, with class struggle abolished and the worker and the capitalist both serving the interests of the Iberian nation. State ownership of industry, national economic independence, protection of the worker: the policies of National-Syndicalism were one of the great legacies of the War of Liberation against the communists, or so said the ideologues of the Falange. To give it up would be to relinquish the power of the state over economic policy and invite pernicious foreign influence into Iberia.\n\nFranco himself was loath to undermine it, at least publicly. Perhaps some compromise would have to be found, in which the National Stabilization Plan was only partly implemented, leaving National-Syndicalism largely intact. But perhaps, like a horse with a broken leg, it simply had to be put down."

Promises that the austerity would only be temporary. Promises that ordinary Iberians would not bear the brunt of the cost for the crisis. Promises that the Caudillo and the Iberian state was there to take care of them. Promises that they seemed more and more unable to keep as the days went by.\n\nThe whole program had been framed in a series of timelines, with several major austerity measures to be lifted when the allotted time was reached. Yet after months and months, the Iberian economy had only marginally improved, with Unemployment was still high and investor confidence stagnant. And all the while, the deadline for the end of the austerity measures was approaching.\n\nThe technocrats had been telling the Caudillo for some time now that their liberalization program needed more time for its effects to be felt, for the economy to start turning around. They had begged for the timelines to be extended, but up till now Franco had refused them. How would he look if he went back on his sacred word to the Iberian people. But now things were coming to a head. He would have to make a choice: betray his word, or risk economic catastrophe."

 IBR.5180.d:0 "To be torn on such a decision would have suited the aging Spanish Caudillo perfectly before his rival for Iberian dominance had died. Now, standing uncertainly alone atop a house of crumbling cards, he wished the former technocrat was beside him. He had always had a clever comment ready for a situation like this. Franco could almost hear the faint whisper of his voice.\n\nYet he was alone, sitting in a large conference room surrounded by empty faced bureaucrats and lackeys who he could not rely on for critique or sound advice. What did they know of the severe strain put upon the union by this precarious situation? What did they know of the Portuguese people's mournful cries and the significance these held for the future of this nation? It was on him to now hold Iberia together in the face of an ugly and unrelenting world. Hopefully alongside him someone to bring the joys and rigor of ruling back to the old man's heart.\n\n"Brief me again on the two candidates." The almost hushed murmur made many, even those sat close to the usually imposing military man, lean in to listen intently. A short pause followed, as the room was unsure of who should speak first. Seeing the dejection and quiet withdrawal of the man at the head of the table the discussion was promptly started nonetheless."

It had not been easy, the pragmatic Portuguese had always been a hushed voice of reason that he could rely on even if he despised it. He would miss it. His senior staff had been excited at the opportunity to now further centralize the regime, ensuring maximum control of a population he might need ready for war. Or worse.\n\nYet Franco knew he needed more than a figurehead to keep Portugal loyal within the union. His final choice had been the scholarly Marcelo Caetano, a protegee of Salazar who had already lived a long life inside the world of politics. His moderate reformer stance may be an issue that could offset the stability brought from securing Portugal, as hardliners may see him as a step too far in the wrong direction. It would be a difficult matter even for his eventual successor to contend with. He sighed. This was not a world that readily embraced the language of hope anymore."

Or worse.\n\nHe had considered the possibility of becoming the lone Caudillo of a Union badly in need of a more martial spirit. Yet with his age he may soon follow his former political rival into the grave. To leave the task of maintaining a stable Iberia, following Spanish centralization, to someone not of his own caliber was dangerous. Hence someone of similar leaning was needed, someone who would be easier to work with and who could be trusted with upholding Portugal's half of the union once he himself would be dead. By suggestion of his advisors António da Mota Veiga had been chosen for this role. A capable and ruthless politician who had enough experience in Portuguese politics to be an essential asset.

His senior staff had been excited at the opportunity to now further centralize the regime, ensuring maximum control of a population he might need ready for war. Or worse.\n\nWith age his swagger had begun to leave him, but not his bite. Sunken, aging eyes glared intently around the room of gathered senior officials. The silence ate deeply into the confidence of all those who faced the Caudillo. Then he spoke, outlining a plan both rational and extremely dangerous. He would assume sole leadership of Iberia and prepare in grooming a successor who would lead a unified state against the dark forces on their doorstep. None of the bureaucrats could see the slight nervous twitch in the left hand of the Spanish dictator, and even if they had done it likely would have only been pushed onto his age."

 #The Grand Inauguration Chain

 IBR.5184.t:0 "Final Preparations"
 IBR.5184.d:0 "An event so momentous and grandiose it can only be compared to the pompous crowning of past absolute autocrats. Yet this was not some medieval ceremony of authority but a modern legitimation of a regime so wet behind the ears it has not even raised a single generation successfully. Noone knew the importance of the appearance of longevity and peace as much as the Spanish Caudillo, who had taken the surprising liberty of inspecting the construction in Lisbon himself.\n\nHe counted the diverse forms symbolism he had ordered to be quietly included on the various stages and locations where the rule of the regime he had helped build could finally be stabilized. Pillars of society like the church could not be forgotten in a historic event such as this. Observing the hurried tussle of the many workers conscripted from all over the union he allowed himself a small smile of relief. Soon would be the end of his road, he now just wished that his rival could have stood beside him in this glorious moment."
 IBR.5184.a:0 "The union consolidating?"

 IBR.5185.t:0 "The Chosen Successor"
 IBR.5185.d:0 "The reformer approached the lavish podium flanked by a seething mass of cheers and jubilation. His eyes however remained steady and pointed forwards, examining the deceptive serenity on the face of the man he would soon run a union of nations with. Hands reached out to grasp hold of him as others were swatted away by the countless security personnel which guarded the extended walkway. Admiring the effort of the Spanish Caudillo in quickly preparing such sumptuous courtiership of the Portuguese capital, he climbed the hastily erected marble stairs to stand beside the aging former general. Not exchanging a single word with Caetano, Franco stepped forward to the microphone.\n\nHis speech, a strange mix of honorable remembrance for Salazar and a desperate call for unity managed to arouse some excitement amongst the masses of Lisbon's gathered. Caetano noted the slightest hint of a satisfied smile on the old man's face upon his retreat to the back of the stage. Now it was his own turn to step forward. He braced physically against the intense din as he quickly shuffled the notes for his speech. Words of reform, moderation and an ease of tensions on the half peninsula were almost lost in the raucous applause that followed. Did he detect a hint of jealousy in Franco's eyes when they left the stage together? No matter, he had done his part and he had done it well."
 IBR.5185.a:0 "Forwards, into a new era for Iberia!"
 
 IBR.5186.t:0 "Disturbing Allegations Arise"
 IBR.5186.d:0 "Franco violently threw the crumpled newspaper on the floor with disgust. He surprised his personal aide when he jumped out of his seat with an energy powered solely by fury. 'Is this true,' he bellowed at the nervous man who had stepped back in fear of being in the way of the Spanish Caudillo's ravings and flying spittle. Hesitantly pointing at the briefing he had just brought prior to Franco's explosion the aide excused himself and quietly left the room.\n\nWith both his hands holding his head steady, Franco began to quickly read the report that the National Institute of Statistics was about to publish publicly. His choice as successor to the role of Portuguese Caudillo, da Mota Veiga, was being accused of possibly being involved in a corruption scandal. Further details could not be given yet as the investigation was just about to get under way. The accusation however stood there on the paper, bold and strong. The aging Caudillo groaned; it was not as if Iberia had not been facing enough problems as it is. Now what had been considered as the safe choice for the replacement of Salazar was in the process of letting him down more than his old rival ever had."
 IBR.5186.a:0 "Get to the bottom of this, quickly!"

 IBR.5187.t:0 "Evidence Surfaces"
 IBR.5187.d:0 "Despite Franco's quick handling of the press it seems the corruption crisis surrounding his choice for the position of Portuguese Caudillo has its own ways of expanding in magnitude. A regional paper from the north of Portugal has published a document from the National Institute of Statistics detailing how da Mota Veiga had seemingly purposefully adjusted some numbers to increase the level of funding received from the central government for a town he had property in. Despite the newspaper's relatively neutral coverage the significance was still damning.\n\nReports of da Mota Veiga arriving at Franco's residence following the publication's release were circulated in national papers. The reasons were however censored well this time, with reporters praising the level of cooperation and unity between the new leaders of the Union. With the issues facing effective censorship in Iberia it is not known how aware the public is of the still unfolding scandal. One thing is for certain, the new administration has a long road ahead before it can begin to govern successfully."
 IBR.5187.a:0 "Not good, but not terrible either..."

 IBR.5188.t:0 "Portuguese Statistics Completely Fabricated"
 IBR.5188.d:0 "Da Mota Veiga has been returning daily to Franco's residence. The Iberian national papers are still toeing the line, proclaiming that a great deal of work to resolve issues that the Union was facing were being done in these private meetings. The reality was looking starkly different.\n\nDocuments had been flooding, not just from the Institute investigating Salazar's successor, but other government branches and institutions. Under da Mota Veiga's watch an astounding number of statistics regarding Portuguese fiscal policy had been entirely fabricated. Now Franco's choice had been forced to explain himself on a daily basis as more and more information kept reaching the Spanish Caudillo's desk. Serious doubts were beginning to be raised within the upper echelons of Iberian politics as to whether da Mota Veiga could even be suitable now considering the vast amount of money he had lost the Union. Some analysts have gone so far as to claim that the losses have hit Spain in particular, further deteriorating the situation behind closed doors.\n\nFollowing a week of discussions with Franco, eventually da Mota Veiga was forced to stand in front of the national press and proclaim that his inauguration would have to be delayed due to personal reasons. Ignoring the rushing torrent of questions washing over him, the now disgraced politician stepped back from the podium to be assisted away by Spanish security guards."

 IBR.5189.t:0 "An Unlikely Outcome"
 IBR.5189.d:0 "Caetano's gaze was captivated by a lonesome workman who was chipping away steadily at the name of the disgraced man he would now replace. It looked to be a tough job; the marble inscription had the tell-tale signs of experienced artisan work. What would he replace the empty space with? There was only another day until the plaza which had been prepared so carefully for the inauguration of da Motta Veiga as Portuguese Caudillo would be filled with to commemorate his own appointment. Something which weeks earlier had been decided against by the Spanish Caudillo. He continued to watch him, now wondering whether many would come to watch at all. The local police could surely procure some 'willing' spectators but what did it matter. The damage had been done.\n\nFranco had put his name behind a man destroyed by the most astounding corruption scandal Iberia had faced in its miniscule history. The public, despite being force-fed lies and half truths about the situation, had been able to receive enough real information from local papers and intuition to recognize the significance of the horrible blunder which had occurred at the locus of power in Iberian politics.\n\nFinally turning away from the worker who had by now cleanly removed da Motta Veiga's name, Caetano wondered how long and how much work it would take to scrub away a misdeed from a nation's consciousness."

 #Franco's Speech Chain
 
 IBR.5190.t:0 "A Message to Iberia"
 IBR.5190.d:0 ""My fellow countrymen, we stand united in our deep sorrow at the loss of the great Caudillo Salazar. His friendship and wisdom were great assets in our ruling of this eternal Union of nations. The memory of the work he has done to promote the ideals of Iberia shall live on forever. Now however I stand alone, having to face the gargantuan task of managing without him. I ask you, my brothers and sisters, to assist me, to support me now that I and this Union are in the greatest hour of need."\n\nFranco sat in front of the cameras and microphones rigidly. One could sense the excited energy in the air, almost as if a single spark could set it all off. The crew assembled and working to broadcast the now sole Caudillo's message to his people around Iberia often throughout his speech looked at each other tellingly. Hidden smirks and grins were exchanged.The Spanish dictator almost couldn't contain his immense glee; he was abuzz, with every sentence of his long speech reminding of the bombastic public speaking his hated enemies in the Reich used to practice. Despite the message proclaiming extraordinary measures in uncertain times in a similar vein in which the Union had first been announced, the significance of the political reality that was hidden behind Franco's words were not lost on those watching and listening. The Union was now solely governed by a Spaniard from Madrid. The consequences of this are still uncertain."
 IBR.5190.a:0 "He stands alone at the precipice."

 IBR.5191.t:0 "Protests Across Portugal"
 IBR.5191.d:0 "Following Franco's address to the nation there was first an unnerving quiet. Reactions were muted to the extent that public officials deemed that Salazar's death had created a temporary culture of mourning across the Union. The more capable ones however recognized the phenomenon for what it was. The calm before the storm.\n\nFirst signs of protest in Portugal were quickly squashed by authorities. Initially it was solemn and quiet marches in the larger cities that could be dispersed at the first sign of police presence. However, as the days wore on the marches did not stop organising and in fact began to grow considerably in size. Soon they also began to take on a much more radical tone as people began to bring along signs and sang traditional Portuguese songs. Again, authorities were called in to deal with what senior Spanish officials started to call an official show of defiance against the Iberian state. This did not the stop marchers either as their numbers continued to swell and their actions began to negatively affect the economy. Arrests and show trials were not putting off those who were now calling for the formation of an independent Portugal, free from Spanish oppression. Local officials and newspapers began to stop toeing the line officially mandated by an increasingly nervous Madrid. State oppression began to become visible as sweeping arrests were made and curfews began to be set in place."
 IBR.5191.a:0 "The situation is spiralling out of control."
 
 IBR.5192.t:0 "Portuguese Bureaucrats Resign"
 IBR.5192.d:0 "Portugal was in uproar. Not only was the public rejecting the imposition of Spanish rule, but now even Portuguese officials of the Union government were beginning to boycott the decision. An unofficial strike has been called with many government workers simply staying at home or joining the continuous marches through the towns and cities. On top of this ministers and high-level officials were handing in their letters of resignation, citing an inability to work for an administration they did not believe in.\n\nThe newspaper censors were working restlessly as most major and minor publications within Portugal were reporting on this mass desertion from the Iberian project. They could not however censor the foreign observers effectively who had begun to spread seditious rumours that army units were amassing at the former border.\n\nAll the while Franco watched his empire burn and crumble around him. His hard work uniting two peoples, his grovelling to Portuguese officials, his compromises while Salazar was still around. All for nothing now that he had made one bad decision. He would be damned though if these traitors would crush his ambitions without a fight. So, he stood over his desk like Nero, singing maniacally in his head as more news of sedition reached his office, waiting for the rot to burn and the just to take their righteous place afterwards."

 IBR.5193.d:0 "The room was half filled with the Spanish representatives of the legislative council already in their seats, anxiously awaiting both the arrival of the Caudillo and the Portuguese representatives. 20 minutes after the allotted starting time of their session the other half of the council filed in, deadly silent and not event offering a glance at the already assembled men. Yet surprise filled their faces as it was noticed that they had not been the only ones to show disrespect to the council.\n\nAs the Portuguese began to whisper amongst themselves the door opened again and the aging Caudillo marched in, taking his seat at the head of the table. Looking around the room shortly he coughed and began to speak, only to be interrupted by a Portuguese member of the council. The Spaniard's eyes virtually bulged out of their sockets in rage as he waved for the man to continue. Denouncing the inability of the council to restrain the Caudillo in acting against the virtues of unity and shared responsibility upon which the Union had been established, the Portuguese rattled down a list of condemnations to which all his fellow countrymen of the council had put their names to. Even if the council had no real power in stopping the power-hungry Caudillo, they could at least show their discontent. If looks could kill, then the speaker would have turned to ash. The Spanish dictator was not pleased. He however motioned for the remaining topics of discussion to now be addressed, an irony not lost on the poor man who would soon never be able to see his beloved homeland again."

Some of the more friendly Spanish members had attempted to make conversation with their Portuguese peers only to be rudely ignored. The air was heavy with tension as everyone waited for the final participant to arrive. Strutting into the quiet conference room Franco immediately observed the small pin badges on each of the Portuguese members' suits. He laughed inwardly at the ineffectual sign of protest. Wearing pins of the Portuguese national flag would not change their situation in the slightest. The Spanish Caudillo now held total control after all.\n\nSitting down he observed that his bones creaked slightly; hoping that no one heard he quickly went on to highlight the sessions agenda of topics that needed to be addressed, putting a high stress on foreign policy issues. In the middle of his monologue however, all the Portuguese members of the council stood one by one. As Franco and the Spaniards looked on aghast, they began to slowly filter out of the room without making a single noise. Finally, Franco stood, his face ablaze in fury as he ordered them to immediately return to their seats or have their privilege of advising the Caudillo forever forfeited. A few grimaced as he went on to claim that Salazar would have been ashamed at the childish foolery they were now acting out. Yet none of them even turned to acknowledge the Spanish dictator. Sitting back down and grumbling to himself, Franco made a mental note to pass on all of the traitor's names to the police."

 IBR.5195.t:0 "Caetano's First Day"
 IBR.5195.d:0 "Following the grand inauguration Caetano quickly delved into administrative work, attempting to gain an even clearer picture of the situation Iberia was finding itself in. Knowing the problems facing regional representations he recognized his own important role, not just as a competent replacement for Salazar but also in being a figurehead of Portuguese interests in the Union. He was able to ingratiate himself effectively with the members of both the legislative and advisory council. Caetano figured that despite their seeming lack of power in opposing Caudillo decision making that they were still extremely important in the process of smooth governance. If an issue were to divide the two dictators it may also help to gain their support to overwhelm Franco's arguments.\n\nThe first day was over, a flurry of meetings and paperwork to establish his authority behind the closed doors of government in the same way his inauguration had cemented his standing on the international stage through foreign press coverage. A small rest in his new office finally allowed him to clear his mind slightly. He looked out of the grand windows on a bustling Madrid, still heaving with activity despite the late hour. Pleased that he could now begin to shape the direction that Union would take in the future he smiled happily. Important work had to be done and he was prepared for it."
 IBR.5195.a:0 "A bright future ahead?"

 IBR.5196.t:0 "Caetano's First Day"
 IBR.5196.d:0 "The inauguration ceremony had not been an easy affair. Franco's introductory speech had drawn hefty criticism from both the crowd and papers afterwards as being disingenuous and displaying an inability to face the mistakes of the regime. It set the tone for Caetano's speech after, as many had already left and those who remained only seemed to be half listening. Dejected the new replacement for Salazar had left early, only quietly answering a few questions from the press before slipping off.\n\nHis first day in office was no better as there were still arrangements underway to change the administrative structure in order to erase the last remnants of da Motta Veiga's preparations. Assembling his staff from a pool of trusted and effective civil servants he knew, Caetano could at least start working on healing the ills of the Union. Not surprisingly the scandal had exacerbated many of the issues he would have needed to deal with anyway. Separatists took Franco's first appointment as another sign of Spanish oppression and incompetence, blaming the federal government for not being a truly representative body. Many Spanish, both in government and in the public sphere, however painted da Motta Veiga as a rogue Portuguese agent, a symbol of Portugal leeching off and abusing its position within the Union. Then there were the financial issues which had been incurred by the scandal; the sheer amount of administrative work to first establish the losses and their consequences and then to begin to remedy them was a mountain which seemingly grew exponentially. Yet the reformer had not entirely lost his spirit. No matter how dire the situation may seem with an effective work ethic and constructive solutions anything was possible. And so, he ended the terrible day with the hint of a smile, he was now part of the solution that would transform the Union into a better place."
 IBR.5196.a:0 "A step in the right direction?"

 IBR.5197.t:0 "Touring Iberia"
 IBR.5197.d:0 "Population centers all over the half peninsula were surprised by the unannounced visits of the new Portuguese Caudillo Caetano as he was making his way around his realm. Only briefly notifying his Spanish counterpart Caetano shortly after establishing the bureaucratic framework for his administration, he set out to tour Iberia. It was necessary to gain a more complete picture of average life and to assess the extent of the divisions were politically unstable for the nation.\n\nOne of the stops he made was in the border city of Badajoz, situated on the left bank of Guadiana river and extremely close to the unofficial Portuguese border. Caetano's motorcade drove through the city making a stop at the bullring, a site where according to regime dissidents the Spanish Nationalists had murdered 100s of Republicans. Choosing to only take a small security detail Caetona then made his way around the streets on foot. He was recognized very quickly, and crowds began to form, following his walk and cheering him. Once he was at the town hall, he requested for a desk to brought out which he sat behind. Motioning for the onlookers to come forward he instructed his security detail to pick out a number of individuals to line up in front of his new desk. He then began to question them in a friendly manner, taking the time to get to know each of the ones picked. Listening to their concerns he made a few notes and asked for their personal opinions on the regime. As none would answer openly he again wrote down a few notes and then made his way back to the bullring.\n\nNewspapers around the country began to follow his journey, documenting each visit and guessing where he would turn up next. Dubbing the event 'Caetano's grand tour' it quickly went down into Iberian conscience."
 IBR.5197.a:0 "A commendable effort."
 
 
 IBR.5198.t:0 "For the Good of The Union"
 IBR.5198.d:0 "It almost felt like continuity. That was the beauty of effective reform. In the critical eye of the public Caudillo Caetano had already taken great efforts to ease his transition into power without hitches. His numerous visits and attempts to understand the mood and problems of localities around the Union had given him impetus to carry forth his ideas and display them proudly to the various councils and to his Spanish counterpart. It was not his will he was representing but that of the Iberian people. Not only had he effectively positioned himself in his new role, so the general populace supported him, but he also had managed his staff and administration well. This had given him the support of many in the civil service.\n\nHe now stood at the pinnacle, admired by many and without the ruinous taint of scandal. Caetano was positioned to be a unifying, stabilising figure in Iberian politics. His reluctance to immerse himself in the cheap power politicking that Salazar and Franco had been engaged in was refreshing to those in higher office. Seeing a change from trying to gain relative gains over one another to working for the absolute gain of the Union made Caetano one of the first true Iberians. Not a Portuguese nationalist but a product of the ongoing integration between two historic nations. Under his rule the future began to look a little brighter."

 IBR.5199.t:0 "A Report From Lisbon"
 IBR.5199.d:0 "The report in front of him was brutal, its official emotionless tone managed to cut as deeply as the most realistic prose. The dictators blood began to boil with anger as each word further compounded the disgusting treason the report was spelling out. It painted a stark image of a vengeful chaos that had engulfed a city. A small glimpse at what the union could soon look like if the crisis was not handled effectively.\n\nFranco's message to the nation had been received by many in Portugal as an address to the Spanish people, not to the united Iberia. In protest they had held civil rallies which had just invited the Caudillo's harbingers of order. Retaliation was the only order they managed to establish. Lisbon rose in a violent uproar. The previously civil marches now turned violent as police and security forces began to be driven from key parts of the city. Like other revolts it even inspired many of those who were ordered to quell it to join it. Public services and other semblances of normal life had been abandoned in favor of opposing Madrid.\n\nThis delicate political climate required conformity, it was not simple to craft a state out of the fresh corpse of another. Of course, the sheep would not understand. In situations such as these a strong guiding hand was required to guide them back to their pens, to bliss and safety. The Caudillo was the right man for the job. In his eyes at least."

Discussions in the advisory council were bleak as two camps had clearly formed.\n\nThe moderates, arguing to be more in touch with the plight of the Portuguese people, recognized the need to restore order and set an example for the rest of Portugal but also not inciting more revolts by establishing martial law and sending in more men. The hardliners on the other side set forth a clear plan of action, almost like a military campaign, in order to not let the revolt turn into revolution. Both sides debated heavily while Franco listened, every now and again shushing one speaker to hear an argument particularly in line with this own thinking. His considerations lasted long, not even being revealed in the space of the meeting. He initially had the plan to converge on Lisbon with the full might of the state behind him, but deeper thinking was required to not be too rash in the decision making. Finally, he had come to a conclusion."

His eyes widened as he saw a menacing column of armoured cars and crowd control vehicles rushing towards the main road, not slowing until people began to scream and back away. As the cars began to disperse the equally armoured Guardia Civil troopers the long line of protestors halted and moved further away. Orders were being barked as the soldiers began to surge forward. Again, people began to scream, this time the whole march was affected. The crowds began to disperse quickly in all directions as the troopers hunted down those defiantly staying or unfortunate enough to be stuck in the middle of the tumult. Within a few hours the guards had established a semblance of control over the city, quickly taking control of vital buildings such as local administration buildings and communication centers. The revolt had effectively been squashed, this time without the iron hand of violence being necessary."

Yet, despite the initial surprise caused as the soldiers swept into the crowd in full riot gear, they would not disperse. Rather than making room for the Guardia Civil troopers protestors began to throw rocks and bottles, hurling abuse and slogans all the while. As the soldiers barked orders the crowd even surged forward, closing the distance and attempting to disarm them. The situation continued to deteriorate as shots rang out. No one had been harmed yet it had the same effect as if the protestors had lost a number of their own. The shouting and violence worsened, forcing the now embattled soldiers to retreat back to their armored vehicles. Cheering the retreat of their oppressors the protestors began to continue their march only to soon be assaulted by even more riot police, this time far greater in number and with crowd dispersal tools. Again, the marchers were unwilling to back down. Yet this time neither did the soldiers retreat."

Yet that order was hated, now no longer associated with true representation but oppression. As the riot police arrived onto a square which the march was passing through, events quickly began to take a bloody turn. Protestors surged forward with makeshift weapons, trying to mob the surprised security forces and seal off their route of escape. They had however not expected the guards to have real weapons with live ammunitions. The first few shots rang out managing somehow to even surpass the din created by the discord. Dazed for a few seconds the protestors stopped in their bloodthirsty vigour, standing almost entirely still until the first screams rang out. Then the next shots plastered the human mass forcing a frenzied stampede in all directions. The riot police switching back to non-lethal weaponry drove the last few demonstrators out of the square only to find that a good number of them had been killed in the commotion. With grim expressions they still recognized their victory. Now order could slowly begin to be restored."

Driving through the abandoned streets of the outer sectors they began to hear a din representative of the large crowds they would soon need to disperse.\n\nGetting closer and closer to the audible harsh din coming from the center of the city a single fresh guardsman gripped his rifle slightly tighter. His training had been brutal and fear inducing but to now be in the position to translate that into a real-life experience terrified him far more. Finally, his armoured car stopped, and the sergeant barked the order for all to rally out. After a long, silent ride with tinted glass windows the sun blinded the young recruit for a short while while the incredible noise of the demonstrators halted him in his tracks. Then, however the adrenaline pushed him forward to stand alongside his comrades, facing off against a wall of seething flesh. He could see the anger visible in their wide-eyed glares and was glad that his face was hidden behind a mask. Suddenly the mass rushed forward. In a panicked flurry he drew his gun. Time froze. The mass abruptly became irrelevant as his entire focus was now on the young woman before him who he was aiming at. No older than he was himself she however stood defiant, inching forwards until her forehead rested against the cold steel. With a start she threw her hands up in an attempt to grab the gun, yet the recruit was quicker. The shot was startlingly loud and the young security man drew in a sharp breath. Time began to move again but now too quickly. All around him his fellow Guardia Civil companions began to shoot too, peppering the now utterly frenzied demonstrators. Yet the recruit could not fire again. His gaze never left the lifeless form before him. Taking no notice of the carnage around him he knelt down and took of his helmet. Putting his gun to the side of his head he whispered a silent apology.\n\nThe massacre in Lisbon was legendary. Once the crowds had broken out into savage rioting, orders to fire at will had been given. This bloody day for Portugal is likely to hold deep political charge for a long time to come."

The conviction with which they had started their demonstrations against Spanish centralization within the Union structure slowly evaporated day by day with the constant harassment.\n\nOne side had to break eventually and as it was the Guardia Civil's duty to make sure that it would not be them the result was that protests finally weakened.

This has resulted in conflicting messages for the forces on the ground who now cannot truly trust those above or effectively deal with those below. A senior officer has in this confusion written a memorandum asking for clear measures to be put in place to put the protestors in their place. In his eyes by allowing the protests to continue any further the state is running into the danger of the shouts for representation changing into ones calling for emancipation and freedom. His notes have been taken seriously as state officials have recognized the need for an image of stability to consolidate the new regime both internally and in foreign affairs."

However, once they did the protests seemed to lack the organization and purpose it had just a day prior. Important speakers and those who were vital in rallying more people to the cause seemed to be missing. In the vacuum a number of other protestors took to the limelight, attempting to rally the demoralised marchers back to the cause. Yet they in general lacked the charisma and vigor of the previous organisers which had the effect of marcher numbers steadily haemorrhaging. Despite this the protests continued and hence remained problematic to security forces."

It has even become clear to foreign observers that the regime in Madrid has become incapable of dealing with the Lisbon uprising. Some of them, those who view the new government with distaste, are even claiming that the protests are gathering such strength that soon the world could see the rebirth of the Portuguese nation from the carcass of Iberia.\n\nHaving to focus on balancing the fine scale of maintaining good foreign relations and quelling domestic unrest has indeed allowed the protests to grow to an unprecedented scale. More disturbingly is the effect this could have on other movements calling for representation, or worse even, "liberation"."

 IBR.5209.d:0 "The death of Salazar had given Franco the perfect opportunity to rid himself of restrictions upon his decision making. He could now centralize control of the legislature upon himself, not having to worry about the interjection from an authority, in theory, as powerful as himself.\n\nYet not all were willing to cede the Caudillo this level of power. Especially amongst the Portuguese Iberians there is now great unrest. This has translated into a number of members of the political class also passively resisting the newly instituted transition of power. They will have to bow, in one way or another.\n\nThe Caudillo has called for an emergency meeting of high level officials. Given the timing, many expect the Spanish dictator to only really approach one topic of discussion. Many are however unsure as to what his decision ultimately will be. Will he concede some aspects of his power to sate those calling for representation? Or will Franco stay true to his nature, crushing the rebellious politicians through dismissal, sidelining and exile?"

 IBR.5210.d:0 " After Franco's fiery address a number of the assembled officials looked at each other with sheer disbelief. Instead of following a more moderate line, the Spanish dictator had decided to dismiss all legitimate concerns raised about his clear power grab. Only a few of the more diehard authoritarian Spanish politicians had enthusiastically clapped after his speech, cheering on the demise of the last semblances of pluralism. The rest of the hall was silent in shock and contemplation. Some even openly looked disgusted.\n\nA list of the likely candidates to rebel had already been conjured up prior to the members leaving the hall. Security forces around the Union were ready to move in once the targets seemed likely to revolt. Only a few hours after all the officials had left, did the first begin to show signs of abandoning the regime. However, as the officers moved in, more and more dispatches were sent from headquarters. It seems a larger than expected number had decided to resign their post and publicly declare their condemnation of the new government. Once the wave started it did not stop. Politician after politician took to the press and podiums, forcing the crisis-laden state apparatus into near exhaustion. The fallout of this could not be effectively contained. It was clear from the outset that many officials, especially the Portuguese ones, had favoured the more collected and dignified Salazar. Yet this crowd now merged with politicians from all over the Union who called for a representative Union or none at all. Seemingly Salazar's ghost could not stop haunting the Spanish Caudillo. Obstructionism and protest now marked Franco's accession to be the sole locus of power in Iberia."

It clearly had been abandoned by its flock. The dictator struggled to get his attention back to the papers before him on his desk.\n\nResignation after resignation. A majority of the council had decided that this would be the point to make their principled stand. They were nothing but spineless cowards still in the pocket of a dead man who now couldn't even give them favors or patronage anymore. He had expected that a few would follow their revered master but not this many. This rump council would take weeks to replenish with men who were both loyal and of the same technocratic stature as their predecessors. More work to add to an ever growing list.\n\nFranco turned again to the bird. How he longed to be as free in his now seeming solitary existence.

Certainly, some of the politicians had to have enough pragmatic bones in their body to recognize the futility of questioning the legitimacy of the Iberian regime. The fear provoked by the looming threat of the state apparatus? The officials certainly should be most aware of the power it could exercise. Promises of patronage and favor in exchange for unquestioning obedience? Officials did make the greatest lackeys.\n\nThe reasons did not matter, what did were the results. Only the most extreme Salazar loyalists refused to conform to the new reality and treasonously resigned. Their actions and fates would remain unbeknownst to the public and most of their colleagues. The majority of Iberian politicians have decided to remain loyal following Franco's reform of the Iberian regime. They could bring much needed immediate legitimacy and strength to resolve tensions with certain identity groups of the wider populace.

Not only had the Portuguese officials decided to follow their recently deceased figurehead's constant desire to impede progress, but now also many Spaniards had thrown in their lots with them.\n\nFollowing the rejection, Franco's office door seemingly was not shut for a few days. The Caudillo desperately tried to convince leaders of cliques and interest groups to disavow their previous declaration. To many, the lack of success appeared to drive Franco insane. Once the last name on his list had also sworn to never cooperate again unless Franco allowed the old balance to be restored, he realized that he should have been harsher with these traitors. Salazar had poisoned their mind with his ceaseless obstructions holding back Iberian greatness. Even beyond the grave his dirty fingers could not help but meddle in state affairs.

He could not trust many of his underlings to undertake such important meetings on his behalf, continuing to push himself as he knew the end result would give him what he so desperately desired.\n\nA clique he thought he had placated with promises of patronage and other concessions now again rallied against him. Officials and politicians within the rotting carcass of the previously representative Union government were calling for even further compromises to be made in order to limit Franco's power. He had believed that these opportunists would resign themselves to the flow of events once they recognized which way the winds were blowing. The Caudillo was astoundingly mistaken.

Little did they know that this was one of the few designated private spaces for politicians and officials of the Iberian government to meet and discuss ideas away from prying ears. Despite the wonderful weather all of the outside tables had been folded up and the heavy curtains had been drawn. Inside three stone-faced men sat and smoked in silence.\n\nThe Portuguese of the group stubbed out his cigarette and broke the tranquil peace. 'You know this is just a ploy for him to silence our opposition?'\n\n'Obviously. That doesn't mean we shouldn't accept the generous offering of the Caudillo. The man still has the power to make us disappear if we don't cooperate,' his bellicose Spanish counterpart shot back.\n\n'He is pushing the Union into ruin, the masses of Portugal will not follow him willingly and I suspect even if we concede many of our colleagues will continue resisting,' came the cynical retort.\n\nThe last member of the group raised his hands slowly to calm his two friends. 'You sadly are both right. And this is exactly why we cannot risk action right now. If the masses were to lose their potential leaders before the spark could be properly ignited, then Franco would win. We cannot allow this.' His companions considered this shortly but then began to nod in agreement. 'Good. Let us see how much we can draw out of the old man. Our acceptance will ingratiate us further with him also.

Was he too old to carry on his mission alone? Was the world changing quicker than he could follow?\n\nThe questions continued to plague him as he absently minded started to chew on his finger nails. This should have been his hour of glory; the Iberian people should have united behind their hero of unification against the outside threats and internal terrorists. Instead he faced a horrible mix of resistance and selfish toadyism wherever he looked. He however knew he could not resign from the task now; history did not favor those who lost nerve at the precipice. Steeling himself up, he stopped chewing on his now miniscule fingernails.

That's what Iberians have told themselves and attempted to believe. It seems their faith was not strong enough.\n\nHistory is an anthology of different stories which humanity has told itself to live and work together. Some in this pursuit alienated others to ensure greater cooperation between initial participants. One of these particular stories is that of nationalism. Now this story was in the process of tearing another apart. The Iberian Union, fundamentally flawed since its conception through the contradiction of its insistence upon equal representation, now stood ready to collapse by political and ethnic tensions. The suppression of minority groups throughout the peninsula by the use of state bureaucracy and force has given rise to an ugly hatred of the political structure in place.\n\nMore severely for the health of the Union however was the gambit played following Salazar's death, by an opportunistic Franco to centralise power upon his own person and hence Spain. Many parts of Portugal had in reaction seen economic standstill, and in some cases open rebellion with Lisbon still in flames. The whole region being in lockdown only further catalyzes the fervor of those who believed more in one story than another. Belief, such a strong tool for the betterment of a society, now stood for the unfortunate disintegration of a union of people."

Believing that his people would welcome the idea was a given. After all it promised progress under the steady direction of a man who had led the Spanish nation out of tremendous turmoil.\n\nHad he been naïve? Of course, Salazar still had many of the Portuguese in his pocket, able to make them dance to his tune from beyond the grave. Neither should it have been surprising that the useless politicians and officials that lined the vast bureaucracy of Iberia would fear for their positions and promptly oppose him. Rather than being localised, the crisis laid bare nationwide opposition and highlighted structural issues which years of political squabbling had not effectively remedied.\n\nFranco knew he now had to swallow his pride or commit political suicide. Before him lay the options for the replacement of Salazar. Only one would now be able to sate the feverous opposition to the regime of Madrid with his calming and reformist politicking.

Combined with the prisoners who surrendered, a hasty provisional prison had to be established.\n\nEven though this was an embarrassing sight, the worst to be caught by the media team was one last prisoner, who had managed to catch a squad by surprise.

 IBR.5313.d:0 "Several complaints have been filed by the Axencia, particularly from their high command. As is fairly obvious, they are the leading anti-separatist force in Iberia, and with this position comes many advantages and privileges. As of recent, the push towards an expanded military presence has brought their ire. Their primary concern is redundancy, they say - the army surely does not need more power to handle anti-separatists, since the job of separatist-busting is already handled by them.\n\nWhat they do not mention are their real reasons for the protests, hidden behind a veil of honeyed words. The Axencia is a governmental agency, much like the army. They feel that their work is threatened by the extra resources going to the military: A classic case of inter-governmental conflict. Regardless, some consideration needs to be made to their concerns, as regardless of purpose they are valid points."
 IBR.5313.a:0 "Why should we care? They'll live with it."
 
 IBR.5314.t:0 "Ringing Down the Hallways"
 IBR.5314.d:0 "It's been a slow day. Every day was slow in an office desk job, but today was slow even by bureaucratic standards. As the man zoned out of his paperwork once more, fighting off an all-encompassing boredom, he could see even the rims of his glasses. He didn't see the paperwork anymore, no, he had started staring at a wall. This was the nature of what he did, he supposed, without frills but one of the safest places in the country. Safe from anything external, anyway. He refocused back on his job - his break was in a few minutes anyway, he could take it to reflect on his life.\n\nCarrying the same sobering weight of an alarm, there was a Noise.\n\nIt was no regular, supposed-to-happen Noise, it was something wrong. A ring, an echo, it was hard to tell. Perhaps a gun? He didn't know how far that sound could go, however. As he stepped out of the cubicle in one-half curiosity, one-half concern, he was pleasantly surprised to see that he wasn't the only person to notice the Noise. Though they all knew there wouldn't be an answer, they asked one another anyway."
 IBR.5314.a:0 "What was that?"
 
 IBR.5315.t:0 "The Council Listens" 
 IBR.5315.d:0 "Another discussion had graced the council. The Caudillos had sent them some more laws to review, and to advise on the best modifications to them possible. It wasn't very glamorous a job, but the duty to the Union overshadowed the fame. At least, everyone seemed to put on the act well enough to look the part.\n\nA man walked in through the door, with seven more besides him. They were very quiet, and exceptionally casual. Were they any more energetic, someone would probably have noticed the firearms and military garb. There were no regular men - these were officers, behind them soldiers. It seems the council noticed when the first man raised a pistol into the air and fired several rounds, creating a Noise great enough to silence any conversation.\n\n"Have I gotten your attention!?" he screams, making sure everyone can hear him."Good! Now, me and my colleagues have a few things we'd like to say..." So the officer spoke. He was Spanish, and his second-in-command Portuguese. They were not Iberian, because Iberia was not a country worth being in- at least, not until a few changes were made. Firstly, the council needed some real power...\n\nOn he spoke, outlining his manifesto for his coup. There would be no negotiation but the capitulation of the government to ending injustice, for the Iberian Council would be staying right where they were until then. If they tried to get them out, well..."
 IBR.5315.a:0 "The die is cast. Let us hope it is good enough."
 
 IBR.5316.t:0 "Chaos in Madrid" 
 IBR.5316.d:0 "A calamity is beginning to unfold! According to generals in the area, a contingent of soldiers and their commanders have mutinied against the Union, holding the Iberian Council hostage in their own meeting place. Numbers are uncertain, but an entire armor crew has defected to them, meaning that the rebels are even more dangerous! They have one particular weakness - their willingness to negotiate means that they could be caught off guard, potentially.\n\nThey need to be dealt with immediately. There is already a mess in Madrid, as law and order dissolve in the face of an attempted coup. The public opinion hit would be devastating! If the Council can be evacuated safely, then this could still be spun as a positive for the masses."
 IBR.5316.a:0 "They've signed their death warrants! It's time to carry them out."
 
 IBR.5317.t:0 "Caudillos Address the Nation"
 IBR.5317.d:0 "The speech was delivered in a meticulous manner, in such a way that nearly everyone in Iberia would witness it. To those using the radio, it was simply voices - the unknown one Caetano. On the television, the matter was much more serious. The Caudillos stood next to one another on separate podiums, both lined with microphones. Iberia was watching, from the highest politician to the lowest worker.\n\n"An unfortunate incident has unfolded in the capital," Franco began. "Some rogue elements have attempted to seize control of the city of Madrid." It was here the mutineers stopped listening, turning their attention back to the affairs of their rebellion.\n\n"In the face of these exceptional circumstances," spoke Caetano, "we request your serenity and trust, and that we have given the Captains General of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force the following order:" The separatists stopped listening, laughing and joking over the rest of the speech. "Any use of force necessary to maintain the cohesion and the unity of the Iberian Union will be utilized without a moment's hesitation."\n\nFranco continued, "We will not tolerate any attempts to, in any degree whatsoever, undermine the Iberian Union by use of threats of violence and treasonous behavior." It was here that everyone else stopped listening, for there was no more speech - for it was all that needed to be said."
 IBR.5317.a:0 "¡Arriba Iberia!"
 
 IBR.5318.t:0 "The Siege Intensifies"
 IBR.5318.d:0 "There were a lot of defectors around the Cortes, variably armed but with enough morale to back it all up. Of course, this was before they were more than doubled by the military bearing down on them. When the tank crew defected in exchange for a lighter punishment, the rest didn't take very long to go with them. Lines of arrested traitors were paraded through the city by their loyalist counterparts, using every scene as a show of strength for the media. It truly was an impressive scene to behold.\n\nMeanwhile, those within the Cortes were much more resilient than their outside defectors. Perhaps it was a revolutionary zeal, or maybe just the confidence that the Cortes provided them. They stood, with every prod towards them declaring that they would not fold except with the acceptance of their demands. It could have been that they expected this, or more likely they had raided the stored provisions the building held. The revolutionaries waited for several days, refusing to be smoked out. More persuasive means couldn't be utilized, since killing the councilmen was a risk - and it would be a disaster if it happened.\n\nAs the situation stagnated, the environment grew more uneasy. What would this do to Iberia, everyone wondered? Could this be a death blow, or a sign of horrors to come? It seems this concern pierced up to even the Caudillos themselves, for the men surrounding the Cortes were given a simple order, to be carried out how they pleased. Straight from Franco and Caetano themselves, it was said."
 IBR.5318.a:0 "Isto remata hoxe."
 
 IBR.5319.t:0 "A Bloody Conclusion"
 IBR.5319.d:0 "Isto remata hoxe - this ends today. It was a very simple order on the surface. The mutineers needed gone, and the Cortes needed to be freed today. The only weapons left that would for sure end the siege were the big guns. Very destructive things, sure to cause collateral; but collateral damage was excusable for the sake of sticking to orders.\n\nThe soldiers went in no holds barred, yet they found their opponent ready for them. Fighting on to the last man, the Cortes was totalled after the last mutineer was pronounced dead. It took several hours to tally up casualties, and worst of all was that many councilmen had been found on the list of dead. Too many. Their bodies could be hidden, but with time their deaths could not be.\n\nThe hamfisted attempt at salvaging the situation had only made it worse, with the damage to the Cortes a monument to resistance, emboldening the separatists with the hope that their struggle was not in vain. They struck at who was not slain in the siege, and without their loyal middlemen the Caudillos had next to no influence, nor the information needed to stop what was about to happen. Their control had faded, and Iberia was quickly beginning to slip the leash."
 IBR.5319.a:0 "Something very bad is about to happen."
 
 #Focus: A Faithful Union
 
 IBR.5320.t:0 "Groups Criticize Lack of Religious Education" 
 IBR.5320.d:0 "Despite our efforts to bring Christian spirit back to Iberia, the attempts to establish further zeal have failed. Or, more appropriately, it has worked too well. We have managed to play up faith to such an extent that many religious groups have taken us totally to our word. Of course, while this is normally not a bad thing, it is a very good idea to back up the rhetoric with some token concessions. We have neglected to do this.\n\nMultiple religious groups across Iberia have criticized the government for hypocrisy, such as how we have neglected a faithful education, even though we have emphasized faith in Iberia. This has brought the more religious sects of the population towards a critical angle of the Union, and it will take some time to repair the sentiment."
 IBR.5320.a:0 "Oh, what do they know."

 #Focus: Encourage the Youth
 
 IBR.5321.t:0 "The Future of Iberia" 
 IBR.5321.d:0 "The future of the Union is its youth. All men grow old and die, and their children will take their place. This is the fact of the matter. Because they are the future, the youth of Iberia are effectively an investment. Like all investments, we have the capability to make a great profit off of placing resources into them. The primary way to do this is their education.\n\nIf we take the initiative to give our students political education, we can effectively control the way they see the world - lasting or otherwise, the legacy will leave a deep mark. Of course, we should still aim for an effective control of their education. We could push the youth into organizing in politics, mobilizing their support to help Iberia. Alternatively, we could uniquely tailor the political message to them, in order to bring them closer to a more conservative point of view. What will we do?"
 IBR.5321.a:0 "Push for higher political youth organizing"

 #Focus: Iberian Grand Prix (dont even necessarily have to do hidden events: just make titles a bit vague)
 
 IBR.5322.t:0 "A Grand Sporting Event" 
 IBR.5322.d:0 "The day of the Grand Prix approaches, and all of Iberia has marked their calendars. Through careful marketing, extensive campaigns, and plain persuasion, the events have become incredibly popular throughout the country - even before they have even premiered. In every major city, many have prepared their televisions for the upcoming show, and the less affluent have memorized where they can listen in on the radio.\n\nMany are deeply entertained, and with their entertainment comes a much more important factor. They are distracted, their attention spans captured by the flashy show. With their minds occupied, it will be much easier to manipulate the opinions of the public. This could prove a lasting smokescreen."
 IBR.5322.a:0 "We should've done it earlier."
 
 IBR.5323.t:0 "The Iberian Grand Prix" 
 IBR.5323.d:0 "Plastered all over Iberia was promotional material, advertising the Iberian Grand Prix, promising no small amount of entertainment for any who wished to watch. The date was rapidly approaching, and as it did the event only grew more everpresent, to such an extent that it was near inescapable. Despite all the media, there seems to have only been limited effect. The rigorous campaign has been unable to inspire more than limited enthusiasm, never truly riling up the population enough to excite them sufficiently.\n\nIt is said that an idle mind makes sinful hands. This is true in Iberia, as without the circuses to distract them many have turned to examining the government, and under public scrutiny we are not as free to act as otherwise. "
 IBR.5323.a:0 "Their loss."
 
 #Focus: The Grand Parade (dont even necessarily have to do hidden events: just make titles a bit vague)
 
 IBR.5324.t:0 "A Powerful Military Showing" 
 IBR.5324.d:0 "The soldiers marched down the street, walking in large rows and holding their guns identically; it was a point of pride, as evidenced by how zealously they kept to formation. They were flanked by cavalry, who ambled alongside the marching troops. Madrid's streets were very busy all day, even through midday, as crowds watched and journalists sought to record the scene and take plenty of photos.\n\nAfter everything was said and done, it seems that the parade has left an impression on many. The population, already riled up, was pushed into patriotic fervor, and the entire event seems to have become a very positive memory. Even though separatist elements seem unfazed, our military was able to put on a very impressive performance."
 IBR.5324.a:0 "I never doubted them."
 
 IBR.5325.t:0 "Iberians Celebrate The Grand Parade" 
 IBR.5325.d:0 "The men march in organized lines, marching as if they were all the limbs of the same organism. Tanks roll behind them, at once both urging the troops on and creating a spectacle for the audience. On televisions all across Iberia, the parade is broadcast live as the military showcases its might. Not harming this, of course, were the news reporters - they had found a particularly flattering angle, and enhanced the parade beyond regular levels using their PR trickery. Not a single thing went wrong all parade.\n\nOf course, the separatists are not terrified by this display, but it has definitely knocked some sense into them. By reminding them of what they are up against, they will think twice before trying to challenge it. The public itself is greatly impressed. It will be some time before people stop speaking of how impressive the parade was."
 IBR.5325.a:0 "God bless Iberia."
 
 IBR.5326.t:0 "Military Parade in Madrid"
 IBR.5326.d:0 "In terms of the sheer expense, one would expect the grand military parade in Madrid to have been impressive. If an event would cordon off so much and use so many resources, it was fair to imagine that they were using them all effectively. Of course, it was also fair to reason that quantity was being used to offset quality. The only way to tell for sure was to see the event itself.\n\nAs the soldiers marched down the streets of Madrid to the scrutiny of regular people and journalists, the latter proved true. Despite the flashy ceremonial intent, the execution proved less-than-ideal. The lacklustre performance seems to have encouraged separatists, and they have started to use the poor use of resources by the military as a piece of their rhetoric."
 IBR.5326.a:0 "We need to have a chat with somebody."
 
 #Focus: State Media
 
 IBR.5327.t:0 "Reinforcing the Media"
 IBR.5327.d:0 "Every good state knows how to keep itself stable. By baton, ballot, or broadcast, every man can be sold, and selling as many as possible is crucial to the continued existence of Iberia. The way we will do that is by reinforcing state media broadcasts, as to ensure our information is the only out there. Our message is the most important part, as we must direct our media outlets in order to actually affect anything. There are two options:\n\nWe may direct our attention towards mobilizing public attention, to inspire them to act in ways beneficial to Iberia. Were we to make use of public mobilization, it would likely come in handy when attempting to garner public opinion regarding public events. Alternatively, we could make use of subtle propaganda. By nudging perceptions slightly here, and doing so again there, we could slowly turn public support away from concepts we do not support. As well, there is also a third option. Since the media workers are for the most part differing in their specialties, it stands to reason that both could be done at once with the proper resources. What will it be?"
 IBR.5327.a:0 "Focus on riling up the masses"
 IBR.5327.b:0 "Focus on subtly implanting propaganda"
 IBR.5327.c:0 "We can do both actually"
 
 IBR.5328.t:0 "A Refined Propaganda Strategy"
 IBR.5328.d:0 "Our goal is clear: We are going to rile up the masses, and court their public opinion. However, we are going to do so in tandem with the use of semi hidden propaganda. It is an ambitious proposal, for sure, but if it is done right we may be able to potentially take the best of both worlds. Our propagandists are unsure of something, however. They are unsure of how best to execute two campaigns at once, and since we are the ones to suggest it, they also want to know how we expect them to operate. We could combine the two, mixing subtle imagery with inspiring tactics to create a system that could rile up the public without them even knowing it. Alternatively, we could simply hold two separate campaigns. How will we work our strategy?"
 IBR.5328.a:0 "Meld them together"
 IBR.5328.b:0 "Separate, but equally important"
 
 #Focus: Cracking Down on Democracy
 #party pops in here lol
 
 IBR.5329.t:0 "The Spectre of Democracy"
 IBR.5329.d:0 "The Iberian Council was our greatest mistake. Even though it was designed solely for advising us in legal matters, it quickly failed to live up to expectations. Worse than that, some parts of the population have latched onto the failed experiment, wanting it and much more from the government. They demand democratic institutions, unaware of what discord they would sow in the Union. Separatists have joined with them, using their underground networks to attempt to amplify the message of the foolish.\n\nIn order to save Iberia from itself, we need to convince the people that these ideals are misguided and wrong. The unclear part of the solution is how. It would be most obvious to launch a grand national campaign, garnering the support of the people and turning it against liberal forces. We need to be careful - if we were to allow such a movement to proceed on totally unhindered it would quickly turn on us. This is why an alternate solution is on the table: It is possible to try a covert approach, infiltrating rebellious media and using it to broadcast propaganda. Either way could work, it is only a matter of choice which could synergize better with our current strategies."
 IBR.5329.a:0 "Launch a national campaign"
 IBR.5329.b:0 "Infiltrate their illicit sources of media"
 
 IBR.5330.t:0 "A Plea to Iberia"
 IBR.5330.d:0 ""What has democracy done for you? It has sowed disunity, weakness, and the last democracy the country had tried to destroy the very foundations of the nation!" Franco stared on, locking his gaze to the camera directly in front of him. He leaned in once again, speaking into the microphones more.\n\n"I do not expect you to know the intricacies of politics, and you ought to be unconcerned with them- the Iberian nation requires all hands to be focused on their role, and you ought to do your part. I beg you, fair citizens of Iberia, to allow us to do what we must! We are going to save this country, and with you all, we will make sure it is never torn apart again!"\n\nThis was not the only speech held across Iberia, and Caetano was sure to do his part, too. The words varied, as did the intended audience, but the message was the same. Iberia needed to stand together, under her Caudillos, and let them save their beloved nation."
 IBR.5330.a:0 "Arriba!"
 
 IBR.5331.t:0 "Iberians Rise Up"
 IBR.5331.d:0 "On, and on, and on, continued the campaigns. It was constant, in the form of radio programs, television PSAs, posters, speeches, and even more tactics besides. It was all designed specifically to rile Iberians up. Only together could they achieve victory, said the rhetoric, and many seemed to take the propaganda well. For every piece of material, it seems that even more people were inspired enough to take to the streets.\n\nIn every major city in Iberia, crowds of people have taken to the streets, in grand public demonstrations of support for their Caudillos. They are standing up to democracy, so they say, and countless citizens attend rallies to show their dedication. Very little police action has been necessary - in fact, more law enforcement have been forced to quell overzealous supporters than public dissidents.\n\nAll this, however, is mostly among adults."
 IBR.5331.a:0 "So... what are their children doing?"
 
 IBR.5332.t:0 "An Uninspired Response"
 IBR.5332.d:0 "All over Iberia, propaganda runs over nearly every medium of communication possible. Television, radio, even by word of mouth. Only together, it says, can we save Iberia. It only grew more intense, but no matter what, the campaign seemed to do nothing. Perhaps it was in how it was delivered, maybe the planning, but no matter what it seemed to utterly fail at truly riling up the public.\n\nNobody seems to be taking to the streets in defense of the Caudillos, roads are usually unoccupied by anyone but those in transit, and rallies rarely attract anyone but their usual crowd. People are unconvinced by our campaigns. They are not inspired, nor are they convinced of the faults of liberalism."
 IBR.5332.a:0 "Let's hope it's true apathy."
 
 IBR.5333.t:0 "The Youth Against Democracy" 
 IBR.5333.d:0 "The youth of those rallying for the Caudillos are not idle. Bustling with the energy of childhood, many have decided to get politically involved, just this once. They have taken to organizing. From universities and schools they gather, getting groups together, preparing routes, and taking to the streets.\n\nIt is being done for our sake. The children and teenagers apply for youth organizations, standing proud and happy at the idea of their energy being expended on proper life skills, and discipline, rather than some rebellion that will get them nowhere in the long term. University students and others of their age come to rallies and separate themselves from their adult counterparts. They participate, adding another grand chorus to the patriotic cries for Iberia - while making themselves distinct, of course. They are standing up against liberalism with their own unique vigor."
 IBR.5333.a:0 "God bless them. We have raised our sons and daughters well!"
 
 IBR.5334.t:0 "Youth in Counter Protests" 
 IBR.5334.d:0 "The youth of those rallying for the Caudillos are not idle. Bustling with the energy of childhood, many have decided to get politically involved, just this once. They have taken to organizing. From universities and schools they gather, getting groups together, preparing routes, and taking to the streets.\n\nUnfortunately, this is for the sake of opposing us. Children and teenagers avoid their appropriate youth groups, banding together to show their rebellious spirit was not correctly tamed. Even worse, students in universities have mostly turned against the Union. Acting with hostility to law enforcement, they have found that hiding in shells of hatred was not enough. They have taken to the streets, showing up to rallies to counterprotest. The students try to yell louder than our supporters, seeking to drown out any show of support they can. The Guardia Civil cannot stop them as easily, as both sides are aware of what firing on young adults would look like. Using this to their advantage, the youth have made life in Iberia considerably more difficult."
 IBR.5334.a:0 "Arrest who you can, don't make a scene."
 
 IBR.5335.t:0 "A Shadow Information War"
 IBR.5335.d:0 "The best way to stop dissidents is to cut off their information. There are several media sources across Iberia - regionalist, separatist, and otherwise treasonous in attitude - that these would-be rebels get their information from. They refuse to get their news anywhere else, so we cannot reach them regularly. Therefore, we will need to get onto the dissident networks. This is the plan - we will infiltrate the worst offenders and slowly shift their perspective on the Caudillos, under the pretense of fairness.\n\nIn slowly changing the information given, we will deprive the worst rebels of evidence in their arguments and change the minds of the more malleable. The people will love us, or they will hate us without reason."
 IBR.5335.a:0 "Let it be done."
 
 IBR.5336.t:0 "Slowly Changing the Narrative"
 IBR.5336.d:0 "From our informants come a series of very promising events. Firstly, they have reported that graffiti upon Iberian state media has decreased drastically. Posters are cleaner on average, with vandalized contents reaching an all-time low. In public, those identified as potentially troublesome have appeared more genuine in their praises - it no longer seems coerced. Undercover operatives have corroborated with similar reports. In more private settings, where open opinions tend to flourish, the worst examples of rebellious thought seem to have cooled considerably, with arguments frequently muddying the waters.\n\nThe Caudillos are starting to be seen in a more understanding light by even their dissidents, at least the reasonable ones,and these people have become less inclined to disagree. This success has only been reported on middle- and older-aged adults. How it will come off to the younger sections of Iberian society is yet to be determined."
 IBR.5336.a:0 "What are you waiting for? Let's see how we did!"
 
 IBR.5337.t:0 "Laughable Attempts at Influencing"
 IBR.5337.d:0 "The infiltration has gone as planned. Loyalist agents have found their way into dissident networks, using modified stories and grand - but not totally fabricated - tales in order to sway public opinion about the Caudillos. Designed to rile up those who watched it, the emotion elicited would then be redirected into support for the regime. Unfortunately, nothing has gone to plan beyond that.\n\nInformants have reported that the "special dispatches" used to rile up emotion have been perceived as ridiculous, taken as satire or as humor by most dissidents who watched it. Lacking in subtlety, the propagandized reports have failed to shift opinion. It is unlikely we will get another chance at this, and we have failed to garner more support."
 IBR.5337.a:0 "I see we've used a hammer when we needed a scalpel, excellent."
 
 IBR.5338.t:0 "A Closing Generational Divide" 
 IBR.5338.d:0 "According to informant reports, the youth of Iberia seem to cherish their Caudillos more than before. They do not have much in the way of definitive proof, however the ways in which younger citizens express discontent - such as vandalism and seditious humor - are reported to have declined. More concrete, probable dissident organizations are reported to have plateaued or even declined in membership. The youth have gotten tired of their treason, likely thanks to our influence.\n\nAll together, the conclusion is that our subtlety has paid off. Because of our effort to specially tailor the message to the youth, the younger Iberians have taken the bait perfectly. Our regime has grown to their liking, with nothing but a coat of paint to bring them along that way."
 IBR.5338.a:0 "If only the rest of the world was this simple."
 
 IBR.5339.t:0 "The Disinterested Young" 
 IBR.5339.d:0 "When the preliminary reports showed no strong change, it was accepted without a second glance. Surely, it was reasoned, this was only because the program had just begun. Waiting for further reports would show the desired trend. Normally this would be so, if somebody had fabricated reports or things had worked as desired. As the results filtered in, and nothing seemed to change, it finally became obvious that something wasn't working. Once the clerks had stopped looking for success, they instead began to look for answers.\n\nAfter much research, they found, without surprise, that the younger segments of the population weren't very interested in our influence. This didn't solve why, to the displeasure of the Caudillos. Facing some proper consequences for failure, the informants have discovered that our influence wasn't popular with the young because it wasn't compatible. "
 IBR.5339.a:0 "All of that for nothing? Who suggested this again?"
 
 IBR.5340.t:0 "The Powerful Traitors"
 IBR.5340.d:0 ""Look at Iberia. I know this union was forced upon you, the people, as it was forced upon us. But how it was created means nothing! We must focus on the now. What has Iberia brought for you now? It has created unity. Our unity of purpose, of faith, and this unity has propelled us to great lengths. There is prosperity and happiness, and morality to keep it all in place." Franco pauses. Some scarce applause comes from the crowd, until people realize the speech isn't concluded. Once it dies down, Franco looks at his fellow Caudillo. Caetano glances around, before speaking himself.\n\n"It has come to our attention that some- traitors have sought to destroy Iberia. A democratic deep state, dedicated to instituting mob rule. From that mob rule, they will create bolshevism. They think that they can simply destroy Iberia, but that is not so! We are onto them, and with the help of you, the people, we can destroy this menace!" Caetano glances around again. "Now you may clap.""
 IBR.5340.a:0 "Applause ensues."
 
 IBR.5341.t:0 "High Ranking Officials Resign"
 IBR.5341.d:0 "Following our speech against the democratic elements of our government, there have been a number of incidents in the government. Several officials, some definitely rebellious, some unexpectedly so, have begun to make a scene by resigning. Normally this isn't an issue, as they can simply be acknowledged and then sent on their way to irrelevance. This will likely not happen this time. Usually, protesting officials take the form of lower clerks or bureaucrats, gears so caught in the machine that nothing happens from them leaving it.\n\nThe resigning cabal is significantly higher in rank than usual, which could give their protests much more credibility. If we do not silence them - for they will undoubtedly speak out - then many formerly high ranking officials will become figureheads, or even worse, martyrs."
 IBR.5341.a:0 "Find them. I knew loyalty was secondary to nothing."
 
 IBR.5342.t:0 "Traitors Speak out Against Caudillos"
 IBR.5342.d:0 "Somewhere in the countryside, a place that looked so nondescript it could have been anywhere, a man faces a reporter, the sort with a penchant for too-many-questions and too-many-answers. The man himself is formally dressed, with clothing that seems perfectly designed to simply melt into a crowd. The reporter does his best to hide the concern on his face as he brings the microphone back to his mouth.\n\n"Well, that... is something, yes. One last question: Do you have anything left to add?"\n\nThe official takes the microphone. "I, uh, think I do. Don't listen to Franco. He is, well, quite simply a snake. He'll stab you in the back and, uh, my message to anyone listening is to get him and the other one gone."\n\nThe interview concluded not long after the final statement, as one damning statement after another found their way across Iberia. First across underground outlets, then through more legitimate stations, the words against the Caudillos managed to find themselves reported to many people, and worse than that, they seemed to be listening."
 IBR.5342.a:0 "Bastards, can't keep their mouths shut."
 
 IBR.5343.t:0 "Protests in Support of Democracy"
 IBR.5343.d:0 "In Madrid, protests were contained early by the overwhelming police presence. In several other cities, the government was not nearly as fortunate. Protests had sparked up, spurred on by the damning comments against the Caudillos, as thousands of people rural and urban alike had taken to the streets in order to defy the government. As the demonstrations were victim to attempted containment, they quickly devolved into plain riots.\n\nThe flash riots took several days to put down. More than that, during that several days democratic ideals had been planted into the populace. Not from any deliberate strategy, but in opposing the government they had come to support what it detested most - democracy. There are now many calls for further freedom, the protection of whistleblowers, and many other liberties that were only conveniences before, but were now mandatory.\n\nThe odds are significant that now, with a populace more conscious of politics than ever before, solidifying our control will be nigh-impossible. Any moves to remove dissidents will be met with outrage, for it seems that most people are more in favor of no Iberia than not getting their way."

They placed him in handcuffs and walked him out of the office, as his coworkers watched on with stupefied amazement.\n\nSeveral others were walked out with similar stories - picked up by uniformed men, charges read to them, and then walked to some form of transit, from which they were driven off to somewhere unknown. This wasn't the only place this had happened, either. Countless individuals were removed and imprisoned in what had quickly become, for them and the ones who had signed the warrants, a purge."

 IBR.5345.d:0 "Unlike the bureaucrats and clerks, the politicians, the higher echelons of the government, were far more valuable for courting opinion. On live television, reporters were escorted to the homes and workplaces of various politicians, conveniently ignoring their common thread of liberalism, and guided by officers through raids and arrests. Several major officials - and many lesser - are detained and walked to a vehicle, surrounded by camera men and reporters from several different news networks.\n\nThankfully, no reporter ever got in earshot of a rebel, and any dissenting opinions were talked over by guides. Nearly every (legitimate) media station in Iberia had someone at several arrests, and we were able to put on an impressive show of force as an example to any would-be traitors."

Forced to defend himself, against fabricated but numerous evidence, he was stuck in a losing case. Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence was the testimony of his coworker, who was able to corroborate many of the bureaucrat's conspiracies.\n\n"I do not know-"\n\n"Do not lie to the court!" snapped the judge."We have documents in our possession proving that he was an accomplice in all of your crimes!"\n\n"I sentence you, Enrique Velasquez, to spend the rest of your life in prison in order to atone for your mistakes."\n\nSuffice to say, Enrique would not be without company."

Firstly, we would like to apologize for the way we were forced to carry it out. However, you, the people, must understand that these steps, while harsh, were necessary to save the Union..." It was perhaps one of the longest and most winding speeches yet, both Caudillos speaking the same words - as Franco was broadcast to Portugal, and Caetano was broadcast to Spain.\n\n"...Finally these matters have been dealt with, and the security of Iberia is nearly assured. All it takes is one last thing: You, the people, the brave citizens. You must help us walk to the future, and with your help we may enter an era of prosperity." At the rallies themselves, applause.

Of course, not everyone in the Union felt the same, but those who truly cared were in the minority. No major events occurred, and the streets of the country's cities remained the same - only men and women going about their day.\n\nIt seems that, following the successes of Tarrafal, dissidents are afraid to protest, fearing their own incarceration.

Crowds of angry nationalists took to the streets, encouraged by their coverage from an ever-fickle media. Attendance surged far beyond what was expected, as a day-long riot evolved into a multiple day affair.\n\nMotivated by the overseas debacle, "Remember Tarrafal" became a rallying cry, a phrase upon which the rioters based themselves upon. Despite having the arms of a crowd of people taking to the streets, they also had a fight on their minds, and they easily found that fight against the Guardia Civil. The riot was not fully contained until several days after, and by the time the last head was given a taste of baton the damage had been done - several minority cities had been victim to rioting, looting, and a whole host of other nasty consequences."

These collaborators also form the backbone of our bureaucracy, not only supplying the state with information but processing it too. We should, of course, reward these men and women for their deeds in service of Iberia, but an issue of more uncertainty is the method we will go about making use of our collaborators.\n\nThese people have worked with the state for many years, and as traitors have long since been weeded out we will never have to doubt their loyalty. There is an issue, however - these people are mostly despised by the natives of their regions, and might have grown complacent in their positions. We could use a potential solution to this by recruiting new collaborators, whose fresh blood could transform their regions into something more productive.

While this would guarantee loyalty, it may not provide us enough manpower to keep things functioning. Therefore, we could let more than just the most trusted individuals participate in higher echelons.

There is a hitch - not everyone in Iberia realizes this, and separatist terrorists would stop at nothing to turn this entire turn of events to their advantage through trickery and deception. Our objective is to make up for that.\n\nWe could play the political game, and use our agents to cut out slack in the regional bureaucracy. This way, we could prepare it for anything thrown at it, offsetting any terrorist gains with gains of our own.

Against the cynical bureaucrats of the regional administration, these agents have been mangled by the political games and, between them, have frequently left humiliated or worse-off than when they began.

Our new collaborators, new faces with believable stories, have been received far better than expected.\n\nThanks to their ability to really provoke a crowd, the new collaborators have seen stunning success in singing our praises.

It was more than likely a mistake to direct our collaborators to disperse propaganda.\n\nKnown thoroughly by the inhabitants of their given regions to be puppets, their hostility to the Union was directed towards the informants.

When the Regional Law was being passed and broadcast over television and radio, the Guardia Civil swarmed the streets, hoping to preempt their opposition.\n\nThey did, to an extent. As predicted, many took to the streets - some rural, but most urban. It took several hours for the first riot to be snuffed, through the others carried on with such fierce separatism that the regional governments were pushed to the edge in dealing with them.

Even more of what they asked for was granted, and some of what they didn't, such as Guardia Civil from regions who had no threat of separatism. The collaborators, trusted as they were, were put to work figuring out how best to stop dissenters. After all, nobody knew the regions quite like the informants, whose insights could place the Union one step ahead of its detractors.\n\nPerhaps there was sabotage, or maybe there simply weren't enough informants to work on intelligence. No matter the cause, the local Guardia Civil was victim to a shocking revelation, as they prepared to move to stop regionalist dissidents; They didn't have what they needed to work effectively. Depending so greatly on a relatively small number of collaborators, there just wasn't enough insight to get ahead of protests.

No matter how well you stamp a rally, it counts for nothing if you can't stop them after the fact. This is a very difficult affair, requiring the dedicated work of administration to keep ahead of the opposition - the only way to stop backlash and lasting opposition is to stop their growth before it can begin. Hence, the administrative importance of being able to outpace them.\n\nThankfully, it seems we have totally succeeded in that regard. Our administration is strong and nimble, with the lethal slack cut out before it was able to kill us. As well, we have enough skilled, trustworthy collaborators to keep it that way, as they all put their masterful abilities at the pointical game towards chasing out corruption and inefficiency.

Containing a protest means nothing if it has left martyrs and an opposition willing to take up the cause the next chance they get. It takes a strong bureaucracy to handle the backlash - it is of critical importance they have the size and scale required to outpace the opposition, no matter how large is necessary, for it is a war of scale.\n\nThis war is one we appear to be losing. The bureaucracy is not large enough to keep up with what is demanded of it. The enemy is gaining pace, capable of sowing dissent and spreading its rebelliousness to previously uninvolved citizens. It is going to leave a legacy of opposition, which will take far longer than any single protest."

There is a process - the bureaucracy must snuff out the backlash, in order for it to truly go away. To do this, the administrative capacity must be greater than what the dissidents can put out.\n\nIt is not. It is totally insufficient for the purpose we require it for. Dissident is growing nearly unchallenged, and with the way it is growing it will not matter how well we suppressed the initial reaction.

The Guardia Civil had been deployed en masse to the minority regions, as the Union was providing everything they needed in anticipation. With the new equipment came even more gear than requested, and officers from non-separatist regions - unquestionably loyal - to help use them. A storm had been prepared for in all places possible, including even the chamber of deputies. Three guards had been assigned to thoroughly search all non-representatives, so that nobody could sneak in a device designed to hurt the representatives during voting.\n\nThis made it all the more shocking when a bomb was detonated during voting. A remarkably high-yield explosive, as evidenced by the building being judged as "unsound enough to warrant an evacuation", though the chamber was not irreparably destroyed. Two of the three guards were killed, with the third remaining steadfast and performing the evacuation order.\n\nThis is an absolute disaster. Somehow a separatist organization has snuck in contraband, even through all of the security precautions. Though no councilmen were hurt, it is shocking that they still managed to sneak through the security precautions. More surprising, however, is that the perpetrator is still unknown - usually by now a group finds some way to claim responsibility for an attack, using it as a point of pride in their propaganda.\n\nNobody has taken responsibility."

Most had the sense to leave, while those that didn't found the agent's promises true.\n\nOf everyone we let in, many were terrorists. This is a total disaster - we let in far too many people, and we didn't have the capacity to totally vet them all.

Only a short while ago, a well-placed plot could have destroyed the country. Now, we are back in a situation where it will take more than a scheme to obliterate Iberia."
 IBR.5375.a:0 "God has saved the Union - that is the only possibility."
 
 IBR.5376.t:0 "Unrest Growing in Regions"
 IBR.5376.d:0 "The new Regional Law has appeared to be the breaking point for many citizens of the minority regions. Agitators - no doubt aided by their separatist brethren - have started rioting. These riots are much more violent than any preceding them, as the protestors have struck back at the Guardia Civil in ways that nearly didn't happen before. Tear gas is being thrown back at the Guard, several groups are getting physical, using improvised weapons to attempt to compete with riot gear. Most worrying, however, is that the men sent in have been shot at, as rifles and pistols are being confirmed as being used against them.\n\nThe situation is primed to only get worse as time goes on, as separatist support seems to do nothing but grow. The Guardia Civil seem totally under equipped for the situation, and the prospect of large casualties dampening morale hasn't done anything to help them either."
 IBR.5376.a:0 "I hope they can hold out long enough.."
 
 IBR.5377.t:0 "Regions in Lockdown"
 IBR.5377.d:0 "Regional unrest is continuing to reach all-time highs and break records. Even though the Guardia Civil put up an extraordinarily brave struggle, the visible turning point was when separatists hijacked a Catalonian media station, broadcasting propaganda to bring more rebels out against the Union. After this event, and a skyrocketing attrition rate with the Guard, the decision was finally made to deploy the military to the regions in order to enforce law and order.\n\nThey haven't succeeded.\n\nThe military presence seems to have inflamed the separatists, and the riots have gotten so intense they likely cannot be contained anymore. With the situation so destabilized, it would only take one decisive hit to the structure to bring it all crashing down on our heads..."
 IBR.5377.a:0 "Fuck!"
 
 #Focus: The Issue of Languages
 
 IBR.5378.t:0 "The Language Problem"
 IBR.5378.d:0 "The Union is extremely diverse, and the same should be said of its languages. In fact, there are so many languages in Iberia that you cannot count them all on one hand. While this would normally be an object of no concern, recent events have brought to light the downsides of having such an excessive number of languages present in the country.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that attempting to run administrative procedures through several different languages will only end poorly, as important descriptions are lost in translation and unnecessary strain is placed on the system as it has to cope with translating to this and that and this dialect and that sublanguage, when the entire process could be a fraction of the difficulty by simply printing in two languages - Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nThis would have its drawbacks, however. We are still currently running the government on Galician, and suddenly shifting over may have consequences. Not to mention that the unrest generated by simply swapping formal languages may outweigh any gain we could create. For this reason we could make a few concessions as a transitory stance, but segments of the government may not approve. "
 IBR.5378.a:0 "Spanish and Portuguese will reign supreme!"
 IBR.5378.b:0 "We can do small concessions..."
 
 IBR.5379.t:0 "Protests for Regional Languages"
 IBR.5379.d:0 "Another crowd has taken to the streets. The same group as always, a core of separatists backed up by a large number of people who, with the new law, had found themselves particularly aggravated against the government. They have assembled to protest the new language policies, chanting nationalist slogans and - in case somebody couldn't hear it - made sure to brandish them on signs, too.\n\nWhile the protests were very simple affairs for the Guardia Civil, a less-than-ideal handling of the situation has created a martyr out of the protests. We have drawn the ire of more previously neutral bystanders, which has in turn given the separatists a larger recruitment ground. "
 IBR.5379.a:0 "To be expected."
 
 IBR.5380.t:0 "Minor Language Protests"
 IBR.5380.d:0 ""These minor languages, perversions of Spanish and Portuguese, infect Iberia, always demanding the world from us for nothing in return..." Franco seems agitated, but stops talking. Caetano instead speaks,\n\n"...We owe them nothing. The strain of even acknowledging their existence is great, and for the Union's sake they will be brought back into Portuguese and Spanish."\n\nIt was quite an irritating message, to put it diplomatically. It seemed that everything was in order to create riots, perhaps even ones large enough to topple Iberia, but then the collaborators intervened. Using careful rhetoric, the collaborators were able to soften the message for relevant populations. As they are seen as quite trustworthy most of the minorities they represent, our collaborators were even further able to soften the message. The end result was a group far smaller than they could have been, easily suppressed by the Guardia Civil."
 IBR.5380.a:0 "Perhaps a raise is in order."
 
 IBR.5381.t:0 "Hardliners Denounce Weakness"
 IBR.5381.d:0 ""We find that the direction the Union is taking, with regards to its stance on languages, to be an insult to all righteous men and women within Iberia. Allowing separatist languages, encouraging them even, is a hypocritical act which..."\n\nFollowing recent concessions, several factions within the government have issued an official protest against the government, backing up their protest by obstructing several functions of the government. Normally even the wildest of the hardliners would not even think to do something like this, but our recent shifts in governing policy have emboldened them, and going back on our course even slightly seems to have knocked them collectively into overdrive. They will, eventually, fall back into line, but their defiance has disrupted some functions of state already."
 IBR.5381.a:0 "Let them run the country, see how long they last!"

 IBR.5382.d:0 "Casimiro Morcillo González, the newly consecrated Archbishop of Madrid, delivered a speech to a large congregation of citizens. Unusually for such an event, it was broadcasted over the radio and live over television.\n\nHis Eminency spoke first of the power of faith, of how a common religion can bind its believers in friendship, solely by the power of the cross. He spoke of union - as Iberia joined together, its people must also come together to work for a better country.\n\nHe addressed God's plan. Nothing happened just for the sake of happening. Rather, everything that happens was a part of God's greater plan, and so anyone who came on hard times had to have faith, for everything would work out in the end, as planned.\n\nGod, he says, put strong men on Earth to guide the weak, to serve as teachers, stewards, and mentors. These strong men are agents of God, and so it is His desire that the same faith be placed in them as is placed in Him. The Caudillos are some of these strong men, and so they must take absolute power. The country must have faith in them, he reiterates, for they will guide it in the correct direction.\n\nHe ended his sermon with a call for prayer. During the sudden silence, many were left to wonder just what this would all mean for Iberia. "
 IBR.5382.a:0 "God bless his soul."

 IBR.5423.t:0 "Responses from Iberian Homes"
 IBR.5423.d:0 "It has not been very long, yet we have already received enough complaints and responses about our new policies that we cannot count them all in a short time. However, it was easy enough to take a small sample of complaints and interpret them instead. If they are at all representative, then our new policies are unanimously disliked.\n\nPeople do not appreciate our austerity measures. Given our status as a rich, western country, in this day in age it is unfathomable to most that they might need to use candles instead of other sources of fuel. They do not understand the value of oil, and want to keep wasting it away. We could divert some oil to civilian usage, which would alleviate most of these complaints for a time. However, we do not have much oil to spare, so we must decide whether using some of what little we have is worth getting people to shut up."
 IBR.5423.a:0 "It is a necessary step to curb consumption"
 IBR.5423.b:0 "Divert some of the oil their way"
 
 IBR.5424.t:0 "Problems with Food Distribution"
 IBR.5424.d:0 "We have gotten people to cook less. It took shipments of food that do not require cooking to the areas around the country, but we have managed to mostly wean people off of food that needs oil. We have drafted a plan, detailing how to feed the country. There are regular food shipments, of fixed amounts, to areas around the country. We do not send more, and we do not send less. So far, it seems to have worked.\n\nSome of the rural areas are complaining that they do not get enough food delivered to eat. They say that our shipments were not enough to distribute, so some have gone hungry. While it is possible that we miscalculated the shipment amounts, it is infinitely more possible that they have not yet learned to ration. Everyone in this country was instructed to eat what was necessary, and perhaps the issue is that they are eating more than their fill?"
 IBR.5424.a:0 "We have to stick to the plan"
 IBR.5424.b:0 "Send it where they are complaining"
 
 IBR.5425.t:0 "The Pains of Virtue"
 IBR.5425.d:0 "The people of Iberia ought to see the silver lining in their situation. A time like this is absolutely perfect to devote themselves to their faith. With the perfect circumstances to fast, and keep along with one another in monklike contemplation, there is no time like the present to truly follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Surely, they would be closer to God if they followed an ascetic lifestyle like Jesus Christ.\n\nHowever, it seems that people have refused to accept this opportunity for religion. According to reports, a growing number of citizens have grown displeased with austerity. Yet more complaints still have come in about the daily lives of many politicians, who have neglected the burdens of faith for proper political aptitude. Why should we compromise, when the souls of Iberians are at stake? Perhaps, this time, the soul of Iberia is at stake too..."
 IBR.5425.a:0 "They will get used to it in due time"

 IBR.5426.t:0 "The Rain Never Stops" #this is the event for iberian wars flashpoint for despotist union
 IBR.5426.d:0 "A new atmosphere had come over Iberia. Where the oil crisis once created uncertainty, there now lies another emotion. Slowly, the collective wonderings of what was to become of the country faded, replaced by a growing resentment of what had become of the country.\n\nHorses plodded through the streets, as burnt wax and hunger returned to Iberia. They were a modern country, right? If they were, then why did they need to regress to such horrid depths? This resentment grew into anger, once they beheld the lives of their betters. The politicians and the generals still lived lavish lifestyles, as if they had stolen all of the people's goods to use for their own. From this anger, Iberia began to decay.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the situation degraded. Terror attacks grew more constant, shielded from retribution by a populace with nothing left to lose. Tensions between the government and the people grew, the perceived injustice too great to bear. Society is ripping itself apart, and it will only take one strong shock to send the entire country tumbling down."
 IBR.5426.a:0 "God help us."

 IBR.5427.d:0 "Despite the efforts to sugarcoat it, to twist the words to make it seem better than it actually is, or just to ignore it, the numbers simply don't lie. It's become clear that the effects of the Oil Crisis will be felt in Iberia for some time to come, as we are in the midst of a slow recovery. While spokesmen say that the economy is recovering from the lows of the Crisis, the skyrocketing unemployment rate, and the astronomical price of gas shows that there will be more pain in store for Iberia. The price of oil is still stubbornly high, which will retard our efforts for economic growth and prosperity for a very long time to come. Economists are already speaking of slow growth, perhaps even a recession due to the government's failed plans and lacklustre initiative. We can only hope that the events will defy the current trajectory at this point, and brace for a persistent and long downturn."

 IBR.5500.d:0 "The icy cold frost had descended upon the tranquil little town during the early morning hours. Not even the steadfast bakers or milkmen had started their gruelling shifts when a small group of blackclad figures descended upon the quiet streets. Their efforts would spell a very different morning for the generally peaceful townspeople.\n\nAlong the stark granite walls of the police station and mayoral office a message of defiance was painted in a horrifying shade of red, a message to be received all around the Union. News of it quickly made its way up the large chain of bureaucracy that defined the Iberian government and landed right in the hands of the security apparatus of the AAS.\n\nElsewhere, similar messages had also begun to appear, whether graffiti, sloppily designed posters or other illicit publications. One thing was certain, a wildfire had been set, with opposition to the regime becoming visible on the streets and walls of Iberia. While some within the Axencia little more than youthful delinquency in the propaganda, others see a dangerous movement in need of stamping out."

 IBR.5501.t:0 "Basque Teenagers Caught Vandalizing"
 IBR.5501.d:0 "News of another display of separatist activity has been relayed internally by the Axencia. A pair of rebellious youths had had the audacity to attack the Bilbao AAS branch office with rocks and other small missiles while chanting freedom messages, in the process smashing multiple windows and allegedly even causing minor wounds to a female secretary. The teenagers, both believed to be of the age of 14, were immediately apprehended at the scene to be taken in for further questioning. The precedent that this attack could set for more daring dissatisfied separatists is yet to be seen."
 IBR.5501.a:0 "Disgraceful display of our education system."
 
 IBR.5502.t:0 "Teenagers Die in AAS Custody"
 IBR.5502.d:0 "The ashen yet calm police chief slowly descended down the cracked stone slabs of the station, with every nearing step to the grand oak entrance doors increasing the blasting cacophony of voices and screams outside. With a quick pause and steady breath he opened them to the unwelcome greeting of harsh camera flashes and unintelligible questions. Raising his hand to try to soften the din he went over the message he had to relay again, already gritting his teeth in anticipation of what was to follow.\n\nThe tragic death of the two youths who had vandalized the AAS Station in Bilbao only to be arrested immediately on the scene was a travesty. Local police had been due to transfer the delinquents into custody to await trial only to find both had died under mysterious circumstances while being detained by AAS agents. Without having the full consequences in consideration the transferring officers had contacted the family of the deceased soon after. If word about this incident spreads, its initial ripples have the potential of turning into full shock waves, ready to incite social devastation upon the already teetering Union."
 IBR.5502.a:0 "You fools, what have you done?!" 
 
 IBR.5503.t:0 "Riots in Bilbao"
 IBR.5503.d:0 "The lazy summer sun warmed the already cracking roof tiles of a town in total uproar, creating an almost amazing contrast to the chaos on the streets of Bilbao. Large mobs had gathered with numerous posters and signs decrying the supposed injustice committed against the two recently deceased youths and their families. Their angry march had taken them right into the arms of waiting riot police who had seemingly little sympathy with protesters while they quickly dismantled the gathering. Numerous ringleaders and those who resisted were arrested without delay, likely not helping a situation that already was beginning to influence the national consciousness."

 IBR.5504.t:0 "AAS Infiltrates Large CNT Cell"
 IBR.5504.d:0 "To say that she looked shifty was an understatement. Quite frankly her whole body felt oddly out of place walking down the shoddy wooden stairs to the hidden cellar entrance. Letting her eyes flit momentarily onto her guide just behind her she was again taken aback by how innocent and normal these people looked. He could have maybe been a school teacher, likely actually was; academia was starting to be filled with these people. The pair stopped at the heavy door blocking the view of what sounded like a relatively large meeting room, larger than what you would expect to find under a regular storefront. Without further thought the undercover AAS agent let herself in.\n\nWith this extremely fortunate infiltration of a large anarchist CNT terrorist group the government security agency has been able to finally map out further plans of revolt and also gain insight into their high morale. With the pyrrhic victory of government forces it should come as no surprise that the rebels feel emboldened in future actions. Their movements will continue to be monitored."
 IBR.5504.a:0 "A lucky catch. "
 
 IBR.5505.t:0 "AAS Infiltrates Small CNT Cell"
 IBR.5505.d:0 "Standing secluded at the sidelines of the clearly rushed and poorly executed meeting it became obvious to the undercover AAS agent in how much disarray the CNT terrorist cell he infiltrated really was. The profusely sweating and overweight leader of the small group rushed in almost 10 minutes late, excusing himself with hushed whispers about how dangerous it was these days and the extra precautions he had to take. At the sight of this walking disaster the security man let his cover slip for just a brief instance, smirking with glee, only to resume his half bored normal state. His reports in recent weeks had been enlightening to the agency. The state of the CNT had been heavily affected by the news of the decisive defeat in Barcelona, recruitment was at an all time low and the situation within active cells was not much better. It would however be foolish to dismiss the terrorists yet, and so the AAS agent continued to participate in this dark comedy."
 IBR.5505.a:0 "They are growing slowly, at least."
 
 IBR.5506.t:0 "Thousands in Lisbon Protest Spanish Dominance"
 IBR.5506.d:0 "A great chatter rose from the cobbled streets of old Lisbon, many windows opened with jubilant people leaning out and cheering the seething mass outside onwards. Yet this was not a parade, nor a military march; were you to listen closely to the deafening cacophony of these proud Portuguese you would realize that this in fact was a strong statement of resistance. Incessant shouts of 'long live the Republic' and 'remember the last union' erupted every few minutes to the great dismay of state press that had gathered along the cordoned off sides of the protest.\n\nThe Portuguese will not tolerate subordination in a union originally formed out of desperation. Franco's iron fist likely will neither help quell nor hinder their capacity of opposition. In fact it may even bring rise to something else entirely. With other separatist action also springing up around the country the stability of the union is at threat on a fundamental level if reform is not enacted quickly and effectively. "

 IBR.5507.d:0 "Banners of resistance wave lazily in the soft Lisbon breeze, as a few hundred anti-Union protesters gather to voice their opposition to Portugal's continued participation in the Iberian Union. The rally is small, barely gathering the attention of the local residents trying to enjoy the holy day after the usual weekly Sunday Mass. The few officers that are standing loosely around the dwindling mass of angry voices snigger every now and then to each other.\n\nYet the significance of this event should not be underplayed. A new and more significant separatist faction has now been added to the already brimming list of previous problems concerning autonomy in the union. This issue will need attention in the long term to make sure that it will does fester from a small localised infection into a great epidemic."

 IBR.5508.d:0 "Local authorities in the port town of Avilés today discovered a cargo ship had a secret compartment behind its normal transported goods holding a variety of small arms and ammunition. With social tensions currently very high anyhow due to separatist tensions this discovery may even spark enough controversy to lead the union on the long descent downwards into civil war. We therefore have to sort this situation with minimal press coverage and wider government interference. It however is unknown where this transport had originally come from which opens entirely new questions as well, the Breton crew which we had questioned extensively gave us no further information except for backroom contacts and intermediaries which look to lead nowhere. Perhaps a mystery we will never solve."
 IBR.5508.a:0 "We find ourselves in dangerous waters."
 
 IBR.5509.t:0 "Basque Terrorists Arrested"
 IBR.5509.d:0 "Through the valiant efforts of a loyal citizen of our glorious Union the security forces were today able to arrest a dangerous group of Basque separatist terrorists in Bilbao. An elderly man who lived in a rather rundown apartment block on the outside of the city had seen multiple suspicious looking men enter the rooms next door and heard them shout and sing rather incriminating things throughout the space of a week. With due diligence he had informed local authorities who quickly came to the scene to discover the group had been plotting an attack in the city center. Interrogation later showed the terrorists had been affiliated with the ETA. With this heroic effort we have saved many lives and guaranteed slightly better stability for our nation." 
 IBR.5509.a:0 "Only through the efforts of our police heroes." 
 
 IBR.5510.t:0 "AAS Successfully Raids CNT Cell"
 IBR.5510.d:0 "Across from the innocent looking shopfront, up high on the roof of a secured apartment block lay a dormant sniper, his scope rested on the entrance of the closed store. In the darkness of the chilly summer night he could make out the shadowy figures of his comrades making their way silently to all the possible entrances and exits of the terrorist hideout they had discovered. Finally the call was given and he watched them storm in, hearing the faint noises of panicked shouting mixed in with a few silenced shots over the radio and across the street. After 5 minutes the street went silent again.\n\nThe successful AAS raid on an earlier infiltrated CNT terrorist cell has brought great spoils, both in terms of information obtained after interrogation and material loot. The anarchists had amassed a good amount of material for their planned attacks on our union. This victory will be forgotten by history, as a sacrifice of equally keeping the devastation that could have been perpetrated out of more important books."
 IBR.5510.a:0 "A swift yet groundbreaking victory for our security forces."
 
 IBR.5511.t:0 "AAS Botches Raid on CNT Cell"
 IBR.5511.d:0 "A scramble on the creaky stairs as a pair of unruly teen brothers rushed down to quickly get to the door, their mission of joining the commotion outside fortunately not foiled by their angry mother chasing them. When they emerged, they immediately began to mingle into the large protest amassing outside. Just one of many around the nation, and these were only the peaceful responses to what had now become a national tragedy.\n\nA few days prior the AAS had botched an important raid on a CNT terrorist cell in Axencia that had previously been infiltrated. Yet due to faulty intelligence the anti terrorist forces arrived at the wrong location, opening fire on innocent civilians. The news quickly spread despite government involvement to cover up the situation. Our nation may be hurting for quite some time after this incident."
 IBR.5511.a:0 "A terrible situation."
 
 IBR.5512.t:0 "The Rise of a Portuguese Separatist Group"
 IBR.5512.d:0 "The unabating whispers of the AAS's informants speak of new, disturbing developments. Separatist agitation has begun to ramp up in Portugal of all places, previously thought of as being the one region of the Union not plagued by petty nationalism. Yet now signs show an increase in leftist organisational and political activity, coalescing around the demand for an independent and socialist Portugal. The forces of the Portguese left seem to be abandoning their differences and uniting across ideological and party lines, something that the Spanish left was not able to do truly 20 years ago during the Spanish Civil War. A single name and banner has been appearing around the cities in the form of anti-Iberian posters and other propaganda: The FSLP, the Socialist Front of Portugese Liberation. These developments will have to be closely monitored and dealt with before anything too drastic can happen."
 IBR.5512.a:0 "A ghost from a faraway past across an undying border."

 IBR.5513.t:0 "Something Amiss in Asturias"
 IBR.5513.d:0 "Catalonia and the Basque countries, both essential regions of our union, yet infested with terrorist and separatist groups, have begun to be a serious problem. The AAS is working tirelessly, scrambling after every hint and possible lead to track these terrorist groups. Rooting out this dangerous disease is however proving to be less of a simple operation and rather a self perpetuating cycle of reciminiations and violence.\n\nSecurity agents in Asturias have uncovered a particularly bizarre phenomenon. It seems that the growth of armed separatist groups has not simply been a product of Iberia's tumultuous political situation, yet had been spurred on by the arrival of more and more illegal arms shipments at Asturian ports, divied up to support small local groups as well as those further across the nation. Interrogation of the smugglers has so far failed to reveal much more about the situation, though it seems increasingly obvious that outside forces are helping spur on the speratist radicalism inside our borders. Investigations will continue."

I do not understand them, and I probably never will. Spain is a beautiful country, and when you bring the entire peninsula then everything only gets more beautiful. I can see why my colleague is so proud of his mandate now." \n\nFranco allows himself a smile, almost even a chuckle, before biting it back down to continue speaking.\n\n"We ought to be united as one country, indivisible, until the Pyrenees! These separatists- these terrorists wish to break apart one of the greatest natural states to exist on God's Earth! I come to you all today to beg you, do not allow these monsters leeway. They are just that, monsters. If they have even so much of an inch, they will take the mile from you at gunpoint. I care about you all, which is why I am so committed to keeping you as well as possible. Never allow these criminals to destroy you!"\n\nThe Caudillo speaks for some time more, and wanders off stage to the applause of the crowd."

 IBR.5521.d:0 "It is no secret in government circles that the Axencia has been in on some unpleasant times. Agency performance is down, and reports have gotten progressively less detailed as the whole organization seems to be sputtering to a standstill. At least they have for the most part been attending to an adequate number of separatists, and are generally passable enough to let be.\n\nThat is, until distressing alerts as to the true function of the department surfaced. The whistleblower is very anonymous, and the information traveled through very tight channels to make sure it was not intercepted. The levelled allegations are very serious, of extreme corruption, rampant nepotism, and a system designed to keep it all from leaking out. The most disturbing implication of all was the suggestion that some reports are faked, meaning the Axencia is not as effective as hoped.\n\nThis is clearly a very serious issue, and making sure it is resolved - if there is something to resolve - will be a high priority. The first question is where to start; there are many facets to the Axencia, and only one can have sustained scrutiny. It may be the fault of a horrible administrative class, which cares only for their own pockets. The military cannot be ruled out, however, as they have very close ties with the organization. No matter where the corruption might be most concentrated, if the rumors are true then both parties will share some level of blame. The investigation has to be very careful.

Waiting time between the shreds has been long and excruciating but as time progressed they became more and more substantial. Now, there is a case to be made. Much of the evidence is not totally verifiable, but enough circumstantial pieces of evidence have come together to make much more than a coincidence. There is clearly something afoot, even if it is not as bad as accused.\n\nThis is something to be taken very seriously. If we take the wrong steps, then it could very well happen that any leads we could have will be squandered under the boot of a corrupt official, covered up and prevented from reaching the higher-ups eyes, one way or another. More investigation is needed, and it needs to be determined where this investigation will be directed. It could be put towards the bureaucrats directly, using force and coercion to force the information out of them. This could go badly, but it has the best promise of results. Alternatively, more subversive methods could be applied to glean information from suspects. No matter the decision, it will need to be handed with tenderness."

It seems during their hunt they found something of the sort.\n\nThere are many concerning links and records during the pair's tenure together, leading to imply something more insidious is happening behind the scenes. It is nowhere near enough to base a definitive case on, but it promises to have more to back it up pending further investigation.

All of these coincidences add up to a near-certainty, and the documents, involving payment and financial management, only make the case even worse. Something has to be done.\n\nThe odds are that the case isn't as deep as expected, but in the off chance that it is worse then it needs to be properly examined. To this end, a route of investigation is necessary. Every option needs to be carefully considered, or else any chance at reform will slip out from under us. The general staff responsible could be directly interrogated, and if they do not clam up could prove a valuable source of information. If coercion isn't sufficient, then we could try simple questioning tactics, and use underhanded strategies to slip a confession out of someone. No matter what, it needs to be very well executed."

A little bit of money to a benefactor, and he could keep a finders fee of his own. How did anyone notice? It was all that damned ring's fault. If he had gotten something cheaper for his lover than none of this would have ever happened.\n\nUnder the cruel lamp light, he broke. They had known everything, down to the tiniest secret. There wasn't enough between him and his benefactor to keep all hell from breaking loose on him if he slipped, so he had to make sure he was kept safe... or that his higher-ups had a brick wall around them. With this in mind, he found a thread in his mind, and began to spin a yarn for his captor audience.\n\nMany critical details have been gained from the interrogation of bureaucrats involved for certain with the case. While what brought them to a confession is uncertain, what is known is the damning length the entire case has within the Axencia. Many are corrupt to some degree or another, but the worst in particular are some of the higher staff. In hindsight, it's not surprising, but such blatant corruption never hurts any less."

There were no blows, no harsh words, no threats of some horrid temporary pain. There were only threats, in a calm and collected tone, of the sentences for corruption, what it would mean for their family, and how much worse being uncooperative would make it. How they knew, the soldier didn't know. What he noticed was how, in their endless droning and questioning, one of the interrogators mentioned leniency. It wouldn't be hard to strike up a deal, and how so much of this could go away if he complied. With a choice like that, the soldier knew what he had to do.\n\nInterrogations have revealed a shocking connection. All suspects have pointed not to the higher echelons of either the military or the Axencia, but the middlemen between them. The people in charge of the Axencia-military joint operations are the most corrupt, going from findings. It is not entirely surprising, but it never grows less disappointing."

The rot within the system was so palpable one could almost physically touch it. Leaving anything in such a state would be a tarnish upon Iberia's honor, and an eternal stain upon her government. Therefore, something needs to be done.\n\nThe first question on the long road to reform is what to do with the corrupt officers in question. They may be liable to a deal, and if proper force is put behind the offers then they may become compliant once more. After all, a greedy man may be partial to reform if reform is the only thing keeping him from a firing squad. On the other hand, who says that these people deserve a light hand? They have been committing crimes atrocious in scale, and who is to say they wouldn't again? Ultimately, it boils down to whether or not this sort of behavior is to be accepted if it can be turned to our advantage."

It is much easier to keep a greedy man working for you, as all that it requires is to make sure his paycheck is on time. These men are exactly that, and the bureaucrats ensure their wealth by draining necessary resources from the Axencia. For the sake of the country, this must come to an end. To force them to comply, some force will be placed behind the deal given to them, but what kind of deal will be provided?\n\nSome members of the inner circle of the government advise the Caudillos to follow a path of compromise, negotiating with the culprits to find a solution acceptable to both. This could work, but may not prove as beneficial as the other solution - of which some of the inner circle advise. It is suggested to come down hard on the men in question, making what would essentially be a threat in exchange for cooperation.

Franco had approached the Axencia bureaucrats with a list of demands, of which he would not budge on. They had done the same. Between the two unquestionable fields was an endless number of conditions, terms, and other minutiae that bureaucrats were so good at forcing into the spotlight, choking anything of necessity with minor detail after another.\n\nPitted against such resilient enemies, the Caudillo was tested in a way he hadn't been for a long time. No men were to die today, but words fought and killed just as well in their place. Finally, after the product of many hours work, a deal was created, agreed upon by both Franco and the officials he wrestled tongues with. Despite some small concessions, it massively favored the Caudillo. Not only has it impressed those working with him, it also appears to be the beginning of a very beneficial relationship."

He was ready to argue, mislead, and ultimately convince the bureaucrats to agree to most of his demands, and bring them into the fold under terms strongly favoring him. It caught him totally unprepared when they flatly rejected his terms, refusing to make a deal under nearly any of the terms he presented them with. When pressed on why they were able to give no end of justifications, the most common of which was their views on other departments. They did not ever get terms like this, they argued, so there was no reason for the Axencia to get them either. For every term they were able to find a similar argument, of how no other organization ever got a deal of this sort.\n\nIt took every part of Franco's persuasive ability to stop them from walking away entirely with their ill-gotten gains. The bureaucrats were unresponsive to a deal, and to even slightly interest them it was required to budge on many terms. It is likely impossible we will get a good deal out of them, but the Caudillo will put up a strong showing regardless. Strong enough, as it happens, to attempt to compromise on many of the issues.

Weakened and discredited by his failure to enforce the terms he sought to set out, the dynamic of power began to move away from the elder Caudillo. His persuasive acumen is one to be admired, however, and managed to salvage the best out of a less-than-ideal situation. Engaged in a contest of words, each side presented issues and tried to split down the middle until they found something to both their satisfactions.\n\nThe end result was the birth of a deal, created not to satisfy both camps but to make both the bureaucrats and Franco agree. It bound the Axencia bureaucrats, if only slightly, but did not stop them to nearly the degree that was intended. Even so, they still appear to be following the compromises laid out, and to that end they have kept the bargain they struck. "

As terrorist threats have ballooned into a progressively larger issue, so has the Axencia expanded to stop them. Over time, the equipment issued to the antiterrorists was mostly police-grade, but as the ever-intensifying war of attrition ticked ever closer to all-out war it was agreed upon that something better had to be done. At first, it was just gear, weaponry, and all sorts of equipment made for the military, put to use in a conflict more relevant than nearly any other. The general staff began to request for joint programs with the Axencia, in order to "better teach them how to use what they were given." Tentatively accepted at first, these programs have grown to become a central pillar of the growing agency.\n\nThese programs have proven the suspicions of their skeptics right. When cautioned against, the corruption threatened by cooperation was typically a central argument. More and more money has been thrown into the fire for the sake of better integration, while it was put into the pockets of those leading it. Without any special intervention, the recent corruption investigation will likely cause these programs to wither and die.

For a long while, these programs were a massive money sink, with money being constantly siphoned out by corrupt bureaucrats. With recent circumstances, it seems that the decision to intervene and keep it around in spite of that was a wise idea.\n\nAxencia operatives have grown better equipped by orders of magnitude, and military equipment that was once rarely seen except with privileged agents is now commonplace. They have demonstrated adept knowledge on the operation of the equipment, and the reports show a large increase in captured separatists. On top of all this, the program's costs have decreased from their extortionate levels to costs that are not only reasonable, but even cheaper than expected.

This, too, was a very good sign.\n\nIt should be no secret, then, that the Axencia has become a hawk watching over Iberia. Known criminal hubs have been busted, leaving almost none to ever escape. Double agents and informants have ripped up the terror information networks, able to throw even the most clandestine of the groups to the wayside. New hubs, safehouses, and resource routes have been raided, detaining all within. Information extraction efforts have skyrocketed in quality, bring news of networks we weren't even aware could exist.

Where they would have been closed down, the channels still remained open, and would remain so by Iberian hands. In hindsight, this was a terrible idea.\n\nAlways considered a 'black hole' of money, where funds would go in and never be heard from or mentioned again, the joint programs were hoped to have improved through Franco's deals. This was not the case. The partnership is nearly identical to the way it was before, where funding would go in, and nothing would come out. There has been nearly nothing tangible to come out of the equipment transfer or the training programs, and when pressed it would always require more funding, or more time, or some other similar excuse. Even though the bureaucrats made a deal, and for the most part follow it, nothing has changed.

It was reasoned that the deals the Caudillo had made would improve the state of the partnership, which unfortunately was not entirely true.\n\nResources still mostly come in and never come out, and it seems that the corrupt have still kept on exploiting the military's gratitude. The deals made by the Caudillo do not seem to have been entirely useless, however, and arrangements have prevented the worst occurrences from escalating into calamities.

The military is much the same way, in that allowing just one bad apple to act out could mean the destruction of the country.

Corruption is a very serious matter, and will be handled accordingly. What is in question, however, is who is to receive the punishment. A safe option would be to prosecute those directly involved with the conspiracy, and whose participation could be easily verified. This would not make as much of a stir. Of course, this would mean not removing their corrupt superiors with them. These generals are those who allowed this to continue on in the first place, and so are equally as guilty.

No matter what steps are taken at the lower levels to make the department operational, nothing seems to have a permanent effect. Therefore, the lower levels are not the ones to target.\n\nIn order for Iberia to survive, something has to be done with the Axencia. It is obvious that corruption in some form is present in the upper echelons of the agency, evidenced by the lack of effectiveness of reforms. These upper levels will need to be curtailed. The only question is, how? It has been suggested to increase oversight of these critical roles, as to prevent them from getting away as much. Of course, this could just be subverted too, but there is always the chance it won't be.\n\nA more radical solution has been proposed too, and it calls for something far greater than just oversight.

There was no celebration among them.\n\nNor was the Axencia particularly celebratory, at first. This demeanor took a change for the positive - especially with the ground agents - as they found themselves with larger stores of resources, improved intelligence, and far sounder ideas. The new bureaucrats, fresh to the positions shaken up by recent reforms, were grateful for larger budgets. Nobody among their elder management was happy, but many of them were replaced by enthused young prospects until the rest took the hint and began to smile, even as they were given the whip.\n\nFranco had made the enemy of a large segment of the older guard of his administration, as they all saw the reforms and removals to happen to their cliques and niches too.

Never before had documentation gone missing in such vast quantities, a record the Axencia was sure to soon break.\n\nGiven the resistance to investigation efforts, the hopes of anything fruitful being found is dashed. Our chances of success are rapidly dwindling, and with them go the goodwill of the administrative cliques. The higher ups presented this line of reasoning when questioned on the progress of the search for corruption, and wish to change pace in order to find something in another field. Some, however, have requested permission to persist, insisting that something can still be salvaged out of the situation. What is our course of action?"

 IBR.5545.d:0 "Day sixteen at the office. Manuel was filled with dread at the day in front of him, as that shady government bunch kept asking people questions - dangerous questions. His little side-project couldn't stay a secret forever, no matter how much in bonus payments he got. It wasn't a matter of greed, not at all, but of consciousness. Manuel had never kept a secret like this in his life and it was only a matter of time until he slipped up. If he went down, then so would everyone else, and he had no doubts that they would drag him down with them.\n\nHours pass, and he's never pulled aside for a 'quick question, never tapped on the shoulder and requested to 'satiate some curiosities'. He pulls open a drawer on his desk, and views the paperwork. That damned paperwork, putting this here and that there. It was going to be the death of him.\n"Manuel?" He stiffened. Slowly the drawer slid closed, and he turned around very slowly, as if pretending nothing would be there would make it all go away. "You seem uneasy, are you sure you'll be skipping lunch break?"\n"Y-yes, yes, I'll be perfectly fine. It's only just a side project of mine." Keep it cool, get him to go away.\n"Oh-kay, then I'll leave you to it."\n\nThe other worker, once he was safely out of earshot of any prying ears, located a telephone. It was here where he muttered a single sentence, "Agent Escarabajo here, I think I've got a lead.""

He had gotten things prepared for himself and his lover - thankfully he had no kids to wrangle, yet - and exchanged all his money for dollars. Even through all of this, he didn't feel safe. Police could storm the plane at any moment, and drag him out with tears in his eyes and shackles on his hands. It was only once he was in the air that he felt truly safe, and the pull of sleep gradually replaced all his stress.\n\nAfter their location, several suspects who had been key to the investigation have fled the country. It seems that our renewed audit was at fault for driving them off, and as they make their exodus to other countries the chances of getting any conclusive evidence rapidly drops to zero. If we had acted sooner, it is entirely possible they could have been properly extracted and questioned."

 IBR.5547.d:0 "Nothing could stop the rot within the Axencia.Those involved simply carried on, having blocked any efforts to prevent their misdeeds. Every attempt to change something was shot down, blocked, or flat out ignored by those that needed curtailed the most. The most critical proof needed to strongarm the suspects into compliance was missing, meaning that there was no real leverage. Without that leverage, nothing could be done.\n\nEven though there seems to have been at least some moderation to it all, things have barely changed. The Axencia is a black hole of resources, and has proven immune to anything trying to change that. The department is only seen as an easy way of getting rich, or of an easy job to get credentials for future work. Unless they suddenly disappear, the separatists of Iberia are at a strong advantage."

 IBR.5548.d:0 "Even against a rigorous corruption investigation, the corrupt officials associated with the Axencia proved resistant. Every attempt at information found its attempts blocked, held up by some technicality or another. Every reform was stonewalled, or dumbed down so far as to not accomplish anything at all. When the authorities went to arrest those involved, they found that they could not, as they did not have any proof as to work with. When the issue of reform was left to the department itself, promises and assurances made way to nothing at all.\n\nWithout anything to moderate the filth of the department, it has certainly changed - for the worse. Resources go unused as much as they are stolen, and with their equipment the best agent could struggle to catch even a petty thief. Everyone has noticed this, and the Axencia has become the butt of countless jokes by the public. Even worse, seperatist organizations have taken this as their opportunity to run rampant, and with the Axencia's state it cannot hope to stop them. It is all because of Franco that it did not improve, and so he must approve of it. Many are displeased, most of all the upper echelons of government, that this was what he would call a department. "

 IBR.5549.d:0 "An unexpected happening has occurred, in which an unknown employee involved in the Axencia-military joint programs has come forward to deliver anonymous tips as to the state of the partnership. While we believe he works for the Axencia, he has not provided an identity as to avoid a reprisal from superiors. The information he has provided cannot be verified, but it appears to be consistent and suggests unfortunate implications for the state of the partnership.\n\nGiven the depth of the information, it has been recommended that the superiors in the Axencia be alerted to this turn of events, and their claims verified or rejected. Additionally, it could be used to question the extent of their involvement in the corruption that plagues the Axencia. This strategy may not be advisable, however, as if they are really involved then they will be alerted to a leak. Should they plug it, it would remove our best possible lead towards investigating the case. What is the plan?"

If not, then they were to prove they were not true. They were given three days to respond.\n\nMuch than quicker than three days, they bit back with a flat-out rejection of the claims, and called their validity into question. Presenting records showing a much cleaner record than suspected, they conceded that there were some small inefficiencies, but nothing of the sort which was being leveled against them. As well, they also called the legitimacy of the accuser into question, stating that an agent with 'something to hide' probably did not have genuine allegations.

The mid level administrators, much larger in number, are certain to have at least one person who is aware of what's happening. If that one person can be found and the information brought out of them, then the entire audit could be flipped on its head. There is only one issue, and that is finding the man in question. Two methods have been determined, and each is roughly equal to one another, so a final authority is needed to decide between them.\n\nThe first method is to just take a group and bluntly inform them of what we want from them. We will lay out the allegations, present the evidence, remind them of the consequences of this crime, and how they may receive amnesty if they cooperate. While it runs the risk of galvanizing those interrogated into not speaking, by reminding them of the consequences, some may be more inclined to cooperate.\n\nThe second option is to attempt a more subversive strategy, and instead of just asking directly to instead deceive the accused. We may get what we want out of them by using false circumstances, and luring them into making a mistake. Even though the whole thing is dependent on someone slippin up, it makes for something much more subtle than the alternative. Only the best will be put to it regardless, but which plan will be used?"

It was full of documents, photos, and even a testimony.\n"You are involved in a corruption scandal, and you know it, and we know it too. Why not give yourself up now?" Examining the reaction on the bureaucrat's face was enough. He had him. "Besides, I'm sure you know what happens to enemies of the state... Unless, of course, you cooperate. I'm a very reasonable man, and I can tell you don't want to have a bad end."\n\n"Okay, okay! For amnesty, I'll tell you. What do you want to know?"\n\nMost denied their involvement outright, but when faced with the proof that showed their involvement without a shadow of a doubt, some changed their tune. For promises of amnesty and to be let off the hook, they will corroborate the investigation and its reports. Enough so, to bring definitive credibility to our cases. It looks like we have what we need to make this a legitimate issue in the eyes of the Axencia leadership."

 IBR.5553.d:0 "Just asking if they are guilty or not will probably not get many to bite, even through all the other facets planned. Just the same, repeatedly asking almost pointless-seeming questions about Axencia functions will certainly not lure anyone in, and may make some suspicious. If they are suspicious, then they may be malicious and deceive us. Something will need to be used to justify the lure, and for that we will need to come up with a pretense.\n\nSince there is a routinely scheduled inspection coming up, it would be possible to replace the usual corrupt, ineffectual administrators that man it with loyal agents, who would interrogate bureaucrats about the minutiae of daily operations in the Axencia. No-one would know any better, and since it is only a small modification to what they are used to, they may still answer honestly - as it was already set up so that they do not compromise any of the information we need to know. Some may not fall for it, but others certainly will.\n\nAlternatively, though it may cost much more, would be to set up a celebration to commemorate their successes. This could be used as a front to ask them compromising questions, and for the promise of money they will certainly fall for it. It will be easy to set up, and if anything the hardest thing will be finding a victory for them to celebrate. Which plan will we put in place?"

" He shuffles, shifting his glasses up with a finger. "But, we also need to make sure that you know how everything works. Don't take it personally, it's just that people can sometimes slip through the cracks. I'm going to ask you a few questions, okay?"\n\n"Okay."\n\nThe bureaucrat was nothing if not cooperative, and he seemed very relaxed. Every question he responded to, the results were recorded, to be compared later.\n\n"...Finally, do you mind telling me who heads your department?"\n\n"Oh, yes! It is the marrrshallll-... of financing! What an easy question."\n\n"Well, nothing seems very wrong on the surface, we'll get the final results back to you." The man walked away, and as he made his way out of the building he compared the responses he had hastily scribbled down on his clipboard. There was a marshall, sure, but he didn't see to finances.

Quotas were lower, and there was an air of joviality, especially with the decorations around the place. On top of it all, a large bonus was offered to a number of randomly selected employees, by means of a raffle. All it took to be entered in was to make sure they were caught up on their work. So he did, and his name was drawn. He was escorted off to a side room by a clerk, who held up a check, for an immense sum of money.\n\n"So, I heard you were good at keeping up with your work. That's great! I have your bonus right here, nearly fully prepared. Now, some people like to try and fake their reports to get rewarded for nothing. While I don't think you're the sort to do that, I need you to answer a few questions, to make sure you know what you're doing. First, you need to describe to me your day-to-day operations..."\n\nManuel wasn't listening past there. His eyes were locked on that check, and everything he could do with the money. Though he still kept the ruse up for a while, he was so fixated on the bonus that he wasn't entirely aware of when he went through the less legal sides of his daily work, nor did his interviewer care to alert him. Eventually, Manuel got his money, and left as the clerk was alone to evaluate his findings. Manuel wasn't the only one to slip up, and when the evidence from every interviewed bureaucrat was compared, it painted a fairly damning picture."

There was going to be a deal before he left, Franco explained, or else there would be Hell to pay.\n\nThe leadership did not feel the same way. To them, the evidence was unsatisfactory - they thought much of it circumstantial, and many of the testimonies misinterpreted. Additionally, they did not think there was enough evidence to validify the circumstantial testimonies. Above all, they found that the problem Franco was presenting was nothing like what he had made it out to be. Regardless, they did concede that there was an issue, and that they would make a deal pledging to solve it.

Even though he put the best of his dealmaking ability to the test, it simply wasn't enough to create a sufficient arrangement.\n\nWhat he was able to arrange was enough to stop the worst excesses of the Axencia, and create something that was arguably functional, but he was unable to stop it entirely. For the most part, the money crossed hands under the table, from governmental coffers, to the unhelpful clerks. There was no denying that what was in place worked vastly better than it did originally, but that did not mean much. Separatists were still able to move around the byzantine system, but now they at least had to watch their feet a bit more closely."

Despite their attempts to refute the evidence, it was simply bulletproof. Much of it could be interpreted as circumstantial, but all together it could not be disputed. Begrudgingly, they accepted the evidence, and their role in the situation. The Caudillo had the upper hand at the bargaining table. He dictated terms to them, and they were forced to agree.

Even worse, the military seems to be spurring it on, putting an emphasis on their pockets before their country. It is, quite frankly, sickening. Making enemies and fearful men out of the military is never a good idea, and so threatening them cannot be a good idea either. Alternative methods need to be applied, and the only question is what kind.\n\nThere are very many obvious suspects, of whom have dubious track records and a less-than-stellar character. The common link between them is that most are involved in the Axencia-military joint programs. It would make sense to investigate them primarily, for if anyone were to want to leech off a government program, it would definitely be them. Alternatively, there may be some higher planners to investigate. Many officers are schemers, and so it is possible that one is involved in these unscrupulous deeds, besides the obvious ones.

It also so happens that those that struggle to meet expectations frequently are the most closed off, offering little insight into just why exactly they could be doing so poorly.\n\nAs these programs are ultimately subordinate to the final word of the military command, of which is willing to do as we say, it would be possible to just order them to open up, and share their financial records in particular. They couldn't object to the formal chain of command. This is only if we want the documents now, of course. As possible as it is to have their records now, it is just as possible to wait, and let them show their hand while we gather more information.

We have waited for a greater opportunity to present itself, and now just that has occurred.\n\nInvestigation into those directly connected with the most corrupt of the Axencia-military joint programs has uncovered some very incriminating results, and between what can be found of them and the testimonies of current and past coworkers, even more information has come out to further prove our case.

Some are from disgruntled former employees, others from the wronged seeking comeuppance. At least one, as not all of them describe their relationship, was of a current employee knowing he will be caught, and offering evidence for a pardon. Even though they have been entirely unresponsive to these, their build-up has finally caused The Rots to crack.

Both were willing to make some concessions to their goals, but for the most part they were irreconcilable. One should never say they didn't try, however, as both were aware some sort of deal was necessary, and they tugged it towards their favor.\n\nDealmaking and speech were put to the test. It was a duel of words, and were it physical it would have gone down in history as one of the greatest battles to be fought. Its duration was of a similar stature, taking several hours before a final arrangement was reached.\n\nNo matter how hard he had tried, the Caudillo simply did not have the upper hand in this session of Iberian Negotiations - that is, glorified arguing.

When the first day of questioning ended, there was still nothing to be found for results.\n\nA few hours later, a suspect finally broke. In almost exaggerated fits of tears, he described that he knew where some evidence could be, and that he had some paperwork he thought would help. All he wanted was to be spared, and to go home to his family. He directed the location of these documents to his interrogators, hidden in his office, in a very particular location. A few men were set out to find these documents, and verify their legitimacy. Unfortunately, what they found was very worrying.\n\nThe documents uncovered were very explicit, and the information they contained was damning. There were certainly money transfers happening, the volume of which matched the funding reported missing by other clerks.

Nowhere was spared, and none of the locations searched had the documents. Even with a triple check, they were nowhere to be found. It seems that there will be no finding them. Given the time it took to complete the investigation into the Policía, they probably destroyed the documents at the time. If we had kept surveillance on them, then it could have been stopped before it happened. Without that paperwork, there was no evidence, and with no evidence there could be no purge."

 IBR.5570.t:0 "An Unlikely Voice Speaks Up"
 IBR.5570.d:0 "After we expanded the scope of our investigation into the military, the investigators were unsure how quickly we were going to find something of interest. With how much time it took, there clearly wasn't much to find. Just as they were preparing to give up and focus elsewhere, someone has gotten in contact with them. What they heard next made up for all of the waiting ten times over.\n\nIdentifying himself as an anonymous agent within the Axencia, he had noticed that we were investigating the Axencia-military partnership. As he himself was closely working in that partnership, he had quite a few things to say. There was talk of corruption, bribery, and all-around unprofessionalism from within the joint programs, elaborating on these issues in such a way that left nothing to imagination. Nothing could be doubted: This man was associated, and his allegations said nothing good about the whole affair.\n\nWe could raise this issue with the military officers, who could take a decisive stance to force this issue to closure, but this isn't without risk. If the officers are involved, then they may just dismiss the claims outright and stop our leaker from speaking any more. If we wish to do this instead of allowing the evidence to pile up to an overwhelming level, then it is done taking the chance that they are compromised."
 IBR.5570.a:0 "Raise the issue to higher ups in the military"
 IBR.5570.b:0 "This is too risky..."
 
 IBR.5571.t:0 "Military Higher-ups Reject Claims"
 IBR.5571.d:0 "The allegations were provided to the generals presiding over the military, with proof to back it up. They were instructed to consult their records, and themselves, to see if anything of the sort was true. If it was, then it was to be fixed and the steps taken described. If not, then they were to prove they were not true. They were given three days to respond.\n\nMuch than quicker than three days, they bit back with a flat-out rejection of the claims, and called their validity into question. Presenting records showing a much cleaner record than suspected, they conceded that there were some small inefficiencies, but nothing of the sort which was being leveled against them. As well, they also called the legitimacy of the accuser into question, stating that an agent with 'something to hide' probably did not have genuine allegations. Finally, it was added that, while they were always free for further inquiries, it was requested that they be actual inquiries, since these took large amounts of time and effort."
 IBR.5571.a:0 "Bah! How honest are they really..."
 
 IBR.5572.t:0 "Where in the Armed Forces to Look?"
 IBR.5572.d:0 "There is no mistaking the Iberian military as the pride of the country, and its size only serves to better make the case. It has many departments, subdivisions, and internal division, forming an almost byzantine level of bureaucracy and size. As we are investigating corruption, we must be expedient. There is no time to waste wading through red tape, and there is no simply cutting it and moving on. We need to pick our targets carefully, though we have plenty to choose from.\n\nThe military is vast, but the targets are narrowed down by their relevance to the Axencia partnership. The obvious choice would be the Policía Armada,who is notorious for maintaining a fierce rivalry with the Axencia in the cutthroat political environment. Since they are so hostile, it could be reasoned that they both have incriminating information on one another. Taking this information and applying it could be a great boon to investigation efforts, and they would be glad to hand it over for the sake of a rivalry. Alternatively, there are the units who have partnered with the Axencia. Responsible for much of the equipment and all of the training, they are very closely associated with the agency. If anyone will have an idea on the corruption, it would be the groups working with them. Who will have the evidence we are searching for?"
 IBR.5572.a:0 "They have rivals in the Policía Armada who could help"
 IBR.5572.b:0 "The units tangential to the accused should know"
 
 IBR.5573.t:0 "Policía Armada Pledges Internal Investigation"
 IBR.5573.d:0 "When they were inquired about their documents, the Policía Armada were somewhat lethargic to respond, but seemed to grow much more spirited when it was mentioned that it was about the Axencia. They were even more eager still when it was brought up that the investigation was over Axencia corruption. Off the record, they were very willing to see if they had anything on the agency's corruption, especially if a bit more funding was in it.\n\nThe Policía Armada leadership pledged to commit to a thorough internal investigation and audit of all their documents, from start to finish. They were going to see if they had absolutely anything on the Axencia-military joint programs, and if they did they would share it with the government immediately. Since this is a total audit, it will probably take several weeks for them to finish. The department is remarkable for breaking records in efficiency for sorting through paperwork, and with such a motivator they will probably be even more efficient than normal. It should indicate the size of their bureaucracy that it will take them several weeks to fully evaluate all their reports and information. On the bright side, we can rest assured that they are certain to have something, as the odds are better than not that there is something hidden within their records."
 IBR.5573.a:0 "What will they find?"
 
 IBR.5574.t:0 "Documents Prove Corruption"
 IBR.5574.d:0 "It has only been a short while since the Policía Armada initiated their internal investigation. They have stated that, while it was much swifter than usual, the speed was due to their specific targeting. Their documents had been very well sorted, and so it was very easy to comb the relevant section to find what they wished to find. The rest is still ongoing, but they had found what we wished for them to locate. We would be informed if they come across anything else that was out of place.\n\nOn investigation and verification of the documents, the designs check out and do not appear to be forged documents. Going off of the information contained within the papers, our suspicions seem to be true. The Policía Armada had located the exact transaction, and it took just one look to see that something was off, and just one more to see what was being done wrong. With this information, we have the case we need, and all we need to do now is to act on it."
 IBR.5574.a:0 "Confront them!"
 
 IBR.5575.t:0 "Collaborating unit Provides Proof"
 IBR.5575.d:0 "After placing an inquiry with a unit closely involved with the training and equipping of Axencia operators, it seems we have a definitive lead. They were reluctant to oblige at first, not appearing to wish to so much as acknowledge our request. That is, until Franco himself ordered them to investigate the case. They answered our call very quickly following that, and said they would look right away for evidence. The unit's officers tripped over themselves to provide a vast amount of information, of which seemed legitimate enough at a cursory glance. They were also able to hand over the most valuable proof of all - financial records.\n\nThe Caudillo was quizzical, what would push them so far if they were otherwise unwilling? Again, they were very quick to respond: they were the military, and Francisco Franco was their Caudillo. Their loyalty to him was unquestionable, and they were pleased to show an opportunity to demonstrate it. If he needed anything else, they would be able to provide."
 IBR.5575.a:0 "How odd... but we will not complain."
 
 IBR.5576.t:0 "Confronting the Accused"
 IBR.5576.d:0 "The evidence was ready, prepared in totality for a meeting. Franco had ordered the investigation to commence, and he insisted that he would see it through to the final steps. Even though the initial reaction was downright derisive, the Caudillo was fully confident that the next time he brought it up it wouldn't be ignored. He had an ace up his sleeve - and it was evidence. Acquired by other means, the evidence was summarized and placed into a folder, creating the nail in the coffin of his rivals of negotiation. Countless testimonies, records, and especially the financial audits created the basis for this powerful document, and he was going to milk it for everything it was worth.\n\nFranco will not stop until he gets the terms he desires, harsh contracts designed to stop any more money siphoning from happening ever again. He will place every last bit of his persuasive ability in to make sure of it. The bait is already set, as the date marches closer to the meeting which will surely doom his opponents."
 IBR.5576.a:0 "Best of luck!"
 
 IBR.5577.t:0 "Policía Armada Documents Fabricated"
 IBR.5577.d:0 "The negotiation was going forward as anticipated. The generals were skeptical, despite the Caudillo's best attempts to convince them otherwise. They seemed impatient, so Franco played his master stroke, and slapped the folder full of Policía Armada findings on the table. It would be wonderful to see them recoil. Now he would wait for them to re-\n\n"Señor, you are aware these are fabricated documents, right? There is a man in the Policía that frequently does this. I can recognize his trademark anywhere, his statistics are always the same." To Franco's shock, the general spent the next few minutes utterly dismantling Franco's arguments, leaving him with nearly no ground to stand on. Even worse, he was slightly embarrassed by it all. Regardless, he was able to talk some way to something, with the generals conceding that something would be done to rein in corruption, but that the issue was nowhere near as bad.\n\nThe first thing the Caudillo did was order the particular bureaucrat - whose identity he had been informed of - executed. In hindsight, perhaps it wasn't a good idea to trust such quick findings. Total investigations take much longer, and that it was finished so quickly should have been a red flag. This should have been expected out of a department that despised the Axencia; for more resources these lackeys would do absolutely anything."
 IBR.5577.a:0 "Anything is much larger than we thought."
 
 IBR.5578.t:0 "Harsh Terms Accepted by Military"
 IBR.5578.d:0 "The negotiation was going forward as anticipated. The generals were skeptical, despite the Caudillo's best attempts to convince them otherwise. They seemed impatient, so Franco played his master stroke, and slapped the folder full of corroborated partnership information on the table. It would be wonderful to see them recoil. Now he would wait for them to react to the findings. Franco saw it as it happened - impatience turned to alertness, and from there to fear. It looks like this conspiracy was a bit deeper than he thought, and now in the best way possible.\n\nBy applying the threat of punishment, the Caudillo was able to ply a very advantageous deal with his generals, much harsher than what he had intended originally. The corrupt partnership programs would be adhering very strictly to this new policy, or else the generals in charge would be taking most of the punishment. After all, they would be the ones enforcing it. If they couldn't, then it would be their necks on the line. The Axencia-military partnership will not have any more issues regarding corruption."
 IBR.5578.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 IBR.5579.t:0 "Unit points finger at Policía Armada"
 IBR.5579.d:0 "In order to find the direction of the funding that seemed to disappear within the Axencia, it was opted to ask one of the units that worked with the program, whose corruption was liable to be less than the usual within the agency. Their response was sluggish, but when pressured by the Caudillo they finally gave a response. The leadership was certain they could find documents about what was wanted out of them, but it would take time.\n\nEventually they did present some evidence pointing us in another direction, as well as some testimony of their own. The Policía Armada and the Axencia had been nearly at war for a long time for resources, and so the former had decided to take budget from the latter. The money is being redirected through the Policía Armada, and into the pockets of their leadership and the officials who stand by it. There is no time to waste!"

 IBR.5580.t:0 "A Weak Deal on Joint Programs"
 IBR.5580.d:0 "While less than ideal, what we had was enough to at least get something done. Despite Franco's persuasive ability, there ultimately wasn't enough concrete evidence to effectively pin down his opponents. The Caudillo was never the sort of man to give up if he couldn't secure a total victory, so instead he opted to push for the next best thing - a slightly weaker deal.\n\nUsing what he had, Franco was capable of placing pressure on his suspects. It turned out to be enough to bring the criminals to skip the formalities. In exchange for their cooperation, they were given leniency, and put towards creating a larger case. That same larger case was enough to bring the real masterminds to heel, and a deal put in place to stop their efforts. It isn't perfect, full of compromise and middle ground, but it is better than just letting them run amok."
 IBR.5580.a:0 "Well, anything has to be better than what we're fixing."
 
 IBR.5581.t:0 "AAS Still Struggling"
 IBR.5581.d:0 "After an investigation into the Axencia's practices - and who or what was causing them - it seems like there was no reason to conduct it. The evidence found, if it was found, was frequently inconclusive and gave the appearance more of a taunt, as we had nothing concrete to work on. Since there was nothing but gut feelings to conduct business on, it follows that there was no business that we could conduct without an innocent being affected.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems our culprits feel the same way. Since we had no arrangement to bind the culprits, they were allowed to run free. Much of the worst has continued unabated, and separatists have taken advantage. There are certain runarounds to the system, and without a reform to patch them up they have grown better-known, and commonly exploited. Most terrorists now run circles around the Axencia, and the only silver lining is that they also seem to have grown complacent."
 IBR.5581.a:0 "What does it matter if nobody is willing to take advantage of their complacence?"
 
 IBR.5582.t:0 "AAS in Dire Straits"
 IBR.5582.d:0 "There is no end to the misfortune of the Caudillo! Nobody was able to be found to assign blame, not even a likely suspect. It was the perfect crime - and the Axencia was the perfect victim. No examples could be made, regulations were undercut, and in the end nobody took the fault for their actions.\n\nWe cannot apprehend ghosts, and what we have brings our culprits to just that: ghosts. Without so much as a stray intern to put up to the firing line the suspects have no reason to stop what they're doing. We know they are in the joint programs, and somewhere within there are our suspects. They have grown wary of our audits, and the chance to apprehend them has passed. Things are deteriorating quickly and it's only going to get worse from here..."
 IBR.5582.a:0 "How much is it going to get worse? I'd have thought we've already hit rock bottom."
 
 IBR.5583.t:0 "Franco's AAS, a Public Mockery"
 IBR.5583.d:0 "In many ways, it has turned out the Axencia is remarkably similar to the military. If you were to place them together, they would seem the same in every way that counted - that is, they are both as corrupt and nepotistic as one another. Ranks are filled with the friends of those above them, money exchanges hands freely, and the situation has devolved into something horrific. It has become a saying that you cannot get anywhere in the department without a loose wallet, and the encouragement for being promoted has become the ability to eke a bit more out of your underlings. Cliques are commonplace.\n\nFunding goes in, and undoubtedly mostly goes to the pockets of the corrupt. Agents are poorly trained and have access to even worse equipment. The terrorists of Iberia cheer, for now they can work nearly unimpeded. The public groan, for now they have to work with an agency clawing and striking blindly in an attempt to justify its presence. Franco's role in the whole affair isn't forgotten either - he was the cause of it all, and many know it."

 IBR.5584.d:0 "Some time has passed, and in that period even more evidence has come out as to the actual day-to-day operations of the Axencia. Waiting time between the shreds has been long and excruciating but as time progressed they became more and more substantial. Now, there is a case to be made. Much of the evidence is not totally verifiable, but enough circumstantial pieces of evidence have come together to make much more than a coincidence. There is clearly something afoot, even if it is not as bad as accused.\n\nThis is something to be taken very seriously. If we take the wrong steps, then it could very well happen that any leads we could have will be squandered under the boot of a corrupt official, covered up and prevented from reaching the higher-ups eyes, one way or another. More investigation is needed, and it needs to be determined where this investigation will be directed. It was suggested to put it towards the bureaucrats directly, using force and coercion to force the information out of them. This path is sadly untenable with the political situation as it is, despite the possibility of great results. More subversive methods will have to be applied to glean information from suspects, a strategy that will have to be handed with tenderness."

 IBR.5585.d:0 "With further scrutiny on the programs between the Axencia and the military, the absent documents have been discovered. In a string of connected discoveries, much more evidence - albeit circumstantial in nature - has been revealed. All of these coincidences add up to a near-certainty, and the documents, involving payment and financial management, only make the case even worse. Something has to be done.\n\nThe odds are that the case isn't as deep as expected, but in the off chance that it is worse then it needs to be properly examined. To this end, a route of investigation is necessary. Every option needs to be carefully considered, or else any chance at reform will slip out from under us. The general staff responsible could be directly interrogated, but the current political climate of the Iberian leadership would not allow such bold action. With coercion off the table, we could try simple questioning tactics, and use underhanded strategies to slip a confession out of someone."

 IBR.5700.d:0 "Today in Madrid, thousands of farmers have joined in protest on the streets outside of the Iberian Council chambers for a third straight day. The issue that joins these farmers in protest is a recent announcement by Caudillo Franco, detailing government plans to ease and lift tariffs on all economic sectors. The government states that the continual abolishment of tariffs will encourage the international market to engage with Iberia, and will spur international investment into the Iberian economy over the long term. The farmers, however, remain unconvinced.\n\nFurthermore, the farmers are not alone in their protest. Many employees from the manufacturing industries have also turned up to express their displeasure with the removal of tariffs, arguing that the influx of cheaper foreign imported goods will force Iberian industries to make layoffs, and might even entice local industries to emigrate."The Caudillos put my livelihood at risk. My family has for eight generations survived off our humble farm. But now, cheap, imported, tariff-free foods will soon flood the store shelves. How are we to compete when I can hardly sell my produce?" questioned Reyes Gallego. He inherited his family farm just outside of Madrid two decades ago, but like many Iberian farmers in recent months, he has been struggling to make ends meet. With Iberian consumers likely to prefer the cheaper, imported goods in stores, many farmers such as Mr Gallego question how they will remain afloat.\n\nThe Caudillos have yet to make any comment on the protests as liberalization measures continue to be passed. Government spokespersons have, however, stated that the Iberian administration remains enthusiastic about the economic opportunities that will be presented with increased liberalization."

Following radical liberalization policies, favoured by the Opus Dei and technocrats within the Iberian Council, many manufacturers have laid off their workers, citing an inability to compete with the influx of tariff-free foreign goods. As the demonstrations continue to grow in size as well as in intensity, violence has become inevitable. Last night in Barcelona, altercations between protesters and police escalated. Following several hours of clashes, the city of Barcelona reports that 7 police officers were injured as well 58 protestors, with one police officer currently in critical condition.\n\nAs unemployment continues to rise, many call for the repeal of free trade measures and the re-introduction of tariffs. Several industry leaders have criticized the Caudillos for what they call a "brazen, radical, and irresponsible" approach to economic liberalization. The Caudillos, however, show no indication at halting these efforts, as they continue to further the liberalization programs.\n\nAs a result of the continual demonstrations, the Opus Dei have released a brief public statement, which reads: "The public may rest assured that any and all measures of economic liberalization which have been proposed and conducted within recent months have been carefully considered. Many methods currently being deployed within Iberia are tried and proven methods, in which we place our fullest confidence.

 #Falangist Economic Backfire Events

 IBR.5702.t:0 "Cause for Concern?"
 IBR.5702.d:0 "Economic reports from this quarter have begun to arrive, and the trends are concerning. While initially the heavy investment in the armaments industry spurred growth in both the mining and manufacturing sectors, this growth appears to be approaching a plateau. The initial surge in job creation in mining and manufacturing has nearly come to a complete halt, as generous government investment into the armament industry continues to rise.\n\nWhilst Caudillo Franco continues to praise the apparent economic improvement through his Falagnist policy of state control, arms production, and autarky, many analysts have since decried these policies as an economic disaster in the works. Franco fervently opposes the recent concern, however, as government investment in the armament-related sectors continues to rise.\n\nDespite troubling economic indicators, public confidence in the Iberian economy continues to rise, as unemployment continues to slowly drop. Many wonder; is there truly cause for concern?"
 IBR.5702.a:0 "Surely we shall only benefit from this in the end."

 IBR.5703.d:0 "Within recent weeks, the reception of Franco's economic policies has been less than positive. While the Iberian economy saw some initial success with the heavy autarky measures and investment in armament production and supporting industries, fortunes have been reversed. The economy has since taken a swift plunge. With a large production of armaments and no end buyer, industries have been forced to curtail production to avoid the accumulation of unsaleable armament stockpiles. With the curtailed production came layoffs. Thousands of factory employees found themselves without work in a matter of days, as well as thousands of those working in commercial transportation and mining, as the demand for raw material plummeted.\n\nMany of the unemployed have taken to the streets, protesting the economic policies implemented in recent times. Many of these protestors take aim directly at Franco himself, blaming the Caudillo for the fast declining economic situation. With each passing day, the protests grow in size, with the largest of the protests in Madrid reaching a reported peak of 20,000 participants. As production continues to plunge by the day, it is believed that these anti-Franco protests will only increase in size, as more and more Iberians are put out of work."

Many of the signs read phrases such as "End autarky now!" and "Kill the arms industry, not our jobs!". Franco begins to speak, and the roaring and chanting of the crowd steadily dies down, as they await what the Caudillo's address.\n\n"Countrymen, I know what gathers you all here today. Fear. Fear for your future. Fear for your present jobs. Fear of change. I speak to you today to dissuade those fears. As a nation we have made vast progress in every facet of our society. Great progress! Yet, no progress comes without struggle. This is what we see in our economy today. The comings of great progress. Yes, we must face small setbacks, as we do currently. I do regret that many have to bear the brunt of these setbacks. Yet, it is necessary. Do not be afraid, my fellow countrymen, for golden times lie ahead!" as Franco concludes his speech, the crowd once again erupts into anti-Franco slogans and agitated chatter, much to Franco's dismay. Franco quickly exits the podium behind a well armed police escort and swiftly evacuates the scene of the protest.\n\nAs the economy continues to plunge into freefall, factories and supporting industries continue to lay off workers and outright close down. As hundreds of thousands now find themselves without work, many businesses in the commercial sector have now begun to face a steep decline. The hardships aren't limited to the cities, however. Many rural towns relying on local mining industries now find their men without work, as the economic squeeze is felt outside of the cities. Unrest grows as many of those out of work are unable to find new jobs, and find themselves compelled to join in protests against Franco's economic policies."

All members of the assembly, be they economists, journalists, or simply admiring citizens, have gathered for the same reason. To witness Salazar's announcement upon the next round of economic reforms. Salazar stands confident as the congregation vibrates with a tangible approval.\n\n"Ladies, gentlemen." Salazar began. "We have seen some difficult times together. As a nation, we have struggled with disunity, and as well as with our economy. We have hardly been experiencing a golden age. However, I am proud to confidently say that after much effort, our situation truly looks to be improving. That being said, I am not a man to halt at minor improvements. No. I believe I would share the nations approval in saying that we should stop no further than absolute success." With that remak, the crowd erupts into an approving cheer, as the flashes of the cameras endure. As the cheers die down, Salazar goes on at length to detail the next round of imminent economic action.\n\nWith the implementation of Salazar's economic policies now proceeding in full force, Iberia's economy has begun to make decisive improvements. With this comes the benefit of increased public approval for Salazar, as many attribute Salazar to the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities.

 IBR.5706.d:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar could not have hoped for better results from his economic actions. The economy is now thriving. Industries both new and old continue to prosper, and the demand for employees is at a several decade high. As a result, unemployment continues to plummet. The newspapers praise the current economic success as an Iberian economic rebirth. And they all recognize one man, one catalyst for this national boom. Caudillo Salazar. Salazar's fervent and unending struggle to embrace the status quo and undertake responsible and careful economic management was nearly defeated at several turns, yet he did not falter. Not when opposed by the Spanish Caudillo, and not when the skeptics of the Falangists and Opus Dei pushed their agendas of radical reform.\n\nBut even Salazar did not foresee the economic upswing that Iberia now enjoys. While through the loan-fuelled investment growth was confidently predicted, the current figures of economic growth far surpass any projections. As a further benefit, approval ratings of Caudillo Salazar, collected by various newspaper media outlets, show to be as high as seventy percent. Truly, nobody could have anticipated a better outcome."

 #Franco Morocco
 
 IBR.6000.t:0 "Making an Entrance?"
 IBR.6000.d:0 "Morocco, a place of great significance to the proud Spanish Generalissimo, the place where he began his arduous journey to rescue his beloved nation from the grips of communism. Yet, now the land he once had known like the back of his hand, where he had once conducted extensive military exercises with his hardened veterans, has greatly changed. It had been over 20 years since his reconquista of Spain, enough time for the German instability and the new Iberian wedding to leave its toll. Franco considered that a proud showing in Morocco may prove his legitimacy and reign in any unruly colonial officials, but he had also always been a man of simple action, not a bombastic dictator like those two men who had helped him cross the narrow sea. Should he perhaps arrive quietly and get straight to business?"
 IBR.6000.a:0 "Roll out the red carpet."
 IBR.6000.b:0 "Avoid the limelight."
 
 IBR.6001.t:0 "Meeting with Local Leaders"
 IBR.6001.d:0 "Franco's arrival in the north African colony has reinvigorated local Morrocan elites into pushing for further autonomy while maintaining Iberian suzerainty. The argument for this is simple: having a puppet state will allow the Iberians to better galvanize resources from the area, whether that be manpower, labor or natural resource extraction. Yet giving any form of concession to the Africans may be met with ridicule from European neighbours. Italy in particular could see this as a sign of weakness and could then push for a strengthened presence in the Meditterenean. However, the flustered Spanish strongman has to make a decision now, the men before him waiting eagerly for a response. Prestige or a decline in efficiency?"
 IBR.6001.a:0 "North Africans should have more autonomy."
 IBR.6001.b:0 "This land is Iberian."
 
 IBR.6002.t:0 "Meeting with Settlers"
 IBR.6002.d:0 "The Iberian settlers in Morocco have met with Franco today in Ceuta, and after Franco delivered a heartwarming and praiseworthy speech, the settlers unceremoniously bombarded our great Caudillo with their grievances and troubles. Over the course of several hours, it became clear that the settlers were agitating for more subsidies from the Iberian government to lessen the burden on them. They agonised, in painstaking detail, the hardships the face in trying to settle the arid deserts of Morocco, from worthless and parched soil in the hinterlands to lack of any honest work in the cities. While it will place further strain on the Iberian economy, it may be advisable to promise them more financial support, even if it is just to keep them quiet and loyal. Either that, or some token and inconsequential gestures to appease them for the remainder of Franco's visit are in order."
 IBR.6002.a:0 "Promise to increase funding."
 IBR.6002.b:0 "Give token concessions."

 
 #Salazar Military
 
 IBR.6003.t:0 "What to Wear?"
 IBR.6003.d:0 "The old man's face reflected not just the weakening capacity of his tired and overworked body but also his inner fears. As he stared deeply into the mirror, looking for small imperfections just like with his paperwork, he began to brush away a small crease that he must have forgotten to iron out of the military uniform he was wearing. The uniform of the Iberian army. How could he defeat his greatest fear, militarism as personified by his Spanish counterpart, if not by at least trying to shape into something less threatening if not possibly useful? However it spoke against his entire nature and persona he had so carefully crafted over the years. After all was he not the moderate to Franco's delusional grandeur? The question now is should he try to become more of an iron fisted dictator, at least for show, or stick with his usual statesman appearance?"
 IBR.6003.a:0 "A uniform will impress them."
 IBR.6003.b:0 "Stick with the suit."
 
 IBR.6004.t:0 "Several Generals Visibly Offended"
 IBR.6004.d:0 "The grand entrance of Salazar's new persona was about to begin. An important meeting with several key generals of the Iberian armed forces concerning new doctrines and logistics was the perfect place to practice asserting the characteristics of the man he had emulated. As the grand oak doors were opened to the stiff yet resolute Portuguese Caudillo all heads turned to inspect the new entrant. The accompanying soft murmur began to eat at the now very uncomfortable aging statesman as he began to make his way slowly to his seat. A quick scrutiny of the bitter looking faces of the men he was about to address told Salazar all he needed to know about how his gambit had transpired. None would speak out against him openly but his image had now been tarnished considerably."
 IBR.6004.a:0 "Damn it."
 
 IBR.6005.t:0 "The Speech Begins"
 IBR.6005.d:0 "If there was one thing Salazar could always fall back upon it was his eloquence and strength at public speaking. For all his animosity towards Adolf Hitler he still admired his ability to mesmerize and work an audience. The seasoned Caudillo walked slowly towards the podium, all eyes in the room again on him, with the only sound heard coming courtesy of the din of the living city outside the steadfast walls of the palace. As he stepped up to the wooden rostrum he looked down briefly at the collection of notes he held in his hands. He was surprised to see them shake slightly. Age was beginning to get the worse of him. He quickly recovered again, placing both arms first across his chest while surveying the assembled men and then onto the podium itself. He had gained their fixation, and it was time to begin."
 IBR.6005.a:0 "Begin with a promise of further resources."
 IBR.6005.b:0 "Start off with vague platitudes."
 
 IBR.6006.t:0 "On the Issue of Minority Groups"
 IBR.6006.d:0 "The next topic was an uncomfortable one for him to address considering the room he was in. No matter how this would be played he would likely lose. He sighed to himself briefly, then began his tirade against the terrible terrorism that has swept the Union. How these so called freedom fighters dared to undermine the much needed stability of the Iberia, not caring in the slightest about the consequences on real people living their ordinary lives. Clearly these dastardly scum had to be expunged from the nation like the parasites they were. Yet how was this to be done effectively when most of them came from minority groups which currently still enjoyed the protection of the Union? The question of how to approach the next part of his speech was not an easy one for the old man. Should he push for a harsher policy towards minorities in order to safeguard national security, or take a more moderate approach, in the process likely losing a hefty amount of political power to his more hardline Spanish counterpart?"
 IBR.6006.a:0 "They are terrorist sympathizers. A hard line is needed."
 IBR.6006.b:0 "The terrorists do not represent these people."
 
 IBR.6007.t:0 "Transcripts from High Command Meeting Leak"
 IBR.6007.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar had to experience the repurcussions of the largest political flounder he had ever commited following his address on the importance of minority groups in regards to quelling terrorism. Seemingly someone in the high command had committed absolute treachery by leaking his radical views on how to tackle the issue to the public. The poor display had managed to make its way around the country at a terrifying pace despite the best efforts of state censors. Considering the vast majority of the Iberia supported a tough stance on national security due to recent developments in global political affairs he possibly could still spin this to reduce damage to some extent. Yet the views of those minority groups he had talked so poorly of could now not be changed anymore, he had betrayed them for which his political career would bleed heavily."
 IBR.6007.a:0 "A blow to Salazar's popularity among minorities."

 
 #Salazar Church
 
 IBR.6008.t:0 "Salazar Enters Sanctuary of Fatima"
 IBR.6008.d:0 "It was a crisp, clear morning in the Portuguese municipality of Ourém. The white marble running all around the Sanctuary of Fatima reflected the morning sun's brilliance, bathing the plaza in warmth and light. As usual, Salazar's modest motorcade arrived early, and the Caudillo of Portugal found himself with time to burn before his appointment with the Portuguese bishops. Waving off his bodyguards to permit them a cigarette break, Salazar squinted up at the gold-plated cross atop the spire of the central cathedral as he pondered how to go about his discussion with the bishops. It had been some time since he had dealt with the clergy directly, despite their major role in the Estado Novo. Would they be simple, honest men like the ordinary priests he had known growing up, or illustrious and regal figures representative of the Church's wealth and power? What approach would best speak to them, and win them over?"
 IBR.6008.a:0 "Salazar talks about how he once considered becoming a priest."
 IBR.6008.b:0 "Focus on the issues."
 
 IBR.6009.t:0 "Muted Reactions to Personal Anecdotes"
 IBR.6009.d:0 "If Salazar was hoping to find some kind of personal connection in his story of how he ultimately DIDN'T become a priest, he was sorely mistaken. Clearly the bishops had no interest in hearing excerpts from his biography when there were serious matters to take care of. Gritting his teeth and kicking himself mentally by the end of the meeting, Salazar was several shades redder and looked a few years older as he marched back to the limousine afterwards, having gotten nothing out of the discussion besides an embarrassing anecdote about himself."
 IBR.6009.a:0 "Perhaps they were expecting a more substantive conversation."
 
 IBR.6010.t:0 "Bishops Warm Up to Salazar"
 IBR.6010.d:0 ""I had no idea, Senhor Salazar." Bishop Anselmo had said, clearly impressed. "To be so personally invested in the church at such a young age was rare even amongst my own generation. Though you were surely called by God to your vocation, I feel the Church is diminished simply by its inability to count you amongst its servants." If that wasn't the sound of successfully charming his way into the confidence of some of the most influential men in Iberia, Salazar didn't know what was. Despite his age, the chauffeur noticed a confident energy in the Caudillo as he took his seat in the back of the limousine and opened up some light reading.\n\nThe bishops, too, parted ways with Salazar feeling decidedly more relaxed about dealing with the Caudillos in future. Franco had been so... coarse, despite his faith and good intentions. Their own quiet, charismatic countryman was far more agreeable and clearly a reliable brother in Christ. A cordial smile, it seemed, answered far more of their questions than a stack of government pamphlets."
 IBR.6010.a:0 "Salazar has clearly gained trust from the church."
 
 IBR.6011.t:0 "Attempt to Bring up Issues Fails"
 IBR.6011.d:0 "Even Salazar felt himself sweating a little under the collar as the bishops stared at him, stone-faced and dull-eyed. He couldn't tell whether they were annoyed or just plain bored. Whatever the answer, there was little in the way of mutual exchange, with the increasingly weary Caudillo mostly just talking "at" them rather than "with" them. The longest response to any of his statements had been "Yes, Senhor Salazar."\n\nAfter the meeting, as he stood out in the hot sun dabbing at his creased forehead, Salazar found himself grousing out loud to his bodyguards about how obtuse and unhelpful he found these meetings with the clergy. "I'd never get stonewalled by old Father Pedro!" he exclaimed."
 IBR.6011.a:0 "Perhaps they think some bounds have been overstepped."
 
 IBR.6012.t:0 "Bishops Agree With Several of Salazar's Opinions"
 IBR.6012.d:0 ""Which is, of course, why regional particularism is such an issue for us. Regardless of how the people feel about their own nations, we cannot risk a breakdown of the state, as happened to Spain during their civil war."\n\n"Of course, Senhor Salazar," replied Bishop Manuel. He turned to his colleagues. "We are in agreement then, brothers? No support for our regionalist friends?" He was met by a round of nodding.\n\nSalazar smiled broadly, his shoulders finally relaxing. "Then I believe that's everything for today, your eminences. If you'll excuse me, I am due to return to Madrid within the next few hours and must keep to schedule. My secretary here will answer any further questions you may have," he said, gesturing to the cheery-looking, dapper young man beside him. "Until next time, my friends."\n\nScore one for statecraft. Get the right words out there, and men of the cloth are as pliable and easy to understand as any man in the street. Salazar could report back to Franco that their mutual understanding with the clergy remained as healthy as ever, and they would not have to worry about opposition from them anytime soon. Some consolation in a time of troubles, at least."
 IBR.6012.a:0 "A productive conversation, indeed."

 
 #Franco Business
 
 IBR.6013.t:0 "Choosing a Stage"
 IBR.6013.d:0 "In order to better address the economic situation in Iberia, the Caudillos have opted to host a discussion for business leaders in order to encourage cooperation with the government. Because of his talent for speech, and the predominantly Spanish makeup of the business leaders, Franco was the obvious choice for the job. Hosted at the Westin Palace hotel in Madrid, the function was primarily for business leaders, and brought to their attention specifically. Even though they are the main target, it is not yet too late to hold the speech in a public area.\n\nThere are two locations that are most easily secured for a summit, the main stage of Westin Palace or in a private undisclosed location. Hosting the speech somewhere more private will be an easier job to secure, as well as allowing for only the businessmen to be present. That way, they can be better catered to. The only threat there is of leaks. Alternatively, the speech could be made public, for a larger crowd. This will eliminate any risk of someone compromising secure conversations, and will prevent any unpleasant accusations about the loyalty of the Caudillo. It will cost more to secure the public location, and the speech will have to be broad in tone. Otherwise, some groups could be lost by catering to others. The obvious choice is to..."
 IBR.6013.a:0 "Hold a speech on the main stage"
 IBR.6013.b:0 "Hold a speech behind closed doors"
 
 IBR.6014.t:0 "Choosing a Posture for the Speech"
 IBR.6014.d:0 "A location has been selected, announced, and set in stone. Franco would be speaking to a large audience, and marketing his ideas to the public, and not just businessmen. This is no time to forget who this is dedicated to, however- just because the speech is more public doesn't mean it isn't for businessmen first and foremost. To this end a new strategy must be devised. No speech is complete without posturing, and can be ruined with the improper application of it. It needs to be decided how the Caudillo will present his ideas to his audience, as to best ensure retention among the businessmen.\n\nThe first, and most obvious, tone is to take that of someone in favor of a free market. It is sure to win over many business owners, as the promise of an environment suited to them is one tantalizing enough that they are sure to be lured in. While this may anger some elements of the government, these can be mostly mitigated by taking a more conservative position on businesses. Alternatively, it has been proposed to take a tough stance on corporations, asserting authority over them. If there is anything they will respect, it is a leader that is willing to take executive authority. What form will the Caudillo's tone take?"
 IBR.6014.a:0 "A free market posture"
 IBR.6014.b:0 "A business friendly, but conservative posture"
 IBR.6014.c:0 "A strong, authoritarian posture"
 
 IBR.6015.t:0 "Making promises?"
 IBR.6015.d:0 "More easily guarded, a private setting was the obvious choice to hold a speech at. Only the higher echelons of businessmen will be actively attending, amounting to a small group. This will make the situation much less formal, allowing for a few targeted incentives to be made. With the public not watching, making assurances becomes far easier, and much less risky.\n\nOnly, it is a conscious choice to make these assurances. If one were to promise to the business leaders that the Iberian economy would get just a touch more free, it could go a long way towards getting their attention. These reforms will nearly ensure their support, if the trouble is taken to address them. However, making what is essentially a bribe for political capital is frowned upon. If it were to be found publically, then it would create new issues. Therefore, the speech could be made vague and simply assuring the targets prosperity and growth. This will not make any particular friends, but on the other hand it would mean the speech would be mostly bulletproof politically. Is the risk worth the potential gain?"
 IBR.6015.a:0 "Promise to push for free market reforms"
 IBR.6015.b:0 "Make no promises"
 
 IBR.6016.t:0 "An Offer is Made"
 IBR.6016.d:0 "The speech had concluded exceptionally well. It was positively received, the oral delivery was spot-on, and the audience seemed convinced. The summit itself seemed to be winding down, and as it prepared to end and everyone to go home, something of interest occurred. A group of highly influential businessmen, introducing themselves by rank, have shuffled their way into Franco's notice. Introducing it by scraps and pieces, they construct an offer for the Caudillo.\n\nCorporate profits are fair, but they are not as fair as they could be. The Iberian government has the means to fix this error, and they may do so very easily. All it would take is recognition of the superiority of the companies in question. Since they are more powerful than the rest, then they ought to be better appreciated for what they do to the country. As it would happen, some of the resources Iberia would save by helping them could be used as reciprocation. It is an easy decision, they say. All that support, for just a little bit of favor..."
 IBR.6016.a:0 "Accept the offer"
 IBR.6016.b:0 "Decline the offer"
 
 IBR.6017.t:0 "Franco's Corruption Exposed"
 IBR.6017.d:0 "Apparently, the deal was not as private as expected. Someone present at the meeting between the Caudillo and the council of businessmen took a recording, and has only leaked it a few days later. Anonymously shared, it is hard to tell if the guilty party was a traitorous guard or a man hiding a recorder in his suitcase. Who did it matters little now, as they cannot be readily found.\n\nWhen it was leaked, it was especially directed towards the press. Being the predatory vultures they are, they took the bait and published it sky-high. Now the information cannot be stopped, so the whole country is scrutinizing Franco for his seeming corruption. Most crucially are the intelligentsia, who feel betrayed that a leader would resort to such hypocritical means for little of actual value. The bureaucrats feel the same way as well, drifting more towards Salazar - who is seen as a far more upstanding example of a politician."

 #Salazar Intellectuals (Book)
 
 IBR.6018.t:0 "The Genre"
 IBR.6018.d:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar has recently finished writing his first book after over thirty years of political experience, first at the head of the Estado Novo regime, and now as one of the Caudillos of Iberia. During this time he has surmounted many challenges, both political and personal in nature, and he has drawn on this wealth of experience in creating this masterpiece of Iberian Literature. Painstakingly dictated to his secretary over the course of several months, the first draft is ready to be composed. Salazar however has yet to decide what to keep and what to cut from this unwieldy transcript, ever so diligently copied out and perfected by his assistants.\n\nTwo directions to take the book in have been suggested to him by his close associates, that of a manifesto of his own political beliefs, or an autobiography of his personal struggles during his life. Salazar himself has expressed that a political statement to guide the Iberian people would be an apt legacy for him to leave behind, but the idea of an inspiring personal epic appeals to him greatly as well. With the Caudillo remaining indecisive, and papers continuing to pile up on his desk, it may be pragmatic to convince him to make a final decision. What should it be?"
 IBR.6018.a:0 "A manifesto of Salazar's political philosophy."
 IBR.6018.b:0 "An autobiography detailing Salazar's personal struggles."
 
 IBR.6019.t:0 "The Content"
 IBR.6019.d:0 "With the genre of the Caudillo's new book having been decided upon, Salazar's secretary and his assistants have religiously prepared suitable extracts from the initial transcript over the course of a few weeks, every extract having been chosen for its particularly inspiring and powerful advice, vivid descriptions of Salazar's experiences or Salazar's enlightened political philosophy. Salazar has so far been delighted with the choices presented to him by his assistants, but has yet to decide on specifically what he wants in the book, whether it is to be a personal and heartfelt book, aimed at imparting Salazar's enthusiasm and advice to the reader in order to rouse the Iberian people to greater things, or to be a ceremonious and authoritative text containing Salazar's prescriptions for society, aimed at safeguarding the Iberian state, guiding the politicans of tomorrow and preserving the legacy he has painstakingly worked to build during his time in office.\n\nEither way, the Caudillo doesn't seem to be rushing to make a decision, and the book has taken up enough official time as is. Salazar should be encouraged to choose the passages he wants to include in his masterpiece post-haste, as not only do state papers lie on Salazar's desk unread, and urgent bureaucratic work left untouched, but the second Caudillo Francisco Franco himself is becoming concerned with Salazar's apparent idleness. A decision must be made."
 IBR.6019.a:0 "Inspirational and powerful advice to the reader."
 IBR.6019.b:0 "Salazar's prescriptions for society."
 
 IBR.6020.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 IBR.6020.d:0 "Now that the Caudillo has decided on the specific contents of his book, he has one final decision to make before this paragon of Iberian literature can be sent to the printing presses. A conclusion has yet to be written, and Salazar is torn between concluding that it will be the educated elite that will guide Iberia towards a bright and proud future, or that it will be the common Iberian toiling away that will bring about a golden age for the Iberian people.\n\nWhile favouring the intelligentsia would most likely cement Salazar's book as his magnum opus and possibly increase the loyalty of the intellectuals to the Caudillo, concluding that the common people will determine the future of Iberia could help to foster wider support for the regime, as well as cynically generating a larger profit for the publisher and himself to pocket. Salazar however is more concerned with its popular reception than what a few jumped up toffs think, and while it will be a difficult and lengthy series of arguments needed to convince him of the political benefits of dedicating it to Iberian intellectuals, it may be expedient to make him see this point of view. Alternatively, letting Salazar have his way is surely the quicker route to publication, and more importantly, back to work for Salazar. What should he be convinced to conclude the book with?"
 IBR.6020.a:0 "A declaration that the educated will guide Iberia towards a great future."
 IBR.6020.b:0 "A declaration that the common Iberian will lead the way towards a great future."
 
 IBR.6021.t:0 "Intellectuals Impressed by Salazar's Manifesto"
 IBR.6021.d:0 "Salazar's political manifesto has been met with great acclaim within the intellectual community since being published, as the wise ruler expected it would be. His work received not only favourable reviews from Iberian literary groups and authors, but also internationally his book has also been received well, especially in neighbouring Italy, and to a lesser extent in America, with most copies having been bought by a minority of NPP members. The only frankly minor criticism voiced by the intellectuals is that it might be a little too high brow for the masses, but that doesn't seem to bother Salazar, who appears to be content with the other praise he has received.\n\nUniversally, his theories and guidance have been praised as comprehensive and well thought out, with the rhetoric and ideological dogma usually found in political literature to be mostly absent. Iberian scholars agree that it has a clear vision for society under Salazarian ideals, and some have even written to the Caudillo to express their support for the society envisaged in his book, an occurrence that greatly pleased him. There has yet to be a particularly critical or scathing review of Salazar's work, most likely because the ideas and content are simply indisputable of course, not that there are any other reasons for no one speaking up. Overall, Salazar is incredibly pleased with himself and the book he has worked tirelessly to create, and now he can finally focus on official work once more."
 IBR.6021.a:0 "Recognition from the Iberian intelligentsia is highly appreciated."
 
 IBR.6022.t:0 "Salazar's Book Gets Lackluster Response"
 IBR.6022.d:0 "Much to the dismay of Salazar, his book has been a complete flop both domestically and internationally! No intellectual of significance anywhere, let alone in Iberia has commented positively of his work, with it most commonly being described as "confused, unfocused literary mess" by the Iberian intelligentsia. Not only have intellectuals described the book as a muddled and tangled web of political ideas and personal experiences, but they have also said the ideas included are vague and difficult to digest and the experiences are particularly tedious affairs, and at some points painfully boring to read through according to one particularly scathing reviewer. The common Iberian has also found the book hard to engage, citing many similar criticisms that the intellectuals have expressed, though quite often in much coarser words. Francisco Franco of course has endorsed his fellow ruler's work, though it seems more out of professional courtesy than for its own merit.\n\nPoor sales and a bad reception make it unlikely for the publisher to agree to a second production run of the book, and Salazar is reportedly distraught to see the sale price of his work in shop windows be struck down lower and lower as the proprietors try to make at least some return on their purchased stock. For now it seems, Salazar's career as an author has come to an abrupt end, and the Caudillo has been left greatly disheartened and bitter by the whole affair."
 IBR.6022.a:0 "Perhaps it could have done with a clearer message."

 IBR.6023.t:0 "Salazar's Autobiography Takes Iberia by Storm"
 IBR.6023.d:0 "Only a week after being officially published, Salazar's new book has sold out. Demand for his inspirational personal epic has far outstripped supply, and a second production run is already being organised to cover the shortfall in copies. Reportedly, the personal perspective of the book and its inspiring life advice has found a receptive audience within the lower and middle class, and a newfound respect and sympathy for the premier has been fostered.\n\nNot only has the Caudillo's office been inundated with letters of praise from across Iberia, a whole series of spontaneous patriotic celebrations have broken out in Portugal. Street parties complete with overhead banners and fireworks have clogged Lisbon's streets for several days now, having quickly assembled after the last copy sold out in the city. The same phenomenon was repeated across several of the larger towns, and while some have suggested that this was not entirely natural, Salazar has dismissed these hearsay accusations and is content to bask in the popular acclaim being afforded to him.\n\nFellow Caudillo Franco also has apologized in private to Salazar over his misgivings about his publication, after acknowledging the increase in popular support for Salazar. The success of his work has far surpassed Salazar's own private expectations, and what he initially self-proclaimed as a masterpiece is now undoubtedly regarded as a cornerstone of Iberian literature by popular decree."

 IBR.6024.t:0 "The Ministry of National Education"
 IBR.6024.d:0 "In a drive to stabilize Iberian internal divisions, and sow that the current administration is not politically inert, it has been announced that Caudillo Franco will tour various government ministries in order to gain an insight into their workings and current conditions. Some have already labelled this as a pointless and insulting PR move; something to put in the daily tabloids to distract from other more pressing news. Official statements, however, hail the proposed events as a turning point in Iberia's current political and economic fortunes, dismissing the criticism as pointless fearmongering.\n\nThe elderly dictator's first visit would be to the education ministry. In the run up to the day lobbyists have been arguing for more funding to increase Iberian standards of education both in order to help the national economy while providing better employment opportunities and to help the Union better compete on the global stage. Whether Franco will heed their advice, make only slight reforms in order to balance the national budget or just ignore them entirely will be seen on the day."

Land reform and the future of farming are always hot topics during election cycles, especially in more rural Iberian settings, which resulted in the upcoming meeting tripling newspaper and analysis sales.\n\nAmongst the concerns that the Spanish Caudillo may not be entirely suited to discussing such matters of state, were some more particularly scathing attacks published by left wing organizations who see the strong man as a growing tumour wasting away Iberia's societal and economic wealth. The decisions made at the meeting however could signal a new direction for rural prosperity which had long been lagging behind urban development. It is not clear yet what will be decided."

Road expansion and public works in general are always a good way of improving the national economy and provide jobs for the people, but their downside is, as the name implies, that they need state money to actually happen.\n\nHowever, due to the promises made to the previous ministries, it seems like the Caudillo will only have bad news for the minister, as there is now not only not enough money for the Development Ministry, but that some cuts will have to be made if the minister hopes to keep the department running. The meeting looks like it will be a very short one, with Franco delivering the bad news and getting out as soon as possible."

But even that could mean going over the budget, so another possibility, and the one that scares the minister the most; is Franco going to the meeting just to inform that no changes will be made to the department to save money."
