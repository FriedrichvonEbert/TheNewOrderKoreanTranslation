 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_MARIAN_SPYCHALSKI_DESC:0 "젊은 시절에 건축가로 일했던 마리안 스피칼스키는 폴란드 노동자들의 해방을 위해 일생을 바쳤습니다. 폴란드 공산당의 일원으로서, 그는 나치 점령 첫 날부터 폴란드 지하국가 설립을 위해 노력했고, 인민군단이라는 파르티잔 조직을 설립했습니다. 그는 소련 형제들과 우호적인 관계를 맺기 위해 서러시아 전선이 나치의 동쪽 국경에서 전쟁을 벌였을 때 붉은 군대를 받아들였고, 폴란드인들과 러시아인들이 함께 유럽의 억압받는 국가들을 파시스트의 멍에로부터 해방시키기를 희망했습니다.\n\n그러나, 지휘관들 사이의 내분으로 인해 그의 뜻은 이루어지지 못했고, 스피칼스키는 그의 동지들과 함께 서카자흐스탄으로 피신해 폴란드 사회주의 자치 공화국을 설립하였고, 황폐한 러시아 땅에서 적을 피해 달아난 소련 폴란드인들과 나치 침략자들에 의해 그들의 고향에서 추방된 폴란드인들의 피난처가 되었습니다. 파르티잔 지도자로서의 그의 명성 덕에, 스피칼스키는 급속히 개혁된 폴란드 군대의 저명인사 중 한 명이 되었습니다. 폴란드 노동당이 이끄는 정부가 자치공화국의 긴급한 문제를 다루기에는 너무 독단적이고 근시안적이라고 믿었던 폴란드 장군들을 대표하여, 그는 당 지도부를 상대로 무혈 쿠데타를 조직하여 노바 폴스카 구원 위원회의 회장으로 부상했습니다.\n\n위기의 시간 동안 군사 독재자로 군림하면서, 그는 새로운 폴란드의 국체를 보존하고 권력에 굶주린 카자흐 군벌들로부터 국가를 보호하겠다고 공언했습니다. 비록 그는 여전히 사회주의적 명분과 소비에트 연방에 충성을 맹세하고 있지만, 전통적인 적들 사이에서 불편한 동맹을 모색하고 실용적인 결정을 위해 혁명 전통을 버리는 것을 주저하지 않을 것입니다 - 용서할 수 없는 전쟁으로 얼룩진 중앙아시아의 땅에서 새로운 폴란드 조국이 살아남기 위해서는 무엇이든지 할 것입니다."

 DON_Spychalski_Bizarre_Dictatorship_idea:0 "Marian Spychalski's Bizarre Dictatorship"
 DON_Spychalski_Bizarre_Dictatorship_idea_desc:0 "The "Rada Ocalenia Nowej Polski" (RONP) assumed power through a bloodless coup against the ineffective civilian government led by the Polish Workers' Party. The new military dictatorship consists of officers that fought alongside the Soviet Union in either the 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division or leftist resistance movements such as the People's Guard or the People's Army. Its political ideology defies categorization - Marian Spychalski declares "full allegiance to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the Soviet Union and socialism as a whole", all while making tactical alliances with the clergy, subverting the Polish Workers' Party, and liberalizing society as a whole. This has been viewed as a betrayal of the principles of socialism by some, and has thus lead to staunch critique by ideological purists of the Polish Workers' Party. In the end, the RONP exists solely to ensure the survival of the endangered Polish nation - everything else comes second."

 DON.5.t:0 "Not Yet Lost"
 DON.5.desc:0 "By decree of the RONP, today is the day our people celebrate their independence from three empires of old. The choice remains controversial among the cadres of the Polish Workers' Party, due to their leadership's vehement insistence that the Second Republic was a failure - an authoritarian, capitalist aberration - soon to be crushed under the tank treads of the German.\n\nDespite every effort on the part of the Polish Workers' Party, Nowa Polska never quite was a bastion of pure communism. For many figures, such as Spychalski, the communist legacy of Nowa Polska no longer holds much meaning. This view is shared by the vast majority of our people, who braved hell and high water, travelling thousands of kilometers from the former lands of the Second Republic and the Soviet Union, merely for a chance to live. To speak their tongue. To practice their faith.\n\nAs such, despite a few naysayers, the return to the celebration of the 11th of November as Independence Day has been largely viewed as a natural correction. While few among us saw those momentous events decades ago, now is the time to remember. To remember that back then, in 1918, through the sacrifice of many, Poland was born yet again, like a phoenix. Many things could be said about the Second Republic, but one was absolutely certain."
