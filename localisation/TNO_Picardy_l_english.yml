 POLITICS_Christian_de_La_Maziere_DESC:0 "In the center of what was once France, the Charlemagne Division struggles to re-assert their control- but there is no doubt who they'll back when they regain their footing.\n\nChristian de la Maziere is an odd bird, one of the few men in Burgundy who pledges themselves to the Reichsführer more out of a personal loyalty than a belief or obligation. Once a soldier in the French Army, Maziere has spent the last two decades working his way up the ranks of the Charlemagne Division, the predominant French collaborator division in the Waffen-SS. It was here where he first met Heinrich Himmler, and a loyalty to a man that most found disturbing at best formed as he moved higher and higher, becoming Commander of the division just as the Ordenstaat was founded. For years now, he has worked side by side in pursuit of the Spartanist ideal, even as worries rose about Himmler's disgust for the French culture that Maziere loved.\n\nBefore he could truly reflect on those worries, however, everything changed. The Führer died, eventually replaced by Heydrich- a best case scenario, and Maziere celebrated as such. For a brief moment in time, all seemed like it would work out after all- that is, until the new Führer suddenly broke from what the SS believed, denouncing Himmler with ridiculous accusations of apocalyptic dreams, and everything changed again- not for the better.\n\nCharlemagne was caught off guard by the sudden flip, and it shows. Maziere watches as his men scramble to re-assert their control over cities they hadn't bothered to pay attention to for a year. Though the initial situation seems dire, he has no fear- he knows that the right side will win in the end, and the Spartanist dream will be back on track. With no question of where his loyalty lies, it's a matter of when, not if, his forces will rejoin Himmler's and march off to war."

 PIC_in_name_only:0 "In Name Only"
 PIC_in_name_only_desc:0 "Maziere's men bear the name of Charlemagne, but they are perceived by most Frenchmen as mere German bootlickers. He might see himself as the founder of a new France, but Maziere has a long way to go before his countrymen even consider showing respect."
 
 PIC_robber_barony:0 "The Robber Barony"
 PIC_robber_barony_desc:0 "The leaders of Charlemagne are wealthy men, but not due to any business acumen or hard-earned rewards. Their riches are almost uniformly stolen from others. Though they once restricted themselves to expropriated Jewish property, the officers are not above less patriotic ventures..."
