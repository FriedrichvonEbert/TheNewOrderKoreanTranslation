 POLITICS_Christian_de_La_Maziere_DESC:0 "In the center of what was once France, the Charlemagne Division struggles to re-assert their control- but there is no doubt who they'll back when they regain their footing.\n\nChristian de la Maziere is an odd bird, one of the few men in Burgundy who pledges themselves to the Reichsführer more out of a personal loyalty than a belief or obligation. Once a soldier in the French Army, Maziere has spent the last two decades working his way up the ranks of the Charlemagne Division, the predominant French collaborator division in the Waffen-SS. It was here where he first met Heinrich Himmler, and a loyalty to a man that most found disturbing at best formed as he moved higher and higher, becoming Commander of the division just as the Ordensstaat was founded. For years now, he has worked side by side in pursuit of the Spartanist ideal, even as worries rose about Himmler's disgust for the French culture that Maziere loved.\n\nBefore he could truly reflect on those worries, however, everything changed. The Führer died, eventually replaced by Heydrich- a best case scenario, and Maziere celebrated as such. For a brief moment in time, all seemed like it would work out after all- that is, until the new Führer suddenly broke from what the SS believed, denouncing Himmler with ridiculous accusations of apocalyptic dreams, and everything changed again- not for the better.\n\nCharlemagne was caught off guard by the sudden flip, and it shows. Maziere watches as his men scramble to re-assert their control over cities they hadn't bothered to pay attention to for a year. Though the initial situation seems dire, he has no fear- he knows that the right side will win in the end, and the Spartanist dream will be back on track. With no question of where his loyalty lies, it's a matter of when, not if, his forces will rejoin Himmler's and march off to war."

 PIC_in_name_only:0 "이름뿐인 국가"
 PIC_in_name_only_desc:0 "마지에르의 부하들은 샤를마뉴라는 이름을 가지고 있지만 대부분의 프랑스인들은 이들을 단순한 독일의 아첨꾼으로 인식하고 있습니다. 마지에르는 자신을 신 프랑스국의 건국자로 생각하고 있지만, 그에게 동포들이 존경심을 표하기까지는 갈 길이 멉니다."
 
 PIC_robber_barony:0 "날강도같은 남작"
 PIC_robber_barony_desc:0 "샤를마뉴의 지도자들은 부유한데 사업적 통찰력이나 힘든 노력으로 받은 보상이 아닙니다. 그들의 부는 거의 똑같이 다른 사람들에게서 뺏아 축적했습니다. 한때는 유대인의 재산만을 압류했지만, 장교들은 애국적인 모험에 뒤쳐지지 않습니다..."
