 #Ideas
 WOL_idea_wolofian_stiffness: "볼로피아의 강성함"
 WOL_idea_wolofian_stiffness_desc: "Wolofia is one of the oldest stable regimes in West Africa, but this stability is built on shaky foundations. The government must be careful to balance the pan-African Négritude ideology popular among the Senghor people, and the interests of the Wolof majority who want to retain their privileged position. What could have been the Republic of Senegal is still a long way from a truly equal democracy."
 WOL_idea_haven_africa: "아프리카의 천국"
 WOL_idea_haven_africa_desc: "Democracy is a rarity in Africa, but even more rare than that is functioning democracy. The latter can only be found in Wolofia. The nation has avoided bitter political fights, military coups, invasions invasion, and the worst of the bombings. Wolofia has become a haven from violence and oppression to people all across Africa, and the country has become a hotbed of political thought and expression that would not be tolerated elsewhere in the continent."
 
 POLITICS_LEOPOLD_SEDAR_SENGHOR_DESC: "16 years of wandering. That's how long it took for Léopold Sédar Senghor, the first President of the Republic of Wolofia, to arrive at a place he can call home. A poet and an intellectual well versed in French, Senghor was one of the few black subjects of colonial France privileged enough to study at the Sorbonne University, and become a professor in French grammar after graduation. Despite being an outspoken critic of racism present in French society, he enrolled in the French Army and fought against the Nazis believing in a future that would treat all men like equals. Sadly, this did not come to pass. Captured by the Germans, he and his fellow soldiers narrowly avoided execution and escaped their prison camps by being released for medical reasons.\n\nWhen the war was over and it was clear that there was no more hope for liberation in Europe, Senghor returned to West Africa to take control back from the inept Petainiste colonial administration. The new Republic of Wolofia was a country founded on the principles of African liberation and "negritude", an anti-colonialist concept developed in part by Senghor himself which bases itself in the idea of a strong African national culture. At the same time, President Senghor still maintains strong ties to the old French republic, keeping close contacts with De Gaulle and letting some French administrators be part of his government.\n\nThis ambiguity did not elude his critics, who were quick to point out the dissonance between his calls for African liberation and his loyalty to the old oppressors. After all, a tiger doesn't proclaim its tigerness; it jumps on its prey. The black man doesn't need permission from some now irrelevant whites to govern, he simply has to take what's his by right. With the lack of any strong opposition to Senghor in the government, Wolofia became a politically stagnant nation and pan-African revolutionaries want to remove him and his French lackeys to create a state modeled after Cameroon. But now that he found his home, Senghor is not in the mood to wander anymore. He will turn Wolofia into a shining example for all Africans, and some sacrifices are in order."
