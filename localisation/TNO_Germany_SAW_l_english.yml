 GER_Bormann_SAF_arsenal_of_afrika_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika, located primarily within the geographic boundaries of the former-Belgian Congo, is notably a considerable distance from the conflict's frontline and largely outside the range of any enemy airfields & bombers, thereby making the Reichskommissariat and region difficult to directly strike.

 GER_Bormann_SAF_restore_luftwaffe_divisions_desc:0 "The Bürgerkrieg left the Luftwaffe bloated and many airmen are grounded, with little reason to maintain operations in Europe. Restoring the field divisions would provide valuable support for our Reichskommissar allies and give a chance to cut the chaff. These men are of questionable loyalty given their proximity to Göring, and little will be lost if they don't come back."

 GER_Bormann_SAF_train_the_werewolves_desc:0 "Unternehmen Werwulf was a plan from the less certain stages of the war, for the unthinkable event of the Reich falling and an Allied government being imposed. Recruits would be trained in guerilla warfare, supplied with silenced weaponry, explosives and vehicles, with the aim of making Germany ungovernable and aid the rise of the rightful government once more. This event naturally never came to fruition, but the Werwulf plans may yet be useful. Training Hüttig's soldiers in these tactics will provide a valuable edge."

 GER_Bormann_SAF_festung_johannesburg:0 "§OFestung Johannesburg§!"
 GER_Bormann_SAF_festung_johannesburg_desc:0 "Johannesburg has been a bastion of Aryan settlement on the Dark Continent for nearly two hundred years. The discovery of gold brought a flood of Boer settlers that rapidly turned it into South Africa's largest cities - now it is the capital of the Boer Republic. Our Afrikaner allies must not be allowed to falter in the defense of their homeland. We must send our engineers to turn the city into a fortress, one that will not fall to the Americans like it did to the British."
